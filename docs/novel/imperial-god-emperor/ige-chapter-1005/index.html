 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu didn't expect that it was these people who came.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How do these people know where the [Dragon Palace] was?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Accidental?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Or...?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For a moment, dozens of thoughts flashed through his mind, but he did not act rashly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing quietly and motionlessly in front of the Immortal Palace, Ye Qingyu looked over with a calm expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The figure opposite landed, and of course, had already noticed the presence of Ye Qingyu, slowly moving closer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, boy you run very fast, but we still caught up to you.” The Young Lord of the Sinful Pit fixed his eyes on Ye Qingyu, slightly narrowing and chewing a straw in his mouth. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon hearing this, Ye Qingyu immediately realized that these several people had been following him along the way. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You've been following me.” His tone was not a questioning tone, but very certain. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Young Lord of the Sinful Pit nodded confidently, then responded in an indifferent tone, “Exactly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Could it be that there is something on me that you want?” Ye Qingyu was a little puzzled for a moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was well aware that there wasn’t any enmity between him and the Young Lord of the Sinful Pit in the Black Demon Abyss, and what he had done afterwards in the City of Chaos did not have any conflict of interest with the Young Lord of the Sinful Pit. Therefore, he was certain that he wasn’t here to retaliate. Moreover, through the door of the demon domain there were thousands of years of rare treasures, an opportunity that no one would give up on for their own selfish reasons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In other words, even if there were deep-seated hatred between them, he would have waited until they got out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So, for a moment Ye Qingyu could not guess what their purpose was for following him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahaha, you don't have it on you yet, but you will soon.” The Young Lord of the Sinful Pit was evidently in a very good mood, burst out laughing, and directly spoke out his purpose, “All the people who came out of the 18th district of the Black Demon Abyss alive had not ascended as fast as you. Adding to this, you were able to escape under that situation, and even brought out [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei]. From this it is clear that your martial arts luck is absolutely in defiance of the natural order. Haha, you could be said to be a favorite of the heaven and earth, this world always favours a child with luck... Although I had always felt that my luck is pretty good, but compared to you, we are poles apart. Since you have done it once already in the 18th district of the Black Demon Abyss, then why not try again in the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor. It would be better for me to follow behind you and perhaps I can also find some good things, haha.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the reason?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu did not know whether to cry or laugh when he heard this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This reason sounded more like he was praising him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even a young heaven's prideling like the Young Lord of the Sinful Pit had thought so highly of him. Ye Qingyu also felt that there was light on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only thing that was unfortunate was that this did not bring any good things to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, the gaze of the several great experts, who followed the Young Lord of the Sinful Pit, also fell on the Immortal Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were no fools. The building style of the Immortal Palace was not only very different from the other buildings in the [Dragon Palace], it was named with the word ‘Immortal’ and Ye Qingyu was guarding in front. Anybody would know that the real opportunity and treasures were in the Immortal Palace. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahaha, it seems that my choice this time is not wrong. If I had not followed you, even if I passed by the lake, I would never think to check the bottom of the lake. Even more, I would not know that this lake is so deep, and in the bottom of the lake there is unexpectedly a hidden [Dragon Palace]. I also would not know that there is a hidden Immortal Palace hall in the [Dragon Palace].”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The face of the Young Lord of the Sinful Pit lit up with excitement, licking his lips.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Along the way he had seen the luxuriousness and horror of the [Dragon Palace]. In particular the bizarre ancient formations. It was unknown how long these formations had existed, but they were still operating silently. If he had not specially prepared some ancient objects he most likely would have been buried in the formations outside the [Dragon Palace].&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The more heavily guarded a place was, the more shocking the treasure was hidden.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the logic since ancient times.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, the Young Lord of the Sinful Pit was certain that there were earth-shaking treasures in the Immortal Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahaha, a wise person would take advantage of a situation. Deputy Envoy Ye Qingyu, no need to be so nervous, we don’t want to kill you now. As long as you get lost then we can spare your life.” On the other side, one of the guardian Saints who was shrouded in blazing flames gave a howl of strange laugh, his voice shrill and soul-stirring.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That's right, you can leave.” The Young Lord of the Sinful Pit smiled a strange complacent smile. “Since your luck is matchless, perhaps you may find other opportunities. Haha, at that time, you should be careful and don’t let us follow you, haha!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he was speaking, the several figures slowly moved closer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Powerful yuan qi surged. Every figure was of the Great Saint realm cultivation level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the Young Lord of the Sinful Pit now also possessed Great Saint realm yuan qi. It was unknown how many times more powerful he was compared to back then.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the imposing pressure of the six powerful Saint experts, even if someone was as strong as Ye Qingyu, it still felt a little suffocating.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed that the Young Lord of the Sinful Pit had also obtained a lot of opportunities in the 18th district of the Black Demon Abyss. Otherwise it was impossible for him to have improved so rapidly. The Sinful Pit was now one of the top extraordinary forces in the Vast Thousand Domains, and as long as there were enough opportunities, they could shape the Young Lord into a top expert. Although Ye Qingyu had encountered infinite exceptional opportunities, now he only possessed the cultivation base of the Saint realm and physical strength of the pinnacle of the Great Saint realm. While although the Young Lord of the Sinful Pit had not had as many lucky opportunities as Ye Qingyu, his background had made up for it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cultivation base he had was around the same level as that of the Saintess of Jade Pearl.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thoughts were flashing in Ye Qingyu's mind as he began to understand the situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, these were all distracting thoughts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He must not retreat no matter what they said. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahaha, very good, I have to thank Young Lord for thinking so highly of me, but I'm afraid I have to disappoint you. I only accidentally found the [Dragon Palace], and so far have not found any treasure or opportunity.” Ye Qingyu let out a long sigh, maintaining an indifferent expression. “The reason I stopped in front of this Immortal Palace is just because the ancient formations ahead are too dangerous that I don’t dare to go any further. You want this Immortal Palace? Fine, I'll give it to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, he was outnumbered, and what he could do was only stall for time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, he slowly moved to the side, stepping out of the way.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But such a simple move made the Young Lord of the Sinful Pit and the other people have a slight change of expression, feeling a little unsure for a moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally they were certain that there must be Immortal opportunity and treasures in the Immortal Palace. However, now they were somewhat hesitant, especially when they saw the expression on Ye Qingyu's face, and for a moment really did not dare to push open the door of the Immortal Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was not to say that they really believed in Ye Qingyu's words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was that they were worried there would be danger. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What if there were some kind of terrifying formation on the steps of the Immortal Palace, or that there were killing prohibitions the moment they pushed open the door of the Immortal Palace? Along the way, the horrendous formations in the [Dragon Palace] had already reduced their party from ten Great Saint experts and twenty Saint realm experts to the remaining six people. The others were all buried in the terrifying [Dragon Palace] formation. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stop there, you, go and open the door of the Immortal Palace.” The Great Saint expert on the right suddenly ordered Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu smiled, “What? Are you afraid of death?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Great Saint expert did not respond.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course he was afraid of death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Experts of the Great Saint realm were high and mighty sovereign-like existences in the outside world, but once stepped into the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor they were no different from ordinary martial artists. It was unknown how many had died on this trip, and it was no exaggeration to say that in just a few days of time, the number of Great Saint realm experts that had perished here added together was more than the number of Saint experts that had fallen in the past thousands of years.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time, location, and level, determined such a tragedy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are already a caged bird, a turtle in a well, if you are obedient then we can spare you your life, otherwise, haha...” Another Great Saint expert of the Sinful Pit laughed sinisterly. “We don’t mind killing the most outstanding heaven's prideling of the Human Race, not to mention that, if you were to die here nobody will know about the truth. Even if its known, our Sinful Pit would not afraid... Kid, think it over. Obediently go over there and open the door of the Immortal Palace, or die!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu expressionlessly returned to his original position when he heard these words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing at the bottom of the steps of the Immortal Palace hall, he coldly looked at the Young Lord of the Sinful Pit and the others, struggled and hesitated for a moment before he finally turned around slowly and stepped foot onto the stairs to the Immortal Palace...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait!” The Young Lord of the Sinful Pits cried out all of a sudden.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu turned around, looking at him coldly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Walk slowly and slow down your speed.” The eyes of the Young Lord, whose hair was like a birds nest, were flashing a strange light, exchanging glances with the Great Saint next to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Great Saint nodded, activating his yuan qi to its peak, increasing vigilance, and walked over, following ten steps behind Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were afraid of danger in the Immortal Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Also afraid that Ye Qingyu would flash into Immortal Palace at lightning speed and take the opportunity first.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To tell the truth, the Young Lord of the Sinful Pit really felt like he had eaten a dead mouse. It was unfortunate that many of his subordinates had been killed outside of the [Dragon Palace], otherwise he could have ordered a few of his subordinates to be cannon fodder and test the path ahead, and wouldn’t have been so troubled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Continue.” His eyes were fixed on Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu clenched his teeth, slowly stepping towards the door of the Immortal Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nothing unexpected happened as he climbed the several steps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people of the Sinful Pit breathed a sigh of relief.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu came to before the door of the Immortal Palace, slowly stretched out his hands to push open the double doors.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as his hands were about to touch the doors, his body suddenly shook.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Great Saint expert behind him cried out in shock, his mind like a stretched bow, and his tyrannical yuan qi was about to erupt like a mountain torrent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it did not continue to happen. Ye Qingyu did not move further, and his body only stiffened slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What's going on?” The Young Lord of the Sinful Pit frowned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, suddenly there was violet lightning curling around Ye Qingyu's palms, which seemed to have scattered out from the door of the Immortal Palace. Ye Qingyu's body was trembling all over, and an indescribable Immortal aura spread out, shrouding Ye Qingyu from head to toe. Under the bright silk-like rays of light, Ye Qingyu, who was clad in a white robe, seemed like he was ascending to heaven and becoming an Immortal.&nbsp;</span></p>
