 <p>339 - Wei City</p>
 <p>This black shadow-like figure that was like a spirit had found her ten days ago. It was the sect leader of an ancient sect, the [Passionate Dao]. His power was definitely terrifying, and far exceeded Jiang Xiaohan's imagination. But the problem was that the blood and flesh body of this sect leader had long been destroyed, and only his consciousness remained behind. As for the [Passionate Dao], perhaps it had once been really terrifying. But Jiang Xiaohan had searched through countless texts in the library of White Deer Academy, but she had not been able to find any description of the [Passionate Dao]. It seemed like the sect had long been extinguished.</p>
 <p>To enter in such a sect, it was unknown whether it would be fortune or disaster.</p>
 <p>If it was previously, Jiang Xiaohan would not even consider such a proposal.</p>
 <p>But the problem was that Jiang Xiaohan's situation had changed.</p>
 <p>Because of Ye Qingyu, the entire White Deer Academy did not want to interact with her anymore. Those noble young masters who circled around her previously now avoided her like she was a centipede or a snake. If she continued to stay in White Deer Academy, it would be difficult for her to progress any further. The greatest hope of Jiang Xiaohan in these years was completely destroyed.</p>
 <p>She was not willing.</p>
 <p>She was not willing to become a normal girl after graduation. She was not willing to marry, to become a common wife, to bear a child, and not willing to age just like that, her entire life trapped in a little place like Deer City.</p>
 <p>"What are you still hesitant about? The age of the sects is about to descend. The power of the [Passionate Dao] is something you cannot imagine. Your body is naturally perfect for the [Seduction Mantra] of our [Passionate Dao]. The mantra is split into nine parts. If you successfully cultivate to the first three stages, you can annihilate all the Spirit spring experts. If you reach the fifth stage,you can crush top level experts. If you are really fortunate enough to reach the ninth stage, then you can freely travel anywhere and do anything you want in this world. There is no one who can suppress you anymore in this world..." the voice of the sect leader sounded out beside Jiang Xiaohan, his voice filled with an endless seduction.</p>
 <p>Jiang Xiaohan deeply breathed in.</p>
 <p>"Fine, I accept."</p>
 <p>She made her choice.</p>
 <p>"Haha, that is the wise decision." The sect leader began smiling in satisfaction.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>When it was morning, Ye Qingyu came to within the Azure Phoenix Province.</p>
 <p>In the area ruled by the Snow Empire in Heaven Wasteland Domain, the region was split into eighteen different provinces. The Azure Phoenix Province was one of them. Compared to Deer City, it was nearer to the south, and therefore the greenery and shrubbery were more lush and verdant. It was mostly hills, but compared to the dangerous and massive Deer Mountain Range, it was much flatter and safer.</p>
 <p>The sentry originated from a city called Weicheng within the Azure Phoenix Province.</p>
 <p>He was the simple and common son of a merchant.</p>
 <p>Previously, Ye Qingyu had already inspected the military documents held for this sentry and his family. He had a brother in his family, a sister, and his parents were still there. There was a merchant company, that was led by his brother within the city, and they could be counted as a well-off family.</p>
 <p>When Ye Qingyu reached Weicheng City, the sky had began to turn bright.</p>
 <p>The [Bright Sword Ship] halted ten miles away from Weicheng City.</p>
 <p>According to the rules of the Empire, those military flying ships were not allowed within the city.</p>
 <p>The [Bright Sword Ship] had only arrived an hour earlier than Ye Qingyu. Wen Wan had already sent people inside the city to prepare. They needed a pass to enter into the city for them. This place was already classified as a different province, therefore Ye Qingyu's influence was not as great as when he was in Youyan Pass or Deer City.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu stayed in the flying ship. He rested for a while, recovering the inner yuan inside his body.</p>
 <p>In less than an instant's time, the soldier that they had sent to prepare had returned. They had obtained the pass to enter.</p>
 <p>"Let's go."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu brought Ximen Yeshui as well as four Youyan Pass soldiers to leave the flying ship. They came to the Weicheng City. The soldiers guarding the city, after inspecting their pass to enter the city, finally allowed them through.</p>
 <p>Weicheng City was not the most affluent city of Azure Phoenix Province, but it's scale was even larger than Deer City.</p>
 <p>Because it was nearer the center of Snow Empire, it's environment was naturally better than Deer City. The resources were wealthier, and the city was incomparably affluent. People were everywhere. After they went past the city gates and entered the city truly, they could sense the luxuriousness of this city. Around on the stores of the streets, there were stands that constantly called out. There were many people that wore brocaded and luxurious clothes, clearly indicating the wealthiness of the people of the city.</p>
 <p>Ximen Yeshui looked everywhere as he walked, eyes bulging out, a complete look of a country bumpkin.</p>
 <p>“Mister, do you know how to get to Qinchun street?" Ye Qingyu asked an old man by the roadside that was selling pastries.</p>
 <p>“Oh, after you finish walking this Qinhei street, and then Longchun street. After you go through the street at the end, you will have reached Qinchun street." The old man seemed to be around seventy years old, his head completely white. His clothes were somewhat shabby, and he was thin and gaunt. He held two bamboo baskets, sweat sheding from his forehead. He constantly painted, seeming to be expending a lot of effort.</p>
 <p>He gave them a glance. Seeing that the aura of Ye Qingyu and the others were not normal, he did not dare ignore them and gave them clear directions.</p>
 <p>Eh?</p>
 <p>The moment that the old man lifted his head, Ye Qingyu could see a large scar on his head. Evidently, they had just stitched it up simply and it had not completely healed. There was a bloody line that was like a centipede between his left eye and left side of his hairline. From its appearance, it should be caused by a blade or a sword.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was surprised, but he did not ask further. Clasping his hands in thanks, he continued onwards.</p>
 <p>After walking several steps, there was a commotion. Then it was the painful cries of the old man who had just led them the way.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu frowned. Turning his head to look, he saw several muscular men wearing faint purple bodyguard outfits that surrounded the old man in the middle. They were punching and kicking him. There was also a middle-aged man who looked like a scholar with a long beard that stood at the side, cursing and shouting at the old man.</p>
 <p>"Old bastard, the money you owe is already three days late. Just when will you return it? Where do you want to hide?" the middle-aged scholar cursed at him viciously. "I was about to go to your house to claim, but I met you midway... What, were you thinking of running away?"</p>
 <p>"Manager Zheng, I... Please can you speak to young master Wu and say that I will definitely repay you guys in the next few days. I will definitely repay you guys. You've already taken everything of worth in my family away... I have to currently sell pastries to make money, I..." The old man had been stamped several times. But he could not pay attention to the pain. He lay on the ground begging."</p>
 <p>"Selling pastries?" The bearded man gave a cold smile, then kicked the two bamboo baskets away. Tens of flatcakes instantly flew out, landing in the gutters nearby. "The tiny amount of money you earn from selling flatcakes, just how long will it take for you to repay your debt? Old bastard, stop struggling. Why don't you let your daughter enter into the Wu household, then that debt will be forgotten..."</p>
 <p>The people on the roadside, seeing this scene, did not dare to stand out and object. The large majority of people saw this and pretended they did not witness such a scene, and quickly departed. There was a small number of people that had a pitying expression, but they held the rage in their heart without saying anything.</p>
 <p>It seemed like this group of people had high status in Weicheng City.</p>
 <p>From far away, Ye Qingyu frowned.</p>
 <p>"Hehehe, is this the rumoured the strong bullying the week? I've read about this many times in novels, but it's my first time witnessing such a scene in real life. Hehehe, this is namely the time for you to act, and become a legendary hero..." Ximen Yeshui said excitedly.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu stared at him, completely speechless.</p>
 <p>He turned round and ordered a person called Gao Shou to stop this, and assisted the old man who had given them directions.</p>
 <p>There were two bodyguards that wanted to fight against him. The result was that Gao Shou lightly brushed them away, and they were sent flying.</p>
 <p>"Just what kind of bastard appeared that doesn't fear death, that they dare to spread fire here? To dare interfere in the matters of the Wu household?" The bearded middle-aged scholar screamed.“</p>
 <p>"Owing a debt is owing a debt. Why must you hit someone?" Gao Shou was a fierce soldier that was born through a hundred battlefields within Youyan Pass. How could he be intimidated by a lacky? He lightly said such a phrase, and assisted the old man up. He picked up the bamboo baskets, and picked up the fallen flatcakes.</p>
 <p>"Haha, just who do you think you are, to think you dare mess with me?" The middle-aged scholar sneered.</p>
 <p>He was about to say something more, when Gao Shou eyes suddenly narrowed. A sinister killing aura emanated. The killing qi that was created from the demon battlefield where corpses were as high as mountains and blood ran till it became like a lake in Youyan Pass emitted from his body. The pressure was like were real, and shot towards the surroundings like blades. The complexion of the middle-aged scholar instantly turned deathly pale, and large beads of sweat dripped down. The bodyguards beside him were also shivering, like rats being held in place by a cat.</p>
 <p>"I... I will definitely repay my debt. Manager Zheng, can you please say, I..." The old man who had given them directions stuttered.</p>
 <p>The middle-aged scholar snorted, his face cold. He did not say anything, and left with his subordinates. Before he left, he turned his head around and gave the old man a glance. The viciousness in his eyes was enough to make one shiver.</p>
 <p>After several people had left, the old man could not help but weep. Two lines of tears streamed down his face. Wiping away the tears, he bowed to give his thanks to Gao Shou who had extended his aid.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu looked at the distance. He knew that this middle-aged manager would definitely not give up. This time, he did not know whether he had placed the old man in a worse situation by helping.</p>
 <p>"You, secretly gather information. Find out just what sort of existence the Wu household is, and just how did the old man owe them money. Find an opportunity to repay it for him, and settle this matter." Ye Qingyu whispered instructions to Gao Shou who returned for further orders.</p>
 <p>"Yes." Gao Shou went to carry out his orders.</p>
 <p>"Such a matter, you can take care of it now, but you can't take care of it for the rest of your lilfe," Ximen Yeshui said in a low voice</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu smiled.</p>
 <p>"If I see something unjust, I will unsheath my blade to help. Of course I have to interfere if it crosses my path, if it doesn't, then I can't do anything. I can only seek peace from my heart.</p>
 <p>Ximen Yeshui slightly nodded his head.</p>
 <p>In truth, Ye Qingyu had not said something extra. If everyone in this world would interfere in all the matters they witness, there would perhaps be much less incidents where one party bullied another because of their power.</p>
 <p>After this little incident, the party continued on their journey.</p>
 <p>According to what the old man had said, after passing through several little alleys, they would finally reach Qinchun street.</p>
 <p>This was a glamourous street, and the stream of people was rushing. It completely did not fall behind to the main road of the city gate----</p>
