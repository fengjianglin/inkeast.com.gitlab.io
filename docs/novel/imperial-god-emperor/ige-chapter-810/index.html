 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once ignited, this flame could burn anything into ashes.

When it came to experts such as Great Saint Zhong Yuan, he must have killed many opponents and encountered lots of good fortune to become a Great Saint. Therefore, his karmic debt would be as high as a mountain and he would never be able to escape. Any living thing that had karma would immediately be burnt to dust by the power of laws once the [Red Lotus Hellfire] touched them. This had nothing to do with how powerful the individual was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to legend, only divine beings with some self-restraint, newborns who had yet to be tainted by karma, or the ultimate Saints with impeccable morals and conduct would not be afraid of being burned by this [Red Lotus Hellfire]. They would be able to walk freely through it as though they were walking on air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Black Moon Divine Palace had committed many crimes, and therefore, its karmic debt was as plentiful as the sand in the Ganges River. Once the [Red Lotus Hellfire] came upon it, flames roared through the Black Moon Divine Palace's representative station as though kindled by oil. Hundreds of experts within the representative station caught fire and screamed piteously as they tried to escape, but to no avail. They were burnt into dust and their ashes disappeared into the Void.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one dared to rush into the place to kill Ye Qingyu or to save their comrades. This was especially so in the case of Master Zhu since he was someone who enjoyed hatching devious plots. Therefore, his karmic debt was even greater than Great Saint Zhong Yuan, who had killed countless people. Furthermore, he was not yet a Saint, so he obviously could not afford to risk it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Bastard, why are you not stopping this... Stop it!" Great Saint Zhong Yuan bellowed angrily as he gnashed his teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He then released a long chain of formations from his body, which shone with mysterious divine splendor, protecting those around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those who had been lying in wait inside were all the top experts from the Black Moon Divine Palace and many experts who had been invited from the various other sects and forces. At least one-third of the Black Moon Divine Palace's elite experts were inside, and now that the [Red Lotus Hellfire] had come upon them, the chances of anyone making it out alive were close to zero. This was probably a hundred years worth of yuan qi burned off from the Black Moon Divine Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hahaha. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. As such inhumane jackals, do you even feel pain?" Ye Qingyu laughed maniacally with rage. His laughter rang out from the depths of the hellfire and was filled with rage, murderous intent, and the need for vengeance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Stop it. You..." Great Saint Zhong Yuan felt his heart squeeze in pain. "Let's have a civil discussion. Let us talk this out."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For someone like this old man who had developed such a strong attachment to the Black Moon Divine Palace and who thought of the palace as his own family, the scene in front of him was unbearable, especially as he could only watch helplessly as these people went up in flames one by one before turning into ashes. These were the elite experts who had been painstakingly groomed by the Black Moon Divine Palace. Over the years, the Black Moon Divine Palace had been secretly cultivating and grooming these talents with the help of several forces, and these elite experts could have turned them into a top force. However, after this hellfire, at least half of their efforts had come to naught.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that even if he rushed out, he would not be able to save any of them and might even be trapped within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hahaha. Old dog, did you just ask to talk things through? Are you kidding me?" Ye Qingyu's figure was barely discernible through the red flames. He was not affected by the flames since he was under the protection of the [Cloud Top Cauldron]. He was like an avenging death god who had crawled out of hell, and wherever he went, he left a trail of bodies burning in his wake, screaming in pain. His anger-filled voice reverberated across the land. "So, now you want to have a civil discussion? Why did you not think of doing so when you ruthlessly slaughtered the Heaven Wasteland envoy mission? When they begged for mercy before they were killed; when those pitiful women were defiled by you bastard and died without their chastity and dignity; why did the thought of having a civil discussion not cross your mind? I've had enough. Today is the day where all you inhumane bastards will experience the true meaning of karma. I have reined in my anger and my urge to kill over the past three days and did not kill a single person even as I sealed your representative stations. To me, the Black Moon Divine Palace was a human sect and I thought that there might have been some within the sect who were innocent and that they only acted in such a manner because they were deceived or hoodwinked by that bastard Yang Wanqu. However, what happened next? You old dog, how dare you even think of sticking the heads of your fellow humans on poles in order to force me to show myself? All of you no longer have a shred of conscience. You are just a pack of dogs and pigs who deserve to rot in hell... Therefore, let us all perish together. May you be baptized in this [Red Lots Hellfire] and cleanse yourself of your evil deeds. As for me, the fact that I have single-handedly managed to wipe away centuries of your efforts makes this all worth it. Hahahaha!"</span></p>

To all these people, Ye Qingyu was a tragic hero and a fearless, outstanding young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a tragedy to this solemn and stirring young man.</span></p>

This was an opportunity for them to rise, an opportunity that their ancestors had searched so hard for. Therefore, Zhong Yuan finally gave his approval for the mission because his desire for his sect to rise outweighed the guilt that he felt in harming his fellow humans of the Heaven Wasteland.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, as he stared at the flames that filled the air, he suddenly started to waver.</span></p>

The representative station was now virtually impregnable and would be an iron prison to Ye Qingyu, but wouldn't it be the same to the elite experts within it?</span></p>

This might have turned out a little differently compared to what we had expected, but the result was what we were expecting. Since this idiot wishes to perish alongside us, let us grant him his wish. As long as Ye Qingyu dies, it doesn't matter how he died, the sect will still see it as a great accomplishment. With the support of that person, we would be able to build back what we have lost today in a matter of three to four years. This is a critical moment, so you mustn't waver!"</span></p>

They had nothing further to add now that they were in such a situation. They transformed into flowing lights and flickered constantly before they reappeared, taking their places in five spots that surrounded the representative station. At the same time, they clenched their fists in the Void and a mysterious divine weapon that resembled a black moon appeared in their hands with a flash of black splendor. They all had varying shapes—some were as round as a full moon, some were shaped like a half moon, while others were only as small as a new moon—but they were all imbued with a mysterious power. Under the control of the five Saints, a ray of dazzling black splendor burst forth from these five divine weapons and they constantly intersected and shattered across the sky above the representative point to finally form a large black web, completely sealing the surrounding area of the representative point.</span></p>

The Vast Thousand Domains had once been in awe of this formation, but following the decline of the Black Moon Divine Palace, the mystery behind the formation was no longer complete. However, even though the formation was not complete, it still had the ability to trap experts who were at the Great Saint level.</span></p>

I hope that no one will try to stop us or you will be my eternal enemy. I will bring him down even if I die doing so," Great Saint Zhong Yuan said ruthlessly as he stood in the middle of the formation. He spoke authoritatively as he was worried that Ye Qingyu's accomplice might attempt to rush into the formation with the final bit of [Red Lotus Hellfire]. Although the chance of that happening was low, he wanted to make sure he took all precautions.</span></p>
