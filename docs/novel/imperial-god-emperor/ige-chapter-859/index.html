His strength was kept hidden and his aura gradually normalized. His murderous spirit that had been sharpened through his battles in the past years, especially the fearsome sharpness that was like a peerless divine sword displayed during the battles at Falcon City and the Chaotic Windstorm, had already been retracted by him. He seemed to be more mature and exuded an inscrutable and mysterious vibe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was clear that Ye Qingyu's cultivation had improved by leaps and bounds since he entered self-isolation.</span></p>

He racked his brain but could not find the key to opening the gate to truly step into the Saint realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had a combat strength that was on par with a Saint but he was still unable to open the Immortal Gate. This left him extremely bewildered, and finally, he concluded that the time for him to become a Saint was not ripe yet, probably because he had yet to truly comprehend the meaning behind reaching the Saint realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu's progress on the martial way had been smooth sailing thus far. Whether he had been advancing to big or small realms, everything had fallen into place easily and he hardly encountered any bottlenecks. This time though, he had truly encountered a huge bottleneck. Presently, he was unable to find a way to break past the bottleneck.</span></p>

He emptied his mind and cast aside all thoughts on pushing past the Immortal Gate. As a smart man, he would not dwell too much on his problems. Through his multiple failed attempts earlier, he had comprehended something very profound, so profound that he could not describe it. However, he was certain that once the time was ripe, he would be able to easily push open the Immortal Gate.</span></p>

He took close to an hour to finish reading it and digesting the information contained inside.</span></p>

First, this was not an area he was familiar with, and second, he understood that Yu Xiaoxing had merely requested him to read through this document and was not seeking his advice.</span></p>

He discovered that Great Dragon Turtle Demon's vitality was gradually starting to fade away and he seemed to be on the brink of death. Nonetheless, he was in good spirits and could walk unassisted. His face glowed with health as though he was back in his peak condition of his heyday.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu was a little dazed. He was not exactly sure what had happened so he could only secretly inject some life-prolonging force into Great Dragon Turtle Demon to ensure that he would not die anytime soon. He would continue to keep him under observation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the afternoon, Ren Puyang sent someone to privately inform Ye Qingyu that the arrangements for him to enter the [Infinite Arsenal] to browse through the techniques kept within the Alliance of Domains had been made for the morning of the next day. He also informed Ye Qingyu to prepare himself by conserving his energy.</span></p>

If his luck held up, he might be able to discover relevant materials that could help him solve the mystery of opening the Immortal Gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Early the next morning, a white airship descended on the square outside the Green Xuan Hall. Xiao Lin, a white-robed divine guard, appeared and privately greeted Ye Qingyu. Then, under the proud and curious stares of several members of the envoy mission, the airship shot into the air and disappeared into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A moment later—</span></p>

The golden rays of the morning sun gave a faint golden glow to the majestic congress divine temple, which made it seem even more imposing and beautiful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was still early but the various airports of the congress divine temple were bustling with life. Warships and airships ascended and descended into those airports, just like bees bustling back and forth between their hives. It was a majestic sight to behold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The white airship descended into a small airport that was exceptionally well-guarded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Lord Ye Qingyu, please follow me." Xiao Lin, the white-robed divine guard, smiled as he led the way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Many thanks. I'll be counting on you this time, too." Ye Qingyu got off the flying ship and surveyed his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu had now reached the half-step Saint realm, which meant that his cultivation had advanced significantly since the last time he was here. He was now more attuned to his surroundings, and as he carefully assessed his surroundings, he immediately sensed that there was a formidable force surrounding this place. It was a restraining formation that was secretly installed and it hung menacingly in the air. If anyone dared to force their way into this place, they would be torn to shreds instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're welcome. Lord Ren Puyang is held up by some matters and is practically holed up in his residence. However, he specifically instructed me to take good care of you." Divine Guard Xiao Lin smiled warmly and led Ye Qingyu to a waiting flying vehicle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The route taken this time was completely different from the one Ye Qingyu had taken when he came for the domain grading. The flying vehicle looked similar to an airship but it was many times smaller. This was the main mode of transport internally within the Alliance of Domains divine temple and it was faster and more agile than an airship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, the silver formation that shrouded the flying vehicle instantly expanded and then moved like a light arrow charging forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moments later—</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The white-robed Divine Guard, Xiao Lin, handed Ren Puyang's edict to the two guards on duty. After the guards checked the edict and verified Ye Qingyu's identity, they granted them access into the corridor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They walked for close to one thousand meters and passed through three guarded checkpoints before Ye Qingyu was led by Divine Guard Xiao Lin to a small portal formation at the end of the corridor.</span></p>

The light-silver formation was slowly activated and mysterious and ancient space formations that circled the center of the formation circulated like rays of rapidly moving splendor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Do you know how this [Infinite Arsenal] came to be?" Ye Qingyu asked curiously as they walked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I only know a little about it. According to legend, the [Infinite Arsenal] where you are headed was established by a very mysterious Martial Emperor. No one knows his name and there are no records of this Martial Emperor, but as the legend goes, this [Infinite Arsenal] is like the boundless sea and contains all kinds of techniques and secret manuals. There is also a collection of almost all the martial way techniques of almost all the races on the Vast Thousand Domains from ancient times up until present times. The breadth and depth of the materials contained within is said to be the most extensive in the Vast Thousand Domains through the ages. No other power has resources comparable to what is contained within the [Infinite Arsenal]. This is the most powerful resource of the Alliance of Domains," Xiao Lin said proudly.</span></p>

Divine Guard Xiao Lin only briefed him on the origin and the magnificence of the [Infinite Arsenal] when they were standing in front of the portal formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Techniques of the different races?" Ye Qingyu was shocked and exclaimed in surprise. "The techniques of foreign races could also be found within it? This seems too good to be true. Wouldn't that mean that every being who enters the arsenal will be able to discover the techniques of other races?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the Vast Thousand Domains, there were millions of races.</span></p>

These techniques were highly treasured by the various races and were all treated as heavily guarded secrets, never to be revealed to outsiders. According to Divine Guard Xiao Lin's brief introduction of the place, the [Infinite Arsenal] not only held the techniques of the Human Race since ancient times, but the Martial Emperor had also collected the techniques of foreign races.</span></p>

Divine Guard Xiao Lin smiled mysteriously. At the same time, he placed Ren Puyang's token close to the portal formation.</span></p>

Rather, there was yet another space with silver formations.</span></p>

It was devoid of anything except for the twinkling silver formation, but the entire space was filled with dense and ancient spiritual qi. There were many mysterious and grey formation splendor markings that moved and gathered across the four walls of this space. An overbearing power that automatically induced fear in anyone who stepped in permeated the entire divine palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Let's go. The [Infinite Arsenal] is heavily guarded and is the heart of the Alliance of Domains divine temple. We're still quite a distance away from it." Divine Guard Xiao Lin placed the token near the silver splendor to activate the portal formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The road to the [Infinite Arsenal] was not only heavily guarded but also very well-concealed. If he did not have Divine Guard Xiao Lin beside him to lead the way, anyone would have found it hard to exit the place after entering these portal formations.</span></p>

It was even more convoluted than a maze and the two of them only found themselves in the [Infinite Arsenal] after they entered the final portal formation.</span></p>
