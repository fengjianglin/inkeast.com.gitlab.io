 <p>Chapter 309 - Shrine Gate Opens</p>
 <p>“You arrogant bastard!” A killing intent flashed across the grey-haired middle-aged swordsman’s eyes.</p>
 <p>This man was of a high level swordsmanship. With a slight flick of his wrist, a resplendent sword light shot out, several times more oppressive than the sword light from before.</p>
 <p>The arc of light of sword qi slashed across the air, and wherever it went, the air split like the waters of the sea were parted. It tore through space.</p>
 <p>But all this, in front of Ximen Yeshui’s fist, was like nothing but an illusion. His punch smashed everything in front of it to pieces but his fist did not weaken and the power did not fade. It instantly arrived before the middle-aged swordsman’s body.</p>
 <p>“Huh?”</p>
 <p>Startled, the middle-aged swordsman drew his sword up in front of his chest, one finger pressing against the blade of the sword, and directly caught the blue fist.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Powerful qi exploded.</p>
 <p>The clear spiritual sword suddenly made a loud clanging noise that rang through the air as it broke into five or six pieces. The middle-aged swordsman tried to stabilize his body, but was propelled back by the tremendous force, ploughing up the earth and broken stones with his feet. However, he still could not stop his body, stumbled back dozens of meters and tore two shockingly deep grooves in the ground</p>
 <p>The people around were all gasping in shock.</p>
 <p>The majority of the people were aware of the background and cultivation level of this middle-aged swordsman. He was definitely regarded as one of the strongest people among the Heaven Wasteland Domain. The crowd knew that none of them could have sent him flying with one punch like the scholar did.</p>
 <p>Just what was the scholar’s background and why was he so strong?</p>
 <p>There were all sorts of thoughts running through the minds of these people. The eyes they looked at Ximen Yeshui with were all filled with fear.</p>
 <p>Even Ye Qingyu, who was following behind Ximen Yeshui, was thought to be Ximen Yeshui’s servant. The people present could basically determine Ye Qingyu’s qi and cultivation level with one glance, so they did not place too much attention on him.</p>
 <p>Only Qin Zhishiu who was standing at the side by himself, had a light flickering in his eyes beneath his sword-like brows, as he nodded to Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>But he didn’t say anything.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu did not expect that the silent and cold swordsman would greet him. After slightly being taken aback, he furtively nodded back.</p>
 <p>“I thought it was some master, but it was an appetizer.” Having succeeded in one move, it was unavoidable that Ximen Yeshui looked a little smug. Looking at the furious face of the middle-aged swordsman, he smiled, “Your strength is so weak, but you want to test the strength of latecomers. This really is an old man eating arsenic, wanting to commit suicide. You’re lucky that you’re still alive.”</p>
 <p>His mouth was so vicious.</p>
 <p>The middle-aged swordsman was trembling with rage. Bloodstain was on the corner of his mouth, and his eyes gleamed with sinister resentment.</p>
 <p>But he did not attack again and bitterly retreated to the side.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu secretly remembered the face of the middle-aged swordsman. To be able to resist making a move in such a situation, this person’s mind was deep - he must not be underestimated. He obviously retained a strong resentment against Ximen Yeshui, and also him. If he found the opportunity, he would definitely retaliate.</p>
 <p>“Why are you standing here? Are you waiting to rob us?”</p>
 <p>Ximen Yeshui’s gaze swept across the crowd.</p>
 <p>Someone snorted coldly and did not look at him.</p>
 <p>Someone pretended that they did not hear his words.</p>
 <p>But there were those that evidently wanted to make friends with this young scholar. An elderly clad in armour with crazy hair like withered grass, looking extremely fierce like a lion, walked out with a smile. “We are waiting for the gate of the Imperial Residence to open. Little friend, do you not know about the secret?”</p>
 <p>“The gate of the Moving Imperial Residence?” Ye Qingyu asked.</p>
 <p>The armoured old man cast a glance at Ye Qingyu and ignored him, turning around to face Ximen Yeshui. “This may be the real Moving Imperial Residence. Just a while ago, when the residence appeared and the gate was opened, some people managed to enter. Just that every time it opens, only 12 people are allowed in, so everyone is waiting here for the gate to open again...”</p>
 <p>Before he finished talking, he caught sight of silly dog Little Nine hanging at the heels of Ximen Yeshui, and he became speechless.</p>
 <p>This scene was too comedic. Can you imagine a scholar, who was regarded as a powerful master, being bitten at his heel by a fat pig-like dog? The armoured old man thought he must be seeing things.</p>
 <p>Ximen Yeshui was not self conscious in the slightest. Nodding his head he said, “I see... Oh, I understand. The strong people have already entered the Moving Imperial Residence. You guys must be too weak and could not win against those people, so you had to wait here, right?”</p>
 <p>The armoured old man’s face flushed with embarrassment.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu could feel sweat dripping in his heart. Ximen Yeshui’s mouth was like a poisonous snake - he was lucky that he was still alive and hadn’t been beaten to death yet. It must be that there were only a few people in your so-called sect or he would long have been killed.</p>
 <p>“Brat, do you want to die?”</p>
 <p>“You’re so young, but use your words so carelessly. You are bound to die early.”</p>
 <p>Among the crowd, people started shouting their discontent.</p>
 <p>They were indeed defeated in previous battles, so they had no choice but to wait here. Ximen Yeshui’s words were tantamount to uncovering their scars, but also mercilessly sprinkling salt on it. If it was not for the fact that they had already seen his strength, and he was indeed strong, he most likely would have been killed already.</p>
 <p>While they were talking, noises echoed from the [Fog of Annihilation] behind them once again.</p>
 <p>Someone was coming?</p>
 <p>“Humph, there are still people coming. There are so many people that are not afraid of dying,” from the crowd, someone said coldly, and the air was thick with killing intent.</p>
 <p>When the gate of the Moving Imperial Residence opens, only 12 people could enter. There were already nearly 20 people waiting in front. With another person, the probability of entering the gate would be lower, which is something that none of them wanted to see. Anyone that got out of the fog area would only be killed instantly, or asked to leave if their strength was not up to standards.</p>
 <p>Faint footsteps sounded.</p>
 <p>A figure slowly appeared.</p>
 <p>The instant that Ye Qingyu looked behind, his heart jumped up.</p>
 <p>The figure that walked out from the [Fog of Annihilation] was a slim girl, dressed in a dark red warrior robe and a mask with gold engraving on her small white face. Others may not see anything, but Ye Qingyu recognized her at one glance.</p>
 <p>If it was not Song Xiaojun, who else would it be?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu never thought that he would meet Song Xiaojun again.</p>
 <p>Because he was blocked by Ximen Yeshui, Song Xiaojun did not see Ye Qingyu at the first instant.</p>
 <p>She quietly walked out of the [Fog of Annihilation], keeping her head low, her dark red hair hanging down like drifting clouds. She exuded an aura warning strangers not to come close. As though deep in thought, from beginning to end she had not raised her head to take a look at anyone. As she stepped out of the fog, her footsteps came to a stop and she did not say a single word, waiting quietly.</p>
 <p>All eyes fell on Song Xiaojun.</p>
 <p>“A little girl?” Someone in the crowd snorted.</p>
 <p>But no one was tempted to test her power.</p>
 <p>Because the power of the dark flames emanating from Song Xiaojun’s body was frightening, making one’s heart beat faster. It all showed that this seemingly quiet and cold maiden possessed powerful strength.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu could not hold back asking, “How did you come here?”</p>
 <p>Song Xiaojun raised her head. The moment she caught sight of Ye Qingyu, a bright light flashing in her eyes that was like ten-thousand-year-old ice. Then she seemed to have thought of something, “Where’s the little rabbit?”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu smiled and said, “At my house.”</p>
 <p>“You don’t keep to your words.” There was a hint of disappointment that flashed by in Song Xiaojun’s eyes.</p>
 <p>Here words were abrupt, but Ye Qingyu knew what she meant, because he had promised the little girl that he would definitely take good care of the little rabbit. He hurriedly explained, “Don’t worry, my aunt and sister will definitely take care of it. I wanted to come here and it's dangerous here so I could not bring it with me.”</p>
 <p>Song Xiaojun answered with a nod, before she lowered her head again and did not speak.</p>
 <p>Ximen Yeshui’s gaze flickered back and forth between Ye Qingyu and Song Xiaojun, and after a long while he said teasingly in a low voice, “Little Brother, your heart is beating so fast.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu’s lips were pressed together.</p>
 <p>He really wanted to sew up Ximen Yeshui’s mouth.</p>
 <p>At this time, Song Xiaojun looked up again, saying, “In a while, follow behind me.”</p>
 <p>“Huh?” Ye Qingyu stood blank.</p>
 <p>Given Song Xiaojun’s personality, she would not say something akin to ‘intimacy’.</p>
 <p>“I will protect you,” Song Xiaojun continued.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu suddenly understood. Song Xiaojun’s meaning was that she needed to protect him, so that he could stay alive to take care of the little rabbit.</p>
 <p>What was this?</p>
 <p>Could it be that in your heart, I am not as precious as the little rabbit?</p>
 <p>Marquis Ye suddenly felt a little disappointed.</p>
 <p>Ximen Yeshui seemed to feel like someone who had discovered a new continent. He began grinning roguishly, “There’s something fishy.”</p>
 <p>Before his voice died away.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>A dark flame blasted the place where he stood.</p>
 <p>A several meters deep pit appeared, and clouds of dark flame burst upward from the pit.</p>
 <p>Ximen Yeshui, who evaded on time, was still recovering from the shock as he hurriedly shouted, “Stop, hurry stop... don’t misunderstand. I’m joking. I’m good friends with him... whoa, so violent...”</p>
 <p>When the other strong people saw the clouds of dark flames, their expressions changed greatly.</p>
 <p>“Unmoving City of Darkness?”</p>
 <p>“You are... the holy girl of darkness?”</p>
 <p>Someone looked astounded, retreating several steps back.</p>
 <p>Given the experience of these people, of course it was impossible for them to not hear of the legend of the Unmoving City of Darkness. A while back, it was rumoured that even Lu Zhaoge was almost killed by this demon woman. Now, the people of Jianghu, at the mention of this name, all had completely different facial expressions.</p>
 <p>Only Qin Zhishui’s eyes were flashing with a surprised expression.</p>
 <p>He evidently was confused why a member of the Youyan Army, [The Leaf of Youyan], would be so close with the woman of darkness.</p>
 <p>But at this moment, there was a bizarre change in the air.</p>
 <p>Multicoloured light flashing in the sky.</p>
 <p>In the originally dusky sky was a majestic shrine slowly emerging, like a mirage, gradually becoming much clearer and visible. The shrine, constructed of pure white bricks, was towering like a mountain that the dome of the shrine could not even be seen. The glistening white appearance gives the whole shrine a dazzling impression and an indescribable feeling of sanctity was exuding from the shrine itself.</p>
 <p>All eyes immediately fell upon the shrine floating in mid-air.</p>
 <p>In the front of the shrine was a double rectangular white stone gate, slowly rumbling open.</p>
 <p>“The gate of the Moving Imperial Residence is finally open,” someone shouted excitedly.</p>
 <p>Swoosh.</p>
 <p>Light flashed and shadows flickered.</p>
 <p>Countless figures, like lightning, were rushing to enter the slowly opening gate first.</p>
