 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Get lost!" a general from the Dragon Human army roared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the leader of the White-robed Divine Guards, Tang Chong saw what had happened, he was also enraged. These foreign race experts were completely shameless in their attempt to profit from this battle. "Whoever dares to enter the sect gate today will become an enemy of the Human Race headquarters. Please leave immediately and refrain from committing this grave mistake."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several experts hesitated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The large majority of them were not deterred but instead charged forward and said, "We're here to help."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Exactly, there's great enmity between the Four Stars Sect and ourselves, so we're here to seek revenge today. These are the unspoken rules of the martial world, so you can't stop us."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's right. The Four Stars Sect killed my father, so I have to avenge his death."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many experts had found excuses and frantically swarmed toward the Four Stars Sect's sect gate, heedless of the warnings from the Dragon Human Race and the White-robed Divine Guards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many of these experts from the foreign race were overcome with greed for the treasures that could be found within the Four Stars Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dragon Human Race and the White-robed Divine Guards attempted to stop them, but they were helpless against the crowd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battlefield soon descended into a state of chaos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How despicable!" the haughty young man Lu Wei trembled in rage. He was still rather inexperienced when it came to the ways of the world and had never encountered such a situation before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The successor of the White Jade Capital's eyes also flashed with anger under her veil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These experts of the foreign races had gone too far. They were clearly making up lies to try to get their hands on a piece of the pie at the last moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These experts had decided that the potential benefits they stood to gain far outweighed the risks they were facing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a voice rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Those who are not part of the Dragon Human Race army or the White-robed Divine Guards but insist on barging into the Four Stars Sect's sect gate shall be killed without pardon!" Ye Qingyu said coldly as he stood in front of the divine temple floating in the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His voice did not contain any power of laws nor any authoritative force but those experts who lusted after the treasures within the Four Stars Sect immediately froze mid-air and did not dare to take another step forward. Their expressions were very uneasy because they could ignore the warnings of the Dragon Human army and the White-robed Divine Guards, but no one dared to defy the young man in white.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he said that he would show no mercy, then they would all be dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Quasi-emperors were not spared from his sword, to say nothing of experts like themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were still hoping that the lofty [Ice Sword Killing God] would close an eye to such matters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were clearly mistaken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several experts retreated and immediately fled from the scene, afraid that the [Ice Sword Killing God] would bear a grudge against them in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, there were some others who hesitated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Heavenly Spirit Race expert paused for a moment, then he said, "My lord, we don't want to make an enemy out of you, but there's truly a deep enmity between the Heavenly Spirit Race and the Four Stars Sect. We hope that you'll let us join the battle to avenge the fallen from our race."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yes, there is a deep blood feud between our race and the Four Stars Sect."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"My lord, you might be incredibly powerful, but it wouldn't be right for you to stop us from exacting revenge."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That would be too overbearing."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Your actions would be no different from the overbearing nature of the Four Stars Sect in the past."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several experts from the foreign races continued to stir up troubles and muttered complaints, hoping to gain the support of even more experts. After all, mass offenders are rarely persecuted before the law, so if they could gain strength in numbers, they could pressure Ye Qingyu in allowing them to join the battle. This would also mean that they were not openly defying him but were merely airing their grievances, so Ye Qingyu would probably not kill them just because they made several complaints, right? No matter how strong he was, he still needed the support and recognition of most of the forces since this was also a way to consolidate his position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How dare you. The Heavenly Spirit Race used to have the closest relations with the Four Stars Sect and you were once allies," Lin Yutang admonished them angrily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was well aware of how the situation had been.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These Heavenly Spirit Race experts bowed their heads, then they lifted their heads again and tried to defend themselves, "The Four Stars Sect had forced us to be their allies... We were not true allies and we were also oppressed and bullied by them, so we must exact revenge..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How shameless of you," Lin Yutang was livid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu smiled and stopped Lin Yutang from saying any more with a wave of his hand. He then turned toward this group of experts and sighed before he said, "You were afraid of the Four Stars Sect but you do not fear me. Do you really think that I won't be as overbearing as the Four Stars Sect?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those experts froze at his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They suddenly felt as though something terrible was about to happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, Ye Qingyu swept his hand across the sky and a ray of dazzling sword light appeared out of nowhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The several dozen experts who had been airing their complaints and trying to stir up trouble were instantly sliced into two by the sword light and fell like stalks of straw that were sliced by a sickle. Their bodies split apart easily before plummeting to the ground. Even in death, their expressions were still twisted savagely with greed. They could not believe right until their dying moment that he would kill them over their minor complaints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other experts shivered in fear at the sight and quickly retreated as though they were avoiding a poisonous serpent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They felt as though their hearts had sunk to the bottom of an icy cave, and they suddenly realized that they had neglected a very important fact - the [Ice Sword Killing God] Ye Qingyu had never shown mercy and was well-known to be extremely ruthless, so he was clearly no pushover. They were simply courting death by trying to use the tactics that they used against those men who angled for fame. Why did they think that Ye Qingyu could be held ransom by their petty tricks?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those who defied him had sealed their death sentence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was how the [Ice Sword Killing God] had always behaved. He did not mind killing several more experts regardless of the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He regained complete control over the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He sat in the middle of the Four Stars Sect's sect gate and overlooked the proceedings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were indeed countless precious and divine treasures and martial techniques manuals that the sect had collected for several millennia. The Four Stars Sect was also indeed very rich so he could understand why those experts from the foreign races had lusted after those riches but to him, these riches belonged to the Human Race and had to be kept within the Human Race. According to the agreement he struck with the Dragon Human Race, they would receive several origin crystals and raw materials as their reward, but he would not allow them to take those secret manuals and precious weapons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a fierce battle within the sect gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had received orders beforehand to not completely annihilate the sect, so they tried their best to not set the place on fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I will spare those who surrender!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We'll only kill the leaders who committed evil, but we will spare the ordinary disciples."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These voices rang out from the Four Stars Sect's sect gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The disciples of the Four Stars Sect were in a state of extreme panic and reacted like dogs without a master. They had once destroyed countless sects and annihilated countless other forces over the past centuries, but they had never imagined that they would one day face the same fate. Their sect had reached new heights over the past few centuries and they had a Quasi-emperor on their side, which also meant that this was a golden age for their sect, so it was a huge blow for them to suddenly sink to such depths at their peak. They were both flustered and frightened, and completely lacked the will to battle on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many lower-ranked disciples put up a feeble attempt to resist, but ultimately chose to surrender.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the upper echelons of the sect, they could only choose to battle to the death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sect master of the Four Stars Sect faced off against Spokesperson Li once more. This time, he attacked with all his might and killing intent surged explosively from him. They both did not hold anything back in their attacks since there was no longer any room for negotiation. Furthermore, the sect master had once threatened Spokesperson Li with his daughter, so Spokesperson Li would definitely not let him escape this time...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both parties soon sustained injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The successor of the White Jade Capital joined forces with Li Shengyan to battle the Four Stars Holy Girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no longer any need to engage in one-on-one battles since everyone wanted the battle to end as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soldiers battled soldiers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Generals battled generals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Wei showed off his incredible strength to kill three of the Seven Sons in quick succession like an invincible killing god. He was then surrounded by four elders of the Four Stars Sect, but still managed to gain the upper hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time ticked by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The resistance within the sect gradually weakened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ah..." there was a sharp cry as the sect master of the Four Stars Sect was seriously injured. His body was destroyed by Spokesperson Li and his spirit was also seriously damaged, so there was no way he could escape. He yelled angrily, "I refuse to admit defeat. I was supposed to be the hero of the Four Stars Sect and I could have ruled over everyone, but why? Why have the gods been so unfair?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, his spirit dissipated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spokesperson Li's body was also riddled with injuries, but he still managed to kill the sect master. This showed how incredibly terrifying and highly-skilled the current spokesperson of the Human Race was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Four Stars Holy Girl had also sustained serious injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She did her best to counterattack, but she felt death closing in on her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Why did things turn out this way?" the Four Stars Holy Girl asked resentfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Four Stars Sect's camp was already extremely influential and this was why they managed to gain the support of a dark Quasi-emperor, but no one had expected Ye Qingyu to possess such a powerful secret weapon that had the ability to kill two Quasi-emperors in succession. This then caused the Four Stars Sect to crumble like quicksand."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those were Quasi-emperors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were two Quasi-emperors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had thought that their strength and the resources that were accumulated over several millennia were enough for the Four Stars Sect to reign supreme over many forces in this world and that they could even claim that they were invincible, but who could have expected that... the truth would turn out to be so cruel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a flash of silver light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The successor of the White Jade Capital pierced the Four Stars Holy Girl's chest with her long sleeves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blood gushed from her mouth and she quickly retreated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Bitch, go to hell," the chubby Li Shengyan attacked ruthlessly and his golden hammers hummed as golden lightning and thunder appeared all over the skies. He couldn't wait to smash this woman into smithereens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Four Stars Holy Girl hastily retreated, but she was still struck by lightning. Her body turned as black as an ancient burnt tree bark.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was stuck in a hopeless situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Death was about to close in on her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Shengyan continued to attack furiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, there was a strange ripple in the void that spread outwards to protect the Four Stars Holy Girl. The ripple swirled and was about to take her away...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu looked down at this scene in the void and purple light circulated in his eyes as he unleashed the power of laws to lock in on that part of the void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother Ye Qingyu, she has already sustained serious injuries and is no longer a threat. Please spare her today and I promise that I will give the Human Race an explanation in the future," a voice rang out. Then, a phantom figure in golden armor appeared. This was Ye Qingyu's old friend and he pleaded sincerely for her life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu sighed and hesitated for a moment, but the purple qi finally faded from his eyes and everything in the void returned to normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ripple in space flashed as that phantom figure brought the Four Stars Holy Girl away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Many thanks, Brother Ye Qingyu," the voice said gratefully before it disappeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
