 <p>They really had to be careful of them.</p>
 <p>As for why there were only ten people that were allowed to enter this time when the divine gate opened….</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu long had an answer in his heart.</p>
 <p>Apart from Little Nine occupying a position, it was most likely that Little Silver also occupied a position. It was only that the little silver dragon had turned into a hairpin and was not spotted by other people.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu sweated a bit somewhat inside.</p>
 <p>He had not thought that he would occupy three places all by himself. This was not his original intention. He hoped that those people who had not gained the right to enter into the divine gate would not be that furious, and wait outside. Perhaps there would still be a chance for them to enter.</p>
 <p>But Ye Qingyu did not know that everything had already changed outside the divine gate.</p>
 <p>"I wonder if everyone noticed that the waves seemed to have gotten larger than before," the armoured old man opened his mouth again.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was taken aback.</p>
 <p>He carefully inspected the surrounding ocean. The blood red waves around them were exactly as he said, it had become fiercer. Wave after wave crashed at them, about three or four meters high. They must carefully control the little raft to prevent the little raft from being capsized.</p>
 <p>Others had also discovered such a point.</p>
 <p>This was bad news.</p>
 <p>If the blood waves were a little larger, everyone would be in danger. If the little raft capsized and they fell into the blood sea, then...</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu had not finished his thinking when the little raft suddenly quivered with a loud bang. It was as if it was struck by something below. It was instantly sent flying tens of meters high into the sky. A strange elastic force emitted from below the ship. It caused everyone to be sent flying because they were unprepared for such an impact.</p>
 <p>"Crap!"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu shouted, grabbing Little Nine and borrowing the force of the upward momentum to jump and curve around in the air. With difficulty, he managed to land back onto the little raft.</p>
 <p>"What's happening?"</p>
 <p>"We hit something?“</p>
 <p>"There is something below..."</p>
 <p>All the experts once again returned to the little raft.</p>
 <p>The person who was currently rowing the raft was namely the armoured old man and Qin Zhishui.</p>
 <p>Qin Zhishui shrugged his shoulders, nothing to say.</p>
 <p>The armoured old man let out a gasp, "I also don't know. I evidently didn't see anything, but it suddenly seemed we struck something... wait, something's not right." His face instantly grew paler. "We're missing one person?"</p>
 <p>“No, we're all here…” the middle-aged swordman glanced around and said in a cold voice. "Even the dog is still here."</p>
 <p>"Woof..." Little Nine became active once more.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu covered his mouth and dragged him back again.</p>
 <p>Such an action was seen as fear in the eyes of the middle-aged swordsman. He sneered.</p>
 <p>"We are indeed missing one person," the hook nosed man said as he looked in front of the little raft. There were originally two people there, they were the two that had always kept silent and unassuming since entering the divine gate and had kept silent. They were easily ignored, but not only one person was left.</p>
 <p>"What happened? Where is he?"</p>
 <p>Everyone's glances focused on the face of the person left behind.</p>
 <p>It was a short and thin man that was around thirty of forty. Hearing these questions, he shook his head, "I also don't know... I didn't see. When the little raft shot up, I didn't even react before the person beside me disappeared, I..."</p>
 <p>As he was halfway through what he was saying, his mouth suddenly shut. His eyes looked behind them, his expression pale.</p>
 <p>"There," the armoured old man shouted.</p>
 <p>When everyone turned around, they could see a figure madly struggling within the bloody waves tens of meters away. But he could not emit any sound whatsoever. Very quickly, the terrifying blood waves had corroded him to a bloody piece of flesh, incomparably terrifying...</p>
 <p>"Save him," the short and thin man shouted.</p>
 <p>"Hmph, save who? He's already dead," the swordsman snorted.</p>
 <p>Before he had even finished.</p>
 <p>Chilah!</p>
 <p>A huge shadow suddenly appeared from the blood red ocean. In an instant, it dragged the bloody body deep down into the bloody ocean, then disappeared.</p>
 <p>Everyone on the little raft shivered at such an sight.</p>
 <p>"You... what did you all see?" The armoured old man shook.</p>
 <p>The swordsman and hook nosed man’s expressions were deathly pale. The hook nosed man had a shaking voice, "this is... Is... a sea beast? A demonic beast? Heavens... it's too terrifying, did anyone see it clearly?"</p>
 <p>Everyone shook their heads.</p>
 <p>In the instant where the blood waves splashed, they could faintly see a humongous blood red tentacle-like object appearing from the waves. In a flash, before they could clearly see just what is was, it had dissapeared. But what they could be certain of, was that it was an utterly frightening existence. For it to be able to survive in such a bloody ocean, just how powerful did it have to be?"</p>
 <p>In an instant, the shadow of death enveloped everyone's heart.</p>
 <p>If such a monster attacked the little raft, everyone would fall into the blood red waters.</p>
 <p>"Quick, quickly row, leave here quickly..."</p>
 <p>The middle-aged swordsman screeched.</p>
 <p>The scarlet red ocean around them had turned incomparably terrifying in an instant. With the power of everyone's sight, they could only see four or five meters deep below the surface of the water. Just what was it like down there, or what sort of horrifying monster was hidden within was unknown to everyone.</p>
 <p>The little raft was like a sharp sword breaking through the blood ocean.</p>
 <p>The mood of everyone became extremely serious and heavy.</p>
 <p>Another two hours passed.</p>
 <p>Apart from the waves becoming larger, there were not any more terrifying creatures.</p>
 <p>"Phew... it seems we are safe?" the armoured old man let out a breath of relief.</p>
 <p>Before he had finished---</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>A blood water pillar shot out from the right of the little raft.</p>
 <p>A terrifying tentacle shot out like lightning. It instantly latched onto the short and thin man at the forefront of the raft. In a split second, it had dragged him into the blood ocean. There was a gurgling sound that emitted from the water. Instantly, he had been partially dissolved till he was like a bloody person. He could not even emit a scream and only struggled for a brief moment or two before he was dragged within the depths of the bloody ocean.</p>
 <p>At the same time.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>It was as if something struck at the bottom of the little raft once again.</p>
 <p>It was the same as last time. There was a strange energy that sent the little raft flying tens of meters. Everyone on the little raft was sent into the air.</p>
 <p>"They deserve to die!"</p>
 <p>“Everyone be careful. The monster still has not left!"</p>
 <p>There were shouts and screams.</p>
 <p>Under a situation where their yuan qi was suppressed, even if the strength of everyone was powerful, they could not remain indefinitely in the air. After being shot in the air and fixing their form, they all headed and landed towards the little raft.</p>
 <p>Pang!</p>
 <p>The little raft heavily struck the water.</p>
 <p>The blood red water splashed everywhere.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu nearly lost control in the air. He did his utmost to recover his stance, landing towards the little raft.</p>
 <p>"Scream, there is someone here," the middle aged swordsman smiled sinisterly. Seeing that Ye Qingyu was landing towards his own direction, he unsheathed his sword on the little raft. The sword light exploded, not allowing Ye Qingyu to land next to him.</p>
 <p>"You're looking to die!"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was enraged. The [True Will of the Sky Dragon] activated. His right hand instantly transformed into the form of a dragon's claw, striking towards the sword light.</p>
 <p>But before he collided with the sword light, Ximen Yeshui had already acted.</p>
 <p>It was unknown just when a three pronged trident appeared on his hand. With a tremble, it shattered the sword light and returned Ye Qingyu onto the little raft.</p>
 <p>With a thought, Ye Qingyu turned his right hand back to it's original form.</p>
 <p>Without saying anything, Ximen Yeshui stabbed the trident in his hands towards the middle-aged swordsman.</p>
 <p>"You... what are you doing?" the middle-aged swordsman was shocked, quickly wielding his sword to block.</p>
 <p>"You think my words are just farts? I said, whoever touches my brother, I will kill him. You should know what you did just now very clearly." Ximen Yeshui took step after step closer. "A trash like you who had malicious intentions, what right do you have to obtain the legacy of the [Formation Sovereign]? Why don't you just die. Jump into the ocean by yourself, don't make me act."</p>
 <p>"I... I only stopped the pretty boy from jumping on me. The ship is so large..." the middle aged swordsman explained himself with a dark face.</p>
 <p>"Are you going to jump or not?" the voice of Ximen Yeshui was cold and merciless.</p>
 <p>Veins appeared on the forehead of the middle-aged swordsman. "don't be too overbearing. My sect ancestor has already entered into the divine gate. There will be someone receiving me at the end of the blood red ocean, at that time..."</p>
 <p>"You're not going to jump?" Ximen Yeshui's trident raised, as he coldly smiled. "Only parents will be called in a fight between children. Come and fight. If you don't dare fight, then just jump and die.”</p>
 <p>"Both, both, don't fight, listen to my words." The armoured old man quickly stood out. "Don't fight internally, we have to band together to survive this trial."</p>
 <p>"That's right, I believe that brother Pei did not mean anything by this," the hook nosed man quickly spoke.</p>
 <p>Song Xiaojun sat there silently by the side, not saying anything.</p>
 <p>"What if I don't want to accept?" Ximen Yeshui was not going to back down.</p>
 <p>"You just want to get rid of those who oppose you. You people want to hog the entire raft to yourself," the hook nosed man said furiously.</p>
 <p>After thinking this over, Ye Qingyu grabbed Ximen Yeshui, lightly shaking his head.</p>
 <p>Although he was angered in his heart, and had also raised his killing intentions, but since the current situation was still unknown, it was not the right time to act. If they left the middle-aged swordsman and hook nosed man untouched, perhaps they could be used, and used as bait at a crucial time. If they threw them into the ocean, perhaps it could attract the attention of the monster below.</p>
 <p>Ximen Yeshui only barely gave up wanting to pursue things further at this.</p>
 <p>"Don't dare act against my brother again, or i'll definitely kill you." He glared at the middle-aged swordsman and cursed at him viciously.</p>
 <p>The middle-aged swordsman did not reply.</p>
 <p>Seeing the situation had calmed down, the armoured old man quickly beckoned at Ye Qingyu. The two quickly rowed, wanting to depart from this area.</p>
 <p>Another two hours passed by.</p>
 <p>The waves of the ocean had became larger.</p>
 <p>The little raft was like a leaf in the ocean. There was the possibility of it capsizing at any moment.</p>
 <p>The complexion of the middle-aged swordsman was pale and white.</p>
 <p>Everyone had an misfortunate feeling in their hearts.</p>
 <p>They had travelled near twenty hours on the surface of the ocean. But they still could not see any signs of any shore. No one knew whether there was even a shore waiting to greet all of them, or would they eternally be lost and drift around in this sea?</p>
 <p>Thankfully, in the entire process, the monster beneath did not appear again.</p>
 <p>"Look, what is that?"</p>
 <p>The armoured old man exclaimed.</p>
