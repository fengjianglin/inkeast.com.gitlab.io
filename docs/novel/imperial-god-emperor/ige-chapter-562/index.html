 <p>Chapter 562, Dare not to kill you?</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu realized that he had made the same mistake as Liu Yuanchang, ignoring the real value of the [Cloud Top Cauldron].&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Thinking of how the [Cloud Top Cauldron] so effortlessly withstood the Moon Wheel’s attack, Ye Qingyu looked at Chen Shaohua who was shrouded in the light shield of the Sun Wheel. An idea came to mind.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>So then, all the people around the floating peaks saw a scene that made them flabbergasted——</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>They only saw Ye Qingyu gently raising his hand, reaching out to hold the ancient cauldron above his head, like a big hammer, and lightly weighed it in his hand. It seemed that it was not too heavy. Then he carried this huge [Cloud Top Cauldron] and walked over to where Chen Shaohua was with a smile on his face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Chen Shaohua panicked for a moment. &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>But the next moment he soon calmed down, “Tian Huang, you... what do you want to do? I have the Sun Wheel to protect my body, what can you do to me!”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Oh, the unbreakable Sun Wheel right. Today I will break it in front of you!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Finished speaking, Ye Qingyu swung up the [Cloud Top Cauldron], fiercely striking Chen Shaohua.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He treated the giant cauldron as a weapon, directly smashing toward Chen Shaohua.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Clang!&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>A deafening sound rang.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Chen Shaohua could only feel his body shaking all over, a terrifying power penetrating even through the light shield of the Sun Wheel, shaking him to the point that his organs felt as though they were shattering to pieces, before everything darkened in front of him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Clang clang clang!&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu did not stop, repeatedly pounding the [Cloud Top Cauldron] at him three more times.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>With each strike, the Sun Wheel's dazzling golden light dimmed down a bit.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Pff!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Chen Shaohua spurted out a jet of blood.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He realized the situation was looking bad, his face grew terrified, and was going to say something, but Ye Qingyu did not allow him the opportunity. He swung the [Cloud Top Cauldron] again.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Clang!&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Clang!&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Clang!&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Another three continuous pounding sounds.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The golden brilliance around the Sun Wheel was so dim that it was almost invisible, and the dragon-shaped formation on the shield was being broken inch by inch. &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“No... no... you...” Chen Shaohua, who was already deathly pale, opened his mouth wide to scream.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Before his voice fell.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Snap.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>A clear sound came, as though glass were shattered.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>And then——&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Boom!&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>In the midst of a muffled sound, there was something exploding.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The light shield around Chen Shaohua finally issued a mournful wail, unable to bear the power, bursting into fragments. Cracks began to spread across the Sun Wheel as it fell before Chen Shaohua.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu stopped.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He dragged the giant cauldron with one hand and stepped on Chen Shaohua's chest with his foot, “What? Now tell me, can I break your Sun Wheel?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Chen Shaohua's face was as pale as dying embers.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>A feeling of defeat and physical injury made him unable to accept the outcome in the first instance. &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Raising his head to look at Tian Huang, Chen Shaohua was very angry and resentful. He almost lost all his reasoning ability. His heart was blazing wildly, he clasped his chest and howled with laughter, “Haha, Tian Huang, so what if you defeated me? Haha, do you dare to kill me? If you kill me, Greater One Sect will not let you live!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Is Greater One Sect that powerful?” Ye Qingyu slowly raised the giant cauldron into the air,“I will kill you, no one can protect you.”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Chen Shaohua looked up to the sky as he was trampled by Ye Qingyu, the giant cauldron was swung higher and higher, blocking the sun's rays and leaving him in darkness.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>If this cauldron really pounded down, let alone a person, even iron would most likely be smashed into iron paste.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Chen Shaohua gritted his teeth.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He did not believe that Tian Huang would really kill him on such an occasion.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>In the distance.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>On the Greater One Sect's floating peak.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Great Hua Peak master suddenly rose to his feet.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Several other peak masters also had a change of expression on their faces.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Standing behind the headmasters, the successors also had a fierce look.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Nangong family, Heaven Devastator Demon Sect, the Sky Demon Palace, Heaven Desire Demon Sect, and The Hundred Spirits Sect...</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>All the forces and sects around the Storm Platform had their eyes fixed on the Storm Platform, focused on the giant cauldron held aloft.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu singlehandedly held up the giant cauldron, and seemed to want to smash it down.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>But he had only swung down halfway, when he seemed to have suddenly thought of something, slowly stopped and placed the giant cauldron to one side.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Everyone’s eyes were fixed upon this scene.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The people of Greater One Sect finally breathed a sigh of relief.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Some people of the other sects shook their heads, some sighed and some nodded.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Hahaha, I told you that you won't dare to kill me, hahaha, you coward...” Chen Shaohua wildly laughed. “You think you can uphold justice, you think you are a hero, hahaha, so funny, you are just a coward. Didn't you say you’re going to kill me? Haha, are you not going to avenge old man Xie? Hahaha, what now? You're afraid of attacking, poor thing...”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu lowered his head, looking down at the Great Hua Peak’s successor that was being trampled.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He faintly smiled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Don’t dare to kill you? I think you may be mistaken, I won’t use the cauldron to hit you because I do not want your dirty blood to soil my cauldron.” Ye Qingyu said calmly. “Now I will send you to hell to apologize to those who have been slaughtered by you.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Before his voice died away.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu suddenly exerted force at his feet.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Chen Shaohua stared at him blankly, then extreme fear flickered in the depths of his eyes, but before waiting for him to respond, the terrifying power directly crushed his body into mud. Not one part of his body was preserved. Purple lightning broke out from Ye Qingyu’s foot, utterly destroying Chen Shaohua’s consciousness.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Everything happened in a flash.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>When Ye Qingyu set down the giant cauldron, everyone thought that he held back because he was afraid of killing Chen Shaohua.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>So when he attacked for the second time, almost no one could imagine such a scene.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>So there was no one that could save Chen Shaohua in time.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Around the Storm Platform.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Above all the floating peaks, there was a deathly silence.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Between heaven and earth, there seemed to be only the wind whistling.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Chen Shaohua ruptured into blood mist and fell from the sky, shaking the nerves of countless experts.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>As though he had done something trivial, Ye Qingyu waved his hand and stood to one side, slightly exerting force, to shake away the bloodstain on his foot. He turned his head to look at the giant cauldron, summoning the [Cloud Top Cauldron] back to his dantian. The cauldron continued to quiet down.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>On the Storm Platform, Ye Qingyu indifferently stood in his original place.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The oppressive killing intent and yuan qi vanished.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The blood of Chen Shaohua was being imperceptibly absorbed by the Storm Platform.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The area thousands of miles around the Storm Platform suddenly became extremely quiet, as if time and space had frozen.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>There was not one person in the audience that was not astonished.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>No one expected that this mysterious Tian Huang really dared to kill Great Hua Peak's successor.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>In the distance.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>On the floating peak of the Nangong family.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>A mist of light flickered past the Palace Master’s eyes as he closed the white jade folding fan and whispered to the elders next to him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“This Tian Huang, he is interesting.....”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“From the news of the last few days, the power of this successor of the Thunder and Lightning Sect is very different.”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Yes, and also no. It's just that cauldron that is a little weird.”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Well, it is difficult to distinguish the ranking of the cauldron, but an object that can break the Moon Wheel is not an ordinary object.”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>On the Sky Demon Palace's floating peak.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The Palace Master had a little ruminative smile, while the Spiritual Master Long Jiao bowed down, reporting something.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Thunder and Lightning Sect’s successor Tian Huang? This man, investigate him carefully, and that cauldron.”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Yes.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>On the floating peak of the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The master of the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect was wearing a mask and his expression was concealed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>But in his originally dull and still eyes was a different colour. As he looked to the Storm Platform there was a more elusive meaning.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>And behind him, the successor of the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect, in addition to a trace of appreciation, there was a trace of eagerness and fighting spirit blazing in his eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>It was an expression that a martial artist shows when they see a worthy opponent.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>On the Heaven Desire Demon Sect’s floating peak.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The several graceful gongzis and the beautiful women had already stood up. No one knew what the man had said to make the charming women blush and cover their mouths chuckling, while casting glances at Ye Qingyu out of the corner of their eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Among them, two stunning women simply stared at Ye Qingyu with an undisguised desire.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>On the Hundred Spirits Sect's floating peak.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Eldest senior sister, he... he won.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Liu Ruxin was indescribably shocked.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>She also could not describe what sort of feeling it was, but it was certainly joy more than worry.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Yes... unexpectedly... he won” Like talking in her sleep, Shen Menghua repeated the junior sister’s words.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>After the initial great shock, she had been staring in the direction of Storm Platform, until she gradually calmed down. In addition to the astonishment of Gongzi Tian Huang’s strength, her forehead was creased with worry.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>This Gongzi Tian Huang does not think over what he does.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He had so openly killed Greater One Sect's Great Hua Peak successor, Chen Shaohua, would Greater One Sect really follow the rules of the Storm Platform and not retaliate?</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>But why was it that, after seeing him kill Chen Shaohua regardless of everything, she admired him even more?</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Shen Menghua could not explain her own psychology.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>She looked over to the seniors of the Hundred Spirits Sect, who were conversing in secret code, and on everyone's faces was unconcealable shock.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>And this time, no one knew who started, but discussion gradually began around the floating peak, louder and louder, until the voices resembled the rumbling of spring thunder, engulfing the Storm Platform and simply could not be suppressed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Heavens, he really is dead.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Stomped into smithereens... This Tian Huang really is ruthless.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“How dare he!”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“This enmity will continue, Great Hua Peak's successor is killed, Greater One Sect’s face had been beaten swollen, especially since the Sun and Moon Double Wheel had been summoned and still lost...” &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Oh, I didn’t expect that the successor of the Thunder and Lightning Sect really would kill Chen Shaohua in Greater One Sect's territory.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Guess what kind of reaction will the Greater One Sect have?”</p>
 <p><br></p>
