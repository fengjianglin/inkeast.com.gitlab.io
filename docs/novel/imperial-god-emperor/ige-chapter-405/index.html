 <p>Chapter 405 - This old woman finds you pleasing to the eye</p>
 <p>“You looking for a fight.” Yu Xiaoxing’s cheeks flushed rosy red, saying abruptly, “You know that the matter is not finished... Besides, I didn’t get such good treatment, so how could that be the reason... Oh, yes, when Aunt Heng took me to the ancestral temple to collect herbal ingredients at the medicinal peak, only Aunt Han herself was taking care of you, you...” The princess looked Ye Qingyu over with a suspicious eye. “You really did not wake up at all?”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu nodded. “Of course.”</p>
 <p>“During the time that I wasn’t there, nothing had happened right?” Yu Xiaoxing said in a skeptical tone. “The reason that Aunt Heng took me to pick herbal ingredients, was it to deliberately send me away?”</p>
 <p>“You’re thinking too much?” Ye Qingyu replied, taken aback</p>
 <p>“There must be something strange,” Yu Xingyu said firmly.</p>
 <p>But she couldn’t find any other suspicious points.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu didn’t say anything else.</p>
 <p>[Drunken Immortal Wine] really was too strong, Ye Qingyu did not think that with his current level of cultivation, he would get drunk.</p>
 <p>He vaguely remembered that before he passed out, there was a scene that he saw: white hair, white-clothed Aunt Han was reaching out her hand to touch his head, her eyes were glistening with tears... Was that an illusion that he saw, or did it really happen?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu tried to ask Yu Xiaoxing.</p>
 <p>Yu Xiaoxing stared at him blankly, from her expression it was evident that she did not know about this.</p>
 <p>What’s going on?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was increasingly baffled.</p>
 <p>At that time he clearly remembered that Yu Xiaoxing and that Aunt Heng were both present.</p>
 <p>Why would this be.</p>
 <p>This matter disclosed a kind of strangeness.</p>
 <p>And Ye Qingyu faintly felt that in his mind there seemed to be information, but for some reason, he could not grasp the key pieces and put them together. It was as though when something was about to penetrate and break through, but a layer of window paper was in the way.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu could not understand this matter as he thought of it over and over again. In the end, he simply forgot about this matter.</p>
 <p>Since the alcohol of [Drunken Immortal Wine] was still surging within his body, Ye Qingyu sat crossed-legged, exercising his breathing and harmonizing qi, and began refining the alcohol yuan qi in his body.</p>
 <p>The nameless breathing technique was activated.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was about to enter a meditative state, when suddenly he realized that his mind seemed to be... there seemed to be something more.</p>
 <p>“That’s...”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was astonished.</p>
 <p>It was two bright balls of light that suddenly jumped into his mind while he was operating the nameless breathing technique.</p>
 <p>What’s going on?</p>
 <p>There was something in his mind that he did not even know?</p>
 <p>Vaguely, Ye Qingyu felt that this may be related to Aunt Han. When her hands touched his head, she probably quietly did something...</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu’s eyes shot open. “That Aunt Han’s strength, is it very terrifying?”</p>
 <p>Yu Xiaoxing firmly nodded. “If Aunt Han’s strength is not strong, how could she develop the [Demonic Zither]?”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu said, “I don’t know much about the [Demonic Zither].”</p>
 <p>“All right.” Yu Xiaoxing rubbed her forehead, saying, “[Three Thousand Feet of White Hair] is one of the four greatest weapons of the Empire. The [Demonic Zither] is one of the other three, you should have seen the power of the [Three Thousand Feet of White Hair]. You almost used it instantly to kill Du Heng, but the [Three Thousand Feet of White Hair] I gave you is just a replica of the real weapon, so you should understand the power of [Demonic Zither], right?”</p>
 <p>“Replica?” Ye Qingyu exclaimed in shock.</p>
 <p>Xing’er said in a firm tone, “Of course, if it is authentic, how could I give it to you? And even if I want to give you the real one, with my status, even I can’t get the real [Three Thousand Feet of White Hair].”</p>
 <p>“That’s... you’re right.” Ye Qingyu nodded.</p>
 <p>Of course, before he had also been wondering that if he really had one of the greatest treasures of the empire, then he should have been able to use it more than once, and it should not have fallen into his hands so easily.</p>
 <p>“You’ve come to the imperial capital for a while now, you should have heard about the [Divine Dragon List]?” Xing’er asked again.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu nodded.</p>
 <p>The [Divine Dragon List] is one of the major lists of the imperial capital, which ranks the real top martial artists, and saying that it is a ranking for the strongest of the Human Race also wasn’t an exaggeration.</p>
 <p>“Aunt Han by herself can sweep away all experts of the [Divine Dragon List].” Xing’er added.</p>
 <p>“How could that be possible?” Ye Qingyu jumped up.</p>
 <p>This piece of information was really a bit too shocking.</p>
 <p>Those on the [Divine Dragon List] were real top-ranked experts, there were even a lot of Ascending Heaven existences that could be called old monsters and old demons. They have been famous for so many years, a mention of any one of them could make a child cry. Yu Xiaoxing said that Aunt Han can sweep away these evil-doers.</p>
 <p>“Haha, look at your face, the things you don’t know, there are many,” Xing’er said proudly. “Without my Aunt Han, Snow Empire would not have had smoothly established the empire.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu did not speak, and just quietly listened.</p>
 <p>The matters were getting more and more mysterious.</p>
 <p>“Of course, to be exact, the reason the Yu clan can sweep away people from all sides, crush the major sects and top martial artists of the era of sects, was because of that invincible War God uncle. But without Aunt Han, there wouldn’t be that War God uncle...” Yu Xiaoxing looked more and more complacent, but the more she said the more puzzled he was.</p>
 <p>As she was speaking, a golden armoured guard came over, whispering something in Yu Xiaoxing’s ear.</p>
 <p>The expression on Yu Xiaoxing’s face slightly changed, she said a few words to Ye Qingyu before turning away and went into the cabin of the ship.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu waved his hand and did not say anything else.</p>
 <p>War God uncle?</p>
 <p>What does that mean?</p>
 <p>Was it that legendary invincible War God?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu shook his head. He felt that the matters of the imperial family Yu clan really were too secretive.</p>
 <p>Since Yu Xiaoxing was gone, there was no way Ye Qingyu could solve all the question on his mind. He sat at the bow of the ship by himself for a while, operated the nameless breathing technique, and immersed in the state of cultivation, to see the two mysterious bright balls of light that inexplicably appeared in his mind.</p>
 <p>The sea of divine knowledge of a martial artist was as boundless as the stars of the universe.</p>
 <p>The two balls of bright light, like two huge stars, were suspended in the endless sky.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu carefully separated out a wisp of divine thought, attempting to touch one of the balls of light.</p>
 <p>The second the divine thought touched the light, it suddenly ruptured, silently splitting into several specks of light, twinkling in the void of knowledge.</p>
 <p>Startled, Ye Qingyu was cautious and alert.</p>
 <p>The countless bright specks of light were constantly fluttering and flashing, constantly combining and arranging in order, as if they had life and were changing into something.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu held his breath in deep concentration.</p>
 <p>Gradually he came to understand.</p>
 <p>The specks of light were changing into some kind of handwriting.</p>
 <p>After a short moment, all the specks of light had finished changing.</p>
 <p>Thousands of flowing words were appearing in the void of the sea of knowledge.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyy blankly looked at the four characters at the top——</p>
 <p>[Divine Emperor Sword Mantra].</p>
 <p>This was the [ivine Emperor Sword Mantra]?</p>
 <p>[Divine Emperor Sword Mantra] technique that was known as the three Greatest Sword Techniques?</p>
 <p>Before the specks of light had finished changing, Ye Qingyu thought of countless possibilities, but had not thought of this.</p>
 <p>Right now Ye Qingyu was basically certain that the two large balls of light in his mind were definitely because the white hair white-clothed beauty Aunt Han used some supreme ability to penetrate into his sea of knowledge——If, as Yu Xiaoxing had said, this Aunt Han was a master that can crush the top experts, she could have easily done this.</p>
 <p>The problem was that, why would she be so nice to him at their first meeting?</p>
 <p>She not only let him drink a jar of [Drunken Immortal Wine], but also gave him the [Divine Emperor Sword Mantra]?</p>
 <p>Although Ye Qingyu had always felt that his luck was good, wasn’t this sort of luck too unbelievable?</p>
 <p>The Three Great Sword Mantras were known as the pinnacle absolute mantras of the Sword Dao. It was absolutely a martial treasure that could be enough to cause the entire Heaven Wasteland Domain to fight and shed rains of blood for it. Even the current Snow Emperor would not be able to obtain such an item, how could Aunt Han have it in her hands? And for her to give it to him?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu had many questions in his mind.</p>
 <p>Then he attempted to separate a wisp of divine thought to touch the other ball of light.</p>
 <p>But as he was approaching the second ball of light, there was a gentle force pushing him away.</p>
 <p>“The three major sword techniques complement one another. Little fellow, your present strength is not enough to peek into the mystery of the [Life Sword Mantra]. Don’t be too greedy.”</p>
 <p>A familiar voice sounded in Ye Qingyu’s mind.</p>
 <p>It was Aunt Han.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu heard clearly. This voice was the voice of that Aunt Han, he was sure of it.</p>
 <p>“Senior? Can you perceive the activity of my sea of knowledge?” Ye Qingyu was startled, hurriedly asked.</p>
 <p>“Haha, little fellow, do you think I shouldn’t have peeked at your sea of knowledge? I shouldn’t be peeking at your secret? Are you angry? Haha, there’s no use in being angry. I, this old woman, have read all your memories, there’s no secret anymore.” Aunt Han’s voice was filled with a kind of delight.“To tell you the truth, it is just a wisp of divine thought, it can’t do anything to you, but if you encounter any danger in the future, I can come to your help in time.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu did not know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
 <p>This was the style of Aunt Han.</p>
 <p>From her words, there was no doubt that the second ball of light contained the [Life Sword Mantra] of the three major sword techniques.</p>
 <p>“Senior’s generous gift, I am really scared, why is senior so generous to me?” Ye Qingyu was also unsure of his current mood.</p>
 <p>“I, this old woman, finds you pleasing to the eye, haha. After so many years, I finally have a pleasing toy... Well, don’t ask, I, this old woman, am going to play the zither now. I have no time for you. First practice your martial arts well, you think you’re already very strong by reaching the Bitter Sea stage in one year, right? I’ll tell you, your cultivation level is still far away, I can kill tens of thousands of you with one finger, not to mention those people... Pleh pleh pleh, almost blurted it out.” ——</p>
