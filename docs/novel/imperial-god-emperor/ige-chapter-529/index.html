 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu was simply speechless.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, in Ye Qingyu’s mind, this Old Fish was almost equal to a scoundrel.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t talk nonsense, quickly look, see if you can erase the consciousness mark of the bearded man.” &nbsp;Ye Qingyu could not bother with his nonsense anymore and spoke in an impolite manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If his mind was not trapped in the [Cloud Top Cauldron], and his consciousness drastically weakened, Ye Qingyu could have erased the drop of consciousness within that Greater One notice himself. Would he needed to ask the Old Fish?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Fish smiled, and with one brief, casual touch easily wiped away the consciousness of the bearded man on the Greater One notice, grinning as he handed it back over.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Fish evidently enjoyed seeing such an expression on Ye Qingyu’s face. He replied triumphantly, “The consciousness of a little trash of the Bitter Sea boundary, how much time does it need? No need to be so surprised! Although I said that I had sustained a Dao injury, but that does not mean that I cannot fight with that person, nor does it represent that I cannot use some consciousness techniques. I have been trapped in the bucket for more than 1 million years, besides healing the Dao injury, I have been cultivating my consciousness. Hey, in this current world, there is no one’s consciousness that can be compared to mine.”&nbsp;</span></p>

He slightly observed it for a moment, obtaining the information on it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This notice offered the reward of 100 kilograms of Origin crystal and the acceptance of joining the Greater One Sect. And it also detailed some of the so-called ruthless crimes of Ye Qingyu, including the raping and killing of three female disciples of the Greater One Sect’s Clear Lotus Peak. It portrayed Ye Qingyu as an ignorant and brutal monster of a lower domain who will commit any crimes. But also further directed the enemy’s crime at Heaven Wasteland Domain, vaguely insinuating the fact that the people of Heaven Wasteland Domain were also devil-like villains from Hell. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Interesting... they have an ulterior motive.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Greater One Sect wanted to invade Heaven Wasteland Domain?</span></p>

The principal was going to hold a so-called Sword Storm meeting, to gather various masters and experts at Greater One Sect’s Lotus Flower Eight Petals Peak, in order to discuss a major event.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Greater One notice could be considered as an invitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course these were not the only invitations. The real major forces and sects received a more refined and formal invitation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I was just about to find Xing’er, then better take advantage of this opportunity to sneak into Greater One Sect. What bullshit Sword Storm gathering, it is just a meeting to discuss how to invade Heaven Wasteland Domain, then I better go and mess things up.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu secretly pondered in his mind. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a brief thought, he handed this Greater One notice to Old Fish, “Didn’t you just brag that your consciousness is unparalleled? Then I’ll give this to you, first let it recognize the owner, then with it, we can sneak into Greater One Sect, and kick up a storm.” The reason why he did not drop his own blood was because Ye Qingyu was worried that Greater One Sect would be able to, through this notice, detect his whereabouts. After all, a major influential sect like Greater One Sect surely would possess all kinds of secret techniques.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Fish’s eyes suddenly opened wide, a look of excitement across his face as he impatiently replied, “Haha, good, youngster, I really did not misread you, you have the courage, you wilfully go up a mountain despite knowing there are tigers... Hey, I can enjoy some lively, fun atmosphere again.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu, “...”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu smiled, “Flowing Light City is the final big city that leads to Greater One Sect on Fragrant Plains, and also the transport hub of various places. There is no harm to staying here for the time being, we will surely be able to hear a lot of news, that way we can prepare easily, prepare a huge gift for Greater One Sect. Then when the moment comes, we shall deliver it to the door and let them have a good time.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Youngster, I feel that you have lots of evil tricks.” Old Fish’s cross eyes shot a glance at Ye Qingyu from sideways, then continued with a smile, “But, I admire you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now the entire Clear River Domain had heard of the famous name of Ye Qingyu, even a lot of ordinary people had also heard of the news that a foreign domain barbarian had defiled several fairies of the Greater One Sect, which is like a direct, merciless slap to the face of the Lord-like sect of the Human Race of this domain. And this sort of news was constantly being spread around with a more exaggerated version every day.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But what Ye Qingyu and Old Fish had not expect was that, although Demon King Ye was clearly situated in Flowing Light City, there was still constantly news about him burning, killing, robbing and raping women circulating around.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, did you hear, that lower domain barbarian is causing trouble again, the daughter of the sect master of Golden Spear Sky Sect was defiled.”&nbsp;</span></p>

These mysterious murals could greatly enhance the power of Ye Qingyu’s consciousness. During this long period of time, Ye Qingyu persevered, and the degree of the power of his consciousness, compared to that of before, had increased five or six times, which was comparable to some Heaven Ascension experts. Unfortunately, the majority of the power of his consciousness was still trapped in that mysterious space of the copper cauldron, unable to get out.&nbsp;</span></p>

The stream in the sea of bitterness was also more and more massive, the vast expanse of ocean had stars, his real yuan qi strength was much more vigorous than that of many peak Bitter Sea experts.&nbsp;</span></p>

He said twitching his mouth, “The scale of Greater One Sect is little, but their arrogance is not small. But this mountain range and terrain is quite interesting, looks like the ancestors of Greater One Sect should be very able people. Connecting the luck of the sect to the spiritual veins of this piece of land, it is a pity that these younger disciples have narrow vision. In order to pursue beauty and imposing style, they disorderly repaired and built buildings, destroying the most original layout. Hey, the foundations that the old ancestors left are almost all destroyed.”</span></p>

It is a very clever technique, the three forces - heaven, earth and man complement one another,” Old Fish said irritably. “The location of Greater One Sect is surrounded by beautiful mountains, clear waters and picturesque scenery, as a result there are many talents, many disciples. But the original spiritual veins formed along with the land had been forcibly divided into eight by these idiotic trashes. The eight peaks of Greater One Sect compete against one another, which seems to enhance the competitiveness of the sect, but in fact weakens the feng shui of the geographical location, disperses the spiritual qi of the location and accumulates heterogeneous qi. So I can conclude that the Greater One Sect, in spite of its number of disciples, the qualities of disciples are uneven. The most important thing is that, look at the landscape, what do you see? In the Southwest direction isn’t there often a mass of dark clouds, hehe, that is not a gathering of mist but malignant qi...” &nbsp;</span></p>

Sigh, our sect practices the power of thunder and lightning as our main technique, and master, in order to pursue the mystery of thunder and lightning of the Thunder and Lightning Emperor, revived our Thunder and Lightning Sect. He often puts himself in danger by practicing during a storm. Perhaps because he had suffered too many strikes of lightning, so his brain is a bit abnormal. He often thinks that he is a friend of Thunder and Lightning Emperor His Highness, and that he has lived for millions of years... Brother Liu, please forgive him.”&nbsp;</span></p>

Within seconds, as it came closer, the hundreds of figures on this mass of golden cloud were finally discernible. There were golden dragon horses roaring in the vault of heaven. The long roar resembling the growl of the divine dragon, echoing between the heavens and the earth, in the most imposing manner. The dragon horses’ body was dressed in gold armour, and sitting astride them were gold knights wielding gold spear banners. The clatter of horse hooves sounded as though they would shatter the sky. &nbsp;</span></p>

It is said that the military strength of Nangong’s Golden Dragon horse corps is comparable to a dragon. And had once destroyed the Ancient Demon Sect. Now that I’ve seen it with my own eyes, it really is terrifying.”</span></p>

They are directly allowed up the Greater One Peak. Us people were unwelcomed, and only allowed at the foothills, and not even halfway up the mountain.” The Old Fish deliberately stated loudly in the middle of the crowd. “Sigh, we came all the way, but Greater One Sect treated us like that, it really makes one feel bitterly disappointed.”</span></p>
