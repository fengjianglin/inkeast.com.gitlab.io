 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because before coming to Greater One Sect, he had already disguised himself a little bit. At this time his appearance was completely different from before. He looked like a big eyed and thick browed youngster, so he was not afraid of Xiao Yunlong and others recognizing him. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And Xiao Yunlong and the others really did not notice the fact that this big eyed and thick browed youngster was the Ye Qingyu that they had been chasing after. Under the leadership of Han Qi, the three people came over, and under countless watchful gazes, headed straight towards the handsome and elegant youngster, and extremely respectfully bowed. Their attitude was rarely polite and modest. Han Qi smiled and said, “I didn’t know Young Emperor is coming, please excuse Greater One Sect for not going out to meet you, just now a disciple reported to me, and we hurriedly rushed over to greet you, Young Emperor please forgive us.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The handsome and elegant youngster smiled lightly, “Don’t worry, I am having a good time here with friends.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Han Qi hastily added, “I can’t allow that, Young Emperor has a noble status, how can you be stranded here, please follow me to rest at Greater One Peak.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The handsome young man slowly stood up, patted the grass strands off his body, stored away the wine jar that Ye Qingyu had just gifted him and said, “I met some new friends today, we are drinking and chatting merrily, I don’t want to go to Greater One Peak to join in the fun, how should I address Elder?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am Greater One Sect’s Han Qi, these two are...” Han Qi from the beginning had behaved very humbly and politely. He introduced Xiao Yunlong and Zuo Li to the handsome and elegant youngster. “</span></p>

Tell Song Liren that when the meeting starts, I’ll show up on time,” the handsome and elegant youngster said indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Song Liren was the name of the current sect master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had been a long time ever since someone dared to say this name out loud in public. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How dare you, how dare you address the Greater One Sect’s sect master by his name.” Xiao Yunlong, with a trace of pride and contempt on his face, interrupted, “Even if you’re the successor of the Immortal God Emperor Sect, still should not be so arrogant to call the sect master by his name. Even the sect master of the Immortal God Emperor Sect himself also has to call him Daoist friend...” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Immortal God Emperor Sect? &nbsp;</span></p>

The onlookers also could not hold back gasping in surprise, and then the gazes in the dark that were fixed on the handsome man were immediately added with all kinds of shock, respect, awe and other various expressions. It was evident that these five words had a special weight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, for Ye Qingyu, he was an outsider and did not know the history and glory of the Immortal God Emperor Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the contrary, Liu Shaji and Hu Bugui seemed much calmer than Ye Qingyu, which indicated that they were already aware of the true identity of the handsome youngster.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is your identity, to dare say such a thing to me?” The handsome and elegant youngster smiled lightly, looking at Xiao Yunlong, his eyes flashing a strange light that makes one palpitate. His speech, although calm and indifferent, but there was an imposing manner that resembled that of a deity looking down at the mortals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The him at this moment, and the elegant him who was apathetic with everything before, were completely different. Like a rare peerless sword was suddenly unsheathed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Xiao Yunlong said another word, under the crushing impact of this momentum, he immediately no longer dared say a word.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Han Qi saw, he turned and winked at the junior brothers, signalling for them to not talk, and then he himself hurriedly stepped forward, bowing repeatedly, “Two young juniors have little experience and did not know any better, please forgive them... Just that this odd job worker disciple area is not suitable for someone with the status of Your Highness, if the sect elders find out and blame us, we cannot bear such responsibility, please Your Highness don’t make it hard for us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The handsome young man hummed when he heard what was said, but did not speak. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the Great Thief Hu Bugui sneered, “Make it difficult for you? Haha, who are you, what does it has to do with us? That junior brother Xiao of yours is not only inexperienced and not know any better, on the basis of the tone that he spoke to the young emperor of Immortal God Emperor Sect, he should be killed over 1000 times. The rules of the Greater One Sect really are ridiculous.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shut up, what are you?” Xiao Yunlong, who had just admitted his mistake, had anger brewing inside him, and with nowhere to vent his rage. He glowered at Hu Bugui right away, his gaze seemingly as though he wanted to kill. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his opinion, in this odd job worker disciple area, apart from this handsome and elegant youngster that he could not berate because of his special identity, the other people that dared act so arrogant in front of him were stirring up trouble for the Greater One Sect. They were just simply seeking death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A handsome and elegant voice sounded, “I'll introduce you, this is older brother Hu Bugui, as for his name, I think you should have heard of him before.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These words had made Xiao Yunlong expression changed drastically, his face growing pale. His sword-like gaze before faded, his heart palpitating, lowering his head and unable to control the terrified feeling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Zuo Li who had not yet spoken a word was also startled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sloppy and evil man was the infamous Great Thief Hu Bugui?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could this scoundrel have come to this place?&nbsp;</span></p>

How about we head up Greater One Peak together, find a place to continue to chat, what do you think?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Fish very excitedly nodded, “Good, good idea, I also want to go up to see the Greater One Sect’s eight peaks, especially the legendary Greater One Peak, haha.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu was also nodding, “Yes, sounds good, we can see further from above, enjoy an overview of the gathering storm.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The way these people spoke was as though they did not attach any importance to Han Qi and the others, treating as if Greater One Peak was their back garden.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Yunlong and Zuo Li were gnashing their teeth with fury and fear of saying anything else. First putting aside Old Fish, Ye Qingyu and Liu Shaji, who they were not aware of their background yet, only one of the 18 Great Thieves Hu Bugui himself was terrifying enough. This reckless person that would do anything when mad. He was rumoured to have raided Nangong family’s arsenal. Once enraged, the two of them could be easily crushed to death by this lunatic.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Qi hastily agreed as soon as he heard this, “If you guys are willing to accompany Your Highness, that would be great. This way please.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that, he turned and led the way.</span></p>

More than 5,000 years ago, its real name was Immortal God Court, its territory spanned across a wide area, and had almost unified the whole Clear River Domain. Immortal God Court had countless masters, profound foundation, and could be called the best in the world. It was a matchless man-led nation with a long history. Everyone was scared into submission, and in these long years, the rulers of Immortal God Court were all extremely wise and merciful to other races. It can be said that the fact that Clear River Domain was able to reach this level of civilization, Immortal God Court should claim the most credit. They also protected the living beings of Clear River Domain.&nbsp;</span></p>

Many sects that had received protection from the imperial court took advantage of the chance to set up an independent regime. The reign of Immortal God Court came to an end. The final generation of Immortal God Emperor, watching the situation progress uncontrollably, finally declared his abdication and Immortal God Court changed its name to Immortal God Emperor Sect, continuing in the form of a sect. The Immortal God Court gave up on its former capital, and the clan moved to the faraway Weishui mountains, which was established in the ancient times, and basically lived in seclusion.&nbsp;</span></p>

Its descendants were to be respected and protected by the great powers, and if any force dared to make things difficult for Immortal God Emperor Sect, they will suffer the joint attack of all the other powers.&nbsp;</span></p>

Therefore, many large forces had gradually began to ignore the vow of the past. After all, in such a world, strength was all that matters. For example, people like Xiao Yunlong even dared to berate the descendant of the Immortal God Emperor Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
