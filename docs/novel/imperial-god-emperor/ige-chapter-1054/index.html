 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This mission should have been a timely cooperation between the Black Guards of the Demon Race and the White-robed Divine Guards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Black Fish airship of the Demon Race had sealed off the void, and the Black Guards had originally not intended to physically take part in the battle. And although their presence was just for security, Ye Qingyu's sudden appearance turned the tables on them. Now, they had no choice but to interfere.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who do think you are to interfere in the internal matters of the Human Race? You're courting your own death."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Tianfang was enraged and immediately began shouting at the guards.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was already angry about the sudden appearance of the Black Fish airship of the demons, which had sealed off access to the airspace above Blue Cloud Manor, and upon hearing the Black Guards insult Ye Qingyu, the Third Deputy Envoy of the Human Race, in such a manner, the public-spirited Lord of the manor could no longer hold himself back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm Purple Night."</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The expert from the Demon Race stared at Huang Tianfang as he spoke with purple demonic energy circling around him. He looked as though he was staring at a dead man, and he began to laugh coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was the [Demon Sage], Purple Night, one of the six leaders of the Black Guards from the headquarters of the Alliance of Domains.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was an expert from the Demon Race who had entered the Great Saint realm just a year ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over the past year, his name had become very famous in Heaven Connect City. He had progressed even further to reign supreme over the leaders of the White-robed Divine Guards, such as Lin Yutang, Tang Chong, and Fang Bule. His fame led him to gradually become arrogant, and his manner turned extremely vicious. He was known to react vengefully to people who just stared at him, and he even tortured someone who had taken one glance too many at him by removing that person's limbs, eyes, and tongue. He would surely sentence Huang Tianfang to death for speaking to him so impudently, and he would most definitely make this human suffer terribly before allowing him to die.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You're the [Demon Sage], Purple Night?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Tianfang's expression changed a little upon realizing who he was talking to.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had arrived in Heaven Connect City a few years before, but he had mostly remained indoors to train in self-isolation. He had heard of the [Demon Sage's] name but had never seen him before, and he had not expected for Purple Night to lead the Black Guards during this particular mission. All of a sudden, Huang Tianfang began to worry for Ye Qingyu, and he glanced at the deputy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Huang Tianfang, Lord of Blue Cloud Manor? Very well, haha, I'll remember you," the [Demon Sage] replied. He did not physically assault Huang Tianfang, but instead began to laugh coldly. It was best to begin torturing someone mentally, and to only move against them when their mind was broken. Since time was on his side, he could afford to attend to more pressing matters first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thereupon, he continued to laugh coldly as he taunted, "Hehe... Fang Bule, do you want me to help you? Hmm? Have you been scared by this junior of ours so much that you don't even dare to speak now?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, Fang Bule, who was kneeling on the ground, did not dare to even speak a single word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not even a single word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did not even take a single look at the [Demon Sage].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One could just sense the terrible power of Ye Qingyu while being suppressed by the god of death. Fang Bule did not feel that Purple Night, the [Demon Sage], could gain any advantage in a fight with Ye Qingyu, and he did not think that interference from the Black Guards of the Demon Race would change things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A look of sullenness flashed across Purple Night's face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He turned around to face Ye Qingyu. "Ye Qingyu, the Third Deputy Envoy of the Human Race, right? The order to capture Lin Yutang and the others came from the divine temple of the Alliance of Domains. You're merely a Third Deputy Envoy from the Human Race, and an honorary deputy to boot. You have no actual authority, so how dare you defy orders and publicly humiliate a leader of the White-robed Divine Guards! You've committed a heinous crime. Do you still deny that?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a mysterious power contained in his voice, and it was accompanied by the pressure only an expert in the Great Saint realm could produce. It exploded suddenly and shot toward Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A derisive smile appeared on the [Demon Sage]'s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was as if he was already picturing the image of Ye Qingyu being knocked backward clumsily from the force of his attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His smile, however, would eventually freeze on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was because Ye Qingyu remained still in his original spot. Before the mysterious force and Great Saint realm level of pressure could reach him, it strangely dissipated, as if it had been swallowed up by the air around Ye Qingyu. Not a single hair on his head had moved, much less knocked him backward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Huh?" Purple Night said, surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was just about to continue speaking, but all of a sudden he noticed that the corners of Ye Qingyu's lips had curled into a sneer. Before he could even react, a sudden, formless energy wave surged toward him. It instantly made the [Demon Sage] feel pathetic about himself, as if he was just a speck of dust in the vast universe. His vision blurred, and he did not know why but he began to see illusory images of a divine golden dragon raising its five-fingered claw at him. It clawed off his head with one blow, and he nearly screamed in fright. He kept retreating, looking extremely flustered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The image vanished very quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The [Demon Sage] let out a loud yell. A bead of cold sweat flowed down from his forehead, and he seemed to be in extreme panic. Upon further examination, he realized that he had taken dozens of steps backward and that his five subordinates were looking at him in shock and complete disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was standing opposite him with a look of contempt and mockery on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I..."</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Purple Night wanted to speak, but no words would come out of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He already understood that he had wanted to display his power but ended up making a fool of himself instead. He had been suppressed by Ye Qingyu's aura, knocked backward by it, and lost his self-control in public.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could this have happened?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was already in the Great Sage realm and he had long trained his mind and spirit to be impenetrable. He was already at the peak of the martial arts community of the Vast Thousand Worlds, and even experts at the peak of the Great Saint level could not have made him look so bad just by using their aura alone. How did Ye Qingyu manage to do that?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A mysterious technique?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It must be some sort of mysterious technique that targets one's spirit,</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;he thought.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The [Demon Sage] was in shock and anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could have still somehow accepted defeat if Ye Qingyu had forced him to stumble backward in a full-on battle, but he could never accept that he had been defeated just by his aura alone.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the most terrifying aspect of mysterious techniques that targeted the spirit was that they attacked suddenly. As long as one took the necessary precautions in advance, such techniques would not be much of a threat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The [Demon Sage], Purple Night, had already realized this and focused his mind, condensing his spirit as one.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He accused his opponent, but in fact, he was trying to cover for his loss of image just now.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"So, it was a sneak attack."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No wonder..."</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"So his opponent used some secret spirit-targeting technique. It makes sense now."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Comments of sudden realization could be heard all around.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Earlier on, they had watched Purple Night scream and act as if he was insane after Ye Qingyu had sneered at him. It had given every living being on Wuqing street a huge shock. After all, the [Demon Sage] was an expert who had become very famous lately in Heaven Connect City, so Ye Qingyu's power was truly terrifying if he could defeat the [Demon Sage] just by using his aura alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was speechless.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And too lazy to explain it as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pressure generated by a Quasi-emperor was enough to cause an expert at the peak of the Great Saint realm to hallucinate. Even though Ye Qingyu had still not entered the Quasi-emperor realm, he was extremely close to it. The suppressive aura that he had unleashed just now was something that he had picked up after observing Quasi-emperors in battle in the void of the universe. He managed to learn the nuances of aura-channeling, and it was something that was beyond martial artists like Purple Night who had just stepped foot into the Great Saint realm. As such, the [Demon Sage] could only come up with the explanation that Ye Qingyu had used a spirit-targeting mysterious technique.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I can't be bothered to talk nonsense with you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu did not want to waste any more time. His figure blurred, then he appeared in front of Purple Night instantly before punching out at the [Demon Sage].</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Are you trying to court death...? [Deity Submerging Claw]!" Purple Night roared in anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He reacted very quickly. A purplish aura circled around his entire body, and the divine light covering his hands transformed into a set of scaly talons that flashed with a purplish glow. They grabbed hold of Ye Qingyu's fists instantly.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Purple Night was originally a heavenly falcon from the line of dragons before he had attained the Dao. There was natural dragon's blood in his body, and coupled with the fact that he was a descendant of heavenly falcons, his claws were extremely terrifying. He had shredded countless strong martial artists with his talent and sharp talons, and even experts that were stronger than him dared not meet them head-on. The [Demon Sage] laughed loudly after he managed to grab hold of Ye Qingyu's hands and channeled his strength into his talons, intending to grind Ye Qingyu's fists into dust!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Child's play."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu sneered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He then unleashed the might of the [Great Light Dragon Punch].</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bam!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bloody spit and bones flew into the air.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The [Demon Sage's] sharp talons split open instantly, like ceramic that had burst open, and turned into pulpy flesh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The gulf between their martial prowess and comprehension of the realms was simply too huge. Even though Ye Qingyu had purposely kept most of his power in check and not used his Divine Emperor sword will, the talons of the [Demon Sage] had exploded into a bloody mess. He was completely unconcerned about the welfare of his opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Purple Night, however, was in complete shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was so shaken that he forgot about his pain.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In an instant, his mind had turned completely blank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could this happen?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could not accept the result of their fight at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Be careful, my lord."</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the other five Black Guards of the Demon Race reacted and unleashed their strongest powers at the same time while they surrounded Ye Qingyu and tried to save the [Demon Sage] from danger. Waves of demonic energy surged instantly as all five of them leapt into battle. Their weapons glinted as they charged at Ye Qingyu with the force of a storm, as if they wanted to overwhelm and crush him by force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Scram!"</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu shouted as he took a step forward.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Massive yuan qi was unleashed from his body for an instant before being absorbed back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other people on Wuqing street had not sensed anything, but the expression of the five Black Guards changed drastically, and they exclaimed in shock.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In an instant, they felt as though Ye Qingyu was like a deity who had descended upon their world. They realized that their attacks had rebounded off him, and even that rebound contained a huge, magnificent, and uncontrollable force. It shot back toward them with a great unstoppable force, and they were knocked backward through the air, blood spewing out of their mouths. They crashed into a stone tablet erected a long distance away on the street, leaving trails of blood on it, and lay twitching on the ground like dead dogs, their fates unknown.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The [Demon Sage] had just regained his senses at that moment and hastily retreated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You... How dare you harm the Black Guards of the Demon Race..." he shouted, sensing that things were quickly turning south for him and his men.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu took a giant stride forward and appeared before Purple Night in an instant. He kicked the [Demon Sage's] knees, and there was a sickening crunch as Purple Night knelt onto the ground squealing.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm a leader of the Demon Race, you can't..." the [Demon Sage] shouted wildly. He was beginning to feel scared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu gave him a huge slap, knocking a handful of teeth out of the demon's mouth in the process.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blood spewed out of Purple Night's mouth. "You... Do you want to wage war against the Demon Race?" he roared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You aren't fit to represent the entire Demon Race yet," Ye Qingyu replied as he stepped on the demon's chest with one foot, breaking a few of his ribs in the process. He looked down at his opponent and continued in an icy tone, "I should be asking whether you people are planning to wage war against the Human Race instead! You Black Guards of the Demon Race appeared in the sky above Blue Cloud Manor and seized the human White-robed Divine Guards!"</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm acting upon orders..." the [Demon Sage] instinctively tried to explain out of fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu increased the force on his leg, and there was a resounding boom as the body of the [Demon Sage] exploded. Murderous energy circled around him, and he laughed derisively with a chilling expression on his face. "Acting upon orders? Whose orders? Since when did we humans require you demons to interfere in our internal matters? Since you've overstepped your boundaries, you should be prepared to pay. Do you really think that you can bully us humans?"</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No..." Purple Night muttered as his blood qi churned and his body reformed. However, he could still not escape from under Ye Qingyu's foot and he was beginning to become truly afraid now. "This is a misunderstanding," he continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Misunderstanding?" Ye Qingyu laughed. "We humans will never stand being humiliated. Since you dared to cause such a misunderstanding, I shall 'misunderstand' you once as well."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He then caused the [Demon Sage's] body to explode into a bloody mess again.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Purple Night roared in indignation; he was being completely humiliated. He expended some of his origin yuan qi to reform his body again before continuing in a trembling voice, "I will retreat... The Black Guards of the Demon Race will retreat and act as though this matter never happened... Let's forget about today's incident, and the headquarters of the Demon Race at the Alliance of Domains won't pursue you to take responsibility for your actions today. We should end this now."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Retreat now?" Ye Qingyu replied as he shook his head cruelly. "I disagree."&nbsp;</span></p>
