But when he was about to fight the great disaster of the Human Race, to fight against those Fiendgods, even he did not have absolute confidence. He could only leave his legacy behind, and give the Great Dao cultivation technique to him. He said that the Inspiration King could look at it and cultivate in it. He hoped that the [Ultimate Lightning Enlightenment] would be able to heal the Dao wound of the Inspiration King. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; In these hundred of thousands of years, the Inspiration King had also looked and pondered over this Emperor manual.

In the most intricate core contents, it was absolutely the same. It was only that some of the more surface level moves had been altered slightly. And this sort of alteration was what had perhaps caused the originally extremely complex introductory piece to be easy to understand and comprehend. It was even more suitable for someone who did not have any prior foundation in cultivation.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was not possible for a third copy to exist.</span></p>

But it was a pity, because of various reasons they had no way of entering in this store rom. Although through the words of this person, the Inspiration King knew everything that had happened in the outside world. He knew that the Lightning Emperor had managed to turn the situation around, and managed to settle down the situation for the Human Race to continue and reproduce. But in a blink, like a shooting star falling, he disappeared from the world, with no traces at all. And in this world, there was no longer the legacy of the Lightning Emperor remaining.</span></p>

That's not right, your family name is Ye, not Qin. If you really were the descendant of the Lightning Emperor, as one of the descendants of a Great Emperor, it would be impossible for you to change your family's name... Could it be that one of the ancestors of this young man had great fortune, and discovered another Great Emperor Dao manual that Little Ming left behind in some other location, so you were... That's impossible. If the ancestor of that young man really discovered Little Ming's Dao manual, then he would most likely instantly ascend, and create an incomparable Empire. Even if his talent and fortune was limited, and had no way of creating a new Empire, but he could absolute run rampant in an area. After all, it's the cultivation technique of a Great Emperor. But this little fellow is as down as a dog. He doesn't look like the son or disciple of a rampant Empire at all?”</span></p>

His ability in investigating and observing was already at a master's level. Just by looking at Ye Qingyu, he could largely approximate his background.

The Inspiration King became serious and was filled with curiosity towards Ye Qingyu.</span></p>

After you remember it, you can go compare it with your so called nameless breathing technique. Then you will know how similar it is.

Even the ancient soul that was slumbering deep within the Snow Dragons den had once said that the nameless breathing technique was mysterious and abnormal. It seemed ordinary, but it went from shallow to deep. It contained incomparably profound essences, and was a rare cultivation technique. It seemed that it was especially created for someone with no fate like Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu nodded his head.</span></p>

It was not hard to remember even at the start, and adding to this, he had a photographic memory, and his power of memorization was abnormal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Good.

The same words were significantly different from his first recital, there was an even deeper and profound meaning being stated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu did not dare tarry, and immediately concentrated and listened.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; In his mind, the nameless breathing technique and this entry level Dao manual piece began consolidating slowly. The core essence of the nameless breathing technique became even more complete, and the complex and difficult to comprehend sections of the entry level Dao manual gradually became clearer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ye Qingyu felt as if he had received the impact of listening to the Dao, and was able to experience an unprecedented world.</span></p>

After a long period of time, he then said breathlessly, "You brat... at least you have a conscience."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Even what he referred to him had changed. Previously, he had referred to him as friend. Although this seemed respectful, in reality, there was a distance between them. Now he called him 'you brat'. The relationship between them had instantly gotten a lot closer, as if he was berating one of his juniors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "How is elder?"

The second recital just now was the insight I had towards pondering deep in the [Ultimate Lightning Enlightenment] for the hundreds of thousands of years. You go and comprehend yourself. But you don't have to treat it as the golden principle. After all, everyone has their own martial path. If you want to walk your own Emperor's path, then you need to walk your own road. Walking the road of your predecessors is only just copying.”</span></p>

It was the personal voice of the Lightning Emperor when he left. He used a secret technique to imprint it into my own soul. I can only release this once in my entire life..." The Old Fish rested for a while, recovering his breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Hearing this, a thought suddenly occurred to Ye Qingyu. He said, “Elder, can you please wait. For the third recital, can we change the location?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Inspiration King was taken aback, "Why so?"</span></p>

I want to wait until my understanding of the entry level Dao manual has deepend, before hearing the personal recital of the Lightning Emperor. After all, it's the words from a Great Emperor. This opportunity is precious, I don't want to waste it in a state where I am unprepared." Ye Qingyu smiled, then hesitated and asked again, "Elder, when the Lightning Emperor left his words behind, did he say that only one person could listen to it?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "He did not, what does your question mean?" The Inspiration King suddenly achieved Ye Qingyu's plan. "Could it be that you want to..."</span></p>
