He had unmatched power and authority, nearly ruling over the entire Imperial Court of the Empire.

The Left Minister, Qu Hanshan did not seem to mind the mockery of the Right Minister in the least. As opposed to this, it was like he was greeting an old friend. With a faint smile, "the things that you have done may have caused too great a disturbance."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Lin Zheng suddenly smiled, "Qu Hanshan, you should not have came.

There was disdain in the gaze of Lin Zheng. "Qu Hanshan, do you know what I don't like most about you?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Qu Hanshan had a faint smile, "Please advise me."</span></p>

You have to act as if you are a saint every minute, every second." The Right Minister, Lin Zheng, continued to sneer. "The way of heaven is in the heavens, the way of man is in the mortal world. From the heavens to the earth, everyone is competing. Even you are competing, so why are you pretending to be a high and almighty immortal separate from the mortal world. Just who are you fooling." &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Lin Zheng said, the main point on the word 'compete'.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The authority and status he had today was famed and feared. This was all something that he had competed for from the impossible. He competed with the heavens, with the earth, with time, with people. In the impression of many people, the Right Minister was as leisurely and idle as an old man. But once his heart to compete was aroused, he was like a peerless sword being unsheathed, making someone have no way of receiving him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Such words coming out from his mouth was like the righteousness of the Dao. No one was able to refute his words in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Qu Hanshan frowned, then nodded his head. "I know."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Since it is like this, then act. You and I have competed on the open and in the shadows for so many years, it must have been hard for you to endure and remain standing. In these years, I have competed with so many people, but you are still able to stand on your own footing. Although I find you annoying, but I cannot help but regard you in a new light." Right Minister Lin Zheng walked towards Qu Hanshan step by step. Between his brows, there was an aura of sentimentality, "Let the grievances between us, end today."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; “Since killing intent has been aroused in your heart, then perhaps today is really an ending. But this is not my personal grievance, but for the greater good of the Empire," Qu Hanshan said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Lin Zheng sneered, "With your personality, you rarely do anything that you are not sure of. You evidently know you are not my opponent, but you still appeared. That is just going to your death. You must have found some underlings, tell them to appear."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The complexion of Qu Hanshan instantly became strange.</span></p>

It turned into a hundred-meter-long formation sword qi, with tight and clustered formations encircling it. The might of it was enough to shock the heavens, and everywhere the sword qi passed by, the air was like butter, being cut apart, splitting the air rumbling apart into two. The point where this sword qi pointed at was namely at the Right Minister, Lin Zheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The complexion of Lin Zheng suddenly changed.</span></p>

There was a wind and snow long sword in his hand, and the move of his sword was like a rumble of thunder. The figure instantly neared inches from Lin Zheng, completely sealing him off.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "So it was the arrival of the Old Commander."</span></p>

He stood alone in the air, and struck out with hundreds of palms strikes. It constantly struck again and again on the sword move that was like a bolt of lightning, choosing to face against it directly. It was like heavenly fire striking against an ice mountain, sparks and ice flying everywhere. There was the repeated sounds of explosions, as the air around was shattered and reformed, with a storm beginning to form.</span></p>

His appearance was like a mighty tiger, with pure yellow hair, standing up like needles. His eyebrows were yellow and filled with a red light, as if there was a blood-coloured fierce qi that was like real surrounding him. As both his eyes opened and closed, there was a glimmer fluctuating.</span></p>

In his expression, there was a slight respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Although he did not regard the Left Minister, Qu Hanshan, who walked carefully and came to his position step by step from a poor background with high regards, but this was different for the Commander. For this was a legend amongst the military of the Empire. He was one of the great existences of the army, the old Commander Li Guangbi. Lin Zheng was evidently extremely courteous. After all, whether it was his identity or status, or the effect he had on the Imperial military, he was first class. Although they were on different sides, but he maintained a suitable respect for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; For Li Zheng, from the top to the bottom of the entire Empire, there was not many people worthy of his respect, or could be counted with one's hands just who deserved his respect. But Old Commander Li Guangbi, was definitely one of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Useless words, I rely on my temper to stay alive. Treacherous minister, receive my sword."</span></p>

The sword move struck out once again, sword shadows completely covering the skies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "For the contributions that you have made for the Empire in the past, and as I am your junior, I will first let you have three moves." Lin Zheng's figure flickered, evading sword after sword but not striking back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Qu Hanshan by the side lifted his hand, a ruler held in it.</span></p>

The mirage of a tiger's claw protected his hand, and it was as if it struck something. With a bang, in the air a white-coloured ruler appeared. Instantly, there was a fierce wind that was created, as the fragments of space along with chaotic turbulence appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The next instant, Qu Hanshan once again struck out with his ruler from far away.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The attacking methods of Qu Hanshan was extremely strange. It was evident that the movements of the ruler was hundreds of meters away, but the attack instantly descended without any signs or sound five meters next to Lin Zheng. If it was a normal person, they would have no way of detecting the arrival of that attack. If a solid strike was struck, even if it was a Heaven Ascension stage expert that was hit by it, they would spit out a mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; After Li Guangbi had made three moves, there was a light that ferociously exploded from the eyes of Lin Zheng. His aura surged, as he began to retaliate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; A white coloured tiger light image appeared on his shoulder.</span></p>

It would either strike out with its claws, or perhaps open its mouth and spit out silver blades, coordinating with Lin Zheng. It was completely at a state of perfect cooperation with no flaws. The tail of the white light tiger was two meters long, and constantly changed position. Every attack that struck within one meter of Lin Zheng would be blocked by the tail of this white light tiger.&nbsp;</span></p>

The effects of it was incredible, and was beyond the imagination of normal people. According to the rumours, if a Bitter Sea stage expert donned the [White Tiger Armour], even he would have the power to fight with a Heaven Ascension stage expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu originally thought that the so called [White Tiger Armour] was the same asany other Treasured tool]. It was also of the armour type. But from the current situation, he had thought of this too simply. As a Tool of Fate of the Empire, it was evident that the [White Tiger Armour] had already gained intelligence. Coordinating with Lin Zheng, its power was multiplied.</span></p>
