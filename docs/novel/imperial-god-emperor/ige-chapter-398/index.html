 <p>Translator Note: I've double checked the raws and the sites - it seems the author has made an error in numbering the chapters. So the numbering system jumps from 379 -&gt;&gt;&gt;398. The story continues, just a mistake in numbering. However I will have to keep it consistent with the raws,&nbsp;so apologies for the discontinuity in the numbering system.</p>
 <p>Chapter 398 - Do you think I can pull out this blade?</p>
 <p>Waves of imposing manner were swelling within Ye Qingyu, rising little by little. It was as though a fierce demon beast that had been imprisoned for thousands of years was finally freed, completely hysterical!</p>
 <p>“Roar!”</p>
 <p>All of the people saw the inside of that invisible void, the two imposing auras were forming into a vortex, spinning rapidly, fighting against each other, frantically colliding against each other, and tearing at each other. Blood and flesh splattered about and dyeing the skies red!</p>
 <p>That imposing aura that was a hindrance to Ye Qingyu’s movement instantaneously shattered into pieces!</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu, at this moment, seemed to have changed to another person. An unprecedented power broke out from him, the surrounding flow of air rumbling like a waterfall gushing down, and from his body exuded an overbearing imposing aura that made the people feel he was possessed by the god of war. Nothing could stand against him!</p>
 <p>[Limitless Divine Way], [First Limit]!</p>
 <p>Once the [Limitless Divine Way] was activated, it would subvert even the heavenly way!</p>
 <p>With the current strength of Ye Qingyu and the explosive state of the [First Limit] of the [Limitless Divine Way], his battle strength had doubled. The strength that he possessed now would make even a top expert of the River stage of the Bitter Sea stage &nbsp;have second thoughts. His fist that was flooding with explosive power, suddenly struck at Xiao Lou’s terrifying purple gold sheath!</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>In the instant the two forces collided, an overbearing strength suddenly exploded out. The entire restricted void was wildly torn apart and shattered!</p>
 <p>Annihilation!</p>
 <p>The remaining blasts of powerful qi that were produced caused the prohibited light canopy formation to quake. Ripples floated out, rocking, like a little boat was trying to survive in the midst of a storm, in seemingly imminent danger.</p>
 <p>The incomparably dazzling rays of light flooded the entire prohibited area, blinding everyone’s eyes and completely swallowing the two bodies. For a long moment there were no signs of them.</p>
 <p>A long while after...</p>
 <p>From the restricted light canopy formation, there were faint sounds of cracking and rupturing, and soon it collapsed.</p>
 <p>The light scattered away.</p>
 <p>Xing’er subconsciously opened her eyes to take a look. Inside the prohibited area were two figures standing with their hands clasped behind their back, eyes fixed on each other.</p>
 <p>The supreme skills that the two people displayed were evenly matched, equal to each other!</p>
 <p>The aftermath of the battle was still spreading across the air.</p>
 <p>The airflow around the two figures was like a broken vortex, flowing slowly and looking extremely unnatural. The rising and falling of airflow were visible to the naked eye and shrouding the two figures as before.</p>
 <p>There was an utter silence above the battleship.</p>
 <p>After a long while, the dozens of flabbergasted guests finally broke into commotion.</p>
 <p>“Evenly matched?”</p>
 <p>“The boy... No wonder he claims to be the [War God], he is indeed amazing... to draw with Xiao Lou. This achievement, if spread out, would be enough to create a stir in the Jianghu of the imperial capital, right?”</p>
 <p>“We can’t be sure yet... Xiao Lou hasn’t pulled out his blade yet.”</p>
 <p>“The problem is that Xiao Lou has not pulled out his blade, his black blade is like a decoration. The people that lost to him befor were defeated by his palm techniques... Who knows if this guy was just bluffing with that blade?”</p>
 <p>“But today Xiao Lou has always been using sword skills.”</p>
 <p>“Do you mean, Xiao Lou had not attacked with all his strength yet.”</p>
 <p>“That is very terrifying, which of us could withstand five attacks from Xiao Lou? Among all the guest masters, there is only a handful of people that could do such a thing. The little princess’s boyfriend is really impressive.”</p>
 <p>“And he’s younger than Xiao Lou... Everyone, I remember the reason why Xiao Lou was regarded as important by the many forces of the imperial capital and was chosen by our Prince. It’s because he is young, right?”</p>
 <p>“Another demon-like talent.”</p>
 <p>The dialogue among the visitors, although their voices were deliberately lowered, but was still heard by Prince Yu Feiyan and Xing’er, two martial arts experts.</p>
 <p>A slight smile crossed Yu Feiyan’s face.</p>
 <p>It was obvious that he seemed more satisfied with the result.</p>
 <p>“Girl, it seems you picked the right person .This Ye Qingyu is indeed a talented person, although his background is a bit low, but our Snow Empire Imperial family also started from nothing. As long as men have enough strength, they can change everything. This kid is handsome, has a tough mind, is gifted and outstanding, and matches well with you. No wonder you gave him the [Three Thousand &nbsp;Feet of White Hair]... However, the matter between you two, wouldn’t it still need your father’s approval?”</p>
 <p>Yu Feiyan looked at Xing’er smiling.</p>
 <p>“Uncle you’re thinking too much, I never said that he is the one I love...” Xing’er replied, expressionless.</p>
 <p>“According to the iron law of the empire’s imperial household, giving him the [Three Thousand Feet of White Hair], is equal to choosing him to be your husband. If he is not the one you love, you should already know the consequences...” In Yu Feiyan’s palm was a whirling purple-gold armrest of the imperial thron. Smiling, he continued, “I know that you’re usually very mischievous, but you’re unlikely to go so far as to disregard the imperial family’s tradition. The one that a woman of the Snow Empire’s Imperial family give their strand of white hair to is the one they love.”</p>
 <p>Xing’er did not say a word for a long while.</p>
 <p>“What? Don’t tell me regret it, Ye Qingyu is so talented at such a young age, he is considered as &nbsp;a one in a million genius. Uncle also extremely admires his talent. He is a good match for our little witch, haha...” Yu Feiyan began laughing heartily. From his words, he seemed rather open-minded and deeply concerned about Xing’er.</p>
 <p>Xing’er smiled faintly. “Just because he tied with your dog that has the sharpest teeth?”</p>
 <p>Yu Feiyan helplessly shook his head. “Girl, ever since you came back, you’ve been avoiding me. Do you have some issues with me, or do you dislike my guest masters?”</p>
 <p>“What’s the difference?” Xing’er indifferent curled her lips. “If you think that it is already very impressive that Qingyu could remain undefeated under Xiao Lou’s blade, then I can only say that you still do not understand [The Leaf of Youyan]. Since he accepted this so-called battle of learning from each other, he would not be satisfied with such a result.”</p>
 <p>Yu Feiyan was taken aback.</p>
 <p>In the martial arts ground.</p>
 <p>“Pull out your blade.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was slowly moving his body about, activating strength within his body, real physical strength bursting forth, roars of dragons echoing inside his muscles and bones, as though there were countless divine dragons about to come out from his body.</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Lou was astonished, the pupils of his eyes shrinking abruptly.</p>
 <p>“Before, you... were suppressing your strength to fight with me?” On Xiao Lou’s face emerged an anger triggered by humiliation.</p>
 <p>“Didn’t you also suppress your strength?” Ye Qingyu faintly smiled. “People from the era of sects, their methods of fighting are a completely ancient style. Why did you not pull the blade? Because you do not want to kill me? Or do you know that even if you draw your blade you’re not going to kill me? Or... are you afraid of drawing a blade in front of so many people and exposing your true identity?”</p>
 <p>The expression on Xiao Lou’s face instantly calmed down.</p>
 <p>“You’re thinking too much.” His hand slowly grasped the blade hilt.</p>
 <p>His slender, soft and fair fingers were more beautiful than some women that pay particular attention to the maintenance of their fingers. If this was another place, another occasion, few people would be able to link such a beautiful hand to the frightening bloody hand that had taken part in the serial killing of twenty-one martial artist in the imperial capital in one year.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu did not speak.</p>
 <p>Drawing a deep breath.</p>
 <p>[True Will of the Sky Dragon] was in operation.</p>
 <p>His right hand was instantly covered by light silvery dragon scales, his fingers also becoming a dragon claw.</p>
 <p>At the same time, activating the [Human King Sword Mantra].</p>
 <p>The true meaning of swordsmanship was gathered on the right dragon claw, rumbling out like lightning.</p>
 <p>The sword-air whistled and the chill pervaded the air.</p>
 <p>A look of surprise crossed Xiao Lou’s face, and without the time to even hesitate, his right hand that was originally tightly gripping the black hilt, suddenly shot out like lightning, and his originally fair jade-like palm instantly turned black as ink, as if it could devour all the power of the world.</p>
 <p>The next moment, the black palm and the silver dragon claw clashed.</p>
 <p>This time there was no fluctuation of energy.</p>
 <p>There was no deafening sound.</p>
 <p>Not even a faint breeze.</p>
 <p>That split second of contact was like a friendly tap between two good friends, the palm and fist were lifted, and then tightly glued together again, and not immediately separated.</p>
 <p>Bang bang bang.</p>
 <p>Beneath the two people came a muffled sound.</p>
 <p>The deck that was strengthened with the power of the mysterious rune inscription was like rippling water. The location of the two people had sunk and numerous rune inscriptions were flashing like crazily. The metal deck that was floating in the air seemed like it would collapse at any time...</p>
 <p>It was clear that the strength that these two people endured at this very moment was absolutely violent and tyrannical. It was absolutely not as easy as it looked on the surface.</p>
 <p>Such a stalemate probably lasted less than ten seconds.</p>
 <p>Xiao Lou’s face was suddenly flushed red like he was drunk, his eyebrows scrunched up, then blood slowly trickled down from his mouth. Like he was exhausted, he began trembling.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu actually still had ample strength.</p>
 <p>“So the origin of your strength comes from your blade.” His eyes lit up for a second as he realized, then he continued in an indifferent tone, “So the reason you did not draw the blade is because your current level of cultivation cannot pull out this blade... The so-called people that have seen you pull the blade are all dead, it is only a rumor. What ancient sect of the era of sects was your master in?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Lou glared at Ye Qingyu and did not speak.</p>
 <p>“For ashes to want to rekindle?” Ye Qingyu’s eyes also gradually become ice-cold. “The era of the sects has passed, it is impossible for it to return... It’s time for you people to forget such a time.”</p>
 <p>“You overestimate yourself...” Xiao Lou opened his mouth to speak, when his body trembled even more.</p>
 <p>From inside of Ye Qingyu’s arm, suddenly came the roar of a dragon, more forceful than before.</p>
 <p>“Ah... pfff!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Lou finally could not hold on any longer, blood gushed out from his mouth, and his body was propelled away.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu waved his hand.</p>
 <p>The black blade in his hand that was twirling and attempting to fly away, fell into the hands of Ye Qingyu, still struggling and vibrating, but unable free itself from Ye Qingyu’s silver scaled dragon claw.</p>
 <p>“Give back my blade...”</p>
 <p>Xiao Lou roared. His expression took a huge change, the first time he showed the look of shock and panic. He counter attacked frantically.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu laughed, his left hand turning into a dragon claw.</p>
 <p>His right hand was holding the scabbard, his left hand was clasping the hilt, saying indifferently, “Do you think I can pull out this blade?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Lou’s figure abruptly stopped——</p>
