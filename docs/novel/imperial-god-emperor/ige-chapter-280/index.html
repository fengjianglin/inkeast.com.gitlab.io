 <p>"You've finished?" There was a trace of excitement in Xiao Buliu's voice, "You are quite quick. Pass it over for me to have a look..."</p>
 <p>"No," Jin Ling'er rejected him unconditionally. "You are too dishonest, I can't trust you… tell me first, just how will I open brother Yuanxing's shackles, then I'll help you. That is the fairest method.”</p>
 <p>"You… little brat." Xiao Buliu was taken aback at first, then could not help but say angrily, "Do you understand. Right now, we are ants on the same ship. We should help each other, not suspect each other."</p>
 <p>"Who knows whether an ant like you will escape by yourself after you are released from your shackles." Jin Ling'er snorted in disdain, not backing down in the slightest. He indicated he did not trust Xiao Buliu in the least.</p>
 <p>"You… this i... fine, fine, little brat you win. I accept defeat." Xiao Buliu cursed at him several times but was not willing to entangle himself with a little brat for too long. "Listen carefully, I'm about to tell you how to open the shackles. If I did not guess wrong, Bai Yuanxing's shackles should be the exact same as mine. You must use the time well. In another two hours, there will be someone guarding from outside that will check up on us. If you cannot open the shackles within two hours, then we will be in trouble..."</p>
 <p>As he said this, he breathed in deeply. He passed on the methods and secrets of how to open the lock slowly to Jin Ling'er.</p>
 <p>Jin Ling'er used what he learnt, trying to use the little metal implement he created to open the lock.</p>
 <p>Under the direction of Xiao Buliu, and after attempting tens of times, the sound of metal clinking against each other continued in the darkness. In less than fifteen minutes time, the shackles on Bai Yuanxing's right hand was really opened by Bai Yuanxing.</p>
 <p>"Haha, I did it, it really opened," Jin Ling'er cried out delightedly.</p>
 <p>"Hush, keep your voice down. You little brat, why are you so loud. Do you want the people guarding outside to have a look?" Xiao Buliu scolded without showing any mercy. "You used fifteen minutes to open a single lock and you still want to cheer. You’re so young , but you're so shameless already."</p>
 <p>"Fine, fine, I know." This time Jin Ling'er did not give off too much of a retort, carefully entering the metal implement into another hole.“</p>
 <p>After the experience of the first time, and with Xiao Buliu's instructions by the side, this time he was much quicker in opening the locks.</p>
 <p>The next three locks did not even take fifteen minutes before they were all unlocked.</p>
 <p>Bai Yuanxing stood up while rubbing his arms and wrists.</p>
 <p>The rough and chafed skin and bruises caused by the metallic shackles were only superficial wounds. It did not hurt his bones or tendons, and furthermore he had just eaten, so his recovery rate was quite high. However, because he had been bound for a long time on the post, the blood did not flow that well to his arms or legs. He required a brief period of rest before he could begin normally operating.</p>
 <p>"Fine, then come over now and pass that metal implement to me," Xiao Buliu said impatiently.</p>
 <p>Jin Ling'er hesitated for a while, but ultimately passed the little metal tool over. "We had an agreement beforehand. Don't try anything funny, let me tell you, don't look down on me because I'm small. I am a person with high position and significance outside..."</p>
 <p>Xiao Buliu did not know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
 <p>The sound of metal clinking against each other could be heard. In a short period of time, Xiao Buliu was able to get away from the post. The speed at which he opened the locks was unbelievably quick. The metal implement that had been created according to his specifications seemed like magic in his hands.</p>
 <p>"You were able to open the lock so quickly? I know, you must be a thief. You stole someone's stuff, so you were captured. You really deserve it." Jin LInger pressed his lips together.</p>
 <p>"You are a thief? do you know how to speak?" Xiao Buliu was enraged.</p>
 <p>He moved his hands and wrists, flexing his muscles, doing his utmost to make blood flow through his body. Only after the numbness gradually faded away did he tidy the clothes on his body. He tore a strip from his sleeve, tying up his messy hair.</p>
 <p>This scene could completely be seen by Jin Ling'er, who could see in the darkness.</p>
 <p>"A little thief, why are you prettying yourself up? Hurry up and open that three inch lock, escaping is the priority." The little brat could not help but criticize.</p>
 <p>"What do you know. No matter what time it is, you must pay attention to your own appearance. A good and intact appearance is the foundation for confidence. Often, this will bring one luck," Xiao Buliu said angrily.</p>
 <p>He felt that there must be poison smeared on the mouth of this little brat.</p>
 <p>But Xiao Buliu was indeed aware that time was short. Without wasting any more words, he came to the metal door by sense of touch. At the door, he touched the surface layer of the lock using his finger, confident in his own ability.</p>
 <p>"Wait a moment," Bai Yuanxing suddenly opened his mouth.</p>
 <p>"What? You don't want to escape?" Xiao Buliu lightly inserted the metal implement into the lock, not taking any more action. He turned towards the direction of the voice.</p>
 <p>"It's not that I don't want to leave. But we must plan what we should do if there are guards outside. If we are captured, it will become even more difficult for us to escape once again," Bai Yuanxing said cautiously.</p>
 <p>"That's right, that makes sense." Xiao Buliu nodded his head. "Fine, Brother Yuanxing, what proposal do you have?"</p>
 <p>"This..." Bai Yuanxing had nothing to add.</p>
 <p>In truth, he also did not have any alternate plans. His and Ling'er's strength was by far not enough, and the items on their body had already been taken away. There was no plan they could make.</p>
 <p>“Then why did you say such pointless words," Xiao Buliu, after waiting for a long time for no better alternatives, grumpily cursed at him. "After all this time being locked in this dark place, I'm about to go crazy. No matter what, let's first leave and see the sunlight outside. If I am able to see natural sunlight, then I'll be able to die happily.”</p>
 <p>Ka-cha.</p>
 <p>The sound of the lock moving in the darkness could be heard.</p>
 <p>It was exceedingly quiet.</p>
 <p>In less than three breaths of time. Xiao Buliu had stopped what he was doing.</p>
 <p>"The lock has already been opened. Right now I need to open the door. When the door is open, everyone needs to run for their lives outside. At that time, the most important thing is escaping. Everyone will take care of themselves. I'll say this first, I won't be of any help afterwards and our alliance will lose it's effect from this point onwards. Xiao Buliu said such words in a suppressed tone.</p>
 <p>In the darkness, the breathing of the three became rough and hurried.</p>
 <p>Pang!</p>
 <p>The door was instantly opened.</p>
 <p>A piercing sunlight like a flood rushed in.</p>
 <p>There was a scarlet red high wall passageway outside.</p>
 <p>The imagined heavily guarded entrance did not appear.</p>
 <p>There was not even a single person guarding at the door.</p>
 <p>"Let's go."</p>
 <p>Xiao Buliu was at the forefront, stepping lightly, his footwork exceedingly strange. It seemed like he was an agile rat, scurrying off, his light footsteps not giving off the slightest of sound. It was like a cat walking on snow.</p>
 <p>Bai Yuanxing and Jin Ling'er followed behind.</p>
 <p>There was passageway after passageway outside.</p>
 <p>These passageways were like a labyrinth, twisting and turning. After passing through several turns, they still did not see anything like an exit. But there were still high walls tens of meters high, and they could faintly hear the hustle and bustle outside. It did not seem to be a place that was tightly guarded at all.</p>
 <p>After walking a while, Xiao Buliu stopped.</p>
 <p>He placed his hand on the wall for a short period, "There's not any formation arrays, we should break through the wall and go from there. If we continue walking forward, we might walk into a net... Mother, if my inner yuan was recovered, I would have long jumped over this wall, it’s only tens of meters high...”</p>
 <p>As he said this, there was suddenly the sound of footsteps in front of him.</p>
 <p>A weak figure, a youth carrying food appeared.</p>
 <p>He walked towards them step by step, turning the corner. There was no place to hide in the straight passageway. He instantly saw Bai Yuanxing, Xiao Buliu and Jin Ling'er who had escaped.</p>
 <p>It was namely the guard and food deliverer, Li Rui.</p>
 <p>"Mother... shit.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Buliu let out a strangled scream. Like a mad, feral dog, his face was sinister. He was the first person to react, grabbing the little metal implement and charging towards the head of Li Rui.</p>
 <p>The first person to act wins.</p>
 <p>Bai Yuanxing's expression also greatly changed.</p>
 <p>But he did not charge at Li Rui. Instead he grabbed at Jin Ling'er with both hands, his arms exploding with a power. With a swing, Jin Ling'er was like a sandbag that was thrown.</p>
 <p>"Quickly, go find the Marquis," Bai Yuanxing shouted.</p>
 <p>Pak!</p>
 <p>Jin Ling'er let out a strange scream, not having had the time to react yet. The power of the throw sent him soaring above the wall onto the other side. He transformed into a dark dot that disappeared on the other side of the wall...</p>
 <p>When Bai Yuanxing had finished doing everything.</p>
 <p>Pang.</p>
 <p>There was the sound of a heavy object falling to the ground.</p>
 <p>The Xiao Buliu who had charged forward, was now in a sorry state when he was thrown backwards like a sandbag. His bottom struck the wall, grimacing in pain. He could not get up in such a short period. The yuan qi in his body was sealed away and he had to rely on his physical body alone. Just by relying on pure power, he naturally was not able to fight against the young man Li Rui.</p>
 <p>Bai Yuanxing deeply breathed in.</p>
 <p>After he had sent Jin Ling'er away, there was nothing tying him back anymore. He prepared for his final struggle. After all, since he had sent Jin Ling'er away, news would definitely get to Marquis. It already did not matter whether he lived on or not, or just what sort of tragic fate awaited him.</p>
 <p>But the atmosphere in the alleyway was somewhat strange.</p>
 <p>The young man Li Rui who stood there holding the containers had a frown. He did not shout and call for people, he did not begin a furious offence like that of a rainstorm. Instead he stood there in shocked silence for three or four breaths of time.</p>
 <p>There had never been such a conflicted expression on his face.</p>
 <p>Six breaths later.</p>
 <p>"You... are someone from the White Horse tower?" Li Rui's glance landed on Bai Yuanxing.</p>
 <p>Bai Yuanxing hesitated, then nodded his head slightly.</p>
 <p>Li rui did not open his mouth again.</p>
 <p>After being silenced for three or four breaths of time.</p>
 <p>"You still have an hour left…"</p>
 <p>Li Rui suddenly lifted his head, saying such a phrase inexplicably. He brushed back Bai Yuanxing's shoulder with a calm expression while carrying the food containers as he passed directly past Bai Yuanxing. It was as if he did not see anything, turning back towards the dimly lit corridor.</p>
 <p>What followed after made Bai Yuanxing and Xiao Buliu more confused.</p>
 <p>What had happened?</p>
 <p>Li Rui’s tone seemed as if he was going to deliberately let them go. This huge change was outside of Bai Yuanxing's and Xiao Buliu's expectation.</p>
 <p>"Why are you just standing there? Quickly break the wall.”</p>
 <p>The first person to react was Xiao Buliu.</p>
 <p>This really was finding an exit in a desperate situation.</p>
 <p>Although they did not know why the young man Li Rui would do such a thing, but it was no longer important. They must first quickly find an escape route.</p>
 <p>Bai Yuanxing and Xiao Buliu were both martial cultivators. Their strength was much greater than a normal person, with good stamina. In the blink of an eye, there was a little hole on the wall.</p>
 <p>But their luck today, did not seem that good.</p>
 <p>At that time ---</p>
 <p>"You... How did you escape? Where's Li Rui?" a strange female voice sounded.</p>
 <p>Nan Hua wearing a violet Robe appeared around the corner. The beautiful young girl of the Crepe Myrtle sect had evidently not expected she would be met with such a scene. She opened her mouth wide, staring uncomprehendingly with shock as she saw the two men.</p>
 <p>"Shit, the female demon has come."</p>
 <p>Xiao Buliu was greatly shocked, his heart sinking.</p>
 <p>"Why are you standing there? Quickly escape... You go first." Bai Yuanxing’s reaction speed was quick, lifting the Xiao Buliu who stood there stunned into the little hole. Then he also crawled through the hole onto the other side.</p>
 <p>The other side.</p>
 <p>Nan Hua had finally recovered from her huge shock and did something in response.</p>
 <p>"Escape... there are people escaping! Quickly, come..." As she shouted loudly, she lifted the flare that she held in her hand and sent it up. Then she followed after them instantly.</p>
 <p>Yuan qi exploded.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The hard stone wall in front of her white jade-like hands, was like cardboard, completely collapsing.</p>
 <p>Nan Hua continued to chase.</p>
 <p>On the other side of the high wall, there was an empty little garden. The grass and plants were withered and there was nothing decorative at all. Tens of meters away, Bai Yuanxing and Xiao Buliu were like frightened rabbits, madly fleeing.</p>
 <p>The streets were outside the garden.</p>
 <p>As long as they managed to escape onto the streets and mixed themselves in the crowd, they had hope.</p>
 <p>But what made Bai Yuanxing despair was that Nan Hua's strength was not weak. Her speed was as fast as lightning and in an instant, she came \before the two, blocking their paths.</p>
 <p>In the far off low wall of the garden, the first person who had ran, Jin Ling'er, had not truly escaped. There were three or four people wearing the Crepe Myrtle sect robes that surrounded him.</p>
 <p>They've failed.</p>
 <p>There was an icy coldness in Bai Yuanxing's heart.</p>
 <p>Xiao Buliu avoided Nan Hua's palm strike in a very sorry fashion. He also had a face filled with hopelessness. If they were captured this time, even if he did not die, they would rip his skin off. He placed the metal implement against his own neck, roaring, "You little slut that deserves to die,. Even if I die, I'm not going to be captured and tortured by you..."</p>
 <p>At this time----</p>
 <p>A change that no one imagined finally occurred.</p>
 <p>"Woof, woof, I've finally found it. Bai Yuanxing, did you bring Jin Ling'er to play hide and seek? You've made me search so hard, but you were hiding in such a rubbish place..."</p>
 <p>A proud voice suddenly sounded in the little courtyard.</p>
 <p>What followed after was a white and soft chubby paw that lightly patted Bai Yuanxing’s shoulder.</p>
 <p>There was an inexplicable shock and disbelief as Bai Yuanxing turned to look. It was a dog's face that was so familiar it made Bai Yuanxing want to cry. It appeared without any warning in front of him.</p>
 <p>"Hachi Hachi....."</p>
 <p>This dog stuck its pink little tongue out, wagging it's chubby little tail, his head tilting as he smiled and pretended to be cute.</p>
 <p>The silly dog, Little Nine.</p>
 <p>It was the silly dog, Little Nine.</p>
 <p>This chubby dog that always followed behind the Marquis, a little white dog that was so lazy it always seemed to be asleep, this little white dog that always caused trouble, had never appeared like it did so right now. It made Bai Yuanxing feel an excitement of being able to escape from a hopeless situation.</p>
 <p>"Woof woof, what is it? Do you feel surprised at my appearance? Wahahaha..." Little Nine wagged his tail arrogantly.</p>
 <p>Then it jumped onto Bai Yuanxing's head.</p>
 <p>"Has the Marquis come?" Bai Yuanxing, after being delighted, asked this question.</p>
 <p>"Little Ye still has his own problems to take care of. He has challenged someone strong in the arena and has encountered something difficult. He doesn't have the time to help us wipe our own asses. Wahahaha, little Bai, little Bai, at such a crucial time, you must of course rely on Brother Wen Wan in saving you, don't cry."</p>
 <p>A voice that was extremely familiar sounded out.</p>
 <p>Bai Yuanxing turned his head.</p>
 <p>He could see Wen Wan wearing black with his arms crossed at his chest standing at a pavilion at the center of the little garden. His robes faintly fluttered with the wind, his muscular figure straight like a spear. There was a confidence on his face, but the wink on his face completely ruined his atmosphere of pretending to be a peerless expert.</p>
 <p>"Officer Wen..."</p>
 <p>The moment he saw Wen Wan, Bai Yuanxing's worried heart could finally be placed at ease.</p>
 <p>"Officer Wen, quickly come save me." Jin Ling'er had a face of mad delight, jumping up and down, shouting.</p>
 <p>At this time, there were tens of experts wearing the clothing of the sects that ran out in the garden. They surrounded them from all sides, their strength not weak in the slightest.</p>
 <p>Four or five of them fluctuated with an extremely strong yuan qi turbulence, old in appearance. They floated in the sky. One of them caused silver light pillars to be shot through the sky with his hands, and the formation array began to be established. Instantly all the sounds of the streets were cordoned off, the environment changing entirely.</p>
 <p>A formation array that isolated everything.</p>
 <p>In an instant, it had sealed off the little courtyard.</p>
 <p>As such, even if the little courtyard was turned over, the people from outside would not notice at all.</p>
 <p>"It's really the people from the Crepe Myrtle sect. You sinister little rats, you're really not afraid to die. To even dare touch people of the army." Wen Wan stood on the pavilion, staring at the people all round. With a cold smile: he said, "It seems that Li Qiushui's brain is retarded, and is used to his arrogance. To dare kidnap and ransom someone in Youyan Pass, this is no different from committing suicide."</p>
 <p>Tens of meters in the air.</p>
 <p>Those five elders of the Crepe Myrtle sect with white hair did not have any change in their expression whatsoever. they did not react at all to Wen Wan's provocation.</p>
 <p>They all stood their serenely, their faces peaceful, their eyes as cold as blades.</p>
 <p>"Kill!"</p>
 <p>One of the old men waved his hands.</p>
 <p>Xiu!Xiu!Xiu!</p>
 <p>Numerous figures shot through the air, their long blades like a rainbow.</p>
 <p>The lights of the sword flickered. A sharp aura completely enveloped them, slicing apart the air all around. Everywhere the sword qi passed through, wood, grass and rocks would be sliced apart. This terrifying killing intent was like a net that mercilessly tore towards Wen Wan.</p>
 <p>"Hahaha..." Wen Wan laughed.</p>
 <p>He turned to give a glance towards Bai Yuanxing. "Look at how I take care of this pack of dogs and chickens. Remember to report to Little Ye that my power is actually very strong."</p>
 <p>Before he had even finished.</p>
 <p>He took a step with his foot.</p>
 <p>The little tiles beneath his feet that covered the little pavilion shot out in all directions.</p>
 <p>Xiu Xiu Xiu.</p>
 <p>The tiles were like divine weapons.</p>
 <p>Ding Ding Ding!</p>
 <p>There was the constant sound of tiles striking those swords. Those sword strikes, which seemed so remarkable and sharp, struck the tiles and collapsed. Those Crepe Myrtle sect disciples’ sword aura was like a net, but it could not block the tiles that shot towards them in the slightest. It broke the swords, the tiles piercing through their young bodies...</p>
 <p>"Pugh!"</p>
 <p>"Ah..."</p>
 <p>Blood spurted and people screamed tragically.</p>
 <p>These eight Crepe Myrtle sect disciples could be counted as significant people, but in the time of a single move, they were all heavily injured. They did not have the power to hold their swords any longer, falling to the ground.</p>
 <p>"Hahaha, I've long said. I am very strong, but you didn't believe me." Wen Wan stood on the pavilion without any more tiles, gloating, pretending to be a peerless expert.</p>
 <p>There was complete silence everywhere.</p>
 <p>Jin Ling'er ran to Bai Yuanxing.</p>
 <p>Xiao Buliu came closer, saying strangely, "My friends, so you had such a great background. That bearded brother seems very fierce. Are you guys the Marquis that they were referring to? The enemies are of the Crepe Myrtle sect? Crap, the Three Schools and Three Sects? You... how did you manage to provoke such a force... Can that bearded brother withstand it, those old men still haven't acted yet..."</p>
 <p>Bai Yuanxing did not have anything to say.</p>
 <p>"Why are you coming over?" Jin Ling'er sniffed at him disdainfully, giving him a look of contempt, "Did you not say that our alliance is over? That we have to look out for ourselves. You better think of your own plans, we don't want to drag you down!"</p>
 <p>Xiao Buliu had a completely green face.</p>
 <p>But at this time, he could only act subservient. "Little brother, how can you say that. Currently we are ants on the same rope. You can't run and neither can I, we have to respect the spirit of cooperation..."</p>
 <p>Jin Ling'er had a face like he wanted to vomit in disgust, "Your face must be the most secure lock in the world, you can't even open it yourself!"</p>
 <p>Xiao Buliu chuckled, not objecting.</p>
 <p>At this time, as long as you weren't an idiot, you must quickly grab onto the thick thighs of Jin Linger and Bai Yuanxing. Evidently, that white dog demon and that bearded man had come for the two. If he wanted to get out of this alive, he had to rely on them.</p>
 <p>On the pavilion.</p>
 <p>"Old bastard, come up yourselves. Don't let your disciples come and die." Wen Wan crossed his arms at his chest, assuming the attitude of a peerless expert. With a laugh, "Even if you do not feel too much pain from losing some trash of the sects, but I still have to clean up the corpses after.“</p>
 <p>"Kill!"</p>
 <p>A Crepe Myrtle sect elder finally acted.</p>
 <p>With a flick of his wrist, his sword was like lightning.</p>
 <p>Yuan qi fluctuations raged through the air. The power of the sword light seemed as if the heavenly river itself had flowed down. The violent light seem to generate a feeling of insignificance to those who saw it, making it feel as if you could not block it.</p>
 <p>Wen Wan's figure flashed, leaving the pavilion.</p>
 <p>That little Pavilion, struck by the sword strike, turned into dust. Such dust spread about everywhere.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The next instant.</p>
 <p>The four elder class experts acted at nearly the same time.</p>
 <p>Numerous blades pierced through the air, the purple sword light looking invincible.</p>
 <p>"Ai ai ai ai? How shameless are you, to attack at the same time. I thought we agreed on a series of one on one duels? Are you going to disregarded the rules of the Jianghu?" Wen Wan cried exaggeratingly.</p>
 <p>He was completely surrounded by five great experts, the endless Crepe Myrtle sect sword qi enveloping him. After some twists and turn, he carefully avoided the sword momentum that was like a hurricane, seeming somewhat panicky.</p>
 <p>It seemed that Wen Wan was about to fall at any second.</p>
 <p>He was like a little raft in the ocean when a storm or gale struck; There was the possibility of capsizing at any point in time. It seemed like if another wave or another sword strike landed, it would be enough to completely destroy him.</p>
 <p>But without knowing why, every time when it seemed like he had no place to avoid, he would manage to just move away. Wen Wan did not die. The fatal sword qi was avoided in an inexplicable way by Wen Wan.</p>
 <p>Millions of swords enveloped the sky, so vast and dazzling it could not be stared into. It was like thunder from the heavens itself, or like a purple snake madly dancing.</p>
 <p>Wen Wan also only bitterly supported himself.</p>
 <p>But in such a short space of time, the elder class experts all acted. Unexpectedly, they did not manage to kill Wen Wan, but was delayed a little longer.</p>
 <p>There were looks of contempt from the faces of those white-haired experts.</p>
 <p>They were within Youyan Pass, and this location was also close to the Proud Sky Center. If they got too excited and the army discovered this, the consequences werenot worth thinking about.</p>
 <p>"Don't worry about it, the news has already been leaked. The air in the outside world cannot always remain the same the entire time. We don't have much time left."</p>
 <p>An elder unsheathed his sword, shouting loudly, "What should we do?"</p>
 <p>"Once the matters at Proud Sky Center are concluded, we don't need to show mercy anymore. We have to quickly kill those people and utterly destroy them. Then we have to leave Youyan Pass as soon as possible," the Crepe Myrtle sect elder said with a serious expression. "We must be quick. If the Youyan Pass army reacts, then we may have trouble.“</p>
 <p>"Good."</p>
 <p>"Act with our full power."</p>
 <p>"Then what are you hesitating for. Quickly kill those three, and that white dog demon... Send someone to prepare the formation array and we will depart immediately," A thin elder shouted at the hesitating sect disciples below.</p>
 <p>Those sect disciples finally recovered.</p>
 <p>"Hahah, do you guys think I'm dead? To plan your schemes in front of me? Leave?" The Wen Wan who was busy evading suddenly began laughing. "A bunch of ignorant dogs, to dare bark in Youyan Pass. This time you had better make the preparations for your spines to be broken. It's too late for you to run!"</p>
 <p>As he said this, Wen Wan grabbed at something through the air.</p>
 <p>A gigantic battle axe landed in his hands.</p>
 <p>This huge battle axe was like the size of a door slab. It curved like a crescent moon, the sides of the axe sharp like a hook. The axe was extremely wide and thick, as coarse as a duck's egg. There was a faint pattern on it. This axe was nearly as big as Wen Wan. Even one axe was the size of Wen Wan's body, but he held two of such axes. Under such a comparison, Wen Wan's burly figure seemed somewhat small.</p>
 <p>"Five dogs, try my move!"</p>
 <p>Wen Wan laughed loudly, his body beginning to move like a wheel.</p>
 <p>Chi Chi!</p>
 <p>Two axes shot out in all directions.</p>
 <p>This long quivering axe blade transformed into blades that spread throughout the sky .Such a terrifying and sharp blade qi spread throughout the air. The curved moon shape of the axe glowed with a splendour. The aura of the sharp blade cut apart heaven and earth in all directions. It seemed as if there was nothing it could not cut, as if it wanted to completely cut and tear apart the world.</p>
 <p>Jang Jang Jang!</p>
 <p>There was the sound of swords being sliced apart.</p>
 <p>The Spirit Class treasure swords in the hands of the five great elders were cut apart like a wooden doll. It came wave after wave, and what it sliced apart were not only the sharp swords. Their bodies that contained a powerful yuan qi were also torn apart...</p>
 <p>There was not any blood.</p>
 <p>There was not any torn limbs whatsoever.</p>
 <p>The atmosphere suddenly halted.</p>
 <p>All the sword qi in the air disappeared.</p>
 <p>The five elders of the sect were still standing in the sky.</p>
 <p>There was disbelief on all of their faces.</p>
 <p>Although they did not see the wounds left behind after the axe sliced their waists, but as powerful existences that were half a step in the Bitter Sea stage, the moment those axes touched their bodies, they could judge what had happened...</p>
 <p>Their lives were like flowing sand that disappeared grain by grain. It could not help but fade.</p>
 <p>"You…”</p>
 <p>The leading elder had wide eyes.</p>
 <p>He could not believe what he saw. Facing this muscular bearded man wielding blood red battle axes, he could not say that many words.</p>
 <p>It was as if he was still immersed in that absolutely fatal and terrifying axe strike that seemed as if it would split apart heavens and earth.</p>
 <p>The four Crepe Myrtle sect elders next to him were also similarly shocked and surprised.</p>
 <p>Although these five were not the strongest elders of the Crepe Myrtle sect, but they could absolutely be counted as tough opponents. They became famous sixty years ago, and they began hiding themselves in isolation in the Magnificent Sunset Hall of the Crepe Myrtle sect, focusing on the martial path for the past thirty years. Although these people's names were not well known in the Jianghu recently, but when the five banded together, even a Bitter Sea stage expert would have a chance of falling if they were not strong enough.</p>
 <p>For the five to act at the same time to kill Wen Wan was akin to using a tiger to hunt a rabbit. They used their full power, not being overconfident in the slightest. But who would have guessed that a guy who they did not even regard as important at all would completely slaughtered them in an instant?</p>
 <p>The gaze of the leading elder was still staring at the exaggerated blood red battle axes.</p>
 <p>A blood red glimmer was fluctuating on the blade of the axe.</p>
 <p>As if a bi-coloured sunlight was resting against the blade of the axe.</p>
 <p>His heart quivered. He suddenly thought of an exceedingly terrifying legend, a legend that had made countless sects shake.</p>
 <p>"That blood axe... You... you are..." His heart was greatly shaken, a terrifying name that could not help but appear.</p>
 <p>The shock at this instant was even more terrifying than that sharp axes that tore apart their lives from their bodies.</p>
 <p>But before he could finish his sentence----</p>
 <p>There was a spurt of blood at the waists of all of the elders. Their bodies split into two, then a terrifying energy emitted from the limbs. The area tens of meters around the five corpses completely exploded, transforming into a series of blood rain.</p>
 <p>"I've already said that I'm very strong, but you didn't believe me... do you believe it now?" Wen Wan having in succeeded in one move was satisfied. There was light flickering in both of his hands, and the huge blood red battle axes disappeared. it was unknown whether it was absorbed into his body, or stowed away in some interspatial storage.</p>
 <p>Below.</p>
 <p>"This, this, this... he really is so motherfucking strong..." Xiao Buliu stood and stared tongue-tied at Wen Wan, who floated above the ground. There was a shocking sensation that he was a divine person.</p>
 <p>He originated from the Jianghu and had seen countless experts. But the strength of this burly man in front of him, the invincible aura he had when those huge axes swirled around him, cause a tremor and terror in his heart.</p>
 <p>There was a violent, brutal and invincible sense of beauty.</p>
 <p>The curve of that axe blade at that instant seemed enough to destroy everything in this world.</p>
 <p>Bai Yuanxing stood in complete shock, staring at Wen Wan in the sky.</p>
 <p>He had long known that Wen Wan was also a martial expert and he had once taught Marquis Ye martial arts at White Deer Academy. He could be counted as a mentor to Marquis Ye. But the attitude and laziness Wen Wan exhibited these days made it really hard for Bai Yuanxing to imagine him as a peerless expert who cut apart the very skies with an axe. It was very hard to connect the two together.</p>
 <p>Jin Ling'er lifted his head in worship. There was an expression of blind admiration. He had completely ignited the passion the young man had towards martial artists.</p>
 <p>As for Nan Hua and the other Crepe Myrtel sect disciples, they were compeltey scared senseless.</p>
 <p>They originally did not react to anything that had happened. Five powerful sect elders were turned into bloody mush in the blink of an eye. This scene made their legs weigh thousands of pounds as if lead was poured into it, not even able to lift it in the slightest. They stood there dumbly, quivering, not daring to have any shred of movement.</p>
 <p>"Woof, stop pretending. Mad Wen, quickly come down. After spending half a day, you only won against five old men. You still have the nerve to brag..." Little Nine was the only existence able to remain remarkably calm, mercilessly taunting the Wen Wan floating in the air.</p>
 <p>"You... I'll turn you into dog stew sooner or later." Wen Wan pressed his lips together, returning to the ground. He scanned the surrounding Crepe Myrtle sect disciples, saying fiercely, "You're not allowed to leave, just stay here obediently. Whoever dares move, I'll send them to see those five old bastards."</p>
 <p>"Little Bai, I've finally found you." Wen Wan patted Bai Yuanxing on the shoulder, saying laughingly, "Have you encountered any difficulties? Haha, it seems like there isn't any injuries on your body, so you should be fine. Look at you, why had you incited those Crepe Myrtle sect people, for you to be beaten up with a stick by them, wahahah!"</p>
 <p>Bai Yuanxing breathed in helplessly, rubbing away the black lines on his face. Kneading his head, "Officer Wen, please call me Yuanxing. Why is it that your tone seems to be taking delight in my suffering?"</p>
 <p>"You must have misheard." Wen Wan chuckled, his gaze staying on Xiao Buliu's figure. Curiously, "This is..."</p>
 <p>Bai Yuanxing was about to introduce him, when Xiao Buliu coughed of his own initiative. His aura of a rascal completely disappeared. He suddenly stood straight, fixing his ragged clothes. Then he respectfully paid his greetings, bowing. With extreme manners, "I am the Xiao Buliu of the South West Jianghu. People call me the Thief King. I give my respects to elder."</p>
 <p>"Thief King? You are a thief?" Wen Wan's lips pressed together. "Am I very old, you called me an elder..."</p>
 <p>"Err..." Xiao Buliu suddenly felt that he had not managed to grasp the personality of this bearded expert. In the introduction just now, he seemed to have made some kind of mistake.</p>
 <p>He was about to say even more...</p>
 <p>At this time, a sudden change occurred.</p>
 <p>Ping Ping Ping Ping!</p>
 <p>A series of air explosions sounded out. Those Crepe Myrtle sect disciples that originally stood where they were, not daring to move a single step, suddenly exploded like water melons. Every single one of their bodies burst open without any prior warning.</p>
 <p>Fresh blood and bones shot out everywhere.</p>
 <p>The people who were still alive, instantly turned into scattered meat and bones. Dense blood scattered everywhere, their corpses deformed. One could not identify one from the other, they were all meaty mounds of flesh.</p>
 <p>"Ah..."</p>
 <p>Half a Nan Hua's face was covered by this blood. Looking at her senior brother exploding one after the other, she began shrieking hysterically.</p>
 <p>"Who dares, scram out."</p>
 <p>Wen Wan finally sensed something.</p>
 <p>The proud expression he had completely disappeared. There was a cold glimmer like that of blades flickering in his eyes. The blood axe appeared on his right hand rose again, and he used it to cut apart the air. The axe tore apart the barrier in the air, the hook entering the crevice in space, pulling something back.</p>
 <p>A murky figure, like a loach in a swamp, constantly flickered amidst the chaotic space turbulence. He wanted to escape, but was ultimately hooked onto by the blood axe, being torn away by force from the crevice in the air.</p>
 <p>"Heaven's Sob Blood Axe? Why is it in your hands? Who are you? Could you be...?" The figure that was still murky lost his composure, screaming.</p>
 <p>His figure was extremely strange, it was as if he was an illusory shadow. There was the possibility that he could escape at any moment, but the strange attraction the blood axe had made him unable to do so. He was being torn out bit by bit from the chaotic space turbulence.</p>
 <p>Like a fish that was being fished out of the deep dark waters.</p>
 <p>"So it's someone from the Dragon Tiger sect... to dare kill in front of me, it seems people of the the Dragon Tiger sect aren't afraid to die. Then die."</p>
 <p>Wen Wan's voice sounded out like an enraged tiger.</p>
 <p>The axe in his hands vibrated, and an incomparably strange energy began spreading out. In an instant it completely shattered the figure that was still hooked onto the axe and was still somewhat illusory, crushing it and transforming into scattered space.</p>
 <p>A strange energy, began emanating from the scattered remains of space, shooting in all directions.</p>
 <p>"Ah..."</p>
 <p>"Pugh!"</p>
 <p>"No, save me..."</p>
 <p>The Crepe Myrtle sect disciples were struck by these scattered pieces of space. There were holes in their bodies, as if they had been shot by a thousand arrows. Before they could react, they all tragically died to the wounds and holes on their bodies, falling with regrets.</p>
 <p>"Ah..." Nan Hua fell down with her face facing the heavens.</p>
 <p>Her luck was the greatest. Apart from a piece of flesh from her face being sliced by the fragments of space, there were not any other injuries on her body. But her face was ruined, the pain causing her to faint.</p>
 <p>And the fragments of space shot at Wen Wan were all batted away, not able to hurt Jin Linger and the others.</p>
 <p>"Mother, this Dragon Tiger sect brat is far too sinister, far too cruel. For there to be Space Lightning hidden within his body. They want to use his corpse to threaten me. It was my carelessness... now that everyone has died, how do i give a report back to Little Ye?" Wen Wan spat out a goblet of phlegm, his heart somewhat annoyed.</p>
 <p>When the situation was completely controlled by him, because of his carelessness, the result was that someone had struck against them without any warning. Those who were alive were completely killed, it would become more difficult to handle matters in the future.</p>
 <p>As Wen Wan said this, he turned to look at Bai Yuanxing beside him.</p>
 <p>Then his entire person froze.</p>
 <p>Without knowing when, Bai Yuanxing's two eyes were completely empty. Fresh blood spurted out like a spring, his destroyed pupils hanging at his eyes. Two miniscule space fragments had hit his eyes, destroying his eyesight...</p>
 <p>"Little Bai!”</p>
 <p>Wen Wan screamed as Bai Yuanxing's figure slowly fell backwards.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Proud Sky Center.</p>
 <p>Bright Moon Lake.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was panting roughly.</p>
 <p>The opponent was strong enough to make one despair.</p>
 <p>The tiger-striped mighty aura was like a prison, like a dragon, like a pillar. It was brilliant and upright, completely enveloping the entire Water Ray Arena.</p>
 <p>The sound of swords could be heard whistling through the sky.</p>
 <p>A cold star fell.</p>
 <p>Clang!</p>
 <p>The [Little Shang sword] that was vibrating in Ye Qingyu's hands, after twenty breaths of time, finally fell from high up in the sky. The sharp point of the sword fell down, stabbing into the arena, quivering. The sword kept on vibrating, like a series of autumn ice, as if it would shatter at any second-----</p>
