He would come to report every morning as Ye Qingyu gave advice on the cultivation of Bai Yuanxing and the others. Although it was not very detailed, but it was still enough to allow Ye Qingyu to understand what was currently occurring outside.</span></p>

The army of the White Mountain Black Water Brute Race ultimately was able to pass through the Mountain Sea Pass and invade straight through. In one go, it had reached the heart of the three great provinces of the North East.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; After losing the restriction of the ground of the pass, after losing the aid of the experienced [Whip of the Thunder Deity] that had longed battled with the White Mountain Black Water Brute Race, the situation turned for the worse. The troops of the three major provinces had not experienced battle and had long been used to idleness. Although they had previously been gathered and trained, but they were still not the opponents of the soldiers of the Brute Race. They could not even be compared to a rabble, nearly collapsing at the sign of a first contact. In an instant, they had invaded over a thousand miles. Without even time for the second wave of military reinforcements from the Empire to come, they had already lost over seventy percent of the territory of the great regions.</span></p>

It had caused the soldiers of the great cities, the provincial troops to lose their sense of cautiousness. Their discipline was a mess, and leadership was not clear. The previous iron bloodedness when Snow Empire was founded was already lost, they basically had no battle ability.</span></p>

Bones lay in the wild, blood seeped into the water, and less than fifty cities remained out of hundreds of major human cities under the constant invasion of the Brute Race. And these cities could fall at any moment.</span></p>

However it seemed to become unbelievably weak and fragile in the passing of a single night. Previously, it had suppressed the alien races from all sides so much that they could not breathe, but right now, it was Snow Empire itself which could not catch its breath without needing for anyone to bully it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Gao Han reported back to Ye Qingyu everyday with information from all directions. At the beginning, he was somewhat normal, but in the later stages, his expression became more and more serious. When he mentioned the other races, there was a coldness emitting from his teeth that was like real, his face a complete expression of someone who could not wait to rush to the &nbsp;battlefield to do battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu was also of such a temperament.</span></p>

This was extremely suited for the activities of the Water Demon army. The water demons of the Hurricane Wave Demon Court madly attacked. When it was autumn, the camps above water of the water army of the military had already been largely destroyed. Their lines were forced to retreat a hundred thousand miles backward, with the vanguard of the water army even unable to maintain its organizational structure due to the losses it had sustained. It's battle power had been cut in half. Although there were reinforcements, but these were inexperienced soldiers, so they could not reverse the tides when facing the attack of the Water Demon army.</span></p>

They began madly attacking without paying attention to the consequences. They purely relied on the advantage of numbers, to wear down the armies of the Human Race. Even the elite troops of the West Boulder Army were also being worn down by this and forced to retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Only the Youyan army of the Youyan Pass was like a steel wall.
