 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Exclamations of surprise could be heard throughout the area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Hu Bugui and Nan Tieyi in the Void were extremely shocked. They were both confused and hopeful because the person who sent out the divine radiance seemed tremendously powerful and righteous. It did not look like the demonic arts that were cultivated by the Heaven Desire Demon Sect. Could this person be coming to their rescue?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But still, they were uncertain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui and Nan Tieyi both sensed the terrifying power contained within the divine radiance that had streaked past earlier. It contained a force that was so powerful that it could topple ancient divine mountains and it instinctively instilled fear and respect into them, as though a peerless fiendgod was about to descend upon the earth. However, to the best of their knowledge, no one throughout the entire Clear River Domain was this powerful. Nan Tieyi thought for a moment, then concluded that not even the master of the Immortal God Emperor Sect was this powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since when did such a powerful expert exist in the Clear River Domain?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I spared you guys four years ago and didn't annihilate your sect. However, you refused to change your evil ways and even brought great evil upon the Clear River Domain. I shall spare no one today," the voice rang out once more. It seemed to be a thousand kilometers away earlier, but now it resounded from the outer fringes of the battlefield, which showed how unbelievably quickly this person was moving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before they could react, a figure moved like a flowing stream of light in the Void, far away from the cracks in the Void, and instantly left a ghostly afterimage in his wake that was thousands of meters long. He moved so quickly that no one could see his figure or face clearly. Even top experts, such as the master of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect and Hu Bugui, were unable to lock in on his exact location.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They could vaguely make out the figure lifting his hand slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet another ray of divine radiance was sent shooting out at the speed of lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Large swathes of the Void were smashed into pieces and explosions rocked the sky like thunder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This ray of divine radiance moved as fast as lightning and hurtled toward the elder from the Heaven Desire Demon Sect, who was battling with Hu Bugui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh no… [Ten Thousand Soul Vessels], [Infinite Demon Slash]… block this!" The elder reacted as though the grim reaper had called out his name and he was so terrified that all his hair stood on end. He hastily exerted his yuan qi to its maximum power and brought out dozens of defensive treasures and life weapons as he tried to block that ray of divine radiance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, the grim reaper had already decreed his death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one would have been able to stop it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hiss!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A strange sound could be heard, like a hot knife slashing through water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The divine radiance smashed against that elder's treasures but it showed no signs of stopping. In an instant, those treasures that exuded powerful demon qi were easily slashed in half by that divine radiance, giving the false impression that those treasures were so fragile that they seemed to be made of paper or clay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, everyone knew that this elder from the Heaven Desire Demon Sect was extremely powerful since he was already a half-step to the Saint realm. How else could he have lasted so long battling Hu Bugui? Nonetheless, this expert was still easily slashed into pieces as though he was a harmless animal… Exactly how damn powerful could this newcomer be?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one could help themselves from shuddering in fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thereafter, the entire battlefield seemed to be paused in a mysterious state of stillness. Even the wild experts from the Heaven Desire Demon Sect did not dare to continue charging toward those disciples from the Hundred Spirits Sect. Everyone from the Heaven Desire Demon Sect sensed that something was amiss and felt as though death was beginning to envelop them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that ray of divine radiance killed the elder from the Heaven Desire Demon Sect as easily as a hot knife cutting through butter, it did not lose any of its momentum but darted out and slashed a large hole in the Void several hundred meters behind. Then, a formidable force radiated outward and the clouds in the Void suddenly reacted as though they had reached a boiling point, tossing and turning before they shattered, creating holes in the sky from the explosions. The Chaos force was unmistakable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It looked as though a god was about to descend to earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At almost the same time—</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hiss!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Something ripped through the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The flickering figure, who moved like a flowing stream of light, slightly raised his hands once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A third ray of divine radiance was sent hurtling through the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, the divine radiance headed toward the three elders of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect who surrounded Nan Tieyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The amazing and mysterious divine radiance was like a ray of sword qi as it whistled through the air, brimming with earth-shattering energy, as though it had the power to shatter this part of Heaven and earth. All who witnessed its power were left completely awestruck and those three elders from the Heaven Desire Demon Sect did not even have the time to escape before they ended up sharing the same fate as the elder before them. The divine radiance gently brushed past these three elders, then they shattered as though they were made of sand. They transformed into fine dust and green smoke that filled the air!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In an instant, those from the Heaven Desire Demon Sect who had surrounded Nan Tieyi and Hu Bugui were completely crushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is a good opportunity!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Tieyi and Hu Bugui were overjoyed and quickly made use of this chance to escape, their figures flashing as they retreated back to where the disciples of the Hundred Spirits Sect were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both sides finally faced each other in a complete stalemate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who could this person be?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Tieyi and Hu Bugui exchanged glances when they returned to the ground and saw the astonishment in each other's faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They could clearly sense the piercing terrifying power contained within the divine radiance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those three rays of divine radiance had all been extremely formidable. It was difficult to tell what that divine radiance was—it could have been fist radiance or sword will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were not that many famous experts known for their fist techniques or sword will. Furthermore, the number of people who were extremely formidable was even fewer. It was difficult to find someone who could match Hu Bugui's punches throughout the entire Clear River Domain, but it was obvious that this person's strength far surpassed them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The disciples of the Hundred Spirits Sect within the formation were all frightened and bewildered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The figure might have sent out three consecutive punches to kill those from the Heaven Desire Demon Sect but no one knew who this person was or what his motive could be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several disciples helped the master of the Hundred Spirits Sect up, and her eyes flashed with surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had been filled with despair earlier at the thought that the Hundred Spirits Sect was on the verge of being annihilated. Then, this person had appeared unexpectedly at the critical point to turn the tide. Although she was unable at the moment to determine what his motive could be, it was clear that he was extremely powerful and that no one present on this battlefield was his match at all. It could even be said that this person was the most powerful person that the Clear River Domain had seen in a thousand years. If he was truly here to help the Hundred Spirits Sect, he would most definitely be able to crush the entire Heaven Desire Demon Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Menghua, Liu Ruxin, and the others clearly shared the same opinion. A glimmer of hope filled their hearts and looks of excitement appeared on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point in time, the figure continued to dart around as fast as lightning, so no one was able to pin down his exact location nor see his features.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, in the Void—</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Retreat and form the Heaven Desire Fiendgod Destroyer Formation!" the master of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect yelled out a command. Soon, all the disciples gathered to form a black mist formation that was linked to the heavens, as though it had stirred up the legendary black sea. Then, their beautiful master took his place right at the front of this black mist light mass. He bellowed angrily with his eyes spitting fire and his long hair fluttering wildly, "This matter is the affair of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect, so who exactly are you and how dare you try to stop me?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A fourth ray of divine radiance shot out in response.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This divine radiance was as strong as a dragon and moved like a spark of flowing light, both threatening and dazzling. It carried with it an invincible force that was many hundreds of times stronger than the terrifying divine radiances from before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The master of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect was livid when he saw that the person had attacked instead of responding to his question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How dare you…" he screamed in rage as he activated his demonic arts and his yuan qi soared to its maximum point. A light mass that was as black as ink and dozens of meters tall exuded black evil qi that rolled like the sea as it materialized behind him with a piercing and frightening growl that shook the heavens. This inky, black light mass transformed into the shape of a skull that was as large as a mountain, then it charged at the divine radiance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bam!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden and black radiances collided with a bang and the collision was so great that the earth split apart and the mountains collapsed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Inky black mist rolled everywhere, then it disappeared in a flash at an incredibly mystifying speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black skull looked as though it managed to block the hurtling fist radiance, but in the next moment, it was shredded to pieces. Formidable power and killing intent roared like stormy waves as it hurtled toward the master of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bam!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was another loud explosion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black mist that shrouded and protected the master of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect immediately shattered. He yelled as he was thrown back a few hundred meters and he had to use all his yuan qi to finally steady himself. His face was as white as a sheet and blood flowed freely down from his slender white fingertips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was injured!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was injured after just one blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless gasps could be heard all around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the elders and disciples of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect were completely struck with fear and they all suddenly looked terrified, as though they had been plunged into bitterly cold ice. These people had always thought that their master's strength was fathomless—he always seemed to be like a god to them. Yet, he was not even able to take one blow from this mysterious newcomer. This showed that the newcomer had to be so powerful that it far surpassed their understanding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This person… was just too terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blood qi surged and rolled over the master of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His yuan qi was close to going ballistic and his eyes were bloodshot. He looked with rage and surprise at the blurry figure who was a flickering stream of light, then he said after some thought, "Sir, we have already formed an alliance with the Greater One Sect. If you leave quietly now, I will not pursue this matter first. I hope that you won't make the wrong decision!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The master of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect already knew at this point that he was no match for this mysterious newcomer even if he were to summon up the full strength of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect. If he continued to battle, they would all be as good as dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, there was no need for them to flee just yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, the Greater One Sect had the support of a mysterious super force from the foreign domains and they were powerful enough to rule over the Clear River Domain. They were extremely influential and since the Heaven Desire Demon Sect were their allies, they would naturally fall under the Greater One Sect's protection. This mysterious expert might be extremely powerful, but he was just one person, so he would definitely be wary of getting on the wrong side of a ruling force such as the Greater One Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He revealed his strongest trump card with those words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But this also meant that he was admitting defeat to this mysterious newcomer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
