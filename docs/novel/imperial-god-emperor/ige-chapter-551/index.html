 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spiritual Master Long Jiao was shocked, and although in disbelief, he was well aware that his Palace Master had torch-like vision, and had rarely misjudged someone before. Since the Palace Master had said that he might not be a match for Hu Bugui, then that is most likely true. But what he could not understand was that the Great Thief, who had only emerged in the recent 10 years, did not belong to any sect or faction, and had no backers or no background. Was it possible for him to be able to suppress him who had been cultivating for tens of thousands of years?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Master of the Sky Demon Palace seemed to have noticed Spiritual Master Long Jiao's unwillingness. He opened his mouth and laughed, “Little dragon, in this world no matter how good you think you are, there is always someone out there who is better. You must not underestimate the heroes in this world. That Hu Bugui’s cultivation is perhaps not as good as you, but the problem is, within his body, there is a wisp of the imperial qi. This is the key, for so many years this little robber had caused many disasters in this domain, but there has been no super force that could kill him, it is because of this wisp of imperial qi.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Imperial qi? This, could it be that...” As soon as Spiritual Master Long Jiao heard this, immediately a stormy sea was set off in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are thinking too much. He is definitely not the incarnation of a Martial Emperor. Perhaps it is just because of a coincidence, but he has a Martial Emperor's blessings. It is better not to provoke this person. After all, any matter that once involves the word Emperor is not what someone like us can contend against.” The Sky Demon Palace Princess smiled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Others naturally could not hear the dialogue between these two important figures of Sky Demon Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene shocked a lot of people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Previously, when they saw that giant mountainous turtle that was full of spirits and had a visible expression, everyone had thought that it was a living thing. It was only now that they realized that this giant turtle was an object transformed with remarkable powers by the Palace Master of Sky Demon Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strength of the Sky Demon Palace master was demonstrated fully.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people who had come to attend the grand meeting today were all famous people within the territory of Clear River Domain; if not a despot, they were a Master of a major sect, if they were not a long time experienced veteran expert, they were a famous rookie genius. Each person’s strength was extremely powerful. With the gathering of so many experts, the surroundings of Storm Platform really could be said as the wind rises and the clouds gather. The aura of nearly ten thousand experts were tumbling like a glow of light or smoke signals, although not deliberately released, but it seemed to be pulled by the mysterious power of the Storm Platform, rising into the air, like cloud pillars and like swords, piercing into the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a scene made the sky and ground change colour.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the tide of yuan qi of the earth itself, under the impact of the energy and qi of the numerous experts, had become disorderly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In such circumstances, if one’s strength was a little weaker, such as a beginner of the Bitter Sea stage, they will also be affected by other people’s aura. This would cause confusion in the yuan qi within one’s body and the possibility of falling into a state of demonic possession.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore the disciples that the Greater One Sect had arranged to watch over the event and to maintain order were all at least in the middle stages of the Bitter Sea stage, and were wearing a protective jade accessory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a moment, there were new changes again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the West direction of the turbulence, a pale blue ancient boat plowed through the sea of clouds, like a little boat on the vast boundless sea. It was seemingly slow, but in a few blinks of the eye, it had come near the Storm Platform. The shape of the blue boat resembled a sword and on the boat stood a tall black-clothed man, strongly built, with a figure straight as a sharp sword, and wearing a dark mask. The corner of his mouth was slighting curved in a strange smile, and on this person's face there was a chilling strange demeanour that sent one shuddering all over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And standing behind him was a figure slightly skinnier than him, similarly in a simple black robe, standing perfectly straight as a javelin, and wearing the same mask on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the mask worn by these figures was a face that was extremely silent, as if never wanting to speak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the people of the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Around 10 days ago, in the odd job worker area at the foothills, Ye Qingyu had seen the black-clothed master and disciple on the ancient boat. He also already knew their backgrounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The burly and tall man in front was the present head of the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect, and that slightly thinner, black figure, was the successor of the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Clear River Domain, the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect had always been a mysterious sect. Ever since it had become famous, there was always only one master and one disciple; everything was passed straight from master to disciple. There are only two people in the entire sect, and after the master dies the successor will automatically become the master, and then the new master will take a long period of time to look for an outstanding disciple. The disciple also must be a rare peerless talent seen in thousands of years. The strictness in accepting a disciple can be considered as ranking first in the whole Clear River Domain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the martial arts of this sect were extremely powerful, almost invincible. The cultivation technique practiced by them was mysterious and unpredictable, especially its sword skills which were well-known throughout the world. They come and go unpredictably and are secretive in their movement and trace, no one had seen the true face of the master and successor of the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For many years, the Master of the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect had remained invincible, succeeding in every battle, and was undisputedly the strongest expert in Clear River Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And the successor of the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect will certainly set off endless waves in the domain, like a comet streaking across the sky, exuding a dazzling light and bringing great pressure to the successor of the major forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most important thing was that this sect acted in somewhat questionable ways. All things were done by the heart. Every time they had attacked, it caused a blood bath, so much blood was shed that it could float a boat, a heaven devastated scene. But all forces and sect that go against this sect ultimately cannot escape such destruction. Wherever they passed, it was as though the end of the world had arrived, so they got the title of Heaven Devastator Demon Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely because they were too strong, close to invincible, that this sect had always been one that only had two people, constantly passing along its tradition and had continued for thousands of years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Also because of this, the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect had a remarkable and unique status in the whole Clear River Domain. Not one person or power dared despise the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was such a prophecy in the Clear River Domain: the numbers of people in Heaven Devastator Demon Sect does not surpass one hundred. If it ever reaches one hundred it will become invincible in the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It can be seen just from this statement alone, that the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect was terrifying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, the unpredictable Heaven Devastator Demon Sect also came to participate in the Storm Sword Meeting, which far exceeded the expectations of many people. Although more than 10 days ago, the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect had appeared in Greater One Sect, but its appearance here today had still sparked astonishment. In a short period of time, an infinite number of eyes had all shifted to the ancient boat. The two indifferent black figures on the ancient boat that seemed to not belong to this world had won countless gazes of awe and respect.&nbsp;</span></p>
