 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But compared to before, this human's strength was many times stronger. The Snow Dragon King was puzzled, and a little unsure. Although he hibernated every year, he could still perceive the outside world. Only around ten years had passed, but why was it that this human's strength had unexpectedly reached this level, and he simply couldn’t clearly see through the white-robed youngster before him. Facing him, it was as though the Snow Dragon King was facing a ripple-less abyss, which made him shudder with fear from the soul.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Snow Dragon King, we meet again.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu greeted him with a smile. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That year his lucky opportunity was obtained from the Snow Dragon’s lair, thus in a way, the Snow Dragons were also one of his benefactors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It really is you?” The Snow Dragon King exclaimed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was certain now. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How could your strength improve this much... could you really be the reincarnation of the Dragon God?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It really was unbelievable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a careful detection, the Snow Dragon King found that, from Ye Qingyu's body, there really were wisps of the aura of a True Dragon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But soon, he chose to surrender.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I came to meet someone,” Ye Qingyu said, walking towards the depths of the Snow Dragon's lair.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the depths was the Snow Dragon cemetery.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the most sacred place of the Snow Dragon Race.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Generally speaking, this cemetery was similar to that of the Dragon Human Race, that they will never allow outsiders to enter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the Snow Dragon King did not stop Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because he was certain that Ye Qingyu was the reincarnation of the Dragon God——even if he was not the reincarnation of the Dragon God, the True Dragon aura around Ye Qingyu was enough to make the Snow Dragon Race extremely reverent and respectful. Therefore, Ye Qingyu naturally was qualified to enter the Snow Dragon cemetery. Adding to this, the many Snow Dragons escorted him like guards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Dragon King showed great humility. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A day ago, there was a swordswoman who forced her way into our Dragon Race cemetery. She is very strong and possesses terrifying strength, like a sword Immortal of the heavens. We could not stop her, fortunately she did not kill, and only drove us away. She is now in the depths of the Snow Dragon cemetery... Lord just said you’re here to meet someone, could it be the swordswoman?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu nodded, “She’s an old friend.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Dragon King and other Snow Dragons were suddenly filled with great respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The friend of the Dragon God was naturally a distinguished guest of the Snow Dragon Race. Fortunately they did not have too much conflict before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In the depths of my Dragon Race cemetery, there had been a strange scene. The former Snow Dragon King had once gone there and then left behind the last words to not allow future generations to enter. It is said that there is a great evil inside. Lord if you want to enter it, you must be careful.” The Snow Dragon King did not hide anything he knew.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu nodded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew that the Snow Dragon King was referring to the mysterious coffin in the depths of the Snow Dragon’s lair, as well as the evil object of the [Blood-soaked Dragon Tooth] that the million-year-old soul had mentioned. It seemed that the Snow Dragon Race did not know much about these things.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The members of the Snow Dragon Race escorted Ye Qingyu to the entrance of the Snow Dragon cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because of the rules of the race, they could not enter any further and could only wait for Ye Qingyu at the entrance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu followed along the path that he had passed before, and went through some ice cave passageways, which was like a maze, but his divine sense was unmatched and soon he found the right way. After a moment, the space before him was suddenly spacious and well lit. He had already arrived at the real dragon cave cemetery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A familiar sight came into view.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had once experienced dangers here with silly dog Little Nine, met the million-year-old soul, and obtained the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] mantra.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Walking along the familiar path, Ye Qingyu came to a towering underground snow mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mountain peaks were like swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fierce qi were circulating around, and with Ye Qingyu’s current cultivation base could feel this much more clearly than before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An object of great evil did indeed exist here, as well as some ancient Dragon Race formations, which were guarding and suppressing something. Back then Ye Qingyu was only a martial artist of the Spirit Spring stage, and even if he had managed to come here, he was not able to detect much. However, when he examined this place again, he could not help feeling a chill running down his spine. He really was too lucky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, there was a sharp sword intent piercing the clouds at the summit of the tremendous snow mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a familiar sword intent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It represented a familiar person. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Teacher Wang Jianru, it has been ten years, how have you been?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu smiled, soaring skywards, and instantly came to the summit of the tremendous underground snow mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the top of the mountain was only a platform of around four thousand square meters in area.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But as though it had been specially polished, the ground was as smooth as a mirror and reflected one's figure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And in the middle of the platform, there was a nine-storey ice crystal altar, like a pyramid, somewhat similar to the ancestral pyramid tombs of the Dragon Human Race emperors. It was sparkling, crystal clear, and without the slightest impurity, and at the top of the altar was a piece of thumb-sized jade.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beside the altar, a figure was standing tall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">White dress, black hair, and long sword.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the female sword Immortal Wang Jianru.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Proud, aloof and incomparably beautiful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected it was her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing this figure, Ye Qingyu almost could not contain his emotions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back then, Wang Jianru went by the alias Wang Yan. Her appearance was ordinary, and had once taught in White Deer Academy, and could be regarded as one of his teachers. After Song Xiaojun's blood was awakened and her power broke out, it was Wang Jianru who destroyed the joint attack of the four sword military leaders and disappeared with Song Xiaojun.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that time, Wang Jianru broke the vault of heaven with one slash. The strength she showed was already very terrifying, and had left a deep impression in Ye Qingyu's mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But now, facing Wang Jianru again, Ye Qingyu was surprised to find that he wasn’t able to determine the strength of this female sword Immortal. It was as though he was facing an ancient bottomless well without the slightest ripple. Given Ye Qingyu's current cultivation level, unless it was a Quasi-emperor, otherwise he could determined the level of any experts standing in front of him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Could it be that Wang Jianru was a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Quasi-emperor</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Impossible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was startled by his own thoughts, and soon dismissed this speculation. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Teacher Wang Jianru, how have you been?” Ye Qingyu tidied up his emotions and bowed. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, it has been more than ten years, who would have thought that the fallen youngster back then would become a top expert whose name shakes the entire Vast Thousand Domains.” The eyes of Wang Jianru really resembled a sharp sword, looking up and down Ye Qingyu. “Even the most crazy fortune teller wouldn’t be able to predict this scene.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu performed the bow of a disciple, saying, “Teacher Wang Jianru is overpraising me. Teacher is the real top expert, student has made a little progress in martial arts but still could not see through the cultivation level of teacher.” Ye Qingyu attempted to find out through words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, it doesn't matter whether my cultivation base is high or low.” Wang Jianru's eyes grew gentler, “When I took Song Xiaojun away, I originally thought you two would not see each other again in this life. I did not expect that fate would be so magical. It will not be long before you two meet again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He understood the meaning of Wang Jianru's words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back then, Song Xiaojun seemed to be hunted by everyone all over the world and was in extreme danger. But there was the real blood of darkness flowing in her body, she was the King of the Unmoving City of Darkness. As long as she returned to the Unmoving City of Darkness, she would be one of the mightiest people of the world. In the Vast Thousand Domains only the high and mighty important people could face her. And at that time, he was just a little student of the little White Deer Academy of the little Deer City in the little Heaven Wasteland Domain. Back then, even if he showed some potential, it would be ridiculous to say that he would grow into one of the top existences of the Vast Thousand Domains. Thus, in Wang Jianru's view, the status that Ye Qingyu had at that time was one hundred eight thousand kilometers away from that of Song Xiaojun. Let alone the fact that he was just a little student, even if he was the emperor of the Snow Empire Human Race, in front of Song Xiaojun, he would still be as little and insignificant as an ant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that time, Wang Jianru firmly believed that Ye Qingyu would not have any contact with Song Xiaojun in the future. Even if Wang Jianru admired Ye Qingyu and was moved by how he risked his life to save Song Xiaojun and to see Song Xiaojun, she thought that Song Xiaojun would forget the past and would also forget Ye Qingyu when she had fused with the blood of darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, life was full of uncertainties, and everything was unpredictable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu's growth was beyond her imagination.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu had shaken the Vast Thousand Domains. Anyone who knew about his achievements would tremble at the sight of him. In the world, there were not many people qualified to stand in front of Ye Qingyu anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, Ye Qingyu was now qualified to stand in front of Song Xiaojun. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have always wanted to know where Song Xiaojun is. I have never given up looking for her,” Ye Qingyu said earnestly. “Since Teacher Wang Jianru knows where Song Xiaojun is, then please tell me. Now I think I have enough strength to stand beside her, and to shield her from the wind and rain?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Jianru nodded, “You are indeed qualified.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This sentence was a complete recognition of the weight of Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu felt his heart lightened upon hearing this, and breathed a sigh of relief. However, he will not know and understand the weight of this sentence, until later when he knew about Wang Jianru’s true identity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, teacher.” Ye Qingyu bowed again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A smile surfaced on Wang Jianru's face, “That year, it was I who took Song Xiaojun from your side, but soon I will bring her back to your side. I hope you still remember your promise back then. No matter what happens, you will firmly stand beside her, and truly shield her from the wind and rain.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu firmly nodded, “So many years have passed, but I did not dare to forget my promise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Jianru nodded with relief. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a pause she then said, “This time I was entrusted by someone to ask you to come, in order to solve the fiendish qi in this fierce land.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You mean the [Blood-soaked Dragon Tooth]?” Ye Qingyu asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Jianru nodded, “Yes, but not just this, the fiendish qi here is not entirely caused by the [Blood-soaked Dragon Tooth]. There is also an unparalleled evil formation... Well, let's first talk about the [Blood-soaked Dragon Tooth], do you know about the origin of this great fearful object?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu shook his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The name came from the mouth of the million-year-old soul, he had no knowledge of it at all. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is the tooth of a Dragon God, and is originally the most supreme sacred object, a rare auspicious object between the heavens and earth. Unfortunately, it had been contaminated with the blood of the Demon Lord. Now there are few objects that can control and suppress it.” Wang Jianru slowly moved closer to the crystal altar. “The only thing that can restrain this dragon tooth is on you.” —</span></p>
