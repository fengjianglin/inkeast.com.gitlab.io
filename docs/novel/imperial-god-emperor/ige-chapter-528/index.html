The colour is not extremely beautiful, but because of the sheer number and the fact that the flower and leaf emitted a strange delicate fragrance that wafts through the air, it made one feel carefree and relax. This was also the origin of the beautiful name Fragrance Plains.</span></p>

Being situated at this lively and bustling place, where it was crammed with people, he couldn’t help but feel somewhat overwhelmed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cross-eyed old man who was sweeping his eyes around with great curiosity and excitement said with smile, “There are numerous underground rivers, there are many dangers. I was trapped for millions of years, it’s good that I was able to can find an exit to the surface. Young man, you are hot tempered and impatient. Remember, to succeed you must remain calm at all times. How do I bring you to success if you’re like this?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After more than one million of years of being trapped, the Old Fish had finally returned to land.

So as soon as he returned to land, he had not activated the slightest yuan qi nor released the slightest fluctuation of yuan qi. It was better to be safe than sorry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the two men escaped from an underground river exit three days ago, they noticed that they were far away from the mountains, and the exit was a lake on the grasslands. After climbing out of the lake, they determined their bearings based on the direction of the sun. They walked in the same direction for more than three days, and had finally came to the capital city of Fragrant Plains, Flowing Light City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Old Fish was in high spirits, like a little child that was finally let out after being grounded for three days and three nights. The changes of the dazzling world made him a little dizzy, but he was amused and entertained by everything, squatting down at each stall, looking curiously and asking questions. But his line of thought, was still in the time of one million years ago, and as a result attracted a lot of laughter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah, little baby, how much is this toy?” The Old Fish crouched down at another stall again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The stall owner was a grey-haired old man who looked hundreds of years old.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment he heard the Old Fish’s words, the old man immediately looked irritated. He scowled and said, “What did you say? Firstly, I am 410 years old this year, you are just around 60 years old, yet you called me a little baby? Secondly, I am not selling toys, but combat puppets, made from fine iron, they are masterpieces. Open your eyes and look carefully, the inside is engraved with pure battle formation, enough to erupt into a full-strength blow of a Bitter Sea boundary expert...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? You’re only more than 400 years old? I thought you’re around 600 years old. Then I have more the reason to call you little baby, I am over one million years old, hehe.” The Old Fish triumphantly showed off his age, and then picked up one of the iron battle puppet, and smiled, “This thing only has the strength of a Bitter Sea expert? In my era, this sort of thing is everywhere, it’s much more advanced than yours. Hey, no matter how many hundred or thousand times you say it, it is still like a toy, what use is there?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon hearing this, the old man suddenly opened his eyes wide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He studied the Old Fish closely, thinking that he had really encountered a master. But on second thought, it didn't feel right, even the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors had not lived to more than 1 million years old. Was this cross-eyed old man playing a joke on him?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who are you?” the old man asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Old Fish was immediately full of enthusiasm, grinning, “Then listen carefully, stand firm, don't be scared, I am Inspiration king, the immemorial King of the Quicksand Sea of the immemorial Fiendgod Age, who governs the tens of thousands of Aquatic Race of the endless waters, even the immemorial Dragon Race was respectful to me. Back then I had more than 10 battle divisions, nine army of troops, eight war gods, seven concubines...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before he could finish his sentence, the old man was already certain that he was a lunatic or a conman, and had completely lost interest, “Leave, leave, leave, damn cross eye, obstructing me from doing business, hurry leave.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey? You little baby, how could you say that?” The Old Fish was unwilling to leave things at that.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu could feel cold sweats forming on his forehead as he stood watching at one side. He hurriedly pulled the Old Fish away from the stall without a backward glance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only when he blindly walked down a few streets, that Ye Qingyu loosened the Old Fish’s hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why did you drag me away, I haven’t really taught that little baby yet.” The Old Fish’s voice was very dissatisfied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu sighed, “King, can we be a little more low profile? You’re background is so remarkable and you talk too much, what if you scared the old man to death?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Old Fish was still huffing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu sighed again. “Besides, I am now being hunted by two powerful forces, I am under extreme danger, please do not give me trouble. Your Dao injury has also not healed yet, which means that you cannot fight. If those wicked people know of your identity, then the whole world will turn crazy, everyone will want to capture you. They will use all kinds of torture to force you to expose the whereabouts of the Thunder and Lightning Emperor. If you do not tell them then they will most likely make you into steamed carp soup.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Old Fish’s eyes popped wide open when he heard this, “They dare...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But then he was very well behaved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two people wandered aimlessly around Flowing Light City all morning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Origin crystal that Ye Qingyu had with him could be used as currency, which the Old Fish demanded to use to buy some random things that had no use, and was purely for fun. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, Ye Qingyu, who couldn’t stand it any longer, said irritably, “I can forget the other things that you bought before, but you spent a full five kilograms of Origin crystal on a formation fishing rod and dragon excrement bait.

He struck the enemies on the ground repeatedly with a sword and then, regardless of the other injured and wailing companions, strode over in big steps, eagerly peeled down a pure silver-coloured notice sheet from the wall, and said laughing, “The Greater One Sect’s notice on this street, us brothers have got it, who is not satisfied, stand out now, hahaha.”&nbsp;</span></p>

Haha, three months ago, Greater One Sect issued a Greater One notice, to kill a perverted thief named Ye Qingyu within a radius of hundreds of thousands of miles. Anyone that has a Greater One notice, if they kill that perverted thief or report back the whereabouts of that perverted thief will have the opportunity of joining Greater One Sect.

Don't be embarrassed, we are both men, I can understand, your physical body is so strong, and your blood and qi are so vigorous, it is understandable that you seek exuberance.
