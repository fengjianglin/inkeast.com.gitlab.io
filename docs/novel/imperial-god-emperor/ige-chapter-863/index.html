His consciousness power, which had been exhausted after catching stars and reading those techniques, was now back to its peak condition. He seemed full of energy and his spirit was as full as it could be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Eight hundred thirty-one."</span></p>

This was the total number of secret technique manuals that he had committed to memory after spending nine days in the [Infinite Arsenal]. His luck had held up, for the Human Race technique manuals had made up more than half of the manuals he read, at five hundred ten, and the remaining three hundred twenty-one were techniques of the foreign races.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These foreign race techniques were also incredibly useful to him since it was not only the Human Race that lived in the Heaven Wasteland Domain, but there were also the Demon Race, Brute Race, and other minority races.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The techniques that were stored within the [Infinite Arsenal] were all extraordinary techniques. The weakest technique that he came across was known as the [Gentle Water Cleansing Formula] and at its peak it could unleash a water-type divine ability comparable to a pinnacle Immortal Step realm martial artist. This ability within the Heaven Wasteland Domain would be considered by all sects as an outstanding divine technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu had never lacked combat skills because of the [Fiendgod Titled Chart] from the bronze book. Nonetheless, there was still a slight difference between combat skills and techniques. Combat skills were techniques that could be employed in battles to kill, while techniques were secret skills that could be used to increase one's cultivation and refine one's yuan qi. Ye Qingyu was still lacking in the area of techniques, so these eight hundred and thirty-one techniques would be more than sufficient for him to plug the gap in the martial way of the Heaven Wasteland Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These techniques were not meaningful to Ye Qingyu, so he merely memorized them but did not plan on cultivating any of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason was simple.</span></p>

Second, the highest level amongst those techniques he read could only be cultivated to a maximum of the Peak Great Saint realm and his goal stretched far beyond that realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I've only got one more day left here."</span></p>

He took a deep breath and continued to catch and read the techniques in the Void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time flew by.</span></p>

He knew that he had probably reached his memory's limit. After all, he was committing to memory the contents of these scriptures and techniques of the martial way. These were no ordinary materials, so the difficulty level was extremely high.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, when Ren Puyang had fought for the chance for Ye Qingyu to enter the [Infinite Arsenal], he thought that it would be amazing if Ye Qingyu could memorize and comprehend thirty to forty technique manuals. If anyone found out what he had achieved in a short span of ten days, they would probably be scared out of their minds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu sensed a faint repellent force slowly spreading across the [Infinite Arsenal], as though it was trying to squeeze him out of the area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that his time was almost up.</span></p>

He could not help but be overcome with admiration for the nameless Martial Emperor who had established this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a man would be on the level of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors back in those days, but for some reason, he did not even leave his name or honorific title behind.</span></p>

Any manual that contained the words ”Great Dao” in the [Infinite Arsenal] could be considered to be the ultimate treasure.</span></p>

He stood dazedly rooted to the spot as though those words contained a magical spell. As he contemplated those words, all that he had experienced so far flashed past his mind like lightning, and it was just like his body was slowly cleansed of something that resembled wind or dust.</span></p>

There was a strange expression on his face, but he was otherwise in good spirits.</span></p>

This was only my duty. Please follow me. Lord Ren Puyang had given me orders to bring you to him after you left the [Infinite Arsenal]." Divine Guard Xiao Lin had stood outside the [Infinite Arsenal] for ten days, but there were no signs of fatigue on his face and he still smiled warmly at Ye Qingyu.</span></p>

He thought for a moment, then asked Luo Yi to invite Empress Yu Xiaoxing, Wen Wan, Ximen Yeshui, Yan Buhui, and Old Fish, who were from the higher echelon of the envoy mission, to the meeting hall.</span></p>

Little Ye Qingyu, you must have struck it big in there. I heard that there are countless divine techniques and secret manuals within the [Infinite Arsenal], including Quasi-emperor-level mental techniques. How did you fare this time? Did you manage to obtain a Quasi-emperor-level mental technique?" Old Fish asked gleefully.</span></p>

The number of manuals within the [Infinite Arsenal] is as vast as the sea with no end in sight. Everything came down to luck and over the past ten days, I read close to one thousand manuals and the best ones were merely Peak Great Saint level techniques."</span></p>

To a martial artist, a martial way technique was even more attractive and alluring than a peerless beauty.</span></p>

Unfortunately, they lacked a great master to provide proper guidance, but if they obtained techniques to aid them, it would be the equivalent of a great master by their side.</span></p>

A large majority of the envoy mission will return along with me. We also received word from the Alliance of Domains a few days ago that they will allocate a plot of land for the Heaven Wasteland Domain to establish a representative station within Heaven Connect City. Therefore, we will also need a few people to be stationed here."</span></p>

Yes, this is indeed good news… Oh yes, I have something to announce as well. I met Master Ren Puyang before I returned and he agreed to give these fifty Black Gold Puppets to the Heaven Wasteland Domain. These are the tokens to control the puppets and Master Ren Puyang had already divided them into four parts. I'll hand them over right now and you may bring these puppets back with you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he handed the four tokens to Yu Xiaoxing, Wen Wan, Ximen Yeshui, Yan Buhui, and Old Fish.</span></p>

Their defensive capabilities would definitely be strengthened now that they had these Black Gold Puppets, which were comparable to Saint realm experts.</span></p>

Ren Puyang must really have high hopes for you." Old Fish's face broke into a smile and his eyes twinkled mischievously.&nbsp;</span></p>
