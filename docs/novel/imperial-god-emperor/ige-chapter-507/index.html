He did not want too many people to know about this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The main reasons for this was that, apart from this being a significantly important matter, Ye Qingyu did not want to expose the fact that he knew how to refine weapons currently. After all, whether it was the [Cloud Top Cauldron] or the [Fiendgod Tilted Chart], these were items that were far too important. Once it was exposed, the danger of owning such a treasure would bring trouble to him. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; This was especially so after the Central Domain Gate had been opened. In the situation where the power of other domains were seeping in, Ye Qingyu had to be even more careful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Above the earth fire sword pit.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; After all, these were all ingredients that were rare and precious. They were hard to obtain. If he threw it like so down the earth fire sword pit, what would happen if ithey were &nbsp;incinerated by the underground fire?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; But after a slight hesitation, Gao Han still complied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; This was not only the fact that Ye Qingyu was his superior. The more important reason was that Ye Qingyu had already become a figure that was mighty and mysterious, as if there was nothing he could not do. As long as he followed Ye Qingyu's words, he would basically not be wrong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; His palm moving, a space storage metal flew out from Gao Han's hands. It floated above the earth fire sword pit. Then according to Ye Qingyu's request, all the rare materials that had been gathered were thrown down from above the sword pit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; All sorts of items began falling down like rain.</span></p>

There were immortal metals, Ethyl Essence powder, Angelica ore, Emperor copper, Abyss metal, Geng heart soil, Blood wood etc. These were all rarely seen refining and smelting ingredients. Even many ancient wealthy families would be hard put to assemble such a variety of treasured divine materials.</span></p>

Even in the entire empire, such divine and treasured materials were important strategic class resources. The Right Minister's residence and the military department should not so easily hand it over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; He did not imagine that after he had made Gao Han say such words, in less than four hours of time, the Right Minister's residence as well as the military department had already sent people to deliver such materials. Furthermore, there were even more than they had initially asked for.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>

Releasing a strange attracting force, all the divine treasured materials were absorbed within, without any being missed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; There were in total eight spaces within the [Cloud Top Cauldron].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Each of these eight different spaces had a different use, all unique. Ye Qingyu had not completely grasped the use of each.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Such as the space that had imprisoned the large majority of Ye Qingyu's spirit. It's use was unknown and mysterious. Even today he was observing the interior walls of the cauldron, refining his spirit and strengthening his consciousness, but he still could not completely control it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; But as for the space used for smelting and refining tools and weapons, with the understanding that Ye Qingyu possessed today regarding the [Cloud Top Cauldron], he could already control it according to his own will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; He activated the ancient characters and further divided this refining space into sub spaces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Apart from the space needed to refine the blood vine bone endowment bone, the fallen treasured materials were treated the same as the remnants of the [Little Shang] sword and all the other weapons. They were divided at the first instant according to what attribute of the five elements they belonged to, falling into different spaces to refine. This was the preparations that had to be made before the sword could be formed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Smelting and refining was similar to cooking, it needed expert knowledge of the type of heat to be used.</span></p>

Only then could a complete degree of integration be achieved, otherwise it would all be for naught. Forcefully integrating every material would only lead to a failure and cause the energy to explode within the material.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Although this was Ye Qingyu's first time refining a tool, but the methods and technique he had learnt to refine was not normal. The weapon he was creating was also a rarely seen weapon of the God and Devil Age. The preparations he had made beforehand were very full and in detail, so the whole process was like moving clouds and flowing water, without the slightest of mistake being made.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; In the blink of an eye, a day passed by just like so.</span></p>

It madly began surging, wanting to break free from the constraints of the [Cloud Top Cauldron] and escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The blood red light, was like a berserk vine. It let out demonic howl that entered through his every pore. Ye Qingyu saw this scene and could not help but be fearful.</span></p>

One could imagine just how terrifying a fully grown and matured blood vine would be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Lin Yi had said that a fully matured blood vine could even annihilate a Heaven Ascension stage expert.

Although in the end, they were both injured, but it was finally able to receive the endowment bone of the blood vine. The power it must have held was enough to make one shiver. And this was evidently not the strongest existence amongst the Demon Spider Race. Just how terrifying was the power of the Demon Spider Race?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu, gained an even more direct understanding of the enemies’ power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The blood qi of the blood vine madly struck and struggled within the [Cloud Top Cauldron], wanting to escape. But it had after all lost it's main body, so it was hard to maintain this and keep up the struggle. No matter what, it could not escape. It then transformed into its original form, the size of a finger. Like a loach into water, it wanted to enter into space, breaking apart space and escaping...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; But very quickly the walls of the [Cloud Top Cauldron] flashed, causing the blood vine to be knocked against the walls of the cauldron. No matter how it struggled, it could not escape. &nbsp;</span></p>

He used it to operate the [Cloud Top Cauldron], once again borrowing the power of the earth fire sword pit to refine that blood vine endowment bone.</span></p>

The formation chain was extrated one by one, like a link of tightly clustered blood chains. It began floating aimlessly about in the cauldron, flickering with a translucent radiance. it was extremely beautiful and could be described as a masterpiece of creation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The other treasured materials were also refined to a stage where it could be begun to be integrated with the other ingredients.</span></p>

According to the steps on the [Fiendgod Titled Chart], he began to lift away the subdivisions of the refining space. Using the [Little Shang] sword as the center, the [Beheading Wind] sword as the bones and the other divine metals, treasured materials as the flesh and body, he truly began refining and creating the [Blood Drinker Sword].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; In the refining technique with the [Fiendgod Titled Chart] for the [Blood Drinker Sword], it did not have a set outer form from the [Blood Drinker Sword]. In this perspective, Ye Qingyu could casually design as he pleased. His initial thought was to have it as a sword-like form, exactly the same as the [Little Shang] sword, to cherish the memory of his departed parents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The entire process of smithing the sword was more involved and complex than the process of refining the ingredients.</span></p>

But because there was the existence of the formation chains that were extracted from the blood vine endowment bone, everything once again became possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The challenge that Ye Qingyu faced was to integrate the formation chains one after another from the blood vine endowment bone into the sword body of the [Blood Drinker Sword] that was being created. Ye Qingyu had to merge the two into one, giving the sword body a spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; This entire process, was somewhat difficult and slow.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; After who knows how long later, Ye Qingyu's consciousness finally began slowly retreating from within the [Cloud Top Cauldron]. An unprecedented weariness struck his whole body. His consciousness was like it was withered, and he could even sense a hunger that he had never felt before afflicting him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; But on his face, there was an uncontrollable smile that appeared.</span></p>

One could see that the body of the blade, like it was alive, expanded and contracted, beating just like a heart. It vibrated and moved slightly. The shape and outer exterior of it was largely similar to the [Little Shang] sword of the past, and it matched with Ye Qingyu's initial imagination and design.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "According to what is recorded on that page in the [Fiendgod Titled Chart], it needs to be nourished and refined for another day or two before it can be taken out of the cauldron..."</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; But at that time, a sudden sharp acute quaking was spread here. The entire earth fire sword pit began acutely shaking and the scorching hot lava was like it was a tsunami as it began to grow violent. Like an earthquake, the entire sword pit was moving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "What happened?"</span></p>

All the fingers in both his hands were like brushes, continuing to write the eight ancient characters in the air, the 'Seal' characters. With a fierce push, the ancient characters pushed out, and all of them fell into the [Cloud Top Cauldron]. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; As long as he sealed the cauldron, the refinement of the blood sword would not be interrupted.</span></p>

It was as if some terrifyingly apocalyptic demon was about to descend. The ground began to fiercely shake, and what followed after that was vicious demonic howls. Like a hurricane, it began spreading about everywhere...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; At this moment, Ye Qingyu finally realized what had happened.</span></p>

Paying a glance at the [Cloud Top Cauldron] he ultimately decided to leave it behind there and continue to borrow the energy of the underground lava to refine the [Blood Drinker Sword]. Then both his legs exerted power. With a boom, his entire person was like a cannon that shot up, heading towards the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; When he was still about ten meters from the ground, one of his hands inserted into the stone wall. His body suddenly stopped, and then he took out new clothing from his storage ring and put it on. With a sudden exertion of force, he jumped to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The moment he landed on the ground, Ye Qingyu looked at the huge Central Domain Gate.</span></p>
