 <p>353 - Beheading Wind</p>
 <p>Therefore, he also understood Ye Qingyu very well.</p>
 <p>In truth, from the documents of these eighteen young experts, Ye Qingyu's cultivation was not the highest, nor was he the youngest. His background was also not the poorest nor was his achievements the greatest. But Ye Qingyu's cultivation techniques were definitely the most mysterious, and his battle records were the most inexplicable.</p>
 <p>He was also the person that Bao Shinu was most interested in.</p>
 <p>Bao Shinu after all had carefully investigated his history in Ye Qingyu's documents. In truth, there were too many mysteries contained within.</p>
 <p>What was the most inexplicable was that from all the information and material the military department had gathered, apart from how his parents had obtained that bronze military badge - this was something that Bao Shinu did not have the power to investigate any further, there were no holes in it whatsoever. Ye Qingyu's background did not have any inconsistencies, and his learning process within White Deer Academy was also something that was well-evidenced. The speed at which his strength increased was unbelievable, it was enough to make one's mouth gape open in surprise.</p>
 <p>In the martial alliance meeting at Youyan Pass, Ye Qingyu had killed the [Tiger Child] of the Dragon Tiger Sect, Zhao Shanhe, and forced Li Qiushui of the Crepe Myrtle Sect to die. This was a battle achievement that was enough to shake the world. But from the details at that time, Ye Qingyu had been forced to the brink by the two martial experts, and he had only abruptly exploded at the most crucial time…</p>
 <p>Therefore, it was not possible for Ye Qingyu to have concealed his cultivation.</p>
 <p>The only explanation that could explain this was that there was a great treasure hidden on him.</p>
 <p>He had activated this treasure at a crucial time, and relied on its explosive power to turn defeat into victory.</p>
 <p>After collating all the stories of Ye Qingyu escaping from the hands of the vicious demon Yan Buhui, Bao Shinu could be sure that Ye Qingyu must have relied on some external power.</p>
 <p>But even if so, he still had high expectations for Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Despite him relying on external power, but there were many times that external power and treasures were also a part of one's martial strength. This represented that he was someone with fortune and luck, this was something he could not deny.</p>
 <p>Therefore, after the self-cultivation lesson had begun, Bao Shinu had always paid attention to Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>But right now...</p>
 <p>"Why is there no movement, could it be he has not comprehended the nine moves of the [Dragon Fist] at all or..."</p>
 <p>Bao Shinu's heart was somewhat confused.</p>
 <p>But he did not directly ask.</p>
 <p>Although his identity was an instructor, Bao Shinu could not be sure what kind of duty these 18 young experts would be given after a month of training. Without question, the future of these youths was great. For instructors such as them, right now, leaving a good impression would perhaps be of use when they needed to rely on these youths in the future.</p>
 <p>With such an atmosphere, the lesson of the afternoon quickly ended.</p>
 <p>In this entire morning, Bao Shinu had taught the [Dragon Fist] manual. Apart from the nine moves, there were also nine parts to the heart sutra. It could be used with each of the nine actions to improve the effect of refining one's body. All the talents of the young experts were exceptional and their strength great. But even they spent a long amount of time, before they began to grasp it.</p>
 <p>When it was time for lunch, Ye Qingyu once again acted in the chaos and obtain two pounds of Origin crystal into his hands.</p>
 <p>At that time, he had already largely confirmed the level of these young experts.</p>
 <p>The large majority of them were around the eighty Spirit springs stage. They were existences that could break past the barrier of the Spirit spring stage into the Bitter Sea stage at any time. They could be known as half a step in the Bitter Sea stage. But these young experts, all had ambition and determination, and wanted to achieve something greater. They were not satisfied with the foundation of eighty Spirit springs to have when they entered into the Bitter Sea stage, they wanted to excavate even more Spirit springs.</p>
 <p>Only the bronze-colored young man with fire red hair they saw at the start, the black-robed young man, that huge beast-like young man and a pale yellow long haired person that seemed tired and yawning all the time, they were different. These four people should have already entered into the Bitter Sea stage. Ye Qingyu could not even tell how many Spirit springs they had before they entered into the Bitter Sea stage.</p>
 <p>These four young experts had attracted Ye Qingyu's attention.</p>
 <p>But it was only his attention.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu had the confidence that in a direct battle, he could instantly defeat them.</p>
 <p>This was a self-confidence that originated from being a martial expert.</p>
 <p>The afternoon lesson was training in weapon techniques.</p>
 <p>There was another instructor that handed out weapons to every young expert. Every one of them a Spirit class weapon. It's power was strong, and it was said it was a product of the head of the Weapon formation master in the Imperial Group of Masters. One weapon was worth thousands of gold; it was an elite product amongst elite products.</p>
 <p>Everyone received a different weapon.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu obtained a gigantic beheading great sword, called [Beheading Wind].</p>
 <p>This was a huge sword that was shaped extremely weirdly. It was two meters long, with the hilt roughly around half a meter. It was suited for two hands to hold, and the width of the blade itself was about half a meter. It was silver-coloured, and it had not been used. On the two sides of the blade were two channels for blood outlets. There weren’t any sharp points on the blade, and it was in a half oval curve shape. The sword blade was asthick as a palm at the central part but at the edges, it was only as thick as a finger.</p>
 <p>If one ignored the sword hilt, this gigantic sword looked like the embryo of a sword that had not undergone any smelting or smithing.</p>
 <p>"Such a sword is like heavy steel. It is best used to bash people, but someone called it [Beheading Wind]?"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu held the gigantic sword, swinging it slightly.</p>
 <p>The weight was perfect.</p>
 <p>There was a strange sensation as it entered into his hand, as if it was born fit for him.</p>
 <p>With the state of Ye Qingyu's fleshly body refinement, he did not need to fluctuate his inner yuan. By solely relying on the power of his fleshly body, he could lift hundreds of thousands of pounds. This heavy sword was roughly ten thousand pounds, a normal martial artist would not even be able to lift it up let alone treat it as a weapon. It was even heavier than the Heavy spear that Ye Qingyu chose, the [Inexorable Spear], by tens of times.</p>
 <p>"The military department has really invested this time. This is really too generous. They provide divine herbs, divine medicines as well as Origin crystal for our three meals. Even the weapons are Spirit class weapons..." Ye Qingyu breathed in a breath of cold air, "Not to mention other things, just the extent of expenditure of these eighteen people this entire month, is enough to rival the profits from the Dugu Organization for half a year."</p>
 <p>This time, the military department as well as the Imperial family had really invested heavily.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu had pondered over the ancient characters, [Sole Will of the Heaven and Earth Cauldron], so he also had some skill in the smithing of weapons. He could tell with one glance that the material on the surface of the [Beheading Wind] that was like silver or moonlight, was namely the legendary [Divine Moonlight Steel].</p>
 <p>This was an exceedingly rare heavy material for Spirit weapons .According to the tales, a piece of [Divine Moonlight Steel] that was a finger's size weighed several hundred pounds. It was ranked number five in the top ten divine materials. Only a similar weight of Origin crystal could be exchanged for a similar weight of [Divine Moonlight Steel].</p>
 <p>As for the other materials of the [Beheading Wind], Ye Qingyu could not tell what it was.</p>
 <p>But he could be sure, it was definitely made from extremely precious materials.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu faintly inserted his yuan qi. The surface of the sword that was originally as smooth as water, suddenly had a layer of frost qi fluctuating on it. There were hundreds of small and large formations activating, as it let out a quick, delighted hum that sounded out clearly from within the Heavy sword.</p>
 <p>"Good sword!"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu could not help but sigh in admiration.</p>
 <p>The class of this [Beheading Wind], compared to the [Little Shang sword], was much higher.</p>
 <p>With his power at the Stream state of the Bitter Sea stage, he could fully activate its true power.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu looked at the people beside him.</p>
 <p>Every young expert had an expression of drunken happiness. They had evidently obtained a weapon they were extremely satisfied with.</p>
 <p>This fire red-coloured, long haired young man had obtained a scarlet red two-headed long spear that was like snow. there were formations contained within that could make it retract or extend. It had an unlimited amount of transformations in his hand, and had extraordinary power. As for that two meter tall muscular young man, he had obtained an incomparably large golden purple thunder hammer. The young man with pale yellow hair had obtained two projectiles that were like jade pieces. It was exceedingly fragile and exquisite, that jumped and flitted about agilely throughout his five fingers. The black-robed young man had obtained a black-coloured sword. There was no need to sheath it at his waist. The black-coloured sword lithely wrapped around him, like a special kind of belt...</p>
 <p>Hearing the sighs of admiration of the young experts around him, there was a thought that flashed in Ye Qingyu's mind.</p>
 <p>"I understand now. These weapons must be made according to the way they fight, the power of their body and the state of their cultivation. That's why it fits them so well. In other words, the orders of the military department that told me to only report to the Snow Capital after three months must be because they needed to spend every second preparing weapons for us, as well as creating the training programme..."</p>
 <p>When the machine of the empire began working, the power and efficiency it worked with was really enough to stun.</p>
 <p>Twenty people. That was twenty peak class Spirit weapons. To think it could be created in the short period of three months. In the entire Heaven Wasteland Domain, apart from the Snow Empire, even the Three Schools and Three Sects or the Demon Race could not perform such a feat? Although two people had died on their way here, but they must have prepared weapons for them also. It was only that it could not be of use.</p>
 <p>Understanding this point, apart from being shocked ,Ye Qingyu could not help but also being confused.</p>
 <p>This time, the Empire had invested so heavily in them. Just what was their plan for them?</p>
 <p>The greater the investment, the greater the wish for a great return.</p>
 <p>Just what kind of matter could these eighteen people including himself do, that it would not waste such an investment?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu began to feel that this matter was not as simple as it seemed in the beginning.</p>
 <p>"These Spirit weapons are approved by the Imperial family of the Empire. It was supervised by the current Crown Prince, and he had personally invited the [Divine Worksmith] Luo Feng to smith it after continuous days of work. It has been created by everyone's preferences as well as cultivation techniques. The Crown Prince has ordered, that as long as everyone is able to pass through the examination of the military department after one month, then the Spirit weapons in your hands will always belong to you,” the Instructor shouted loudly.</p>
 <p>The faint sounds of cheers rang out.</p>
 <p>Since the ancient heroes had loved beauties, but heros loved divine weapons even more.</p>
 <p>A good horse fitted a good whip. A weapon that fitted a person would absolutely increase the battle power of a martial expert's strength by a great extent. In a battle between experts, even a small increase of battle power, was decisive.</p>
 <p>"Our thanks to his highness, the Crown Prince."</p>
 <p>Everyone shouted.</p>
 <p>"Thank you Crown Prince."</p>
 <p>The young experts all expressed their gratitude loudly.</p>
