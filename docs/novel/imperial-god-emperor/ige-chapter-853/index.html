Sighing softly, Yu Xiaoxing looked at Ye Qingyu and said, "Before I rushed back here, there were some people causing trouble outside. I heard that there are a few divine temple guards, together with some other people, blocking the doorway. They seem to have come for elder sister Qin and her son."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because he had an excellent impression of Qin Hui and sympathized greatly with her misfortunes, Ye Qingyu had by now started to call her an elder sister.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It's... those rebels from the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect." Qin Hui finally calmed her nerves, albeit her tone remained somewhat alarmed. Filled with a strong hatred, she gnashed her teeth and explained, "That scoundrel, Elder Mingjue, must've somehow found out that we were here and bribed a few divine temple guards to allow his pursuit. He's one of my husband's murderers, and is intent on killing our whole family!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So that's the case.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished listening, Ye Qingyu roughly understood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Speak of the devil indeed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To think that these people from the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect are actually this impatient and have arrived so fast. However, because this place is protected by divine guards, nobody without a nameplate is able to barge their way in, and so Elder Mingjue and the rest can only stay put outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their tentacles have yet to reach into the side hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Still, this kind of environment cannot be any more dangerous for Qin Hui and her son.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Making eye contact with Qin Hui's fear-filled eyes, he said laughingly, "Mr. Ren Puyang has put me in charge of this matter. Don't worry, with me around, nobody from the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect will be able to lay a finger on you or your son."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These words were cocky indeed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they were not just hot air. The master of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect, Tian Huayu, was initially able to control the sect despite only having the cultivation of the Pinnacle of the Immortal Step realm. When he was alive, those rebels did not cause any disturbance, showing that their strength was, at most, also at the pinnacle of the Immortal Step realm, which Ye Qingyu had little regard for even though his strength had not yet fully recovered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, he had the colossus that was Ren Puyang backing him up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his current state of mind, he was completely unafraid of the coming of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect rebels, and was instead more worried of them giving up, which would deny him a reason to take action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Hui's eyes lit up and stared fixedly at Ye Qingyu after she heard those words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Wonderful! Mama, big brother says he'll protect us!" Despite his young age, Tian Ning understood what Ye Qingyu meant and jumped up excitedly at once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since some time ago, this young child had begun to have complete trust in Ye Qingyu and believe that he could fulfill all of his promises.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Qin Hui certainly did not think the same way. As the matriarch of an ancient sect with such a long and rich history as the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect, she naturally understood the implications and stakes involved. Although Ye Qingyu appeared to be of high status and could even associate with Mr. Ren Puyang, he was after all just a young human whose strength and status were not on Mr. Ren Puyang's level, and thus it was not guaranteed that he would be able to protect them and deal with those rebel elders and disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nevertheless, as much as she had her worries, she had little choice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among the myriad domains, there was probably no one but Ye Qingyu who was willing to protect the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Don't worry, just follow us out. I'd like to see which wretched thing would dare to touch you while I'm around." Ye Qingyu had absolutely no misgivings, having been advised by Ren Puyang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That's right, you don't have to worry. Since elder brother Ye Qingyu has promised to help you, both of you will be safe." Yu Xiaoxing smiled tenderly, also looking rather confident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Heaven Wasteland empress did not know what Mr. Ren Puyang said to Ye Qingyu after she left, or why the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect's matter would suddenly be given to Ye Qingyu to handle, she believed that Ye Qingyu definitely had his ideas and plans for him to have taken responsibility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the situation, the white-robed divine guard Xiao Lin pondered before saying, "If that's the case, why don't I escort the few of you out? I also want to see what these people who dare to cause trouble outside an Alliance of Domains divine temple side hall look like."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By following them out, he could not only help but also remind Ye Qingyu not to create too much of a fuss, for this would be in violation of the Alliance's laws, it being within the area of an Alliance divine temple after all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Thank you so much." Ye Qingyu nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The party of five quickly arrived at the doorway of the divine temple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as Ye Qingyu stepped out of the divine temple while leading Qin Hui and her son, a long swishing sound was heard before several dozen flickering figures charged up to the party from oblique directions and surrounded them without allowing any explanation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their leader was a lanky, long-bearded old man with an aquiline nose, a gloomy face, and malicious eyes. Giving off a radiance while huffing and puffing, he was clearly a cruel and malevolent man. The extremely powerful aura from his body also indicated that he had attained the pinnacle of the Immortal Step realm and was just short of the Half-Saint realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aside from him, there were three black-armored divine guards and six middle-aged experts wearing standardized long robes. Their auras were not too weak either, being at the Immortal Step realm, and their faces looked extremely fierce. Inconspicuously, they had blocked off the party's route of retreat back to the side hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sweeping a glance across these people, Ye Qingyu simply sneered without saying anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instead, it was that lanky aquiline-nosed old man who spoke in a chilly voice after casting his sharp gaze across Qin Hui and her son with a strong killing intent, "Bitch, how dare you act so unwomanly and betray your sect. You must've gone mad to run to this kind of place. Unfortunately for you, justice has long arms. Looks like you finally cannot bear it any longer and have decided to come out of hiding. Now, be good and return with me to be disciplined..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Hui became so angry that she convulsed all over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Mingjue is truly deceitful and distortive of the truth. To think he would lay the blame on and slander me when he's clearly the one who has betrayed his sect and hunted down the master's descendants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mingjue you scumbag, don't you dare slander me like this, you..." Although Qin Hui possessed martial cultivation, yet being a woman after all, she had lived a comfortable life for too long and was thus unable to say anything too heated. Plus, because her hate was too deep, she could not complete her sentence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Mingjue did not even take a second look at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was already dead in his eyes, and so he felt there was no need to say anything further.</span></p>

Seeing that they were young, did not bring any guards with them, and did not look like important personages, he paid them scant respect and sneered, "My two young friends, do you happen to know this bitch and want to intervene? Hoho, this is a family matter of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect. I would urge you not to butt in and instead to leave quickly for your own sake."</span></p>

I shall give you another chance to leave on your accord."</span></p>

Hmm, six people in total. Your luck is not bad, I'm in a pretty good mood today and don't want to kill anyone, or otherwise this scumbag's pretentious show of might would've resulted in seven dead bodies... Get lost."</span></p>

You must be tired of living, you..."</span></p>

His raised finger remained in mid-air while the other hand was covering his neck, where a sword mark had appeared. His throat made weird coughing noises while his expression was that of astonishment and terror, with his entire being seemingly petrified. The latter half of his admonition would never be uttered.</span></p>

Although they then fragmented, there was absolutely no smell of blood, and instead there was a kind of melodious noise.</span></p>

Everything, be it the robes, weapon, flesh, bones, or viscera, became jade-like ice before fragmenting with a bam and turning into bright silver-colored ice bits that scattered on the ground...</span></p>

For some time, his mind was blank, unable to believe anything he was seeing. From the beginning, he did not believe for a minute that anyone would dare to use force in front of a divine temple side hall of the Alliance of Domains, and would even kill so brazenly.</span></p>

By following Elder Mingjue these days, their status within the sect had risen greatly, affording them a taste of power and causing their egos to swell to the extreme. Therefore, when they came to Heaven Connect City and the Alliance's divine temple, they behaved extremely arrogantly and conceitedly.</span></p>

Despite also being known for their swordcraft, the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect was completely floored by that stroke which was as chilly as an ice cave.</span></p>
