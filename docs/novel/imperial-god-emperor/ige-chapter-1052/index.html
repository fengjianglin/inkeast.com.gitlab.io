 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Save people? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It turned out to be for that reason. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu's mind was racing with countless thoughts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Could it be a trap? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the First Deputy Envoy wanted to frame him, the most effective plan was to use this method, luring him to save the subordinates of Lin Yutang, and then frame him for collusion with the traitor Lin Yutang. That would definitely put him in a very bad position.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But there was also the possibility that it wasn’t a trap. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yutang had said that his former close subordinates had all mysteriously disappeared, many of which had been dismissed. This matched with Tang Chong's statement. It was well known that, when Ren Puyang was still around, Tang Chong and Lin Yutang's relationship was very good; thus it was reasonable for Tang Chung to protect Lin Yutang's close subordinates. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu had only thought over it for a moment before he came to a decision. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let's go, take me there.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He got up, and ignored the Great Great Dragon Turtle Demon, who had been making eye signals beside him. He left the Heaven Wasteland Building with Tang Chong. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whether it was a trap or not, Ye Qingyu had to go. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He couldn’t leave the loyal White-robed Divine Guards to be slaughtered. Ren Puyang had already been killed. The loyal and righteous people of the Human Race headquarters were in a disadvantageous position. The White-robed Divine Guards, who the First Deputy Envoy was after, were Human Race elites loyal to Ren Puyang and thus must not die. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The West District of Heaven Connect City. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to the prosperity of the other three districts, the west side was relatively rustic. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, this was only in comparison - the most shabby place in Heaven Connect City was also a thriving place compared to other cities and domains.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blue Cloud Manor was not a particular famous manor in the West District, and the Lord of the manor, a martial artist of the Human Race, dwelled in deep seclusion and rarely came out. The majority of his time was spent in cultivation. Very few people had seen this mysterious expert, who bought this manor decades ago and had been living in harmony with the neighbours all this time. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the sky, fragments of snowflakes were still fluttering.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was already dusk. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The main entrance to Blue Cloud Manor was on Wuqing Street.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wuqing street, one of the ten great streets in the West District, was wide and flat, and could accommodate twenty carriages running side by side. There were shops on both sides of the street, people were shuttling back and forth. Even if the sun was about to set, it was still as bustling as before. Many wine shops, restaurants, inns had lit formation lanterns, ready to welcome the night.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The day and night of Heaven Connect City were not much different. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a hurried warning sound rattled across Wuqing street. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All beings on the street had an abrupt change of expression. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a clatter of hooves as white torrents poured in from both the east and west side of Wuqing street. The speed was extremely fast, arriving in front of the Blue Cloud Manor in the blink of an eye. It was the two hundred White-robed Divine Guards of the Domain Alliance, sitting astride the muscular backs of single-horned cloud-swallowing beasts. The entire Blue Cloud Manor was fully encircled, and among them there were great formation masters setting up formations of isolation and interference to prevent the people inside from using formation transportations to escape.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The White-robed Divine Guards are arresting criminals. People that have nothing to do with it leave immediately; otherwise, they will be punished with the same crime.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A loud roar rocked the streets. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, in the sky, there were twenty black fish-shaped airships lowering from a height, stopping in the Void two hundred meters above the Blue Cloud Manor using a strange formation. A series of formation light arcs were linking the different airships, forming a red-black light screen. Like dark clouds falling down, it fully shrouded the entire Blue Cloud Manor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The citizens on the street broke into spirited discussions. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What's going on?” &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When did Blue Cloud Manor anger the White-robed Divine Guards?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It's not just the White-robed Divine Guards; look, the black fish airships in the sky are the battleship of the Demon Race headquarters. Even the Demon Race's Black Guards are here. What has the Blue Cloud Manor done to anger both the Human Race and Demon Race at the same time?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They wouldn't be looking for the remaining people of the former commander of the White-robed Divine Guards, Lin Yutang, right? Recently, this is the biggest matter in Heaven Connect City. To alarm the Human Race's White-robed Divine Guards and the Demon Race's Black Guards, could the Blue Cloud Manor be Lin Yutang's property?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Recently, there had been a lot of storm-like changes in Heaven Connect City. As a result, the people on the streets, the shopkeeper and waiters began to have an inkling as to what was going on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everybody kept a good distance from the Blue Cloud Manor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, this was a wrestling match between the higher-ups of the Domain Alliance; thus they must not get involved. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Otherwise, they might not even know how they died.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blink of an eye, the whole Blue Cloud Manor was tightly surrounded, all kinds of formations were activated. Whether it was the sky, the ground or underground, everywhere was blocked by different forces. There were endless chain formations flashing, and terrifying power fluctuating. With such a frightening siege, even an invisible gust of spring breeze couldn’t float out of the manor. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The people inside, listen up. in ten seconds, open the door and surrender. Otherwise, all will be killed. The whole of Blue Cloud Manor will be flattened.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A forty-year-old commander of the White-robed Divine Guards on a single-horned cloud-swallowing beast bellowed, surging with yuan qi. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The voice, like a rolling thunder, spread clearly within a ten-kilometer radius.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he finished speaking, he waved his hand, and suddenly the White-robed Divine Guards all unsheathed their weapons. Yuan qi surged, like a torrent of white steel, in the direction of the entrance of the Blue Cloud Manor. The atmosphere suddenly tensed up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the door did not open. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The commander of the White-robed Divine Guards gave a cold smile and no longer said anything else. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A lieutenant beside him was counting. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When it was time, and if the entrance to the manor were not open, they would immediately storm in. At that time the entire Blue Cloud Manor would be turned to ruins, completely flattened.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scene was watched by countless eyes in the distance. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sigh, speaking of which, Lin Yutang was one of the most powerful people in the headquarters of the Human Race. His reputation is extremely good. Who would have thought that once he fell from grace, not only was he thrown into prison, but those White-robed Divine Guards loyal to him would be named traitors and hunted down. It really is hard to understand.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you think that Lin Yutang really killed Lord Ren Puyang?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don't believe it, I have seen Commander Lin Yutang before. He is an upright and heroic man, and also extremely friendly and polite. He absolutely would not do that kind of berserk thing, there is something fishy about this.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shh! Quiet! You dare to say such a thing.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the distance, in a shop called [Jade Pavilion], dozens of people were gathered together, speaking in hushed tones and looking at the Blue Cloud Manor with sympathy. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, ten seconds of time had passed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, to dare to resist arrest. Storm in!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before his voice faded. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the door of the Blue Cloud Manor creaked opened lightly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then a little more and a little more until the door was completely open. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dozens of guards of the Blue Cloud Manor rushed out, divided into two rows on the left and right sides of the entrance, all clad in the same blue-green armour. Under the guard's protection, another group of figures slowly came out, headed by a middle-aged man in a violet silk robe. He was tall and burly, and his eyes was bright and exuded an extremely imposing manner. He was the Lord of the Blue Cloud Manor. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind him he was followed by more than thirty figures. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These people were all young martial artists, dressed in white robes and wearing a light helmet. It was the uniform of the White-robed Divine Guards of the Human Race. Each and every one of them had a look of grief and indignation across their face as they strode out. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“ So it was Commander Fang Bule, excuse me for not going out to meet you.” The Lord of the Blue Cloud Manor came to the entrance, and gave a cupped fist salute. “Forgive me, I wonder what Commander had come here for?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The commander opposite was called Fang Bule, one of the four great commanders of the White-robed Divine Guards along with Lin Yutang and Tang Chong, also one of the strongest great masters of Heaven Connect City. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was rumoured that this was not his real name, but because he always had a straight face and never smiled, somebody gave him the nickname ‘Fang Bule’. He was very satisfied with the name and simply changed his name to this. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You should be well aware of why I came.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fang Bule’s eyes were piercing cold, “Don’t tell me you don’t know that the people behind you are all traitors of the White-robed Divine Guards. They are Lin Yutang's subordinates. If you dare to shelter them, you must also be Lin Yutang's accomplice. A little Blue Cloud Manor dares to fight against the Domain Alliance, do you want to die? I advise you to surrender, otherwise wait to be killed.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fang Bule was taken aback when he saw the Lord of the Blue Cloud Manor and the others swagger out. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he immediately realized that the Lord of the manor was most likely going to abandon the pawns to save the chariot and hand over the traitors of the White-robed Divine Guards in order to protect Blue Cloud Manor. This choice was also the one that the White-robed Divine Guards would make if they did not want to involve the Lord of the Blue Cloud Manor. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Fang Bule would not let the people of the Blue Cloud Manor get off this crime. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, the more he arrested, the greater credit he would have. Moreover, the Lord of the Blue Cloud Manor was rumoured to be close friends with Tang Chong. If this person was framed, he may even be able to implicate Tang Chong and suppress this competitor. In addition, the area of the Blue Cloud Manor was not small at all, and it would also be a great asset to be able to take this opportunity to swallow it up. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In my manor, there are only the loyal defenders of the Human Race. There are no traitors.” The Lord of the Blue Cloud Manor gave a faint smile, “Commander must have made a mistake, please go back. These are fellow soldiers of the Human Race, who you have fought side by side with. Why go so far?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you mean by this, you want to shelter these traitors?” Fang Bule did not expect the Lord of the manor to have no intention of handing over the people he wanted, and instead spoke to him in this tone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They are soldiers loyal to the Human Race who were framed. Anyone with any sense of righteousness will not sit idly by.” The Lord of the manor did not have the slightest expression of fear on his face. “Commander Fang Bule you are also one of the commanders of the White-robed Divine Guards, you should know that they’re innocent. You are born of the same root, why torment them so cruelly?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahahaha, the Lord of the Blue Cloud Manor really wants to die. Someone like you dares to talk to me like this?” Fang Bule burst into laughter, but his smile did not seem happy in the slightest. Instead, it was fierce and terrifying. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he finished, he no longer wasted time. With a wave of his hand, Fang Bule added, “Who are you to dare to lecture me? Listen to my order, attack and kill every one of them, do not let anyone go. No matter who it is, they must be killed. The remaining members of Lin Yutang’s group should not live on this world. Blood wash Blue Cloud Manor as a warning to others!” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In an instant, the sound of shouting and killing broke out. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White-robed Divine Guards outside were advancing forward.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A vicious battle was about to begin. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was when a voice sounded. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Commander Fang Bule, what great magisterial awe… What, are you going to get rid of me too?” Ye Qingyu slowly came out from behind the Lord of the Blue Cloud Manor, with unconcealable anger on his face, “It really is an eye-opener for me. This is the graceful bearing of the divine commander of my Human Race. Good, very good!” —</span></p>
