 <p>Chapter 559, One punch raises wind and lightning&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>On a small floating peak.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu slowly rose to his feet.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>In his eyes, there was undisguised anger and killing intent.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>It would not be his first time killing.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>But it was the first time that Ye Qingyu wanted to kill.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The rules of the Storm Sword Duel made Ye Qingyu unable to save Xie Yuan the pitiful old man, because he knew well that, if he did help out, it would give the Greater One Sect the chance that they had been looking for to deal with him. This would ruin the series of plans he had after this.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was willing to pay any price in order to rescue Yu Xiaoxing.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>So he must endure, a lack of forbearance can spoil great plans.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>To look on helplessly as the old man was killed did not accord with Ye Qingyu’s nature and character.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>But he had to endure.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>This forbearance, at this very moment, had become the fiercest murderous intent that he had felt in his life.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>If Ye Qingyu had known about this earlier, then back then at the Enlightened Tea Party, he would not have held back and definitely have killed Chen Shaohua on the spot.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Stepping out of the pavilion slowly, Ye Qingyu’s expression was fierce.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>This time, Chen Shaohua, I absolutely will not let you continue to live.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He crouched down slightly, a violent physical strength bursting out. He applied force to his feet, and then, following a loud thud, this little floating peak was quaking.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The air current exploded, like a whirlwind, dispersing in all directions. Ye Qingyu's body was like a cannonball, shooting into the sky, piercing the air, and the next moment he had already landed on the Storm Platform.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Bang!&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>At the moment of him landing, the entire Storm Platform was seemingly vibrating.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Today, you will die.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Scowling at Chen Shaohua opposite who was laughing scornfully, Ye Qingyu said, his every word loud and clear.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>A flow of purple lightning and thunder, slowly surfaced from his body, and a tyrannical physical strength and qi erupted, like an ocean was bubbling.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The imposing manner of Ye Qingyu continued to climb.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>An invisible aura raged around his body, that even the air began to condense around his body and light rays began to twist under such a powerful imposing manner. An indescribable pressure, centered around his body, came scattering towards all directions.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Opposite.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Chen Shaohua’s body was also surging with yuan qi, resisting the pressure, but a trace of an evil grin appeared on his face, “Will die? Haha, this is what I want to say to you.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“You, a defeated enemy of mine?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu laughed coldly.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The laugh was full of disdain and contempt.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He stood with hands clasped behind his back, looking at Chen Shaohua with an expression that seemed as if he was looking at a dead man, a clown, a bug.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Chen Shaohua was clearly irritated by the expression.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He furiously laughed to conceal his anger.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Haha, what? You're defending the old man Xie, but soon you will be like him, reduced to a pool of flesh and a pile of bones.” Chen Shaohua gave a strange sneer. As he was speaking, at his side were silver yuan qi light swords appearing, densely floating around him, like a devastating sword formation. And compared to before when he killed Xie Yuan, each yuan qi sword had strengthened immensely, there were flowing lights and a murderous intent curling around like a rare divine weapon.”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Compared to 10 days ago at the Enlightened Tea Garden, this force had enhanced several times. &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Is that the source of your naive self-confidence?” Ye Qingyu was gradually moving closer to him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“That's right,” Chen Shaohua roared. “Million sword origin... Kill!”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Swoosh swoosh swoosh.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The silver yuan qi sword light burst out at the same time.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The sword light surged like a shooting star, dazzling and rapid, simply surpassing the speed limit that the average human eye can capture.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The silvery sword lights were extending infinitely in a criss-cross pattern, like a deadly sword net, bringing an incomparably piercing and devastating sword qi as it shrouded Ye Qingyu, and almost drowned his entire body inside.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu’s expression was calm as before, and he did not fight back in the slightest, as he closed in on ChenShaohua.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Take out all your cards, otherwise, you'll die.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Along with the movement of his every step was an abundant and undefendable imposing manner crushing over.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ding! Ding! Ding!</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Countless beams of piercing sharp sword qi slashed at Ye Qingyu’s body, producing light metallic clangs that resembled swords striking against one another, and flames sputtering.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Under such destructive bombardment of light swords that seemed like they could destroy the world he continued walking slowly, his hair fluttering, looking imposing and handsome, his complexion indifferent and calm, as if he was taking a stroll out in a light drizzle and was not hindered by it in the slightest.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Chen Shaohua’s expression changed.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Tian Huang’s physical body cultivation was much more powerful than it was a few days ago. &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Tian Huang, I want to see how many of my sword attacks you can block!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>As Chen Shaohua roared, his body flashed away, soaring skywards.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He only moved slightly and had leaped up 10 meters high, pinching his fingers and performing the sword seals. He put his palms together and a blaze of light erupted out.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Amid the shrill and mournful sounds of the air being destroyed, fluttering light swords that filled the sky like flowing light all converged toward his palm like a mother swallow bird returning to her nest. &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, tens of thousands of swords had merged into one sword.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>This sword was as bright as jade, dozens of meters long, like a divine weapon of a giant God.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“[Thousand Swords Return to Their Roots]... kill!” &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Chen Shaohua thundered, swinging down his sword.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The bright giant sword in his hand momentarily split the void, slashing down at Ye Qingyu's head.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Insignificant skill.”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu’s face was crossed with the look of disdain, standing there and did not defend as before.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>A dazzling sword was brought down on his head.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The scene, at this moment seemed to have frozen.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The moment the great sword was pressed against the forehead of Ye Qingyu, it seemed to have gone motionless.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>All eyes were fixed upon the scene.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>A number of surprised exclamations blurted out.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>And then——</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Kacha! Kacha!</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>A light noise sounded.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>On the body of the giant light sword emerged a small crack.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Then this little crack, like a spider web extending, instantly pervaded the whole body of the huge sword, before a loud boom resounded, as the giant sword was fractured at every inch of its length, becoming tens of millions of fragments in the air.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Chen Shaohua’s pupils were shrinking, incomparably astonished...</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>This... how can it be?&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>His figure retreated at the first moment, pulling away.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Is this your strongest power?” The murderous intent emanating from Ye Qingyu was like a whirlwind, approaching step-by-step.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The [Thousand Swords Return to their Roots] had failed to cut off even a strand of hair from Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Such a stance brought Chen Shaohua great psychological pressure.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“You... fine, let me show you my real strength today,” Chen Shaohua thundered.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Before his voice faded.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>His ten fingers like a butterfly were swiftly twisting and wrapped around each other, forming a mysterious mark.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Between heaven and earth the yuan qi were like a vortex gathering around Chen Shaohua on the Storm Platform, the vigorous yuan qi forming a visible white hurricane, and in the center of the hurricane was Chen Shaohua, his long hair tossed about in the violent wind.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Chen Shaohua slowly spread opened his left palm, the yuan qi of the world as though it &nbsp;had found an exit, converged at Chen Shaohua’s palm and condensed into a budding sparkling and translucent white lotus. The white lotus exuded a bright luster as it slowly bloomed in Chen Shaohua’s hand. And at that very moment of the flower opening up, Chen Shaohua’s right hand grabbed at the white lotus stamen, and then slowly raised his hand. The silver White Lotus Immortal Sword blossoming with a dazzling silver light once again appeared before Ye Qingyu's eyes. &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He finally summoned the White Lotus Immortal sword.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The moment the White Lotus Immortal sword appeared, the Storm Platform was shrouded by its silvery luster.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>A pure and scared aura pervaded the air. Chen Shaohua clasped the White Lotus Immortal sword, his clothes fluttering, standing aloof from the world and floating in the air like an immortal.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>With the Immortal sword in hand, Chen Shaohua's momentum was skyrocketing.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The beautiful lotus in his left hand vanished as the White Lotus Immortal sword was pulled out, and behind him was a huge lotus-shaped halo gradually appearing, giving Chen Shaohua an immortal-like appearance.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>A soul-stirring aura and power was radiated from Chen Shaohua's body.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Hey? Much stronger than that day at the Enlightened Tea Garden.....Greater One Sect's foundation really cannot be underestimated.”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was somewhat surprised.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But his footsteps did not stop, his complexion was as before, as he continued to approach Chen Shaohua.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“I’ll let you know what a true White Lotus sword attack is!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Chen Shaohua clasped the sword tight, howling wildly.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The White Lotus Immortal sword was like a peacock spreading its tail, one turned into two, two turned into three, three turned into millions. The endless, bright sword shadows nearly drowned the entire Storm Platform.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The spectating crowd could only feel their eyes stinging, and was afraid to directly stare at the scene.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Compared to ten days before, now the White Lotus Immortal sword could create shadows that solidified into a solid substance. Besides the top experts, many martial artists would fail to differentiate which one was the real White Lotus Immortal sword from the tens of thousands of sword shadows. &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“The same old trick? Oh, have you exhausted your abilities?” Ye Qingyu sneered. “Well, I’ll let you know what real power is.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He finally made a move.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>It was time to attack.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He gently clenched his right fist.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>A lavender lightning was faintly discernible on his fist.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Then he slowly released his punch.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Just moments ago, the fist power was faint and weak, like a breeze waving a willow branch.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>After a moment, the fist was suddenly erupting with bolts of thunder.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Silently drawing bolts of thunder and lightning.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Before anyone could react, the air resounded with loud booming noises, just as the vault of Heaven was destroyed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Boom!&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Lightning flashed and thunder crashed and rolled.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>An endless purple flame, like the wrath of Heaven, broke from his fist.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The violet light flooded the sky and the ground.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The brilliance from the White Lotus Immortal sword was instantly drowned out, eroded, destroyed, and obliterated...&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>&nbsp;“This... how could this be?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Chen Shaohua's pupil reflected a purple light, which made his frightened face appear extremely ferocious.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Approaching from the front was a force he could hardly comprehend.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>In the face of such a power, Chen Shaohua almost had no strength to struggle, he felt like a grain of rice falling into a raging sea. He was so small and insignificant that he could only wait to die.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Ah ah ah... how could this be?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He shouted in horror.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The power of the White Lotus Immortal sword melted like ice and broke like tiles, crazily vibrating, being crushed head-on by the purple fist print, and was knocked out his hand with a mournful cry and sent flying off somewhere. And the purple thunder and lightning fist print came pressing over. Chen Shaohua only felt that he was trapped within some sort of terrifying power, unable to struggle or escape, helplessly mangled into pieces.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Pff...”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He opened his mouth, spurting out an arrow of blood.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>His chest momentarily caved in, bones shattered into pieces, blood and flesh all mushed together.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“No...” Chen Shaohua roared like he had gone mad, his eyes filled with discontent and resentment——&nbsp;</p>
