 <p>Chapter 1085, Life sword</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The sound of the air being pieced could be heard behind him.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu spun around only to see that the eight Dragon Human Emperor corpses had unexpectedly recovered. There was not the slightest injury or damage on them, like torn puppets were re-stitched. They were flowing all over with black energy as they charged over once again.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>En?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was a little shocked.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They could be restored even after being severed by the power of a Quasi-emperor?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The qi of the emperor had such power?</p>
 <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was in a state of being besieged.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“No wonder the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor had painstakingly tried to occupy the Dragon cave mausoleum. It seems that this place has great significance to him...” Ye Qingyu thought to himself, activating the qi of Quasi-emperor Mushan once again and slashed out again.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chi! Chi! Chi!</p>
 <p>Endless sword light engulfed the eight Dragon Human Emperor corpses like stormy winds, before the storm of blades shredded them into fine powder.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The fragments of corpses were fluttering in the space of the Dragon cave.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu withdrew his sword, but his expression did not relax.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Because he could sense that, although the Dragon Human Emperor corpses had been destroyed, the eight tyrannical forces had not dispersed and still existed. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Gather!”</p>
 <p>The voice of the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor sounded.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The next moment the fluttering corpse debris that filled the sky, like grains of sand, were gathered together again, forming the eight Dragon Human Emperor corpses, and were in no way different from before, even their battle strength and aura was not reduced in the slightest.</p>
 <p>“Kill!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A cold, mechanical voice was emitted from the Dragon Human Emperor corpses.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The battle resumed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>These Dragon Human Emperor corpse battle puppets were indestructible, even with Quasi-emperor Mushan's imperial qi. It was a little hard to believe. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Can the imperial qi resist the laws of a Quasi-emperor?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu came to realize that the situation was a little problematic.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Fire!”</p>
 <p>As he roared, the [Cloud Top Cauldron] came rotating out, spewing clusters of red flames that enveloped the eight Dragon Human Emperor corpses. It was the [Red Lotus Hellfire]. Ye Qingyu was attempting to use this fierce fire, which could incinerate all materials in the world, to completely burn the Dragon Human Emperor corpses.</p>
 <p>However, his expression quickly changed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Because the Dragon Human Emperor corpses that the [Red Lotus Hellfire] had enveloped were not damaged in the slightest, and were completely unaffected as though it was just a gust of spring breeze. They, as before, were frantically charging towards him.</p>
 <p>“What's going on?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu found that the [Red Lotus Hellfire] did not have the slightest effect on the Dragon Human Emperor corpses, which made him incredibly shocked and a little puzzled. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Haha, the [Red Lotus Hellfire] claims to burn all karma. The beings on this world are all contaminated with karma, thus it can naturally burn everything. But these corpses are dead, and on the road of death, karma will dissipate. Therefore, how could the [Red Lotus Hellfire] incinerate them?” the voice of the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor sounded, a hint of ridicule in his voice.</p>
 <p>Understanding dawned on Ye Qingyu's face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He knew that he had made a mistake.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The karma of fire incinerates karma, but these corpses were dead and thus karma had dissipated.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu realized that the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor knew a lot about him, including the fact that he had mastered the flame of karma, and thus was well prepared. Everything in the Dragon cave had a restraining effect on him.</p>
 <p>“Since it can't be destroyed, then I'll take it back and think again.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu operated the secret technique of the one hundred eight ancient characters, sending the [Cloud Top Cauldron] rotating out and releasing endless suction force, which shrouded the eight Dragon Human Emperor corpses and was about to drag them in.</p>
 <p>“Roar!”</p>
 <p>One of the Dragon Human Emperor corpses produced a beast-like roar, struggling desperately. There was bright yellow imperial qi flowing around his body to withstand against the suction force of the [Cloud Top Cauldron].</p>
 <p>It was the same with the other Dragon Human Emperor corpses.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Draw them in!” Ye Qingyu bellowed, operating the [Cloud Top Cauldron] to its peak strength.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the cauldron, bright yellow aura was flowing around, and wisps of bright yellow rope-like mists were seeping out to tightly wrap around the eight ancient corpses in an attempt to drag them in.</p>
 <p>“Hey?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the Void the astonished voice of the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor could be heard.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And at the same time——&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Swoosh!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A Dragon Human Emperor body figure that had turned into a stream of light, was inhaled into the [Cloud Top Cauldron].&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was another three ear piercing sounds.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Another three Dragon Human Emperor corpses were forcibly pulled into the [Cloud Top Cauldron].&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Swoosh!</p>
 <p>A stream of light flashed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu sensed danger, and activated the Divine Emperor sword will to protect his body in the first instance. The sword light, like a cauldron, fully enveloped his body.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The next moment, a terrifying power descended.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Boom!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was directly blasted out hundreds of meters, spewing out blood at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He was wounded.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The [Cloud Top Cauldron] had protected its master right away, abandoning the other four Dragon Human Emperor corpses, suspended above the head of Ye Qingyu, releasing rays of bright yellow light that shielded Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>And almost at the same time, hundreds of terrifying forces bombarded the [Cloud Top Cauldron].</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's face went pale, desperately operating his yuan qi to remove the strange force that had penetrated his body.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The figure of the Taihu Dragon Emperor appeared in the distant Void.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just now it was his sneak attack that had severely wounded Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This existence was the most terrifying enemy that Ye Qingyu had ever encountered. His strength was too powerful, several times more terrifying than Wei Wubing and Zhang Wuxin, also infinitely close to the Quasi-emperor realm, and beyond the imagination of Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>This was a fearful enemy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Opposite, the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor fixed his eyes on Ye Qingyu and then his gaze fell on the [Cloud Top Cauldron], looking surprised and puzzled, “You actually broke the imperial qi? And could block my attack like this? I have long heard about your cauldron. I thought that this treasure was just a rumour, who would have thought that... Ye Qingyu, what's the origin of your cauldron?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu drew a deep breath, inhaling the blood he spewed out into his mouth. His yuan qi was running smoothly, strength had recovered, and eyes blazed with battle intent. “The [Great Emperor Immortal Cauldron]!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Great Ancient Dragon Emperor was taken aback for a moment, then immediately sneered, “Hahahaha ridiculous! A legendary treasure like the [Great Emperor Immortal Cauldron]does not exist in this world, you want to bluff? I think this cauldron, at best, is just a pseudo-emperor weapon.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yes and no, you will know soon. Since you have showed up, then let’s battle.” Ye Qingyu drew a deep breath. The [Cloud Top Cauldron] drifted away from his head and no longer guarded him. “You were unrivalled back then. Let me see, besides hiding in the darkness, what else do you have!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Great Ancient Dragon Emperor was taken aback for a moment, and then sneered, “Want to fight with me head-on? Well, a junior like you is worth dying in my hands... then I'll kill you myself.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He turned his hand over.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A pyramid shot out a golden scepter-like halberd that was overflowing with colours, inlaid with six different gems, and each gem was flowing with a different, terrifying, energy. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The [Six-sided Scepter Halberd]?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Dragon Human Emperor in the distance exclaimed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was the scepter of a noble sacred Emperor of the Dragonblood imperial court in the past, one of the ancestral weapons of the Dragon Human Race, and second only to the [Dragonblood Halberd]. After death, the sacred Emperor was kept warm in the mausoleum, and whenever the Dragon Human Race faced disaster the spiritual ancestral weapon would break out and kill the enemy. Unexpectedly, it was now in the hands of the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor, and had clearly been eroded by the dark forces. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Dragon Human Emperor was enraged. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“[Soul Stealing Heaven Strike]... kill!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The figure of Ye Qingyu turned into a stream of light, tthen directly made an attack.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In a flash he had already invaded the battle circle of the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor, and his sword, like a collapsed mountain, landed with a loud rumble.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Great Ancient Dragon Emperor gave an arrogant smile, retaliated witha slash of the scepter-halberd.</p>
 <p>Boom!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Terrifying power erupted, sweeping across.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“[Storm of Swords]!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu roared, a storm of ice blades filled the sky, and each sword contained the purple qi of Quasi-emperor Mushan. This was his most powerful strength.</p>
 <p>“[Dragons Look Up].” Flames were blazing in the eyes of the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The scepter in his hand was like living creature, once its blue-green gem bloomed out the brightest brilliance. Together, it was as though a majestic blue-green divine dragon had appeared, looking up all of a sudden and punctured the sky with its dragon horn.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Boom!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The sword qi of ice and snow was instantly shattered by the dragon horn.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even the purple qi of Quasi-emperor Mushan failed to destroy the dragon horn of the green-blue divine dragon. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>This was because the moves of the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor contained powerful imperial qi. He was once the Emperor of the Dragon Human Race, received the allegiance and worship of all people, and thus had naturally grasped the imperial qi. Moreover, his martial arts cultivation base had reached an earth-shattering level, and could convert the imperial qi into both attack and defensive force. Therefore, he was able to seriously injure Ye Qingyu during the sneak attack. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The [Sword of Judgment]!”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's expression remained unchanged upon seeing this, inserting the [Blood Drinker Sword] into the ground.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A bright divine sword of thousands of meters in length fell from the sky, locked on the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor, as if to extinguish this world. It was the killing move of the [Four Moves of the Unmatched General]. Given Ye Qingyu's current strength and that the move contained the Divine Emperor sword will, he absolutely had the power to kill Gods and destroy demons.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Good!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Great Ancient Dragon Emperor praised, and then the scarlet red gem on the scepter-halberd was flashing. The green-blue dragon behind transformed into a fire dragon, covered with blazing flames all over, like the king of fire. It lifted its head skywards and let out a deafening roar.</p>
 <p>“The [Dragon Swallows the Sun].”</p>
 <p>He roared in a clear voice.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The fire dragon breathed out flames, then opened its mouth and inhaled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Great Light [Sword of Judgement] was swallowed into the stomach of this fire dragon, exploding into sparks, but the fire dragon also dimmed as a result, and almost dissipated.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Too moves from the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor had broken two moves from Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>“[Life Sword Mantra]!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu launched out his third sword.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Rushing to attack and suppress had always been Ye Qingyu's fighting style. He would never give the initiative to the enemy. His every move was a killing move and he would never hold back. After the first two sword attacks, at this moment his spirit, body, and yuan qi were burning to their peak state, displaying a power beyond the Divine Emperor sword will.</p>
 <p>In the [War God Sword Mantra], the [Human King Sword Mantra] was the foundation, considered as passing through the hall and into the inner chamber. The [Divine Emperor Sword Mantra] was perfect, considered as when the stove fire turns bright green. And the [Life Sword Mantra] was to break and stand again. It was the real peak. It originated from all these sword techniques, but it exceeded all these sword techniques.</p>
 <p>Sword light erupted.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mysterious and blurred.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Great Ancient Dragon Emperor suddenly had a change of expression——&nbsp;</p>
