 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 1024 – Going Up a Mountain</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two hours ago, everyone believed that Ye Qingyu had gone mad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, they felt that it must have been themselves who had gone mad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Otherwise, they would not have seen such a sight before their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nearly ten thousand Saint experts had been killed just like fallen leaves being swept away by a cool breeze. Eight thousand of them were instantly pulverized before dispersing among the world without leaving a single trace, while for the other two thousand, their corpses and bones remained and their blood flowed, only to be tread on by Ye Qingyu and become stepping stones for his divine battle techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This… impossible...” The old demon who had predicted that Ye Qingyu was certain to die was scared senseless at present. He had been hit so hard that he had become muddled. The scene and outcome had flipped his cognition completely upside down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other one-hundred-thousand-plus experts were also in a dazed state in which they were doubtful of life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At present, their postures and manners when looking at Ye Qingyu were of admiration. None of them doubted that he could turn around and kill every one of them if he wanted. This was because he had slain the ten thousand surrendered experts with utmost ease, such that he remained in perfect condition after killing the last of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was not a pyrrhic victory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a massacre.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A one-sided massacre.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even those experts who suspected that Ye Qingyu had mastered some secret techniques for protracted battles did not dare to betray a hint of their covetous thoughts. Instead, they firmly restrained their inner malice. Given that they had not dared to revolt against the Quasi-emperor’s threat and a dozen or so petty officials, they certainly all the more did not dare to show the least bit of disrespect to a bloodthirsty Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, in the estimation of these one hundred thousand experts, Ye Qingyu was currently already not too far off from a Quasi-emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was prestige he had killed his way to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was status he had killed his way to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As long as he did not perish in the large battle on Capital Sky Peak, he would definitely become a killing god dreaded by all races of the Vast Thousand Domains, while those super large forces would almost certainly no longer dare to fight him head-on. Perhaps, only those forces which were backed up by a Quasi-emperor would have a bit of confidence when facing him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Accompanying that would be a huge rise in the Heaven Wasteland Domain’s status.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the process of today’s battle was publicized, there would probably no longer be any being, race, or force among the Vast Thousand Domains which would dare to bear malice against the Heaven Wasteland Empire. Unless water had entered their brains and they were tired of living that was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahahaha...” The fatty Li Shengyan laughed so much that tears nearly fell from his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He simply laughed thunderously without saying a word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Tan Tianzi, Orchid Saintess, Zhang Wudao, Tao Jieqian, and the other Human race experts who were upright, they were already so excited that they could not even laugh while their bodies trembled uncontrollably. Affected by tremendous shock, ecstasy, and incredulity, they seemed to have lost the ability to express their own emotions. A Great Saint like Situ Kongming was even pinching his own face like a fool, hoping to use this most primitive method to confirm that he was not dreaming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the other dozens of Human Race experts represented by the Thousand Illusions Elder, they were so regretful that their guts were churning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They did not stand on Ye Qingyu's side earlier and did not declare their position like Tan Tianzi and the others did, and thus it was impossible for them to attach themselves to Ye Qingyu now. In particular, the Thousand Illusions Elder felt like dying and regretted his past actions whenever he recalled the small conflict he had with Ye Qingyu on the Sky River beach and the Netherworld Ferryboat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the watch of countless pairs of eyes, Ye Qingyu slowly turned around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Avenge whatever grievances you may have. How are you all still able to hold back?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He bared his spotlessly white teeth as he smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This smile made him look as warm and friendly as the boy next door. There was not a trace of evil qi anywhere on his body, making it impossible to associate this elegant child-resembling youth with the demon who had just massacred nearly ten thousand Saint experts. This feeling of visual and psychological astoundment caused everyone to suspect once more that this was just a dream.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Orchid Saintess was the first person to come to her senses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a flash of her figure, she turned into a beam of flowing light and instantly arrived beside the young petty official.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You… What are you doing?” The latter was taken aback and immediately sensed that things were no good. Appearing fierce while timid inside, he said, “How dare you… how dare. The Quasi-emperor of my sect is up on the peak. If you dare to harm me, I’ll tell him to kill your entire family. You...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he had finished speaking, Orchid Saintess gave a slap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Clap!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A resounding slap on the face left a distinct slap mark.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Given that Orchid Saintess was a Saint while the young petty official was merely at the pinnacle Immortal Step realm, there was no chance for the latter to evade this blow. Half of his face collapsed at once, while his cheekbone was pulverized. At present, his face was too horrible to be looked at, smacking of a fully ripe peach of which half had been trampled upon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You...” The young petty official roared angrily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This slap is to teach you to keep your mouth clean in the future.” With that, she issued another slap and broke the other half of his face, practically causing a portion of his head to turn into slime. Although his blood and flesh could regrow, this kind of pain caused him to go mad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If the Quasi-emperor of your sect is here, then kill me. Otherwise, I shall kill you.” Being a heroine, she had already completely dropped her scruples and firmed her will. Using her Saint methods, she shattered his bones inch after inch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Subjected to immense pain, the young petty official screamed agonizingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why Orchid Saintess was deliberately torturing him instead of killing him straight away was that she absolutely abhorred how vile he was, such that her clean and pure self was nearly ruined in the hands of this filthy person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So frightened that their faces turned ashen pale, the other petty officials of the Four Stars Sect turned and intended to flee…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where are you all going?” With her murderous spirit diffusing, Tan Tianzi intercepted these officials who had borrowed the Quasi-emperor’s power to act as bullies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nonono… It’s a misunderstanding, Saintess Tan Tianzi. Seeing as we’re from the same race, please let us off.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Indeed, we were merely obeying orders.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Panicking, the petty officials were about to kneel on the ground and beg for mercy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you thinking about running away, you fake bullies? Too late, did you consider that we’re from the same race when you were humiliating us?” Tan Tianzi’s heart had also hardened, and she did not consider anything else. The only way for her to vent was to kill, and so she swiftly took action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Putt-putt-putt!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among spattering streaks of fresh blood, the heads of the petty officials shot into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A woman’s wrath was indeed frightening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Thousand Illusions Elder saw this scene, he said while trembling with fear, “You all… actually killed… This is huge trouble, what are you all doing? It’s enough to just win, why did you have to kill them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Wudao, Tao Jieqian, and the others looked disdainfully at the Thousand Illusions Elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this person was not a human, he would probably have been killed four or five times already.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In little time, Tan Tianzi, Zhang Wudao, and the others killed off all of the petty officials and disciples of the Four Stars Sect who had remained at the entrance of the mountain path. Since they had already acted completely unashamedly, there was no longer a need for any forbearance. Even if they had spared these people, the Four Stars Sect would probably not let them off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Being a righteous character and a female, Orchid Saintess eventually did not torture the young petty official too much before killing him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this way, the petty officials, who were essentially executioners with malicious intentions and hands full of blood, tasted their own medicine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the other experts from various races could not help cheering inwardly and feeling relieved when they saw the vicious young petty official being killed. Earlier on, the latter’s arrogant and overbearing way of talking and doing things had pissed them off terribly. However, as good as they felt inwardly at present, they did not reveal their feelings on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why Tan Tianzi, Orchid Saintess, Zhang Wudao and the others could vent, curse, and swiftly kill off those petty officials and disciples of the Four Stars Sect was that they had a common friend whose name was Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if the Quasi-emperor on the mountaintop was enraged by these humans, there would be this fiendgod-like youth, who could kill ten thousand Saints as soon as he unsheathed his sword in anger, providing protection for them. The experts from foreign races, however, did not have someone like that to rely on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, they dared not reveal a trace of emotion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, even they had not realized that they had subconsciously began to perceive Ye Qingyu as a Quasi-emperor-level being.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want to go up the mountain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After adjusting his breath for a moment, Ye Qingyu recovered from the feeling of weakness after withdrawing from the [Ninth Limit] state of the [Limitless Divine Way], and once more relived the profound feeling of the [Ninth Limit] state for a few moments. As he gazed at the Capital Sky Peak high up in the clouds, the expression in his eyes gradually became firm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During the earlier battle, there was a vague feeling of divine providence when his battle will reached its peak state. In that momentary splendor, he clearly felt that there were three indescribably terrifying forces locked in a delicate stalemate on Capital Sky Peak. The one which came with a familiar feeling was probably [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei], and he was clearly in a disadvantageous position. One of the other two forces was also very familiar, and should be Quasi-emperor Mushan. Conversely, the other force was extremely unfamiliar yet similarly terrifying, and should probably be the Four Stars Quasi-emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These three forces were entangled with one another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The force which represented Li Xiaofei was apparently being jointly suppressed by the other two forces. Like a small dinghy on a stormy ocean, it seemed as though it could be annihilated at any time, yet it perpetually resisted and refused to retreat even an inch. This caused the Capital Sky Peak to be in a delicate state with absolutely no fluctuation of force. Perhaps this was also why the Capital Sky Peak had not been destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right. Rather than waiting here, we might as well go up the mountain and battle.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Deputy Ye Qingyu, allow us to follow you. There is no longer any turning back for us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tan Tianzi, Zhang Wudao, and the others openly stated their positions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After killing the people of the Four Stars Sect, they completely stood in Ye Qingyu's camp and did not have any way of turning back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the fatty Li Shengyan, being the bloodline descendant of [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] after all, it was needless to say that he definitely would follow Ye Qingyu up the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After some thinking, Ye Qingyu nodded, “Alright, let’s go up the mountain and fight together.”</span></p>
