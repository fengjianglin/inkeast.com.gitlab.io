<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Song Jiannan suddenly realized he had made a mistake.</p>
 <p>The people that conversed with him, that seemed extremely amiable to him, were people of a different world entirely. He had immersed himself into the group to such an extent, that he had nearly forgotten his identity - he was utterly different from these people. As the head of the Qingluo Merchant Company, he could be counted as an important person within Deer City, but in front of these people... he was nothing.</p>
 <p>"I seemed... to have somewhat lost my sense of measure."</p>
 <p>Song Jiannan sighed in his heart.</p>
 <p>Afterwards, he became much more careful with his words.</p>
 <p>Song Jiannan believed he received such treatment today because Ye Qingyu liked his daughter, Song Qingluo. Therefore, he intentionally brought the topic of conversation on the matter of Song Qingluo, wanting to grasp this opportunity.</p>
 <p>But how could he have guessed that the reason why Ye Qingyu was so courteous towards him, and even secretly told the people of the Dugu Organization to look after the Qingluo Merchant Company, was all because of Song Xiaojun.</p>
 <p>Song Xiaojun had already completely changed and had no relation to the Song family, but in the end Song Jiannan was still Song Xiaojun’s elder. The Song family had once raised Song Xiaojun. Just through this debt alone, Ye Qingyu naturally had to look after the Song family.</p>
 <p>After a while, the old servant once again came to report that there were nobles within the city that came to pay their respects in the night. It was the new registrar of the City, Liu Minjun.</p>
 <p>Ever since Liu Yuancheng had mysteriously disappeared, the position of the registrar had been left vacant for half a year. It had incited much conflict between the nobles of the city. Afterwards, the people of the Liu family, that is Liu Minjun, became the new registrar. Within Deer City, he could be counted as someone with power.</p>
 <p>"I'm not seeing him!"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu declined without the slightest of hesitation.</p>
 <p>What followed after were major and minor nobles, all coming to the Ye household, asking to see him. However, they were all rejected by Ye Qingyu. There were some that had even brought gifts but no matter what sort of strange treasure it was, it was all sent back.</p>
 <p>Song Jiannan was stunned as he saw this.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's firm attitude made him dumbfounded.</p>
 <p>But how could he have known that when they were in Youyan Pass, all these nobles holding military power were all swept away by the broomstick of Mother Wu.</p>
 <p>Two hours later.</p>
 <p>The evening gathering had reached it's end.</p>
 <p>Hon Kong rose to leave.</p>
 <p>Song Jiannan, seeing that the time was about right, also called his daughter over to leave.</p>
 <p>At this time, the old servant came again.</p>
 <p>"What? There's another noble asking to see me." Ye Qingyu smiled. "Are you not tired running back and forth? Go back and rest, just shut the door and sleep. Our Ye household is different from the past. You sometimes don't have to pay attention to anyone, haha!"</p>
 <p>"Young master you joke, how would I dare." The old man smiled.</p>
 <p>He was currently seventy or so years old. He could be counted as in his later years, without child and was all alone. The only hobby he had was drinking. He was old, and his body was not what it once was. Looking after the entrance was his chosen job, and it was somewhat leisurely.</p>
 <p>"This time, the person wanting to see you, is not a noble of the city. It's a girl called Jiang Xiaohan. I've seen her waiting for two or so hours. She’s been standing under the willow tree by the door without daring to knock, looking somewhat pitiful. She said that she is an old friend, so I came here to relay the message," Uncle Jiao said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Oh?</p>
 <p>Jiang Xiaohan?</p>
 <p>So it was her.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was taken aback.</p>
 <p>Some matters began to float in his heart.</p>
 <p>Song Qingluo's heart also faintly trembled after hearing such news.</p>
 <p>"Could I please trouble Uncle Jiao to tell her, the matters of the past cannot be chased back. Tell her to go, and don't ever come to the Ye household again!" Ye Qingyu seemed to have made his final decision.“</p>
 <p>Old man Jiao nodded his understanding.</p>
 <p>After a short while.</p>
 <p>Hon Kong gave a smiling glance to Ye Qingyu, then turned to leave.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu saw the others off at the door, and then departed.</p>
 <p>Standing at the entrance of the Ye household, he looked at the Deer City under the moonlight. On the surface, everything seemed calm and peaceful, but in reality, currents were running underneath the surface. The display of City Lord Qin seemed exceedingly normal, but Ye Qingyu long knew that Qin Ying was someone belonging to the Right Minister. It was impossible for him to have a good relation with him.</p>
 <p>Ever since he had arrived at Youyan Pass and killed the [Five Poisons Gongzi] as well as the [Poison King], Ye Qingyu was fated to have enmity between him and the Right Minister of the Empire, this humongous figure. With the way that the Right Minister did things, it was likely there was no way of ever fixing their relationship.</p>
 <p>Of course, the most important thing was, Ye Qingyu did not want to have any relation with the Right Minister.</p>
 <p>After silently standing at the doorway, Ye Qingyu turned to give a glance at the weeping willow. Under the moonlight, it was as if there was a light moving in his eyes.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu knew who it was.</p>
 <p>With a light sigh in his heart, Ye Qingyu turned to enter the household without turning back.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The moonlight deepened.</p>
 <p>City Lord's Residence.</p>
 <p>The four military leaders were responsible for looking after the four areas of Deer City, with the City Lord's Residence at the very center. On the most central and flat four main roads of Deer City was namely situated the four doors of the City Lord's Residence.</p>
 <p>As the center of power of Deer City for the last few decades, the City Lord's Residence represented authority, power, mystery and nobility in the eyes of everyone.</p>
 <p>It was nearly midnight.</p>
 <p>The Qin Ying who had gotten rid of his martial attire, stood at the large entrance to the stone pavilion library. He looked at the shadow of the tree under the moonlight, and the shadows of the trees that swirled along with the wind. In his half closed eyes, it was as if the splendour of the room was moving about in the slender depths of his eyes.</p>
 <p>As the huge figure who had controlled Deer City for thirty years, Qin Ying's authority had never been doubted within the city. He controlled the fate of countless lifeforms within the city. In these years, no matter how the nobility fought amongst each other, he was already the character of the judge. His word was like the law and no one had ever dared to disobey him.</p>
 <p>But from today onwards, matters had begun to change.</p>
 <p>Qin Ying clearly knew that Deer City was about to change.</p>
 <p>Qin Ying knew better than anyone the importance of a third class military Marquis of the Empire.</p>
 <p>That was why he could not help but bring the nobles of the city to receive Ye Qingyu outside.</p>
 <p>From today onwards, no matter how he, Qin Ying, tried to protect his power, ultimately a place had appeared in Deer City that the power of the City Lord did not reach. The Ye residence was like a thorn, piercing deeply into Qin Ying's heart, that he had no way of plucking off.</p>
 <p>The flutter of wings!</p>
 <p>The sound of the blue eyed demonic pigeon's wings sounded.</p>
 <p>After a while, there followed footstep.</p>
 <p>"Lord, we have already investigated the people who went during the night to pay a visit to the Ye household."</p>
 <p>A lean and tall middle-aged man looking like a strategist walked out from the library.</p>
 <p>He had a lean face, but his expression was in the shade and could not clearly be seen. His dark green brocaded clothing was like theer was dim light glowing through it. On his left shoulder, there was a dark-coloured, blue eyed demonic bird on it, and he held a thin book on his right hand. He respectfully handed this booklet over.</p>
 <p>The middle-aged man was namely the new Registrar of Deer City, Liu Minjun.</p>
 <p>Liu Yuancheng was originally one of the right arms of Qin Ying, and the Liu family and the Qin family had tight connections. Losing Liu Yuancheng was equivalent to losing one of Qin Ying's arms. HIs new choice naturally had to be from within the Liu family. Only then could he protect their common interest.</p>
 <p>Especially notable was that after Liu Minjun took over the position of registrar, he did matters excellently, causing Qin Ying to regard him highly. He used him even more than Liu Yuancheng and was exceedingly satisfied with him.</p>
 <p>Qin Ying casually flicked through it, tossing the booklet aside.</p>
 <p>"This cannot represent anything. Ye Qingyu''s momentum is too great, everyone wants to hide under his wings for a bit. This is within reason. Burn this booklet. There's not too much point in pursuing things further. It will only incite fear... Do you understand what I mean?"</p>
 <p>Liu Minjun nodded his head. "Rest assured, I know what to do."</p>
 <p>"Ye Qingyu is not giving face to anyone. Only Hon Kong and Song Jiannan were allowed to his private feast. What do you feel about this matter?" Qin Ying had both his hands clasped behind his back as he said calmly.</p>
 <p>"Hon Kong and Ye Qingyu are long friends. When Ye Qingyu was at White Deer Academy, Hon Kong had personally given him guidance. Afterwards, when Hon Kong became the Headmaster of White Deer Academy, he has taken care of the entire Ye Household. It is within reason that he would be able to attend. I have already carefully investigated Ye Qingyu, he is a person that remembers old debts," Liu Minjun said, his expression masked by the shadow. "As for Song Jiannan... there are people that say Ye Qingyu has feelings for the daughter of Song Jiannan, Song Qingluo. But according to my investigation, the person that Ye Qingyu was close to while he was at White Deer Academy was really the girl born out of wedlock of the Song family, Song Qingluo...”</p>
 <p>"Song Xiaojun?" Qin Ying was taken aback. "That... demonic girl of the Unmoving City of Darkness?"</p>
 <p>"Yes," Liu Minjun nodded his head.</p>
 <p>Qin Ying stood where he was, remaining silent for a while. "I know now.... that's right, call Wushuang over. I have matters I need to speak to him."</p>
 <p>Liu Minjun gave his reply, turning to leave.</p>
 <p>After a while, the young master of the City Lord's Residence Qin Wushuang came to the study.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The following days, the Ye household was still the focal point of Deer City.</p>
 <p>All the topics of conversation in the city had something to do with Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>The storytellers in all of the liquor stores and inns, all described the incident of the martial alliance meeting at Proud Sky Center. No matter how many times the customers heard this story, they would still enjoy it. Countless young people and martial artists began emulating the dress of Ye Qingyu. Especially the silver hair pin at their heads, had countless followers</p>
 <p>Tang San saw the opportunity and ordered the Ye commercial holdings to quickly make silver hairpins. After doing this, when it was placed on the shelves, it completely disappeared.</p>
 <p>Hon Kong had invited Ye Qingyu to teach at White Deer Academy several times, but he had declined. His martial cultivation path was not suitable for everyone. That's why he did not go and lecture. He was worried about misleading others.</p>
 <p>Those who were once his classmates all came to visit Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu did not decline them, greeting them warmly.</p>
 <p>According to Ye Qingyu’s original plan, he would stay for ten or so days within Deer City, then he would begin his journey. First, he would bring the corpses of the sentries back to their homelands. Only after that would he head off to report to Snow Capital.</p>
 <p>But on the ninth day, something happened that completely disturbed Ye Qingyu's arrangements.</p>
