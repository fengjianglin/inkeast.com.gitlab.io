To be able to see a glimmer of gentleness in her eyes and have that kind of ambiguous dialogue with a man was simply more unbelievable than seeing the ancestors of the Phoenix Race that existed thousands of years ago being resurrected. &nbsp;</span></p>

He once again carefully studied Ye Qingyu, repeatedly and attentively looking at him. Then a storm and raging waves were set off in his heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He actually felt a glimmer of the aura of Phoenix from the young man.&nbsp;</span></p>

He had no choice but to ask Her Highness clearly later. With this worry in mind, he finally soared into air with the Celestial Phoenix Maiden and instantly disappeared in the distant Void.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu threw a very disdainful narrowed-eyed glance at him, “What, without me protecting you in the future, do you think you will survive?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fatty Sheng Yan immediately put his hands on his hips, like an oval teapot, as he looked up and let out a full belly laugh, “Hahaha... I, Sheng Yan, am also someone who had successfully come out of the Door of Darkness. I am blessed with the luck of Heaven and earth. Would I need others to protect me? Besides, the ancestor of my Li clan has returned to the top. Haha, this sky and land will be named Li soon. My ancestor has returned, who would dare to challenge him? In the future, if there's anything you need then just tell me, and this little brother of yours will cover you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fatty's attitude could be described as extremely arrogant.</span></p>

Four thousands years ago, [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] was already an invincible existence in the world. Four thousands years had past, and now that he had emerged from the mountain again, his first battle had already showed off his true powers, and it was clear that there were most likely only a few who could contend against Li Xiaofei. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fatty who had the protection of a Quasi-emperor indeed could act domineering and tyrannical.&nbsp;</span></p>

I, Sheng Yan, will not forget your great kindness and how many times you had saved me...” Sheng Yan said firmly and in a very serious attitude, but after the first half of the sentence, he changed the topic and revealed a vulgar smile, “When I have great achievements in the future, I will certainly bring you success, a dog and chicken can also rise to heaven!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This...</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Sheng Yan was still so not serious. He though that he wanted to say goodbye to him, but instead, in the end, he revealed an unseemly expression. Ye Qingyu knew that, although this brother of his seemed disrespectful and frivolous, he was definitely a kind-hearted and loyal man, which was clear from the way he would rather die than to leave his ancestor in the grey bronze temple. To be able to have a brother like him, Ye Qingyu was also very happy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well, then I'll wait for you to take me to the heavens.” Ye Qingyu patted the fatty on the shoulder.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fatty grinned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His smile was filled with gratitude towards Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because he was very clear that, if it were not for Ye Qingyu, let alone saving his ancestor, he would be buried in the 18th district. If this really were the case, then the Li clan would have lost all of its descendants and would completely disappear as a result. Moreover, the choice that Ye Qingyu made at that time was also a great risk and he was almost also killed in the killing intent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This really was tantamount to a life of friendship.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side, [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] was still looking at the two indifferently.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And his gaze was lingering more on Ye Qingyu. In the depths of his eyes there was a glimmer of a smiling expression, as well as a hint of curiosity. But this expression would never be seen by others. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder, take care.” Ye Qingyu bowed respectfully to [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei]. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Xiaofei nodded, approval in his eyes as he said, “Little guy, you saved me once. I owe you a favour. If there is something you need help with in the future, you can come find me directly with this item, I will sort out everything for you.” As he was speaking, he handed a green robe to Ye Qingyu. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the tattered robe that he was wearing as he was escaping before.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In the future the wanted list of the Domain Alliance will no longer be able to recognize you.” Li Xiaofei seemed to know what Ye Qingyu was worried about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With this promise from [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei], Ye Qingyu let out a long sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That's good, there will be a lot less trouble during the next operation.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When everyone was gone, Ye Qingyu finally could not help a hint of anxiety coming to his eye. The Black Demon Abyss assessment really was too torturous. He had to go through so many twists and turns just to get his hands on a few Black Demon Herbs, and did not expect to have wasted so much time in the Black Demon Abyss. Moreover, he did not know what the situation was with the rest of the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps. He had to quickly catch up with them.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After an hour, Ye Qingyu descended onto the Taowu Mountain Range.&nbsp;</span></p>

Ye Qingyu was a bit surprised at the beginning, but later on after another thought he knew that it must have been because the power that [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] had shown in that battle was too terrifying and had frightened everybody out of their wits. They were no longer lingering around and had retreated far away. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Half a day later.&nbsp;</span></p>

It seemed that, as Li Xiaofei had said, the wanted list was no longer able to detect Ye Qingyu's presence. It was most likely because the Quasi-emperor had used some sort of technique to obstruct the detection of the Domain Alliance's wanted list.&nbsp;</span></p>

What made him feel slightly reassured was that everything seemed to be going well, and the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps had already passed the checkpoints of the seven great cities and was moving towards the tenth city of chaos.</span></p>

This news also caused quite a stir.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was as easy as though he was slaughtering a chicken.</span></p>

They had begun to quietly lay out their plan, aware that a huge change was about to come. In particular, the forces that had once made things difficult for the descendants of Quasi-emperor Li were in a panic like stray dogs.&nbsp;</span></p>

The branch grew roots and the roots sprouted branches and leaves. It was as if it had been standing since the beginning when Heaven and earth was created, constantly growing branches and leaves, which then turned into roots. After millions of years, it had formed a tremendous tree city that covered a distance of hundreds of thousands of kilometers.&nbsp;</span></p>

On both sides of the winding road, the aerial roots that connected Heaven and earth was more than thousands of meters high, and the thinnest branches and leaves also required at least two or three people to fully encircle it.</span></p>

However, just as he was passing a market where buildings and stalls were also built from branches, he overheard some of the dialogues between the passersby. He learned that there will be a large-scale auction event in the city soon and at that time there would not only be countless rare pills and medicines, but also divine weapons and treasures.&nbsp;</span></p>
