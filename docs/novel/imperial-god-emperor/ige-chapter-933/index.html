 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The skyful of calamity clouds eventually cleared, but the horror of the punch radiance continued to shine upon everyone’s hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although it could not be confirmed, practically everyone knew that there was only one person in Snow capital who could have exerted such a punch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were instead curious about what exactly caused the calamity clouds to form, and whether it was yet another breakthrough in&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">that</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;person’s strength which incited these clouds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Various kinds of discussions and speculations went on for some time. However, nobody really dared to go ask&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">that</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;person. In particular, the inner fears of the foreign domain forces were relatively deeper, and naturally, their attitudes became more proper than before in their subsequent business dealings with the Heaven Wasteland Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, Ye Qingyu himself did not expect the formations engraved in the Heaven Wasteland Arsenal to attract lightning calamity clouds at the instant they were activated. Normally speaking, only the appearance of an extremely heaven-defying person or object would trigger heavenly rage and divine punishment and thereby lead to the production of calamity clouds. He thus wondered if the defensive formation he had designed was highly heaven-defying, and felt rather proud while thinking about this. The mental road-map for his design of the arsenal’s layout was referenced from the [Infinite Arsenal] of the Alliance of Domains, and the formation he had set up within was mostly based on Formation Emperor Luoso’s formation technique, supplemented by a secret technique which was found among the one hundred and eight ancient characters. This could be considered a unique invention. When the formation began full operation, it would be able to absorb the universe’s spiritual qi and turn it into activation energy, and would be able to withstand a strike from a pinnacle Great Saint. Such a defensive level certainly could not be breached by anyone from the Heaven Wasteland Domain, whereas pinnacle Great Saint-level beings from foreign domains were unlikely to have nothing better to do than forsaking their status and coming to rob the secret techniques in the Heaven Wasteland Arsenal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After completing all this, Ye Qingyu went to the palace to visit Empress Yu Xiaoxing, whom he chatted with for half a day as a way of helping her to temporarily take her mind off the myriad political matters she was bogged down by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Persuaded by her, he performed the [Young Xiaoxing of the Fast-aging Heaven Wasteland] sword technique together with her in the Imperial Garden. Later on, he improved this sword technique a little based on the original, and changed its name to [Young Xing Sword of the Heaven Wasteland], for he had always felt that the original name was weird and rather inauspicious. Yu Xiaoxing was naturally happy with the changes for a very simple reason – after the changes, this sword technique became a technique exclusive to her and her cousin-brother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After having dinner with her in the palace, Ye Qingyu returned to Light City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he returned, he again received a letter from Tang Chong, the commander of the white-robed divine guards in Heaven Connect City. In the letter, Tang Chong revealed that Ren Puyang had still not returned to Heaven Connect City. These days, the first deputy held the fort of the Human Race in the Alliance of Domains, and everything was going considerably smoothly. However, Tang Chong was also in the dark regarding the matter behind Ren Puyang’s secretive expedition. According to the investigations which he had sufficient authority to perform, he could confirm that no major event had taken place in the Vast Thousand Domains, and so he was not able to determine Ren Puyang’s whereabouts via induction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The first deputy?” Ye Qingyu felt surprised as he read the letter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was given the status of third deputy with his promotion to a Human Race deputy, and naturally knew that there was a first and second deputy. However, who these people were and where they came from remained deeply mysterious. He had heard stories that they were experts of extraordinary strength who never appeared in public, as if they were Ren Puyang’s shadows and perpetually hid in the dark such that nobody knew their true identities. With the addition of Ye Qingyu as a third deputy, the Human Race had a total of four spokespersons at the Alliance. The prominent ones were Ren Puyang and Ye Qingyu, while the other two were unknown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Certainly, Ren Puyang’s approval was required for one to become a Human Race deputy. This thereby meant that both the first and second deputies were credible people. Hence, Ye Qingyu relaxed a little after reading the letter, safe in the knowledge that the Human Race was not in a leader-less predicament at the Alliance of Domains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The letter also contained some news of the Phoenix Race.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, these pieces of news were of little use to Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was because, in the letter, Tang Chong only vaguely mentioned that the Phoenix Race seemed to be preparing for war, and was maintaining a relaxed facade while actually intense inside. However, it was not within his power to find out the reason why they were going to war and the identity of their opponents. Moreover, there was no news about the Celestial Phoenix Maiden whom Ye Qingyu was most concerned about. According to Tang Chong, this maiden, who had wowed the Vast Thousand Domains for decades, had not been seen since more than half a year ago, which, by Ye Qingyu’s calculations, was when he met her in the Phoenix Race’s hall in the divine temple of the Alliance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was somewhat worried by this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the Phoenix Race and the Celestial Phoenix Maiden were both very strong, the latter was injured when Ye Qingyu last saw her. Besides, he actually knew who the Phoenix Race was preparing for war against, while he himself had all along never given up on the Unmoving City of Darkness. Unfortunately, these four words seemed to be a kind of taboo and were excessively mysterious, such that nobody talked about them. As he recalled the vivid images of various sects jointly fighting and killing when the Unmoving City of Darkness appeared in the Heaven Wasteland Domain, he could not feeling worried like never before for Song Xiaojun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu had thought about going to find Song Xiaojun, but now had no means of finding her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had also attempted to contact the Phoenix Race, but without going through a friend like the Celestial Phoenix Maiden, they would absolutely not talk about a taboo topic with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In addition, Tang Chong’s letter mentioned a few other things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Four Stars holy girl, who was rendered ashen-faced and all but discredited as a result of Ye Qingyu’s matter, had ended her self-isolation two months ago, and was walking among the Vast Thousand Domains again. As soon as she emerged, she successively crushed several experts of various races who used to be equal in standing with Ye Qingyu and superior in fame to herself, displaying exceedingly terrifying strength and attracting unprecedented attention. As such, her renown had reached a higher level than before. By now, there were already people who called her the top female expert of the new generation. Her actions were certainly extremely conspicuous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To the surprise of many people, there had recently been an endless series of female Heaven’s pridelings springing up. Aside from the Four Stars holy girl, two young female Heaven’s pridelings had emerged on the Road of Chaos. Their origins and identities were extremely mysterious, and they had sprung up completely without warning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of them was rumored to be a successor of White Jade Capital, which was a Human Race ancient sect that had died out tens of thousands of years ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the poem goes, “The White Jade Capital of Heaven has twelve pavilions and five cities. Deities caress my head and grant me longevity.” This was a poem which had resounded through the Vast Thousand Domains ten thousand years ago. The words “White Jade Capital” referred to none other than this sect, which was said to be feared by everyone and to have produced countless Immortals. It mastered a secret technique of longevity which was an inheritance from a former emperor of the early days of creation. It used to be matchlessly powerful, such that even a hegemonic sect like the Four Stars Sect could not compare to it. Unfortunately, it was annihilated overnight, shocking the entire Vast Thousand Domains, for nobody could imagine what kind of power could have wiped out a sect like this overnight. This became one of the most astonishing mysteries in history. Legend had it that this was because White Jade Capital had become excessively heaven-defying by mastering the longevity technique, thereby incurring Heaven’s wrath and getting wiped off the face of the universe...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people originally thought that White Jade Capital had already become ancient history and a name of long ago. Nobody could have guessed that a successor would suddenly emerge in this world, thereby causing widespread shock. Many forces and beings wanted to know whether this successor still possessed the secrets of longevity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the origin of the other emerging female Heaven’s prideling was not quite as prominent, there were two points which caused a stir throughout the Vast Thousand Domains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first was her appearance, which was beautiful and gorgeous to an extreme. It was said that even a Saint who was already several thousand years old and free of all desires and passions would be touched by her beauty upon seeing her smile. There was a Fox Race Heaven’s prideling who fell madly in love with her upon seeing her shed a tear, while, in less than three months, countless young talents from various races, too, fell head over heels in love with her and were even willing to become her servant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The second was that this girl of generational talent and beauty had unexpectedly mastered many top-level battle techniques of various sects and races, and could adeptly display the martial craft of various races. She had broken through the racial limitations of many techniques, and, incredibly, was able to display the secret techniques of dozens of races even more powerfully than the aces of the respective race. This girl was called the [Fatally Beautiful Fairy].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These three female Heaven’s pridelings, namely the Four Stars holy girl, the White Jade Capital successor, and the [Fatally Beautiful Fairy], had stirred up the Vast Thousand Domains and captured the eyeballs of countless people, becoming the focal point of various sides. By comparison, the stir which Ye Qingyu had caused on the Road of Chaos some time ago had already gradually subsided and was mentioned by very few people. As the saying went, every new generation excels the previous one. In less than four months, Ye Qingyu had already become old news.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Chong was emotional like never before in his letter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the tailend of the letter, Tang Chong did not forget to vaguely mention the repercussions on the Road of Chaos caused by Ye Qingyu’s tough stance on the chambers of commerce. He expressed his belief that this was the right thing to do, and stated that the nineteen cities of chaos’ opinion of the Heaven Wasteland Domain was slowly rising, with many people beginning to see the Heaven Wasteland Domain as equals. Tang Chong also clearly expressed that, should Ye Qingyu run into trouble during this process, the white-robed divine guards would certainly be willing to lend their strength.
