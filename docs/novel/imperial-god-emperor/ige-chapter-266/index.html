 <p>Seeing the Dugu brothers stuttering and stammering, Wen Wan chuckled.</p>
 <p>"Fine, fine, you can just call me brother Wen. Let’s put Ye Qingyu and your grandfather’s relationship separate. We can take care of our own hierarchy." Wen Wan finally said something a normal person would say.“</p>
 <p>"Thank you uncle Wen." Dugu Tianxin still respectfully referred to him as uncle.</p>
 <p>At least uncle was still their senior.</p>
 <p>This was a show of respect and manners.</p>
 <p>But as Wen Wan heard this, his face darkened exaggeratingly. "I told you to call me brother. What uncle, am I that old?"</p>
 <p>Bai Yuanxing twitched slightly without anyone noticing. He remembered that Marquis also liked for others to call him brother and not uncle. No wonder they were teacher and student. Perhaps the occasional bad habits that Marquis Ye had, was really influenced by Officer Wen.</p>
 <p>The Dugu brothers instantly laughed.</p>
 <p>At this time, the two brothers could tell that the bearded man had a fun loving nature. His temperament was not bad. From his tone, he evidently knew who their grandfather was, so he should be a important person. Thankfully they had always been very polite and did not got overboard previously.</p>
 <p>Song Zhi and his other cronies was ultimately not able to flee. They were all beaten to death.</p>
 <p>"When I return, I will definitely teach my underlings well. This time we nearly caused a grave error, I hope that Miss Song can forgive us." Dugu Dixiu respectfully gave his apologies to Song Qingluo. After hearing what had happened from his servants, Dugu Dixiu had cold sweat all over his body. If matters really progressed as the trash Song Zhi planned, then his grandfather would definitely break their legs. After all, Song Zhi was the underling he had recruited.</p>
 <p>Between the Dugu brothers, Dugu Tianxin had mercantile talent, and was the more ambitious of the two. The way he did things could be as counted as proper. As for Dugu Dixiu, he was somewhat more hedonistic, normally liking to play with around with meaningless affairs, and was idle all day. He did not have much ambition, and normally just like to play and enjoy life. Song Zhi and the others, were the cronies he had cultivated. This time, they nearly caused a catastrophe.</p>
 <p>"No, no......you are being polite Master Dugu, I'm fine." Song Qingluo said somewhat exaggeratedly.</p>
 <p>She was stunned by the identity of the opposing party. Furthermore, the twist and turn of this situation had caused too great a stimulus to her. Her thoughts were a complete mess. Even a clever girl like her could not adjust in such a short timeframe.</p>
 <p>"Don't say useless crap." Wen Wan said loudly. "Miss Song wants the right to enter into the Proud sky centre, do you think you Dugu brothers can fulfill that wish or not."</p>
 <p>As Song Qingluo heard this, her heart trembled, afraid that they won't help.</p>
 <p>Dugu Tianxin smiled: "For such a small matters, that's naturally no problem. Just how many people does Miss Song want to bring inside? How about this, I'll tell my people to prepare an invitation for a merchant company to enter for you to have. It'll give Miss Song a second class stand. You can bring anyone up to 30 people inside. Will that fulfill your needs?"</p>
 <p>"Truly?" Song Qingluo could not believe her own ears.</p>
 <p>One must know that previously, her father had suffered countless cold laughter, being rejected and played around with time after time. And this was all because he wanted to gain the right to enter into the Proud sky centre. Even if he was only able enter for a short hour. She did not imagine that Dugu Tianxin would just directly give her an invitation and something called a second class stand.....</p>
 <p>"Of course." Dugu Dixiu did his utmost to exhibit his best side. "In truth, the Dugu organisation can even obtain a first class stand for you. But the merchant companies of this area, requires at least one Spirit weapon as the treasure of such a stand. Furthermore, the companies from there are all a bunch of disagreeable characters. If you went there, I'm afraid you won't be able to adjsut to such an atmosphere. Therefore that's why my brother chose a second class stand. If you are not satisfied....."</p>
 <p>"No, no no, I'm already very satisfied. Thank you, thank you master Dugu."</p>
 <p>Song Qingluo was about to shed tears of happiness.</p>
 <p>This really was searching for something all over but finding it landing at your own feet.</p>
 <p>Originally, she was already in the midst of despair. She did not imagine the situation would turn about so abruptly and be settled just like that. This far exceeded her original hopes.</p>
 <p>"Miss Song you are being too courteous. This is something easily done." Dugu Dixiu replied in a extremely respectful tone. "You are the lover of elder Ye, to be able to do something for you, is the honour of us brothers....."</p>
 <p>Song Qingluo face lit up like red clouds, her face like fire. She was so embarrassed she wanted to hide.</p>
 <p>But without knowing why, there was a sweet feeling in her heart.</p>
 <p>Fourteen to fifteen was namely the age when most people started to immerse themselves in romance. When Ye Qingyu had exhibited his unparalleled talent at White Deer academy, his glory had completely enshrouded all the other geniuses of white Deer academy. It was only that, Ye Qingyu came from a common background and always acted and did things alone. People who did not know him could hardly approach him. The only person who was somewhat close to him was Song Xiaojun. Song Qingluo did have some feelings for Ye Qingyu, but she could not exhibit it, nor did she have the opportunity to show it.</p>
 <p>Who would have guessed that in less than a year, that youth of a common background, was now noble beyond words. Even the highest noble students of the noble families in White Deer acadmey, had no way of ever comparing to him.</p>
 <p>Song Qingluo suddenly felt, that her clumsy and ditzy little sister Song Xiaojun, perhaps was the person with the greatest insight out of all the students.</p>
 <p>"No...we are only...."</p>
 <p>Song Qingluo lowered her head, her voice as weak as the buzz of a fly. She could not say the other half of the explanation no matter what.</p>
 <p>Before she had finished, suddenly---</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>A strange aura, suddenly exploded without any indication from the North West direction.</p>
 <p>This was a feeling that was exceedingly change.</p>
 <p>It was as if there was some terrifying and vast power, that was spreading out explosively throughout the air using some method that could not be discerned using the naked eye. Song Qingluo felt like her inner organs was being struck by this powerful spiritual surge, causing her to nearly scream out loud.</p>
 <p>Then they could see, all the clouds in the skies swirling.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, all the clouds had completely disappeared.</p>
 <p>It was as if the hand of an invisible deity had swept the skies completely clean. There was an unprecedentedly azure dome of heaven appearing, as if it had just been washed.</p>
 <p>The exhibited shocking splendour and beauty, caused Song Qingluo to be speechless.</p>
 <p>"What's happening?"</p>
 <p>She turned her head to look at the others.</p>
 <p>The Dugu brothers were regarding each other, both as confused as the other.</p>
 <p>"There’s a top class expert who's broken out of isolation training." The beardless middle aged man that was previosuly beside the two brothers had shock written all over his face, as if he had just witnessed a deity. His mouth was wide open as he looked at the North West direction.</p>
 <p>"This is…..”</p>
 <p>Wen Wan's face no longer had any hint of teasing. He was both shocked, and somewhat confused.</p>
 <p>At this time, there was the sound of a true explosion from far off.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The dust rose up from the North West direction, large amounts of rock shooting in the skies.</p>
 <p>A ray of light shot up into the skies.</p>
 <p>This scenery, was like a gigantic stone had just been dropped into the ocean. There were ripples upon ripples undulating in the azure blue sky, the invisible air currents fluctuating above like a tsunami. The originally calm and quite blue sky started boiling, the peacefulness of everything being destroyed. It was as if some barrier in the sky was being torn apart.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>A storm began to gather.</p>
 <p>At this time, there was no light at all. There was a coldness that seeped into the bones emanating hundreds of miles throughout the land.</p>
 <p>Clouds suddenly appeared, the white cloud layer nearly covering the entire sky. The raging storm tore aparts the layer of clouds, and the white clouds became as violent as the sea in a storm. The scenery constantly transformed. Finally there were translucent snowflakes that floated up from high above to the ground below.</p>
 <p>"It's snowing?"</p>
 <p>There were people letting out gasps of shock.</p>
 <p>The season currently was the end of Spring. Although Youyan pass was a place of the bitter cold, but it was still rare for snow to descend at such a time.</p>
 <p>Snowflakes floated and scattered, landing on Youyan Pass.</p>
 <p>Another even more inexplicable scenery appeared. The cloud layer that was throughout the sky suddenly constricted. Like a whale sucking in water, in less than three breaths of time, it suddenly consolidated, turning into a piercing bright point of light. It was a possible to see the figure of a person within this point of light, then everything disappeared. The dazzling jewel like azure blue sky appeared once again.</p>
 <p>A bright glaring sun, hung in the sky.</p>
 <p>The sunlight war warm.</p>
 <p>A moderate wind and a beautiful sun.。</p>
 <p>But snowflakes were still floating down.</p>
 <p>Under the illumination of the sunlight, these translucent snowflakes emitted a colourful splendour. It was as if there were multicoloured sprits dancing in the sky singing, an exceeding beautiful scenery. Those who saw such a scene, were all completely dumbfounded by its beauty.</p>
 <p>"These signs, are the premonition that a top class expert is about to breatk through. I wonder just what genius has entered into the Bitter Sea stage?"</p>
 <p>The white faced beardless man said in an unsettled tone, not yet recovered from such shock.</p>
 <p>He originally was an extremely famous martial expert. But it was still his first time witnessing such a scene. For such a powerful energy fluctuation to appear, it evidently was the aura of someone who had just steppped into the Bitter Sea stage. But if it was a normal Bitter Sea stage expert appearing, just how would it create such a scene that made it seem like a deity was descending. The landscape was completely changed. This was not the doing of a mortal.</p>
 <p>It was not only him alone.</p>
 <p>Within Youyan pass, there were countless experts that were stunned by such a scene.</p>
 <p>Crepe Myrtle sect, Deer cauldron sect, Violet Seven stars sect, Dragon tiger sect........</p>
 <p>In the residence of these top level sects, the young and proud disciples stared with fear at the scenery in the skies. They were guessing, just which genius of which sect, had stepped past this utterly important boundary at this time.</p>
 <p>-----------------------------</p>
 <p>Pass Lord's Residence.</p>
 <p>Lu Zhaoge's face was complicated.</p>
 <p>Liu Yuqing stood at the window of the Military council pavilion, faintly smiling.</p>
 <p>Behind him, Xing'er stood dumbly staring at the snowflakes floating in the sky. He stretched out his palm, it was slightly cold. Very quickly, it turned into a drop of water, translucent like jade. Under the illumination of the sunlight, it reflected a radiant brightness.</p>
 <p>-----------------------------</p>
 <p>Hundred herb hall, top floor.</p>
 <p>There was a strange lotus fire flickering in Dugu Quan's palm.</p>
 <p>"Haha, this aura.......that's right, it's him. My eyes were definitely not wrong."</p>
 <p>………………….</p>
 <p>The entrance to the Proud sky centre.</p>
 <p>Song Qingluo felt her vision blurring.</p>
 <p>A white clothed, black haired youth appeared.</p>
 <p>This young man had a tall slender body and a handsome face. His eyes was as deep and as mysterious as stars in the sky, his eyebrows hidden beneath his hair. He had long hair, seeming to be flicks of light fluctuating in his hair. He was wearing a white robe, and it was so clean and pur ethat it was like perfect snow on top of a snowy mountain for tens for thousdans of years.There were not any impurites at all. A silver hairpin, held his long black hair back. There was an indescribable aura about him due to his prescence.</p>
 <p>It was him!</p>
 <p>Song Qingluo's heart, suddenly began fiercely beating.</p>
