 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew that he was unlike Xie Yuyun, in that he had already made a mistake. He had slaughtered tens of thousands of people of the northwest Brute Race, and his hands were stained with blood. Therefore, the crisis today had not yet passed for him. If he were to get up, then after Deputy Envoy Ye Qingyu cleaned up the Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce, next it would be the Engraved Cauldron Chamber of Commerce. And he would bear the brunt. His ending would not be better than Li Wanhai in any way.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu glanced at Zhen Shi, and ignored him. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Well, since I have President Fu Tianao's words, then I'll wait for the Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce to give an account to the Heaven Wasteland Empire.” Ye Qingyu returned to the main seat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fu Tianao nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Next, the president of the top chamber of commerce said a few words to Ye Qingyu, but seeing the cold and indifferent look that Ye Qingyu had, he knew that he did not want to say anything to him and should not pester him any longer. He tactfully gave a cupped fist salute and took his leave with the plain clothed old man Ke Juxian as well as the other people of the Sky Suppressing Chamber of commerce.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait,” Ye Qingyu spoke all of a sudden.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fu Tianao turned around, politely asking, “Deputy Envoy Ye Qingyu, is there something else?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu pointed to the paralyzed Li Wanhai on the ground, “Take him away. In the future, I do not want to see him in Heaven Wasteland Domain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Understood.” Fu Tianao waved his hand, and immediately experts of the Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce rushed over to support Li Wanhai up, and dragged him away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fu Tianao bowed again, and really left Light City. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xie Yuyun and Li Yu were people with a flexible mind, and knew that it was best for them to leave now, so they hurriedly went up to present the generous gift they had prepared. Ye Qingyu smiled inwardly, but appeared outwardly unconcerned, while Lin Zheng stood up and accepted the gifts on Ye Qingyu's behalf. The two finally raised their brows and beamed with joy, and could finally breathe a sigh of relief.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The big show seemed to have draw to a close.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Zhen Shi was still trembling and kneeling in fear. He dared not to speak, or even look up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If there were regret medicine in this world, Zhen Shi was willing to exchange it with all his possessions, and eat it all at once, even if he dies eating it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu did not glance at him from the beginning to end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people naturally no longer mentioned Zhen Shi when they saw Ye Qingyu's response, acting as if he did not exist at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He stood up slowly, his face much gentler than before, smiled, raised the glass of wine, looked at the courtiers of the Heaven Wasteland Empire, and laughed, “Everybody, the storm has passed, let's continue, please drink the wine!” Everybody in the Fire Grove raised a wine cup. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everybody toasted one another with a smile. The atmosphere at the banquet suddenly was incredibly warm. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The courtiers of the empire were completely relaxed. Having experienced the series of events, although they did not know what the title Deputy Envoy signified, they were still extremely curious. However there was one thing that they were certain of, and that was, even top chambers of commerce, which were enough to make the entire Heaven Wasteland Domain tremble, did not dare to offend Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was enough.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was enough to know that.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The courtiers that were invited to the banquet today were all intelligent people, and thus understood the reason that Palace Lord Ye Qingyu invited them to the banquet. Through the matters of the Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce, when they again faced the major chambers of commerce, they would no longer be like before, overcautious for fear of offending them, and the implementation of any policy would be smoother than before. Everybody had confidence in this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, what else would they be afraid of with such a tough character standing in Heaven Wasteland Empire? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And the courtiers who had been secretly enticed and bribed by the major chambers of commerce, even if they were swayed before, after this matter they had completely abandoned the plan and intention to secretly cooperate with the foreign chambers of commerce for profit. The strength of Ye Qingyu made them understand how terrifying the consequences of doing so would be. Even the Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce had to bow down facing Ye Qingyu. If they were to do anything that would be damaging to Heaven Wasteland Domain, then sooner or later they would be found out, and even an Immortal could not save them at that time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Hong Yuan Chamber of Commerce was a good example.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shortly after Fu Tianao and the others left, Hong Lin and Hong Ruoqing were mercilessly dragged out from the Fire Grove by the Light soldiers. The wealthy young master, who dared to make things difficult for Ye Qingyu, had already fainted and peed his pants. While the President of the Hong Yuan Chamber of Commerce Hong Lin, who had long turned to the Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce, hoping that they could help him out, in the end did not even have the courage to speak. He was like a dead man as he was dragged out, completely given up all hope, and forgotten to even struggle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon after, the two great heads were hung from the towering pillars outside Light City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And at the same time, before the Fire Grove banquet came to an end, the Hong Yuan Chamber of Commerce was directly searched by the Light soldiers camp, all properties were seized, the escorts and servants dismissed, and the accomplices that were involved in the kidnapping of women were all sent to the Imperial prison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The illustrious Hong Yuan Chamber of Commerce, after this day, was removed from Heaven Wasteland Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, these all happened later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The banquet that day continued until the evening lights were brightly lit before the host and guests scattered. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But everyone knew in their hearts that the storm had not really passed, instead it was just the beginning. From the start, Ye Qingyu had no intention of concealing this news, so what happened here was inevitably spread at the fastest speed possible. It naturally did not take long before the entire Heaven Wasteland Domain knew about what had happened today. It could easily be imagined how stirred up the officialdom of the empire would be.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that time, the various foreign chambers of commerce, aristocratic families and financial groups would certainly hear about it, and there wouldn’t be any other foreign forces acting arrogant and superior in the face of the officials of the Heaven Wasteland Empire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This way, the two sides could really stand on equal status to conduct business activities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A banquet had solved the greatest problem facing the empire today without the slightest blood on the men's swords. Following this, Ye Qingyu's prestige in the empire would no doubt rise to an incredible level, which even that of the Empress could not be compared to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was night, and Ye Qingyu stayed overnight in the Fire Grove.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhen Shi of the Engraved Cauldron Chamber of Commerce also knelt the whole night in the Fire Grove.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The next day, the whole Snow capital was already in a stirred-up state. The chiefs of all small or large chambers of commerce, as though they had gone crazy, were lining up outside of Light City with generous gifts, hoping to meet the Human Race deputy envoy, but were all turned away——Even the chiefs of the Immemorial, Sunrise and Free and Unfettered Chambers of Commerce were no exception, and refused entry. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many ordinary officials of the empire who had not heard the news, during the course of their duties, were very surprised to find that the high and mighty arrogant people in the past had become incredibly polite. The harsh and rude business conditions they proposed before were completely altered today. The terms were simply incredibly generous...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The aftermath from the banquet was constantly spreading.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu stayed another night in Light City, and still did not see the Empress come out of training.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the third day, Ye Qingyu left Snow capital alone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he left, there was still a figure kneeling outside the Fire Grove, motionless, like a statue.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The most illustrious sect among the Jianghu sects in Heaven Wasteland Empire. In the past, the former Matchless Blade City was considered as a large sect but among the Three Sects and Three Schools, it could only be regarded as the middle, and there was no sign of it rising any time soon. However, now even the people who did not have a good opinion of Matchless Blade City must admit that the city was already a super force in the martial arts world of Heaven Wasteland Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All this was because of Qin Zhishui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Four years ago, in the terrifying battle that happened in the Snow capital, Qin Zhishui, who was only a young lord of Matchless Blade City at that time, stood on the side of Lord Ye Qingyu of the Light Palace, and as a result Qin Zhishui rose to the sky with Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Matchless Blade City became the first sect of the martial arts world that received official recognition and support from the empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu returned from Clear River Domain three years ago, and having solved a difficult problem, he leapt into becoming the strongest of Heaven Wasteland Domain, and was invincible in the entire domain. Qin Zhishui, under Ye Qingyu's support, became the City Lord of Matchless Blade City, and brought the former Matchless Blade City, which was considered as the middle sect of the Three Sects and Three Schools, to the peak of the martial arts world in Heaven Wasteland Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Zhishui's strength also rapidly improved and, as early as a year ago, he was said to have reached the fifth step of the Immortal Step realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was unknown how many people were envious and jealous of him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He walked the right path and made the right friends; it was as though the heavens had been helping Qin Zhishui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although it was said that a tall tree attracts the wind and that Qin Zhishui was inextricably linked to the imperial officials, he always had an excellent reputation in Jianghu. Not to mention that almost everyone would stick up their thumb upon hearing the title of [Matchless Blade King]g, because Qin Zhishui was righteous, did things fairly, and had never taken advantage of his position to bully others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In these three years, no one had dared to provoke Matchless Blade City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Until twenty days ago, a martial arts expert called Wen Fusheng, who had been challenging the famous experts of the martial arts world of Heaven Wasteland Domain and had never been defeated once, finally came to Matchless Blade City. In the center of the Matchless Blade Tower, he challenged Qin Zhishui, and won. Qin Zhishui’s [Matchless Blade] was destroyed, he was seriously injured, and could be said to be at his last gasp. The good days of Matchless Blade City seem to be completely over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If Qin Zhishui says that Ye Qingyu has an undeserved reputation, then I can return the [Matchless Blade], and Matchless Blade City can save its reputation... Otherwise, in ten days, I will destroy Matchless Blade City residence, flatted Matchless Blade City, and kill Qin Zhishui and all of the people above the Immoral Step realm in Matchless Blade City!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wen Fusheng let out these words——</span></p>
