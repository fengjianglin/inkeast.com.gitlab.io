 <p>"These people should be the experts who had arrived previously in the divine gate."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu could largely guess as to who they were.</p>
 <p>It was only that he did not recognize the majority of the people here.</p>
 <p>But those who were able to reach such a stage must be truly important characters in the outside world.</p>
 <p>It was only that their current state where they stood there dumbfoundedly, as if their souls had been absorbed away from their bodies... just what was this?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu attempted to step on one of the yellow stone tiles to allow the blue light marking to shine on his feet. But after stepping on tens of yellow stone tiles, there wasn't the slightest of effect whatsoever.</p>
 <p>"Just what is this?”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu could not understand.</p>
 <p>"Woof, no need to try. You must have came late and missed your opportunity." Little Nine had a face that said ‘Ye Qingyu had failed him’ on his face.</p>
 <p>That should not be so.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu did not too believe in this.</p>
 <p>He was about to open his mouth and ask Song Xiaojun to try. But he did not imagine, when he turned around, he would discover that Song Xiaojun had already disappeared without knowing when. The girl who had stood on a demon lotus and appeared, had gone completely. He had no idea where she had gone.</p>
 <p>Why was it like this?</p>
 <p>The situation became more and more strange.</p>
 <p>Would the little girl be in some sort of danger?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu slapped himself in the head, somewhat worried in his heart. But after careful thought, Song Xiaojun did not seem to be restricted by that humongous 'ordinary' character in the sky within the [Base of the Formation Sovereign]. With her strength, she should not encounter any problems.</p>
 <p>After thinking for a while, Ye Qingyu continued ahead beyond the courtyard.</p>
 <p>A hundred meters away, he came to the entrance of the divine palace.</p>
 <p>There were stone tiles that had strange inscriptions on it floating above the stone steps, as if it was floating on water and was supported by an invisible energy. He walked on the stone steps, step by step. In total they numbered a hundred and eight, until he was on the stone base of the divine palace.</p>
 <p>"Hou Hou Hou..."</p>
 <p>There was a series of mad and enraged roars coming from demonic beasts that sounded out.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was taken aback.</p>
 <p>When he turned his head to look, he saw that the massive silver stone gateway to the main entrance of the stone shrine had two large and incomparably mysterious symbols etched onto it. The curved and wacky brushstrokes on it seemed like the scribbles of a little kid, but also a labyrinth that made one dizzy when one beheld it. More importantly, the two large symbols were scarlet red. There was a light dancing within these brush strokes, that looked like fresh blood. There was a sort of abnormal and sorrowful atmosphere that was throughout.</p>
 <p>Every hundredth of a breath, the two large blood red symbols would rapidly flicker.</p>
 <p>And every time it flickered, there would be a flood-like tide of beasts that appeared from within.</p>
 <p>The forms of these demonic beasts were not the same, being of all sorts and sizes. But they all held a berserk and destructive aura about them. Their bloody red eyes flickered with a terrifying bloodthirstiness. They galloped madly, but after running for less than a meter, it seemed as if there was a water ripple in the air. It seemed as if the barriers of space had melted, the demonic beasts entered into the ripple and would disappear to the other side of the water ripple.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu suppressed the shock in his heart as he neared and observed.</p>
 <p>Right now, he could confirm that those demonic beasts which were running madly to attack Deer City, was namely created from these two massive blood red symbols.</p>
 <p>Here was the origin of the demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>The two symbols on the massive silver stone gate was the origin of all the destruction.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu had once thought of countless explanations.</p>
 <p>But he did not imagine that the end result would be like so.</p>
 <p>Just what were these two blood red symbols, that they were able to create such berserk demonic beasts?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu neared, wanting to inspect from a closer distance.</p>
 <p>But when he was less than ten meters away from the massive silver stone gate, something unexpected happen. The two large and strange demonic symbols suddenly emitted faint mist. It was like an invisible giant hand that lightly smothered it, wiping away these two symbols.</p>
 <p>The demonic blood red symbols had disappeared.</p>
 <p>The huge silver stone gate returned to normal.</p>
 <p>And then there were no more demonic beasts that came charging and roaring out.</p>
 <p>The barrier in the air a meter away also disappeared.</p>
 <p>The endless roars and howls of the beast also disappeared.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu still had not yet grasped what had occurred--</p>
 <p>Crash!</p>
 <p>The huge silver stone door in front of him let out a rumble, slowly and gradually opening.</p>
 <p>A vast power of thunder surged out from the stone doors. Faintly, it was as if they could hear the roars of Gods and Devils fighting. They were able to hear singing of heavenly girls. They were able to hear the laughter of giant demonic lifeforms, hear the noise of life forms killing each other, hear the weeping of divine kings...</p>
 <p>There were countless sounds that did not belong to the world.</p>
 <p>The vast power of thunder grabbed at Ye Qingyu. He could not even struggle, there was no way of resisting, even if he underwent dragonification. His entire person was slowly being carried into the opened gate.</p>
 <p>Little Nine was also similarly dragged inside.</p>
 <p>As well as the Little Silver dragon that had transformed into a hairpin.</p>
 <p>These fellows felt something was wrong, and did their utmost to struggle. The figure of the silly dog expanded, his paws gripping the stone door tightly. The Little Silver dragon also exposed his true form, his draconic talons grabbing at the door, wanting to help drag Ye Qingyu out together. But ultimately, they were all pulled within the stone door, entering into the divine shrine.</p>
 <p>Then the large silver stone door shut.</p>
 <p>Nearly at the same time.</p>
 <p>A strange light ripple, with the divine palace at the center, surged out towards the open yard.</p>
 <p>Those experts who were dumbly standing where they were, gazing at the heavens, had the light wave flicker through their body. Instantly, it was as if they awakened from their dreams, recovering to normality. There was joy as well as shock on their faces. They looked at their surroundings, then became cautious...</p>
 <p>"What happened?"</p>
 <p>"Could this have been an illusion?"</p>
 <p>"I seem to have gained something."</p>
 <p>"Is the formation palace in front of us?"</p>
 <p>"The Legacy of his majesty Luo So should be within the divine palace.“</p>
 <p>"But we have no way of entering."</p>
 <p>"We've only just reached the open yard, but we could not help but stay here and comprehend the Dao. Then within the divine palace, there must be something even more ridiculous?"</p>
 <p>There was a series of low discussion.</p>
 <p>Those experts who had been awakened from amidst their enlightenment, comprehended what they had been able to obtain. They were all overjoyed. They had not imagined that there would be such a fortuitous encounter within the formation yard. Only they themselves knew what they had obtained, but from the expressions of everyone, one could determine it was something great.</p>
 <p>The yellow stone tiles below their feet flickered.</p>
 <p>Those strange blue markings and patterns disappeared from the yellow tiles, and appeared on their palms.</p>
 <p>Those blue patterns were like they were etched onto their skin. It would appear and disappear as they willed it.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the 'ordinary' character floating above the air completely disappeared.</p>
 <p>The restrictive power also disappeared that had suppressed them previously.</p>
 <p>"Ah... I can use my inner yuan once again."</p>
 <p>"The power of yuan qi has returned.”</p>
 <p>"Hahaha, this is too great. I can finally recover my normal strength."</p>
 <p>This unexpected event caused everyone to become excited. Power had once again returned to their bodies, returning a sense of security to everyone.</p>
 <p>There were some people who looked at the strange blue markings that had appeared on their palms.</p>
 <p>They attempted to insert a strand of yuan qi into the blue markings.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>A huge blue light shot towards the sky, like a sharp divine sword. It tore through space, even slicing apart the fabric of space.</p>
 <p>"This..." Even the person himself was shocked.</p>
 <p>He had only inserted a tiny portion of yuan qi, but it had displayed such a powerful offensive ability... this, was this the legendary legacy that the [Formation Sovereign] had left behind?</p>
 <p>Boom Boom!</p>
 <p>There were blue lights that constantly tore through space.</p>
 <p>Evidently, the others had also discovered the frightening ability of the blue pattern on their hands.</p>
 <p>"Hahaha..." There were people madly laughing.</p>
 <p>Ximen Yeshui also looked at his own palm, his heart overjoyed.</p>
 <p>The blue light pattern in his palm was exactly the same as the blue under his feet on the yellow stone tiles. In other words, after such a temporary experience and comprehension, he had obtained the power of that seal on the yellow tile.</p>
 <p>Although he had not tried it yet, but he could be sure that the blue light on his right hand had not yet demonstrated its full power. As he continued to examine and mull over it, it's power would definitely increase.</p>
 <p>Was this the legacy left behind by the [Formation Sovereign], his majesty Luo So?</p>
 <p>The Qin Zhishui by the side held his blade in his right hand and activated the formation light in his hand. The blue light instantly wrapped around the red silk battle blade in his right hand. A powerful blade will instantly spread about everywhere.</p>
 <p>He did not strike out.</p>
 <p>But the power was already evident.</p>
 <p>Even with Qin Zhishui's calm demeanour, he could not help but smile.</p>
 <p>This exploration had risk their lives several times over. He had finally received a reward in the journey to the formation palace.</p>
 <p>He and Ximen Yeshui had ran here madly. When they reached the open yard, they could see the crowd of people standing therir dumbly. Before they could notice anything, the yellow stone tiles below their feet suddenly let out a blue light. Then their body, as if it could not be controlled, like their souls had left their body and entered into a strange environment, was met with a series of test. Hence, they began their enlightenment.</p>
 <p>Such a process, seemed long, but also fleeting.</p>
 <p>From the current situation, it was evident the people of the yard had unintentionally activated the blue light on the stone tiles and each received their fortuitous encounter.</p>
 <p>Such a result, was something no one had expected.</p>
 <p>They originally thought, when they reached the formation palace, there would be a great bloody battle. Only those with the strongest strength or perhaps the greatest fortune, would be able to obtain the legacy of the [Formation Sovereign] after paying a certain price.</p>
 <p>Who would have imagined everyone would receive something.</p>
 <p>This great battle should be able to be prevented.</p>
