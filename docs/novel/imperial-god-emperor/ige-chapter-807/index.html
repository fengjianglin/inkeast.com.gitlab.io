If Ye Qingyu did not deliberately slander us, then he would appear and speak with us face-to-face. The fact that he has not done so shows that he is guilty. We hope that all the various sects and our fellow martial artists will stand with us, the Black Moon Divine Palace, in annihilating this malicious punk from the lower domains."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These were the statements that the Black Moon Divine Palace continued to release to the foreign domains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu seemed to have vanished into thin air and no one could track him down at all. Furthermore, he had even consecutively destroyed the representative stations of the Black Moon Divine Palace across the major cities. This was a great insult to the Black Moon Divine Palace and they also felt immense pressure from Ye Qingyu's accusations. If they were indeed found guilty of launching a sudden attack on the Heaven Wasteland envoy mission, then they would find it hard to stomach the pressure from the Alliance of Domains. After all, they were not a super force, unlike the Four Stars Sect, the Divine Sky Sect, etc.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Haha. How dare you ask me to make an appearance. Isn't it clear that you are going to kill me once I show up? You guys are just acting so innocent but I'm no fool. If Yang Wanqu appears, then I will also reveal myself because I can prove that he was the instigator behind the sudden attack on the Heaven Wasteland envoy mission. Black Moon Divine Palace, do you dare accept this challenge?" Ye Qingyu also released a statement to the foreign domains. Shuang Wuyan had his own methods of masking Ye Qingyu's voice to the rest of the domains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was so insistent on demanding that Yang Wanqu make an appearance because he wanted to give them the wrong impression that he really had evidence and pile on the psychological pressure on the Black Moon Divine Palace. The more he did that, the more Yang Wanqu would refuse to show himself. The foreign domains would then start to find the Black Moon Divine Palace's actions suspicious and the public opinion would turn against them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Yang Wanqu is the successor of the Black Moon Divine Palace and was blessed with great fortune in the 18th district of the Black Demon Pool. He is currently in self-isolation in a bid to reach the Saint realm, so why would he make an appearance to attend to such frivolous matters at such a crucial time? That would only delay his progress, and we are sure Ye Qingyu is aware of this fact, having entered the 18th district together with our successor. He is only making such demands in order to deliberately destroy our successor's progression on the martial way. This is proof of his malicious intent."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Black Moon Divine Palace retorted with a statement.</span></p>

It was true that many people had been shocked and surprised that Yang Wanqu had come back to life from the 18th district of the Black Demon Pool, so it made sense that he was in self-isolation, processing whatever he had obtained from the 18th district.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Ye Qingyu is really devious. I have received news that he is ambitious and that he betrayed the Heaven Wasteland envoy mission, deliberately slandered the Black Moon Divine Palace, and created this mess. In actual fact, he is the culprit of whatever happened to the Heaven Wasteland envoy mission. It is also rumored that during his time in the Heaven Wasteland Domain, he suppressed his dissidents and secretly cultivated his own following. No one knows how many innocent citizens of the Heaven Wasteland Domain he killed, and he was known as the 'Executioner' and 'Demon King' there..." &nbsp;the master of Divine Life Sect said as he dragged Ye Qingyu's name through the mud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people were stunned by his words.</span></p>

Furthermore, it was not known to be an ally of the Black Moon Divine Palace nor have any private dealings with them. Therefore, their words caused many people to reevaluate their impression of Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Could this person just be a troublemaker?"</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, everyone started to hit Ye Qingyu while he was down.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The statement was succinct, but the message and intent behind the words hinted at where the Phoenix Race stood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before they could process this information, the Black Demon Pool also made their statement. This time, the Princess of the Black Demon Race announced that Ye Qingyu was a good man and made it clear that they would stand on his side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the Phoenix Race had only hinted at their support for Ye Qingyu, then the Black Demon Race's princess had clearly taken Ye Qingyu's side, so whoever wanted to harm Ye Qingyu would now need to think twice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was also to many people's surprise that the first city of chaos, Sunrise City, which was led by the Human Race, was also seen within the city. When their representatives spoke to their allies, they only had good words to say about Ye Qingyu, and thought that he was a young genius of the Human Race who was of good moral character and skilled in martial arts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This caused many people to be dumbfounded.</span></p>

He hardly ever took a stance, so for someone of his stature to make such a statement, the meaning behind his words was clear enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A young Heaven's prideling from a tiny domain had suddenly obtained the support of two super forces and a large city, and thus, he was now evenly matched with the Black Moon Divine Palace in terms of support. In fact, Ye Qingyu's side had the advantage in terms of power and support.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The situation had become even more tricky. Many large forces who had been observing the situation now did not dare to openly take sides and adopted a wait-and-see approach.</span></p>
