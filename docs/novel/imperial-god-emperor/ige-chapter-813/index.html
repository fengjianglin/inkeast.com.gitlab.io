They had thought of countless scenarios and outcomes, but they never could have imagined that the situation would turn out this way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was especially so for Master Zhu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This lean-faced, middle-aged scholar with a hooked nose had even forgotten to wave his fan. He stood some distance away from the representative station and stared blankly at the fiery scenes in front of him. He suddenly felt a little bewildered because the situation had veered so far away from his plans. This was the first time he had failed so badly since he joined the Black Moon Divine Palace camp as their master schemer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could not figure out how things had ended up this way.</span></p>

However, he had spent the largest amount of resources, laid out his most detailed plan this time around, and given it his all to catch this small fry, putting in way more investment than the potential return would have yielded. He was absolutely sure that this plan would work but now that things were completely out of control, he suddenly could not think of a way to rectify the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What do we do?

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that this was the price of failure and he knew how cruel his master could be. Thus, he was utterly terrified as he watched the situation worsening. When he noticed that Great Saint Zhong Yuan had also been trapped within the [Red Lotus Hellfire] and was unable to escape, the thought of sneaking away suddenly crossed his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When there is life, there is hope.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu's white robes were now dyed in blood, as though he had been baptized in a bloody river. The murderous spirit and evil qi he exuded was so strong that it was just like they had taken on solid forms. The pressure these qi released was so real that it made breathing difficult. It was impossible to describe just how terrifying he seemed, but it was as though a killing god had descended onto this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For some reason, Master Zhu started to shake uncontrollably as he looked into the eyes of this young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I… I am not…" Master Zhu stammered out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene was extremely comical.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For someone as scheming as Master Zhu, his first thought was not to escape nor retaliate, but to try to provide an explanation for something. His ability to distort the truth with his eloquence had left him the moment he looked into those cold eyes filled with rage and killing intent. He could only stammer unintelligibly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Bah!"</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I had already noticed your gloating expression as you stood beside that old dog, Zhong Yuan. You looked exactly like a villainous advisor, so I'm sure that the attack on the Heaven Wasteland envoy mission couldn't have happened without your instigation and plotting, am I right?" Ye Qingyu raised his hand and lifted up Master Zhu by his neck as if he was just a chick.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Master Zhu finally came to his senses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he tried to resist, he realized that a mysterious icy force had entered his body through Ye Qingyu's palm and sealed more than half of his strength. He could no longer escape from the hand that was like an iron shackle around his neck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Whether you live or die, this will be the result of the seeds you have sown, so I'll let the [Red Lotus Hellfire] determine your fate." Ye Qingyu casually threw Master Zhu into the blazing [Red Lotus Hellfire] in the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Should he be free from guilt and sins, he would only sustain light injuries but be spared from death.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This man was clad in the robes of the Black Moon Divine Palace and was obviously in their camp, so he was clearly up to no good. Therefore, Ye Qingyu did not feel a shred of compassion for him as he threw Master Zhu into the Hellfire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Ah..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Master Zhu's terrified cries rang out exceptionally clearly through the night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he sailed through the air, he struggled awkwardly like an old mother hen, but was ultimately unable to change his destiny and he fell into the [Red Lotus Hellfire]. Pain seared through him as the tongues of fire licked his body. At that moment, time seemed to slow down. He saw the tragic, enraged, and savage faces of those who had cursed him before their deaths and of those whose deaths he had caused flash past his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before he lost consciousness, he suddenly understood that perhaps the concept of retribution truly existed in this world. All his malicious schemes seemed laughable in the face of a truly fearless warrior. How could he have been so arrogant as to think that he could control the hearts of men when even the heavens could not control the living organisms? His way of thinking had been so tragic and comical. He could not help looking admiringly at the young man in white bloodstained robes whose figure had turned increasingly blurry. Perhaps only a determined and passionate man like him would have the ability to create miracles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bam!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a loud explosion as Master Zhu's figure transformed into an explosive fireball, which then exploded in the Void. There was a dazzling flash and then he disappeared forever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most people did not realize that this unassuming, lean-faced, middle-aged man who had perished in the Hellfire was the [Phantom Commander]. No one knew what the [Phantom Commander] truly looked like for he seemed to be everywhere at once. He had caused great bloodshed throughout the various major domains and was known to be like an omnipotent evil backstage manipulator. Once he had identified someone as his target, that person was as good as dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After having made a name for himself through his illustrious achievements, even the [Phantom Commander] himself would probably never have imagined that he would be killed as easily as an ant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu did not give this matter much thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He did not know Master Zhu's true identity and was not aware of how famous he was nor how high his status had been. He had only attacked Master Zhu because he noticed Master Zhu speaking to Zhong Yuan and immediately classified the man as someone in the Black Moon Divine Palace camp. Furthermore, to Ye Qingyu, everyone from the Black Moon Divine Palace was evil and deserved death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Master Zhu perished, Ye Qingyu reappeared with a flash in the midst of the raging [Red Lotus Hellfire].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he was under the protection of the [Cloud Top Cauldron], he was still not strong enough to wield this treasure to its fullest potential. Most of the time, the [Cloud Top Cauldron] had acted on its own accord to protect its master. Furthermore, his opponents were far too powerful, which resulted in an intense feedback force. Ye Qingyu's body was covered with injuries, as though he was a porcelain doll with cracks all over. His skin was as dry as a parched riverbed and it cracked opened, causing bloody wounds, as if he was about to shatter any moment.</span></p>

As for the other experts, they had all perished in the Hellfire.</span></p>

He used the [Cloud Top Cauldron] to charge recklessly at them and as soon as any one of these experts showed signs of trying to escape the Hellfire, he would attack them maniacally. Zhong Yuan had almost managed to escape a few times, but was forced back into the fiery sea after Ye Qingyu bombarded him with attacks.</span></p>

However, their force field would be destabilized each time Ye Qingyu knocked into them, which would result in the flames licking their bodies. Based on the sins they had accumulated on their cultivation journey, once the Hellfire touched their bodies, they were as good as dead with no chance of escaping.</span></p>

He had tried to escape, but after Ye Qingyu collided into him, his protective force field was destabilized and the [Red Lotus Hellfire] consumed his body. He wailed and struggled for fifteen minutes before he died a tragic death.</span></p>

Ye Qingyu's valor and bravery had stunned them all. He had almost managed to kill off all his enemies by acting in such a manner. Unfortunately, as someone from a lowly domain, he did not have enough resources, which resulted in a vast difference in strength between him and his enemies. Even though with divine treasures such as the [Red Lotus Hellfire] and the giant cauldron, it was unlikely that he would have the last laugh.</span></p>
