 <p>Chapter 366 - Worthy of Challenging the War God?</p>
 <p>For the first time, Ye Qingyu felt threatened.</p>
 <p>Ang!</p>
 <p>The roar of dragons resounded.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu punched out, a silver ice dragon circling around his arm, the strength of the [Dragon Fist] mantra was displayed to the fullest extent. The fist image was above the sparkling and translucent jade-like palm image.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>A deep and low explosive sound.</p>
 <p>A terrifying air current began to be born from the place the palm and fist met. With Ye Qingyu and that figure at the very center, the doors of the restaurant turned into wooden scraps and flew everywhere. The guards near the entrance were also sent screaming and flying.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu’s right sleeve was disintegrated into pieces, drifting away through the air like ashes, becoming smithereens.</p>
 <p>And the person opposite, his body was propelled dozens of meters into the distance, before coming to a stop.</p>
 <p>The young experts that closely followed behind Ye Qingyu, although were unwounded by this terrifying wave nor retreated by the force, but the expressions on their faces had all changed, sensing the formidable attack just now.</p>
 <p>The originally chaotic and violent atmosphere suddenly had a moment of quiet.</p>
 <p>“Oh, your strength is not bad, no wonder you dare go against the Du Palace, but today, not one of you can leave.” The moonlight and the rays of light of the surrounding formation spirit lamps, were merged together, forming a strange colour, and was projected onto the figure on the public square outside. A red-purple long robe fluttered in the wind, as the figure was walking over slowly with hands clasped behind his back.</p>
 <p>This was the first weighty expert of the Du Household tonight.</p>
 <p>“It’s Guan Gongfeng.”</p>
 <p>[TN Note: Gongfeng is a term of respect for a respected master]</p>
 <p>“Guan Gongfeng is here, great.”</p>
 <p>The master guards that were in a hopeless position, as though they had found their backbone, finally summoned up the courage and gathered together.</p>
 <p>At the same time, standing in front of the banister of the fifth floor, young master Du had completely calmed his mind, and like a mad dog he roared, “Guan Gongfeng, kill him, peel his skin off, capture him, I want to hollow this bastard out...”</p>
 <p>Under the moonlight.</p>
 <p>Guan Gongfeng seemed to be going on a walk in the moonlight, floating about in the breeze like an immortal.</p>
 <p>“Troops retreat, to deal with such masters, the army is useless.” He smiled lightly, waving his hand, signaling the soldiers of the imperial capital patrol camp that have surrounded to retreat one after another.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu could feel that Qiu Fenghan who was on his back was moving, it seems that she had already woken up.</p>
 <p>“[War God], what do we do?” a young expert whispered.</p>
 <p>Before Ye Qingyu said a word, a shadow next to him suddenly darted out.</p>
 <p>It was the black-robed youngster [Shadow].</p>
 <p>“Do you really think you’re invincible? Come on, I’ll kill you.” The black-robed youngster’s tone was indignant and filled with killing intent. Under the moonligh, like a cloud of blue vapour, his figure was extremely fast, as though he was about to merge with the moonlight.</p>
 <p>It was clear that the prideful [Shadow] could not stand Guan Gongfeng’s arrogance, stirring his murderous intentions.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu’s heart was amused.</p>
 <p>Opposite.</p>
 <p>“You have a death wish, dare to tell me to fight with you, you...” Guan Gongfeng’s lips curved into a contemptuous and calm smile, but before his voice died away, a jet of blood suddenly spurt out from his cheek, and then a cut visible to the naked eye appeared.</p>
 <p>“How could it be?”</p>
 <p>Guan Gongfeng’s face took on a sudden change in appearance, a jade-coloured light around him was surging, activating yuan energy. He no longer dared to delay anymore.</p>
 <p>By just meeting face-to-face, he immediately understood that he had met with a real top-level expert.</p>
 <p>Suddenly——</p>
 <p>A dark light appeared suddenly.</p>
 <p>Like a poisonous snake spitting venom.</p>
 <p>This was the light produced by a black soft sword.</p>
 <p>Soundless and motionless.</p>
 <p>“So fast!”</p>
 <p>Guan Gongfeng was shocked, trying to avoid at the first instant.</p>
 <p>But the dark light instantly turned into the stars that filled up the sky, like sparks were flying in all directions, numerous and unending, as though an inescapable net was smashing down. As Guan Gongfeng strangely yelled, a jade sword appeared in his hands, launching various sword attacks and constantly sealing that dark sword light, but for some reason there was not the slightest sound of sword striking against another in the air.</p>
 <p>Guan Gongfeng was in a cold sweat.</p>
 <p>The opponent’s sword, was too fast.</p>
 <p>And the sword was lifeless, like a dim light that he was unable to capture.</p>
 <p>In the blink of the eye, shadows of people crisscrossed, and the dark light disappeared.</p>
 <p>Guan Gongfeng stood upright, clasping his sword tight, motionless.</p>
 <p>Five meters behind him, the black-robed youngster [Shadow’s] long hair was flying upward, his chest violently moving up and down, his forehead dripping with sweat, his breathing slightly unstable, but his body was as straight and sharp as a sword, standing in the same place as before.</p>
 <p>The scene was motionless.</p>
 <p>When all the people felt the difference, suddenly——</p>
 <p>Chi Chi Chi!</p>
 <p>A sound, like a sack of water leaking came from Guan Gongfeng’s body. Looking at his long body, neck, chest, back, waist, stomach, thigh, and arms, suddenly blood arrows were unleashed, spraying out like fog. Majestic yuan qi was madly released from his body. 一</p>
 <p>“Ho-ho ho ho... You... Who are... You... What kind of sword skill is this?”</p>
 <p>Guan Gongfeng’s face was lifeless and twisted with shocked, twisting his stiff body around and looking at the back view of the young black-robed youngster, he finally asked such a question, but before he received an answer, his long body was collapsed with a loud rumble, as he took his last breath.</p>
 <p>There was a complete stunned silence.</p>
 <p>Dead silence.</p>
 <p>“With that kind of strength, you still want to challenge the [War God]? He really does not know his own strength,” [Shadow] turned around, saying indifferently.</p>
 <p>He did not feel the slightest thrill of defeating a strong expert of the bitter sea stage.</p>
 <p>In the black-robed youngster’s mind, winning against a master like Guan Gongfeng who had been raised by influential officials for countless years and had worn away his spirit, was not a feat he should be proud of. Before he made a breakthrough in his [Shadow Secret Technique] and before he came to the Imperial Capital, he had already been on the battlefield, single-handedly killing the experts of the Barbarian Race.</p>
 <p>It was just that back then, his speed was not this fast.</p>
 <p>This time, he was fully committed and went all out to kill Guan Gongfeng in order to let Ye Qingyu see.</p>
 <p>In his heart, only Ye Qingyu who has the name [War God], was a real expert that made him feel pressured.</p>
 <p>A trash like Guan Gongfeng, to even dare to dream of defeating [War God], he really overestimated his own capabilities.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu, along with the youngsters, directly darted to the small square outside the restaurant.</p>
 <p>But the controller soldiers of the formation airship were all gone. The roads in the Imperial Capital were complicated and many, viaducts were like overhead walkways. Without a soldier that knows the way to guide them, in such a short time, there was no way that they could find the direction of the military building in this bustling Imperial Capital that was like a galaxy of the human world.</p>
 <p>In the distance.</p>
 <p>A strong overbearing aura was rapidly approaching.</p>
 <p>The top-ranked experts of the Du palace were continuously coming.</p>
 <p>The other experts of the military must have been alarmed.</p>
 <p>And outside of the small square, an endless number of purple-armoured soldiers was rushing forth like the tide, surrounding the young experts from all sides. There were formation airships piercing the night sky, flying over at a low altitude. The night sky was flashing with beams of formation, and strange formation arrays were closing in on them.</p>
 <p>“Leaving? You’re not going anywhere.”</p>
 <p>In the void, a voice suddenly sounded.</p>
 <p>Brilliance flashes.</p>
 <p>Dozens of strong voices sounded, as though they were tearing apart the void.</p>
 <p>Instantly, the starlight that filled the sky and the beams of rune formation in the surrounding buildings all vanished. The night sky was pitch black, as though a huge black cloth suddenly covered the sky. The voices and auras all instantly disappeared, and between the sky and the earth, only the restaurant, public square, soldiers, and the experts that surrounded remained.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was slightly apprehensive.</p>
 <p>The opponent’s formation was finally thoroughly completed, isolating the sunlight and shade of the outside.</p>
 <p>Flowing light was flickering.</p>
 <p>Young master Du, under the escort of two other strong experts that were not weaker than Guan Gongfeng, also arrived at the void.</p>
 <p>Dozens of formation airships were floating in the void.</p>
 <p>There was a purplish red colour appearing from the first airship, which was larger than the other airships, and at the bow of the ship stood a person, approximately twenty years old, with a feather fan and a silk cloth, and dressed in a purple jade robe. His black hair was like waterfall, his eyes were flickering with a strange violet light, and as he looked down from above, there was a noble majestic aura.</p>
 <p>“Brother, brother you came. Help me kill this group of pigs.”</p>
 <p>Young master Du sprinted over to the purple-eyed young master, his eyes filled with resentment and anger, and shouting loudly.</p>
 <p>[Purple Eye] Du Heng, Du Palace’s eldest son, commander of the City’s north patrol camp, is a young talent that is known throughout the Imperial Capital. Whether it is strategic ability, wisdom, talent, strength, appearance, or knowledge, he is a first-class talent. At such a young age he could wield the military power of a district patrol camp, his status in Snow Capital was evident.</p>
 <p>[Purple Eye] Du Heng was ranked 99th on the [Heavenly Officer List].</p>
 <p>In Snow Capital, this was an important person that should not be provoked.</p>
 <p>The experts that were standing around [Purple Eye] Du Heng were all his subordinates, with the weakest person being in the first level of the Bitter Sea stage. In the city’s north district patrol camp, they were known as [The Top Ten Gods of Slaughter].</p>
 <p>“I asked you to do something so small, but you can’t even do it well.” [Purple Eye] Du Heng cast a glance at his younger brother, then with the wave of his hand signaled the people to escort him away</p>
 <p>“No, big brother, I will watch you kill them all, I am really angry this time, really, that pig dared to try to kill me.” Young master Du pointed to Ye Qingyu below, a ruthless look on his face, “Big brother, help me catch him, I want to empty his pig head. As long as you promise me, big brother, I will listen to you.”</p>
 <p>He hated Ye Qingyu to the bone.</p>
 <p>[Purple Eye] smiled, “If you want to stay, then stay. Where’s the woman?”</p>
 <p>“On him.” Young master Du pointed at Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>[Purple Eye] Du Heng nodded, his eyes falling on Ye Qingyu, surveying him carefully, when he suddenly looked surprised, as though he realized something. And then he looked at the several youngsters behind Ye Qingyu, and realized that not one of these youngsters was weak. In his mind, dozens of messages flashed across, remembering a rumour in the Imperial Capital one month ago.</p>
 <p>If he had not guessed wrong, this was the rumoured group of people.</p>
 <p>That’s interesting.</p>
 <p>He had originally thought to take care of this group of people slowly in the future. To think he would meet with them tonight, this was a chance. If that woman fell into their hands, this was not a good matter. Their original plan had to be changed slightly. No matter what, they must take the woman into their hands, otherwise the business in the [Whip of the Thunder Deity] had to be frozen. But right now, meeting with this group…</p>
 <p>Countless thoughts were flashing across [Purple Eye’s] mind.</p>
