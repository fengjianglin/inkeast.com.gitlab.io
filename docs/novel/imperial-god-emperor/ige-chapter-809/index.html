 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Falcon City was now as lively as a pot of boiling water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fact that both sides had continuously released statements pushed the entire situation to a climax that no one had thought was possible, and everyone looked forward to how things would develop. Both Ye Qingyu and the Black Moon Divine Palace had adopted a tough stance and also received the support of many forces. Many people now realized this was no longer just a matter of a small fry from a lower domain taking on an ancient sect, but had now turned into a proxy fight amongst the top-level sects, which had remained quiet for far too long in the nineteen cities on the road of chaos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, hundreds of thousands of experts from across the land had gathered at the Black Moon Divine Palace's representative station. They were either observing in plain sight or were hidden away, but they were all closely observing the development of this situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That young man in white suddenly walked out from the Void, and as he drew closer to the Black Moon Divine Palace's representative station, many people realized that the end was near.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Ye Qingyu snatched the heads of the three experts from the Heaven Wasteland Domain, a terrifyingly powerful aura immediately appeared as Great Saint Zhong Yuan walked toward him like an enraged lion. Everyone could sense his rage and killing intent. His terrifying aura was like a boundless sea, which threatened to grind Ye Qingyu into a fine powder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Son of a bitch, you finally dared to reveal yourself."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhong Yuan's eyes narrowed as he spoke, his voice was piercingly sharp like a knife.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu did not even look at Zhong Yuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He gently breathed out a mouthful of air and frosty ice crystals immediately froze the heads of Qu Hanshan and the rest. A layer of ice that was as transparent as the finest jade covered these three heads and contained them safely within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"My friends," Ye Qingyu said softly, "Rest assured, I will bring you back to the Heaven Wasteland Domain and return your souls to your homeland. I will make sure that the dreams we had fought for will come true. I will accomplish your unfulfilled dreams and destroy whoever stands in our way, no matter who they might be."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the opposite side—</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind the Great Saint Zhong Yuan stood the five Great Saints of the Black Moon Divine Palace, Zheng Hong, and the others, and they were standing in an indistinct crescent moon shape around Ye Qingyu. Their eyes shone with excitement because they had finally seen the troublemaker who had brought about so much unrest to the Black Moon Divine Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You speak so confidently," the head of Falcon City's representative station, Zheng Hong, said. "You said that you would destroy whoever stood in your way; who do you think you are? You are just a lowly troublemaking citizen from the lower domain. How dare you speak so arrogantly!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Haha." Ye Qingyu carefully put the three heads away, and when he looked up, his anger and sorrow slowly faded away and was replaced by an intense killing intent and rage that consumed him. "You are just a lowly person in charge of a representative station, an ordinary Saint, so what do you know? How dare you speak to me here! You're just a pathetic worm, get out of my sight," he retorted sarcastically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You..." Zheng Hong sputtered exasperatedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His status was indeed far lower than that of Zhong Yuan and the five Great Saints. He was not even as powerful as the experts who had gathered to watch the developments, let alone those from the super forces who had released statements in support of both sides. All he wanted to do was put his importance on display on such a significant occasion, but instead, he had now been greatly insulted by Ye Qingyu. How could he remain calm?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng Hong was about to say something, but Great Saint Zhong Yuan gestured to him to remain silent, so Zheng Hong could only reluctantly swallow his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Son of a bitch, aren't you a smartass? No matter how eloquently you speak today, you will still die." Great Saint Zhong Yuan's aura was extremely strong as he prepared to kill Ye Qingyu. He could not wait to kill this malicious character who had brought so much shame to the Black Moon Divine Palace, but he held himself back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that many forces were keeping tabs on this situation and Ye Qingyu had the support of several super forces, so if he killed Ye Qingyu immediately without giving him the chance to speak, it would seem as though the Black Moon Divine Palace had rushed to silence Ye Qingyu. This would not bode well for their image if they were to kill him without letting him speak at all after demanding for him to appear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mister Zhu, who had been gently waving his fan, also nodded slightly and let out a sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had been afraid that Great Saint Zhong Yuan would pay no heed to his instructions and kill Ye Qingyu in a fit of anger. This would disrupt the rest of his plan and all his efforts would be wasted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had already laid out his plan perfectly. As long as Ye Qingyu tried to make his accusations, he was confident that he would be able to completely tarnish the image of this peasant from a lowly domain and ensure that his image would never be able to recover. This would be a beautiful reversal for the Black Moon Divine Palace, and it could immediately change everything in their favor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mister Zhu smiled a little too arrogantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had great confidence in his intellect and his plans. Furthermore, his master had entrusted him with immense authority and given him an unimaginably large amount of resources to carry out this mission. This was only the first part of his plan, and Mister Zhu was sure that he had laid out the perfect plan. As someone who took immense pleasure in tricking people, Ye Qingyu's actions and reactions had all gone according to his plan. Thus, he was sure that there would be no exception this time around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Speak? To hell with you." Ye Qingyu looked at those of the Black Moon Divine Palace scornfully and cursed. He had never experienced such intense hatred before and this was the first time he had the urge to kill everything in sight. "You bastards, you are part of the Human Race; the blood of the descendants of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors and of the heroic Human Race flows through your veins. You enjoy the freedom and the status of the Human Race that your ancestors fought for, but is there anything left in your brains? Is it filled with dog shit? Shouldn't you rejoice at the appearance of a domain led by the Human Race? Wasn't it a sign of how the Human Race was getting stronger? Why must you make things difficult for the Humans of Heaven Wasteland Domain time and time again? Why do you bully people of your own race, your comrades with the same blood? Did you do it for the shameless gains in that dog-shit brain of yours? Or was it for the filthy power that you craved? Or was it for the treasures and gains I have obtained from the 18th district? You are just a pack of short-sighted jackals. The Human Race is on the decline but instead of fighting for its relevance, you have attacked your own kind. You are worst than beasts... I have nothing else to add but I will tell you that I will not die today. Instead, I will make sure that the Black Moon Divine Palace is erased from the Vast Thousand Domains and will rot in the depths of hell. There is no longer any need for your existence."</span></p>

Words had lost their power and purpose, he would only be able to achieve justice with violence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Kill!"</span></p>

The [Dragon Blood Halberd] and the [Blood Drinker Sword] appeared in hands, then he turned into a bolt of lightning and charged at the group of Black Moon Divine Palace men, with Great Saint Zhong Yuan as his first target.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mister Zhu's face changed.</span></p>

By choosing to attack directly, he was courting death. Were his calculations wrong or did Ye Qingyu have another hidden card up his sleeve?</span></p>

Each beam contained the power and mystery of the Great Saint, and it seemed to contain enough power to crush the surrounding space. A power that resembled the laws and mystery of the universe swept through the surrounding area, as though a fiendgod had descended from the heavens. Zhong Yuan was intensely attached to the Black Moon Divine Palace because he had been part of the palace all his life, so he would not stand for such a grave insult to the Black Moon Divine Palace.</span></p>

They had not expected Ye Qingyu to be such a hothead and to act so rashly, which meant that this matter that had rocked the Vast Thousand Domains was about to come to an anticlimactic ending. After all, Zhong Yuan was a Great Saint.</span></p>

Yellow silk ribbons dangled from the cauldron and shielded Ye Qingyu within it. This huge cauldron was what caused his magical formation to shatter.</span></p>

He was still not powerful enough to wield this cauldron to its fullest potential. Most of the time, the cauldron relied on its own devices to protect him. But despite blocking the blow, he had sustained serious injuries and blood flowed from the corners of his mouth.</span></p>

His figure alternated between real and imaginary, as though it was about to disappear from this world. After all, it was a beautiful magical ability from the [Fiendgod Titled Chart] of the bronze book, so he managed to evade Great Saint Zhong Yuan and appear in the midst of the disciples of the Black Moon Divine Palace.</span></p>

Loud cries rang out as dozens of Black Moon Divine Palace's experts were slashed into minced meat, including Zheng Hong, who was a half-Saint.</span></p>

He had survived despite everyone around him dying. When he saw Ye Qingyu rushing into the representative station, he was unable to wrap his head around it. There were all kinds of formations and traps laid out within the representative station, including many experts lying in wait within. This was something that even an idiot could figure out, so why did Ye Qingyu rush headlong into the trap as though he did not fear death?</span></p>
