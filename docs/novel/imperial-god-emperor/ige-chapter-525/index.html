 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Rest assured, rest assured. In the past when, I ruled over the Quicksand Sea, my words were like gold in the Quicksand Sea, and I would never renege on a promise. How would I make a light promise," the vulgar voice said seriously as if he was swearing an oath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu lowered his head in thought, then said: "Then how can I save you?"</span></p>

You only need to release me from the wooden bucket, then that will be fine." The vulgar voice seemed like it was overjoyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "That simple?"</span></p>

Not to lie to you, but this wooden bucket is not a simple item. In the legends, it is the Dragon Wood able to suppress every creature of the water. Even just a wooden board from it, if you threw it into water, can suppress millions of life forms. When I fell in the past, I fell into a trap, and was imprisoned in this Dragon Wood bucket. I've already been trapped here for a million years. If not for your appearance, in another couple of hundred years, all my aura would have been lost and I most likely would have perished," the vulgar voice said, incomparably sentimental.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Hearing this, Ye Qingyu could not help but be greatly curious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Who would have thought that such a rotting bucket would have such a history?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; He came to before the broken buckets of water. After careful inspection, his hand knocked on the wooden bucket, and there was instantly a metallic clanking noise sounding out. It was smooth and melodious like an ancient bell, containing a strange type of power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Eh eh eh? Friend, don't knock on it, quickly stop." The Inspiration King began screeching. "The Dao sounds of this Dragon Wood is the voice of death for us Water lifeforms. If you continue to knock, I'll be killed by you, quickly stop."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Oh?" Ye Qingyu stopped, then looked at the other three buckets. He asked, "Since the material of these buckets are &nbsp;so amazing, then the water in these buckets must also be some kind of incredible divine item?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "The Dragon wood is the divine wood of the world. Even dirty water from the sewers would have long become bejeweled nectar after a hundred thousand years in the bucket. Furthermore, you are not wrong. it is not normal water in the buckets, it is Lightning Serum. One drop is enough to destroy the heavens and annihilate the earth," the Inspiration King said, sighing in appreciation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "And you are immersed in this Lightning Serum, unharmed?" Ye Qingyu asked again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "I am originally an ancient breed. I was naturally born with abilities in both water and lightning. And this Lightning Serum was originally a treasure that the Lightning Emperor obtained from the Chaotic Domain in order to save me. He told me to rest and recover in the nourishment of the Lightning Serum, so of course I'm fine." The tone of the Inspiration King became somewhat proud at this point.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "The Lightning Emperor saved you? For what?" Ye Qingyu was like a curious little child, his questions never ending.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Because we have good relations with each other." The reply of the Inspiration King could be said to be flawless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu did not give up, and continued, "Then why is your relation so good with each other?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Inspiration King: "..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Before the Lightning Emperor had achieved the pinnacle of his path, he and I called each other brothers." The Inspiration King was facing the only person who could save him, so he could only weaken his explosive temper. He patiently explained, "When he became the Lightning Emperor, there was a life threatening enemy that came to destroy things. Me and some other brothers protected him. We battled in the heavens, our blood staining the air. In that battle, I was ambushed with Dragon Wood, and received a fatal injury.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu, "It's becoming more and more unbelievable."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Friend, in this world, there are many things that are completely impossible. Like the Inheritance of the Lightning Emperor. It is only a step away from you, you must utilize this opportunity well," the Inspiration King said in a patient and guiding tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Although your story is fantastic, but how do I know you are not lying to me?" Ye Qingyu was very cautious from start to finish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Everything he encountered today was really too incredible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; If the Inheritance of the Lightning Emperor was so easily obtained by others, then why was it that in these hundred thousands of years, it did not reappear in the world?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Although this place was filled with many dangers, and there was a killing intent hidden in ambush, but he had successfully reached here. His strength could not be counted as significant in Clear River Domain. For a Greater One Sect disciple like Xiao Yunlong to kill him was like killing a dog. An expert at the peak of the Heaven Ascension stage or perhaps the Immortal stage would definitely be able to come here easily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Although he was extremely tempted, but Ye Qingyu had to remind himself over and over again that he could not be ruled by excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "You... sigh, friend. Thinking of the past, I once ruled the millions of water lifeforms in the endless oceans. Even the ancient dragons had fear and respect for me. Thinking back to the past, I commanded ten battle divisions, nine great armies, eight war gods, seven immortal concubines... I was regarded as brothers with the Lightning Emperor, how would I deceive you?" the Inspiration King said in a panic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Stop, say something real. I have no way of proving or disproving anything about matters hundreds of thousands of years ago." Ye Qingyu completely did not believe this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Then... friend, how do you want to prove it?" The Inspiration King was very patient from the start.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Did you not say that you control the legacy of the Lightning Emperor?" Ye Qingyu stood above the bucket, his head lowered as he looked at the Koi who could not even move amidst the Lightning Serum. With a smile, "Then give me one or two Emperor tools of the Lightning Emperor for me to play with, how about that?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; One could see the Koi at the bottom of the bucket rolling its eyes, twitching, "Emperor weapon? Do you think it is a cabbage that grows on the roadside, to give you one or two for you to play with... After the Lightning Emperor achieved the pinnacle, he had only managed to cultivate a lightning hammer."</span></p>

Lightning Hammer, just where is it?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; This was an Emperor weapon.</span></p>

With the control of the Emperor weapon in ones hands, one could be regarded as invincible, able to kill all enemies under the cultivation of Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "It's an Emperor weapon, so it's naturally in the hands of the Lightning Emperor. Why would I have it?" The Inspiration King twitched once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu was furious. "Did you knot say that you have the legacy of the Lightning Emperor? So you were lying to me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Friend, calm, peace." Inspiration King felt that he might have encountered an idiot. It was like a scholar encountering a soldier, trying to reason with him but failing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; But his last shred of hope was placed on the shoulders of this idiot. He could not offend Ye Qingyu. So he used an unprecedented patience to explain to him, "His legacy and his Emperor weapon are two different matters. When the Lightning Emperor achieved the pinnacle, he had to save the people of his race from the danger of extinction. Facing such great enemies, even the he who had became an Emperor did not have a sure chance of winning. He naturally had to bring his Emperor weapon by him into battle. But before he left, he gave the foundation of his path, the [Ultimate Lightning Enlightenment], to me. Who would have guessed that was farewell forever. My injuries were not able to be healed, so I had no way of leaving and that's why I did not meet him." &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu was not able to obtain an item like an Emperor weapon from this fish, and was somewhat disappointed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; But the Lightning Enlightenment manual was after all the foundation of the martial path of the Lightning Emperor. That is, it was the Dao manual of the rumoured lightning path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Dao manual of a Great Emperor, it's preciousness was not in any way less than that of an Emperor weapon. It was perhaps even more valuable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; After all, even if an Emperor tool was in his hands, he needed vast yuan qi in order to be able to use it. With Ye Qingyu's current yuan qi cultivation, it was absolutely impossible for him to do this. But if it was the Dao manual of a Great Emperor, if he trained in it, perhaps it needed an extremely long training time, but it would absolutely cause him to receive endless benefits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu opened his mouth in a smile, "If it is like so, then to prove your own words, then you pass on that [Ultimate Lightning Enlightenment] to me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Inspiration King hesitated for a brief moment, then ultimately said, "When the Lightning Emperor Qin Ming departed, he once said to me, that this Dao manual must be given to the future generation of the Human Race, to those that are fated. I've been trapped here for hundreds of thousands of years, and you are the third human to have come here. We must be fated, and I saw that you did not take into your own possession the treasures that are lying in this room at the first moment. So you must not be anyone evil. Giving the [Ultimate Lightning Enlightenment] to you must be Heaven's will..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; As he spoke to here, the Inspiration King stopped for a brief moment, then said again, "You listen well, right now I will pass on to you the entry level piece of this Great Emperor Dao manual. It will depend on fate just how much you grasp. The entry level piece is a breathing technique..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Inspiration King began speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; After hearing three or four sentences, Ye Qingyu's complexion instantly became strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; After he heard the tenth phrase, this strangeness became even more evident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Seeing that the Inspiration King continued on, Ye Qingyu suddenly broke him off with anger, "Shut your mouth. You conman, you dare use such a lowly method to fool me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Inspiration King did not understand what Ye Qingyu meant: "Just how did I fool you?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "You say this is the Dao Manual of a Great Emperor? You go fool a little child. I've long heard of this breathing technique." Ye Qingyu had a face filled with disdain. "The breathing technique that I trained in from the start is this one. How could it be the beginning piece of the Great Emperor Dao manual."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Although there was some minute differences, but the core of it was the same as the nameless breathing technique his father had taught him since he was little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu once again felt rage from being lied to once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Hearing this, the Inspiration King could not help but begin screeching in disbelief, "How is this possible? You trained in this Dao manual since you were small? You are the conman, you dare lie to me. You... eh? Wait a moment, young man, you said you trained in this Dao manual since you were small? Then who taught it to you?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu opened his mouth. "My father.”</span></p>

"Who is he? What is he like?"</span></p>
