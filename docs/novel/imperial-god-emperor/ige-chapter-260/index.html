 <p>260 - The degradation of the Song family</p>
 <p>“What kind of joke is Master Wen playing at?"</p>
 <p>Sang Fusheng's figure was as straight as a blade.</p>
 <p>"Who is joking with you. I've already spoken to the commander, I'm currently assigned to the White Horse tower. Right now, I can be regarded as the subordinate of the Patrolling sword envoy, Marquis Ye. Hahaha, otherwise why do you think I have such leisurely time to sit here and eat noodles?" Wen Wan wiped his beard, saying excitedly: "Damn, it's really been too boring recently. Military rule this, military rule that, military order this, military order that. I can't even drink much for fear of breaking the military rules. I'm about to cut my own head off, this isn't days a normal human can endure.“</p>
 <p>With a gulp, he finished the mixed lamb broth and lazily stretched his waist.</p>
 <p>With a loud shout, he called for another bowl. His eyes were closed in contentment as he said, "You must know that ever since my military role was assigned to White Horse tower, I've already woken up in the afternoon for consecutive days. Every day and I can walk around in the streets, doing whatever I want. This is what you call freedom, wahahaha!"</p>
 <p>Sang Fusheng was completely speechless.</p>
 <p>"Hey, how about this, do you have any interest in joining White Horse tower. Haha, I'll give a word to Marquis Ye, to transfer you over." Wen Wen winked at him.</p>
 <p>"Marquis Ye is not someone who will take such a lenient attitude towards his subordinate. Sang Fusheng said with a serious expression.”</p>
 <p>Wen Wan grinned.</p>
 <p>"Perhaps he's not, but he doesn't have time to manage me. Wahahaha, I've already been transferred to the White Horse tower for six days, and I haven't even seen him in this entire six days. It's said he's in closed isolation training. Just how great is a superior in closed isolation training, you don't have to worry about him suddenly appearing in front of you.......every day you can just bask in the sun eating noodles, life is just so beautiful."</p>
 <p>Sang Fusheng's face darkened.</p>
 <p>He did not know what to say.</p>
 <p>Wen Wan's military position was higher than him, and he was firm friends with Liu Zongyuan and Ye Qingyu. Sang Fusheng naturally had no power to restrict him.</p>
 <p>Furthermore according to what he know of Wen Wan, this did not seem like him. This person was known as the Mad Tiger within the Vanguard. he was definitely not an idle and lazy person. For even commander Liu to agree to reallocate him to the White Horse tower, there must be some special consideration behind this. It was not something he could guess that.</p>
 <p>Sang Fusheng spoke some parting words, then turned and left.</p>
 <p>"Sigh, you're like wood, you can't be teased at all." Wen Wan resentfully glared at Sang Fusheng's back. A bowl of steaming hot lamb scraps were already placed around him, with double the amount of lamb meat.</p>
 <p>"Master Wen, enjoy." The owner of the noodle stand that was afraid of Wen Wan initially had already gotten adjusted him. He currently had a delighted smile.</p>
 <p>He now knew Wen Wan was not of the demon race, and not a mlitary officer of the Vanguard so he let down his guard. His service became much more motivated.</p>
 <p>Wen Wan nodded, continuing to eat.</p>
 <p>In a while, Bai Yuanxing came over, roughly panting. He brought over an ink stone, brush and paper.</p>
 <p>"En, sit here. Have you eaten yet?" Wen Wan pointed at the seat next to him.</p>
 <p>Bai Yuanxing shook his head: "I've eaten."</p>
 <p>Wen Wan finished his last bowl of noodles, then wiped his mouth. "I speak, you write, help me record everything I say down."</p>
 <p>Bai Yuanxing did not know what he was going to do, but he sat down. In this simple noodle stand, he spread open the scroll and prepared his writing implements. He wrote down all that Wen Wan said.</p>
 <p>What Wen Wan wanted him to record down, was the names, history and background of all the merchant companies that entered Proud sky centre. And also all the members of sects that entered into the Proud sky centre. It was unknown just how Wen Wan knew such information - he even knew the names of those young sect members. However, Bai Yuanxing still dutifully recorded everything down.</p>
 <p>"Hehe, Ye Qingyu is in closed isolation training, but I have just been lazing about. I've completely investigated into the background of everyone, it should prove useful. When Little Ye comes out of trainig, I at least have something to show him. Hahahaa...." Wen Wan laughed proudly.“</p>
 <p>Bai Yuanxing gave him a glance.</p>
 <p>。Why did he have a feeling Wen Wan was working half heartedly and skimping out on doing proper work?</p>
 <p>Very quickly half an hour passed as one spoke and one recorded.</p>
 <p>From far away.</p>
 <p>The entrance to the Proud sky centre.</p>
 <p>There were tens of guards that were dressed up like people from Jianghu, that had finally noticed the two who was writing and recroding everything from a noodle stand far away. Especially that bearded muscular man, he had already been sitting there sneakily for several days. It seemed they did not possess benign intentions.</p>
 <p>There were several people that came over to the noodle stand.</p>
 <p>"You two, what do you want?" The leading Crepe Myrtle sect disciple pointed at Wen Wan, his expression severe.</p>
 <p>This Crepe Myrtle sect disciples strength was decent, and was the leader of the guards guarding outside the Proud sky centre.</p>
 <p>This martial meeting, was originally incited by the Crepe Myrtle sect. It had siginificant meaning so the Crepe Myrtle dare not take any risks. Ten days ago, they had already began their arrangements in the Proud sky centre, ensuring sufficient secrecy around the whole event. At the beginning there were people who climbed the wall to have a look, but this was eventually forbidden. This Crepe Myrtle sect disciple had gotten used to commanding people, and had an air of arrogance and bossiness about him.</p>
 <p>"What does it have to do with you." Wen Wan impatiently gave these people a glare. "Scram off, stop blocking your father, I, from surveilling people."</p>
 <p>"You've.......really eaten the guts of a lofty leopard." This Crepe Myrtle was enraged. "Do you know who I am? For you two to sneakily record everything down? To dare place surveillance on our meeting between the Three Sects and Three schools, you two....."</p>
 <p>"Zhong Daijun of the Crepe sect isn't it?" Wen Wan said righteously. "A tiny little third generation disciple dares to abuse his power, who do you think will be afraid of you? I'm not afraid to tell you, that I'm indeed here to observe all your secrets. Do you have something to hide? None of the people of the Jiangu are good people, they naturally have to be kept under watch. I naturally have to record the name of everyone here.......I am the Wen Wan of White Horse tower, the number one fighter of White Horse tower. It's Ye Qingyu who sent me. Haha, are you afraid now? If you're afraid then scram off!"</p>
 <p>"You......I......." Zhong Daijun was so angry he was about to spit out blood.</p>
 <p>The other sect disciples’ expressions had also changed.</p>
 <p>Without waiting for Zhong Daijun to finish his words, they quickly dragged him away.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's infamous name, had already become well known amongst the sects. When normal sect disciples heard of his name, their knees would go weak with fright. How could they dare retaliate to such words. Zhong Daijun had a face like he still wanted to persist and argue, but he still cooperated with his comrades and left immediately.</p>
 <p>The next days, Wen WAn openly and brazenly surveilled all the people who entered and left the Proud sky centre, recording their names down.</p>
 <p>No one dared touch him.</p>
 <p>This originally dead little noodle stand, because of the existence of the Mad Tiger Wen Wan camping here, would sell over a hundred bowls of noodles. The owner of the stand's grin was so wide he could not close his lips.</p>
 <p>In these days, Ye Qingyu had not even appeared once.</p>
 <p>The city became much more peaceful.</p>
 <p>There would be large numbers of merchant companies that entered everyday. Apart from the major mercantile organisations that entered into the Proud sky centre, there would also be small merchant companies that did not receive the right to enter into the Proud sky centre but still came to chance it.</p>
 <p>The true martial meeting had not yet begun.On the two main streets outside the Proud sky centre, there were more and more stands. All sorts of merchant companies had erected their stands and tents, causing the surroundings to be like a chaotic marketplace. There were many people coming and going, but all sorts of strange goods and items were sold here so it was hard to discern what was good and what was bad. Everything relied on your insight and luck.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>"Father, can we really truly enter into the Proud sky centre?"</p>
 <p>At an inn.</p>
 <p>Song Qingluo had a face of worry as she enquired.</p>
 <p>At the window, there was a middle aged man with ash grey hair that had his face covered with fatigue. He did not say a word for a long time, then ultimately bitterly smiled. "It'll depend on our luck. If master song is really as capable as he says, perhaps we will have an opportunity. This time the martial meeting at Proud sky centre, is the last hope that exist for our Qingluo merchant company.</p>
 <p>As Song Qingluo looked at her father's exhausted appeared, her heart was like it was sliced apart by blades.</p>
 <p>Qingluo merchant comapny has had it's glory days when it was the largest merchant company within Deer city. But it was a pity that everything compeltey changed since half a year ago. All because of the bloodline of darkness within Song Xiaojun had suddenly awaked. Their family became the target of isolation and exclusion. Although ultimately everything was investigated and nothing was tied to the Qingluo merchant company. Their entire family was normal and did not also possess the bloodline of darkness. But the business of the Qingluo merchant company was massively impacted.</p>
 <p>Those who once had contracts with them all broke their contracts and left them.</p>
 <p>Their competitors started and spread rumours, painting a demonic picture of the Qingluo merchant company. All the civilians of the city redirected the hatred they had towards the demon race to the Qingluo company. Their business plummeted, and their originally bustling shop front, were completely deserted. They couldn't even do a single business in one day.</p>
 <p>At the beginning, the City Lord did pay special attention to the Qingluo merchant company and did not treat them too harshly.</p>
 <p>After all, after the many years of that the Song family had spent building up this relationship, they were firm friends with the City lord so this aided with the situation.</p>
 <p>But afterwards, they heard that Song Xiaojun had once again reappeared at Youyan pass to kill the War God of Youyan army, Lu Zhaoge. This information shook the world. Even if it was the city lord and the four main generals of Deer city, they did not dare to have any sort of relationship with the Qingluo merchant company. One after another, they sought to distance themselves away....</p>
 <p>The Song family had been completely abandoned.</p>
 <p>Even though Song Qingluo's father attempted to use all sorts of means and invested a huge amount of gold, it was hard to reverse such a situation.</p>
 <p>The Song family had completely fallen.</p>
 <p>Their servants were dismissed.</p>
 <p>Their store sold.</p>
 <p>Their business bankrupt.</p>
 <p>As the young lady of the Qingluo merchant company, Song Qingluo was completely isolated within White Deer academy because of these rumours. She remained silent as she suffered such a situation. In the end, the Song family did not have the financial ability to sustain her continued education and training, and Song Qingluo could not help but withdraw from White Deer academy. With grief and sorrow, she abandoned her own martial path, and began following her father, travelling all around for the matters of the family.</p>
 <p>The rapid deterioration of her lifestyle, made it seem as if Song Qingluo’s originally splendid life, had been infected by nightmares.</p>
 <p>She knew, that her fate had completely changed.</p>
 <p>She was no longer the proud and haughty girl of the past. She was no longer the favoured child of fate. She could not help but wear rough clothing and plain hairpins, and could not help but eat the simplest of foods. She had to conserve every last ounce of silver, to support her fallen family.</p>
 <p>The cruelty of fate collided against her directly.</p>
 <p>Song Qingluo suddenly felt she had plummeted into an endless darkness, not even able to see the slightest hint of light.</p>
 <p>Everything, was because of Song Xiaojun.</p>
 <p>Did she hate her?</p>
 <p>Perhaps she should. But without knowing why, Song Qingluo could not muster up such hatred.</p>
 <p>Becaue she knew, her cousin that came from a concubine, was also a pitiful person.</p>
 <p>This time, her father had brought Song Qingluo, brought the last hope of the Song family to Youyan Pass. With the guidance of a son from a friend, they wanted to obtain the chance to enter into the Proud sky centre. If they were able to enter into the Proud sky centre, and be able to meet with some important characters, perhaps Qingluo merchant company would be able to obtain a chance to revive themselves.</p>
 <p>But the right to enter Proud sky centre, just how could it be so easily obtained?</p>
