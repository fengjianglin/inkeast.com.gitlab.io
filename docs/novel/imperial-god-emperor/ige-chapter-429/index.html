For the barrier in the North East to lose two of the three passes, that represented the [Ancient Berserk Army] of the White Mountain Black Water Brute Race could bypass the Mountain Sea Pass any time they wished and invade directly.

The ice dissolved in the summer, causing the water level to surge. This was namely the season why flooding was the most serious. Once a hole was broken through in the [Treading Wave Army] camps on the water, this represented that the Demon Race in the water could depart from the Mist Sea. going against the current. They could go up the river and cause the great provinces in the South to become the playground of the Demon Race, and a place where human bones were buried.</span></p>

They began launching a berserk offense towards the West Boulder Army on the Western borders of the Empire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Thankfully, the West Boulder Army had made preparations beforehand.

Because they had heavily injured the Snow Ground Demon Court during the Spring time offense, it made the Snow Ground Demon Race struggle to retaliate during the summer. Comparatively, Youyan Pass was much more peaceful.&nbsp;</span></p>

This sudden offensive heavily injured the main armies of the Empire. This was absolutely not coincidental.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Evidently, the situation of the Empire had taken a nosedive. This was especially so for the [Whip of the Thunder Deity] army in the North East. It had suffered heavy losses, and the three great provinces in the North East was in a state of near total capitulation. Once the White Mountain Black Water Brute Race had gathered their forces and reformed, and they invaded, it was likely that in less than a month of time before they could directly strike at Snow Capital. The Mountain Sea Pass had became a city all alone, it would fall sooner or later...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "The [Whip of the Thunder Deity] army is the head of the four main armies of the Empire. It was created and supported by the only old commander Lord Li Guangbi. It has experienced thousands of battles, and it has always won more than it lost. It also has the advantage of the three main passes to defend against, and the mountain range of the Yan Mountain is an incomparably dangerous place. How could it have such a grievous loss?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu asked in confusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "This is also a point that many people cannot understand. But that is the truth." Bao Shinu shook his head with a bitter smile. "Because of the loss of the [Whip of the Thunder Deity] army, the internal conflicts and struggles of the Empire worsened rapidly. Old commander Li took responsibility and delegated power away, leaving the army. All sorts of factions are fighting in the open and behind the &nbsp;background, the situation of the Crown Prince... is becoming more and more difficult."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu frowned, his eyebrows locking together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; He had heard people say before that the old commander Li Guangbi, having had the highest prestige amongst the army, had once supported the Crown Prince and gone against the Right Minister. As the teacher of the War God of Youyan Pass, Lu Zhaoge, as one of the venerable elders of the military, him leaving his post meant that the Crown Prince had lost a great pillar of support. For his situation to deteriorate rapidly as a result of this was something expected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; No wonder the Crown Prince had sent Bao Shinu to him to enquire when he would come out from his isolation training.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; This seemed like the situation where a haphazard treatment was given in an urgent situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; He was the Lord of the Light Palace in name. Although he was in a special power position, but he could ultimately not truly be able to influence the situation of the Empire. Even if he could leave as he wished, he would not be able to give too much aid to the Crown Prince.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu tried to order his thoughts regarding the current situation of the Empire, but he still had no clues whatsoever.</span></p>

Ye Qingyu was clear in his heart that his personal martial power could handle battle. But in terms of strategy and planning, this was not his speciality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; For someone's personal power alone to affect the situation of the entire Heaven Wasteland Domain, this was something only the unparalleled War God in the legends had been able to do after the Snow Empire was founded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; With Ye Qingyu's current martial strength, there was still far, far too great a distance between him and that invisible War God.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; But more importantly, Ye Qingyu sensed that this was not the time for the internal factions to fight and struggle over power. If all the major factions did not stand united, the situation would most likely continue to worsen. The empire had the possibility of falling at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Has the Snow Emperor not shown himself?" Ye Qingyu asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Bao Shinu shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; There was another matter that appeared in Ye Qingyu's mind. "What about the sects? Are they doing anything?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; There was hint of pride that appeared slightly on Bao Shinu's face at this time. "The sects are much more stable comparatively. There is the Martial Madman, Hu Yu from the Imperial Gongfeng looking after things as well as the Thunder Army that is specially held within the city to suppress the power of the sects. The people of the Jianghu do not dare to act recklessly in this period of time, but if the situation continues on in the borders of the empire, then it is hard to say."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu understood what he meant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; As the saying goes, foreign aggression, internal disorder. If foreign disorder persisted for a long period of time, internal disorder would naturally be born.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Furthermore, the internal disorder of the Snow Empire had long existed before this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; After conversing for a while, Bao Shinu left with a disappointed face and bade his farewell.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "A chaotic time is about to arrive, and the situation is rapidly deteriorating. You are a peerless genius, I hope that you can come out as soon as you can from the [Light Palace], and do your part for the empire." He cupped his hands, then turned and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu did not know what to say right now in response to this.</span></p>

But this damned [Light Palace] had trapped him completely here, there was no way of departing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Bao Shinu walked forward for a few steps, then suddenly thought of something. He turned to look at Ye Qingyu, somewhat hesitant but ultimately stating: "[Flowing Light] has perished."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu was taken aback slightly, then utterly shocked. Losing his composure: "What? You said..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "In the battle of the Mountain Sea Pass, [Flowing Light] and [Avalanche] as well as twenty carefully selected scouts were carrying out a special mission in the North East. They just happened to coincide. They killed ten might warriors of the Brute Race, and delayed the [White Mountain Camp], which is a thousand person tribe, for a day. Because of this, the Mountain Sea Pass gained enough time to prepare their defenses. The twenty heroic scouts under [Flowing Light's] command died in battle. After [Flowing Light] returned to the Mountain Sea Pass, he died from heavy injuries sustained in such a battle.”</span></p>

He had long pale yellow hair, and specialized in speed. He was one of the most lively people within the young experts, and had a bright personality, causing Ye Qingyu to have an exceedingly good relationship with him.</span></p>

But right now...</span></p>
