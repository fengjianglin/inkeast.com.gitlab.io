 <p>Chapter 107 – The Four Military Leaders</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu made his decision, not hesitating anymore and preparing to act.</p>
 <p>He activated his inner yuan, then struck out with his fist.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>A large hole was directly created in the stone bridge he was hiding under…</p>
 <p>The rock structure shattered immediately, dust and smoke rising in the air.</p>
 <p>At this instant, Ye Qingyu was like a bolt of lightning flying from beneath the bridge with his palm strikes like electricity. In a split second he had struck four times. The four elite soldiers of the [Black Mountain Barracks] that were wearing black armoured face masks did not react to this ambush in time. They were hit directly in the foreheads. With a muffled grunt, their bodies went limp, falling down.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu only knocked them unconscious, he did not kill them.</p>
 <p>“Who is it…”</p>
 <p>On the bridge, the last soldier of the [Black Mountain Barracks] holding the black-clothed person was still there. He was shocked, his mouth opened wide and loudly exclaiming.</p>
 <p>The voice belonged to Xia Houwu</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu let out a cold laugh, nearing the distance in an instant.</p>
 <p>Xia Houwu felt that this laughter was somewhat familiar, as if he had heard it before somewhere. But in this brief moment he could not investigate too deeply before he needed to defend, the long spear in his hands blocking the strike of the enemy.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu still only utilized his fists.</p>
 <p>Yong!</p>
 <p>Within the sound of the impact, the standard weapon made from steel was bent in a split second by this punch.</p>
 <p>The fist completely crushed past the wailing spear, striking onto Xia Houwu’s body.</p>
 <p>The body of the spear snapped.</p>
 <p>Xia Houwu felt his soul flying away and scattering. He could sense a vast force behind the punch entering within his chest. Afterwards, like a mountain torrent breaking out and unleashing, the force destroyed everything in its path. In this moment, he could even hear the terrifying noise of his own internal organs shattering and crumbling apart.</p>
 <p>This was the sound of death arriving.</p>
 <p>The pupils of Xia Houwu dilated.</p>
 <p>“It’s you…” He was finally able to recognize Ye Qingyu at the last moment.</p>
 <p>The next second, Xia Houwu was possessed by hatred and mad regret, incomparably alarmed. That he would meet Ye Qingyu here, could it be that his fate had already been decided by the Heavens? This meeting was different from their last in the [Boundary Canyon Battlefield]. Dying here represented a true death, without the chance to resurrect.</p>
 <p>“You should have long died. This time, who can save you?” A second force exploded from Ye Qingyu’s fist.</p>
 <p>“You… would really dare kill me, you…” he bellowed with a dark guttural roar, his facial features covered with hatred and venom. His body was like a kite that had its string broken, landing against a stone wall. Blood spurted madly from his mouth, completely fainting.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu’s hand struck out again, forming a blade with his hand and snapping the shackles of the black-clothed man.</p>
 <p>“Follow me and leave.” Ye Qingyu extended his hand to support him.</p>
 <p>The black-clothed man that was heavily injured was able to recognize Ye Qingyu. But instead of taking a hand, he took a step backwards and shook his head.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was taken aback.</p>
 <p>A bitter smile appeared on the black-clothed man, determinedly shaking his head. “Young lord, quickly go. They have already seen my face; they know what I look like. Today within Deer City, everyone under the Bitter Sea stage prosecuted by the army will ultimately be found. Don’t worry about me. Bringing me along will only be your burden…”</p>
 <p>“But…”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu still could not bear leaving him behind.</p>
 <p>Since this black-clothed person was tasked with the responsibility of bring him to see Wang Jianru and little loli, then evidently he was a person that Wang Jianru trusted very much. If possible, Ye Qingyu of course wanted to save him.</p>
 <p>“You should leave quickly, don’t linger in such a dangerous place.” The black-clothed man took another step or two backwards. “My life is cheap, if not for my master in these past years, I would have long died. Right now I will give my life back to my master… Young lord, quickly go. Master has already arranged everything; the little princess will definitely be unharmed. You don’t need to worry.”</p>
 <p>As he finished, he grabbed a long sword lying beside him. With a slice, quick as lightning, he mercilessly sliced apart his own face.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was greatly shocked.</p>
 <p>He was able to see that this sword had completely sliced apart the skin of his face. His entire facial features were a bloody mess. There was absolutely no way anymore of recognizing his original features. The black-clothed man let out a long laugh, then stabbed the blade into his own chest. He jumped into the river under the stone bridge.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu remained silent with no words he could say.</p>
 <p>He knew the reason why this black-clothed man had destroyed his facial features. He was afraid that even if he died, that the army would be able to trace his background and history. He was worried that his family in the city would be affected. Therefore, he would completely destroy his face and chose to commit suicide.</p>
 <p>What kind of man was this to be so staunch and loyal?</p>
 <p>In this instant, Ye Qingyu was completely shaken.</p>
 <p>And at this time, there was the sound of footsteps coming from far away. There was a large quantity of elite soldiers from the [Black Mountain Barracks] that quickly rushed over.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu let out a long sigh of regret, turning and heading towards another direction.</p>
 <p>As he passed by the corpse of Xia Houwu, a thought occurred to him that this fellow may be faking his death. As he ran, he kicked a boulder, and under his inner yuan, the boulder was like an arrow released from a bow. It completely smashed and mutilated the head of the corpse. Confirming there was nothing else to be taken care of, Ye Qingyu quickly hid in the rubble and dust far away.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, tens of soldiers from the [Black Mountain Barracks] came to the stone bridge.</p>
 <p>…… ……</p>
 <p>A short while later.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu had successfully managed to escape from the chaotic battlefield around the [Mist Residence].</p>
 <p>The experience that he had in killing and passing through the wilderness area of the [Boundary Canyon Battlefield] had given him a sensitive instinct like that of a wild beast. At this moment, it proved to be of vital use. He continuously ran into the encirclement and blockages of the [Black Mountain Barracks], but manage to successfully break through the surrounding troops every time.</p>
 <p>The battle in the skies was still ongoing.</p>
 <p>Chen Jiuxing along with tens of expert of Deer City continued to entangle Wang Jianru.</p>
 <p>This was the fight that would determine the final outcome of this battle.</p>
 <p>The sword light was like lightning, constantly slicing apart the skies.</p>
 <p>With every swipe of Chen Jiuxing’s huge hatchet, there would be a vast energy striking out along with it. The yuan qi hatchet chopped apart space, tides of air visible to the human eye spreading out everywhere, incomparably vigorous. By Ye Qingyu’s rough estimation, the strength of this person, should have already reached the thirty Spirit springs stage. No wonder he was one of the four military leaders of Deer City, his strength was indeed powerful.</p>
 <p>But even if so, along with the cooperation of tens of Spirit spring experts, Chen Jiuxing was still at a disadvantage.</p>
 <p>Wang Jianru seemed to be holding something in her left arm. Her right arm casually struck out, and another ray of sword light sliced apart the space. The tightly clustered sword light was like shooting stars. Although the sword light was not as vast or as large as the yuan qi hatchet, but it was far brighter. The radiance was able to completely shroud the splendour of the sun and moon. In an instant, it completely broke apart the yuan qi hatchet.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu retreated below to a restaurant a thousand meters away, mixing into the crowd. All his attention and concentration was focused on the battle in the skies.</p>
 <p>The surrounding conversation was noisy and clamorous, discussing the events that were occurring within the city.</p>
 <p>“Did you hear that the demonic girl of darkness appeared from the Qingluo Merchant Company? ”</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Do you not see the woman holding the sword in the skies, her background is very great. I hear that even if she dies, she wants to protect the demonic girl of darkness!”</p>
 <p>“It seems like this demonic girl of darkness was even a student of White Deer Academy.”</p>
 <p>“Hopefully the army can quickly eliminate that demonic girl. Otherwise, I hear that the demonic girl of darkness will bring with her a curse. If so, our entire Deer City will be plunged into misfortune.”</p>
 <p>In such a world where the martial way was prosperous, there were some people afraid of dying. But people who were not scared and loved to spectate the excitement was in greater numbers. Not only this restaurant, but many of the structures just outside the forbidden radius of entry was especially packed with all sorts of people. Every one of them was observing the battle that was like a fight between deities occurring in the skies.</p>
 <p>Characters like Chen Jiuxing had not fought with their full strength for a very long time. Even martial artists of the city had not seen such a world shaking battle for many years. Every one of them was fascinated by what was occurring.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu had already changed into another pair of clothing, pushing himself into the crowd without saying anything.</p>
 <p>And at this time, the battle in the skies had already continued on for over an hour.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu sensed that something was slightly strange, but could not say what exactly it was.</p>
 <p>During this moment, within the air another abrupt change occurred.—</p>
 <p>Another beam of light, came from the Western district of the city. Radiant like the sun, it transformed into tightly clustered dots of light. Like rain itself, it shot towards Wang Jianru</p>
 <p>When Ye Qingyu looked carefully, it was not green dots of light at all.</p>
 <p>It was evidently a large swathe of densely packed green sword lights. As if it was a hurricane rainstorm, it struck to kill Wang Jianru.</p>
 <p>Another true expert had acted.</p>
 <p>It was the number one person of the Western military office, military leader Qian Yuan.</p>
 <p>The people all around instantly became excited.</p>
 <p>The two great military leaders of Deer City had high status with great power and prestige. For the normal citizens of the city, they were existences where they could see the dragon’s head but not the dragon’s tail*. This time, where the two of them united to face a common enemy, could be counted as a grand occasion that had not occurred for tens of years.</p>
 <p>But Ye Qingyu was somewhat anxious.</p>
 <p>Out of the so many people observing the battle, he was the only one who hoped that Wang Jianru and the little loli would be able to safely depart.</p>
 <p>Only after a moment could Ye Qingyu’s worry lessen slightly.</p>
 <p>The Western military leader Qian Yuan demonstrated a powerful strength. His sword light transformed into rain, and within the green light there was a strange and fearful energy. He was not in any way less powerful than the Southern military leader Chen Jiuxing. but what was strange was that even after Qian Yuan entered into the battlefield, he could not change the situation at all. Gradually in the this fight, Wang Jianru still completely suppressed and controlled the experts of Deer City.</p>
 <p>“This is strange, Wang Jianru can evidently handle their attacks with ease, why doesn’t she break through?” Ye Qingyu sensed that something was peculiar undergoing.</p>
 <p>Boom!Boom!</p>
 <p>Accompanied by the two yuan qi radiance exploding from the Northern and Eastern city districts, there were yet more true experts appearing. Like long streaks of red light shooting through the air, they joined the battle in an instant.</p>
 <p>Another two military leaders had appeared.</p>
 <p>A commotion was instantly created in the crowd observing the battle.</p>
 <p>The four great military leaders attacking at the same time!</p>
 <p>“Haha, the four trashes have finally appeared?” The voice of Wang Jianru resounded throughout the sky, bringing with it a pride and contempt. “Qin Ying, your city leader, why has he not yet appeared? To dare act against me, but not have the guts to appear in front of me. He sends scraps such as you people to your death?”</p>
 <p>Before she had finished.</p>
 <p>A sword light exploded from Wang Jianru’s right arm.</p>
 <p>This sword was enough to shroud all the grace and colour of the world in this very moment.</p>
 <p>No matter whether it was Chen Jiuxing’s yuan qi hatchet or Qian Yuan’s green sword light, nothing could block it. Everywhere in the sky, along with the two other great military leaders and the tens of experts, everything was swept away. Their yuan qi attacks, facing such a sword light was like white snow meeting boiling water. It completely disappeared. Everywhere this sword light passed, space was sliced apart. The clouds were completely dispelled, an azure blue crack sweeping across Deer City.</p>
