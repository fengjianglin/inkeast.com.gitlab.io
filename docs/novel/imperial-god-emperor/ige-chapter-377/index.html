 <p>What was happening today, that all the great figures of the Imperial family would appear all at once?</p>
 <p>Xing'er coming here to find himself was within reason, but to think someone like Yu Feiyan who was ranked number two on the [Heavenly Officer List] would also appear -----Ye Qingyu would not imagine that the Apex Prince Yu Feiyan had only passed by here coincidentally in such a location.</p>
 <p>"Haha, what do you mean. Do you want your uncle to treat you like an outsider? When you were little, you peed on me when you were riding on my shoulders. You still haven't paid me a visit after going away for such a long period of time…”</p>
 <p>In that thick and deep male voice, there was a hint of amusement that appeared.</p>
 <p>"Uncle you are a busy person. You have to take care of major matters concerning the Empire, how could I dare disturb you," Xing'er said calmly.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu faintly felt that Xing'er was not too close to her own uncle. There was a hint of wanting to distance herself away from him hidden in her words.</p>
 <p>"You little girl. You seemed to have heard some rumours, and have some prejudice towards me. Since we've met coincidentally and we haven't seen each other for such a long time, then bring your little boyfriend and let uncle have a look at him, wahaha..."</p>
 <p>As he said these words, on the vast battleship high above, there was a yellow light projection that shone down.</p>
 <p>The faint formation light flickered, shining onto the deck of the little flying ship. It projected a three meter wide circle, flickering with light. It was a transferral formation.</p>
 <p>Xing'er hesitated for a brief moment, then regained her calm and collected herself. She turned to give a glance to Ye Qingyu, smiling at him, "How about it?Let's go, Mr. [War God]. Do you want This Princess to bring you to see the world?"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu laughed. "The Prince told you to bring your little boyfriend. Does that mean you admit this relationship?"</p>
 <p>There was a delicately pretty expression that appeared on Xing'er's beautiful and intricate face. One hand holding onto Ye Qingyu's arm, she shook him a little with a laugh. "That's right, that's right, I was waiting for your word. Does that mean you recognize my position?"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu quickly released himself from Xing'er's arms.</p>
 <p>"I can't stand it... you've only just changed into a different outfit, but it seems like you've changed into a entirely different person." Ye Qingyu had a fearful expression, distancing himself away. Then he said seriously, "But I must warn you to not have any thoughts. In my heart, you are forever a man."</p>
 <p>Hearing this, Xing'er had a face of rage. She humphed and clenched her little tender fists.</p>
 <p>As they spoke, the two had already entered into the transferral formation light projection.</p>
 <p>Light flickered.</p>
 <p>Their vision became blurry.</p>
 <p>When everything became clear again, the two appeared on the vast dock of the huge battleship.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu could instantly sense, that there was a powerful aura appearing from all sides. Evidently, on this battleship, there was a significant number of martial experts guarding it. There were several of them that had an aura and power like a dragon soaring in the skies, it was in the direction in front of them.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu observed all around.</p>
 <p>The position of the two was namely at the center of the dock of the battleship.</p>
 <p>The area of the dock was around several hundred meters. There were weapons racks all around, with all sorts of weapons. It seemed like a martial demonstration field that was large enough to fit thousands of people. Under the banner, there were martial soldiers wearing heavy armour and holding a dragon spear in their hands. Every one of them was strong. In other armies, they would definitely be officer class soldiers. But on this huge ship, they were only normal guards that guarded the ship.</p>
 <p>About four hundred meters in front of them, there was a six-meter-tall building.</p>
 <p>If not for the fact that they were on a flying battleship, Ye Qingyu would really have the impression they had been sent to a camp of some sort of army. In other words, this huge battleship was more than enough by far to become a mobile flying military camp within the skies.</p>
 <p>Below the building, there was an imperial canopy that was opened.</p>
 <p>There were roughly thirty or forty people that stood at attention. There was significant power and energy emitting from everyone. They were evidently powerful martial experts.</p>
 <p>And at the most central position, the person at the head under the imperial canopy was a heroic and muscular middle-aged man. Like a resting tiger or an alert hawk, he sat on the yellow dragon throne. His aura was extremely powerful, but this aura was not solely the yuan qi fluctuation that originated from a martial expert. This was a natural born aura, a spiritual force that he possessed.</p>
 <p>From the crowd, Ye Qingyu's gaze unconsciously focused on this person.</p>
 <p>He wore a jade belt with dragon pearls, and had an imperial robe around him.</p>
 <p>There was a purple gold crown on his head, extremely noble.</p>
 <p>He was the only Apex Prince of the Empire.</p>
 <p>A terrifying person that was only second to the Right Minister on the [Heavenly Officer List].</p>
 <p>Just from his personal aura, Ye Qingyu could be sure that it exceeded any of the important characters Ye Qingyu had ever seen before. Even if it was the [War God of Youyan Pass], Lu Zhaoge would slightly pale in comparison in front of this Apex Prince. Of course, this may be that the status and ambitions of the two were different.</p>
 <p>Apart from his aura, from his appearance, Yu Feiyan could definitely be classified as a rare handsome man.</p>
 <p>A muscular body, strong powerful eyebrows and eyes. He had a black beard, with a face like a jade crown. His body was perfectly proportioned, his physique extremely well-shaped. Wearing an armour of purple gold, this complemented the authority of this Apex Prince to the extreme. It was as if all the good items in the world was gathered on his body. This was a character that shined by himself. No matter what the environment, he would become the center of the situation.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu had seen many handsome people, like Li Qiushui, like Yan Buhui...</p>
 <p>But perhaps these people were too young, or their aura was inferior. compared to Ye Feiyan, they were all not enough.</p>
 <p>The Apex Prince in front of him was evidently at the peak of his appearance and masculinity. He was like a manufactured person. Everywhere he stood, he would be able to block out the existence of all other people, showing off his presence alone.</p>
 <p>"I pay my respects to uncle."</p>
 <p>Xing'er bowed, her attitude somewhat casual.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu also gave a military salute. "I pay my respects to the Apex Prince."</p>
 <p>"Hahaha..." A clear and deep voice resounded. The Yu Feiyan that was sat on the golden dragon throne rose, his fire red dragon patterned cloak swirling like the flame. He took large strides over, then lightly rapped Xing'er's head. "Little girl, we haven't seen each other in several years, why have you gotten so unfamiliar with me? No matter what happens outside, when have I ever mistreated you?"</p>
 <p>There was a trace of guilt that appeared slightly on Xing'er's face.</p>
 <p>Without waiting for her reply, Yu Feiyan turned around, his gaze landing on Ye Qingyu. His expression became much more strict, as he carefully evaluated him. It was only then did his expression relaxed. "You are [The Leaf of Youyan], Ye Qingyu? The [War God] that was able to defeat Du Heng?"</p>
 <p>Evidently this Apex Prince of the Empire had power like the mountain, and many channels of information that was even above Dugu Quan and Ouyang Buping. Therefore, he must be extremely clear on Ye Qingyu’s background and history, and had already done a deep investigation. That was why he was able to know him so well.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu nodded his head. "I am he."</p>
 <p>There was a smile on Yu Feiyan's face.</p>
 <p>His interest towards Ye Qingyu, because of some reason, was even earlier than other people. Therefore he comprehended him more than others.</p>
 <p>But no matter how one obtained information from documents, seeing the person in question was more comprehensive and gave a fuller picture. On some perspective Yu Feiyan would choose to believe in his initial instinct and judgement.</p>
 <p>And right now, the instinctive judgement he had towards Ye Qingyu was different from the judgment he made when reading all sorts of information from the documents.</p>
 <p>He was about to speak, when there was a low and gentle voice that suddenly sounded out---</p>
 <p>"[War God]? Haha, he really is impudent... Prince, why don't you let me have a spar with this so called [War God]?"</p>
 <p>The air suddenly chilled.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Above the clouds, there was a fierce wind that blew.</p>
 <p>There were layers upon layers of clouds that undulated, like it was unending towering mountains floating in the skies. Under the illumination of the sun, it emitted a golden, glistening splendour.</p>
 <p>Amongst the clouds, there was a massive flying flagship that was hundreds of meters long and tens of meters wide that flew. It was like a terrifying ancient beast that guarded an ancient mountain that lay there, silently floating, not moving in the slightest.</p>
 <p>There was a purple gold radiance that shined throughout this flagship. The firewood outer shell of this ship had life-like three-clawed dragon on the outside. The head of the dragon was like it was swallowing the skies, as if it would even swallow the very heavens!</p>
 <p>All sorts of lights and radiance flickered past the body of the three-clawed dragon, emitting a radiance and demonstrating it's incomparable aura.</p>
 <p>At this time, on the dock of the battleship.</p>
 <p>"Spar?" Ye Qingyu frowned.</p>
 <p>Who was that person, that so casually uttered such words in such a situation?</p>
 <p>Furthermore, from the person's tone, it seemed they did not hold any sort of fear towards Yu Feiyan.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu calmly briefed in, his gaze scanning the crowd far off. The power of these people were extreme, and should be guests under Yu Feiyan. It was rumoured that the Apex Prince, Yu Feiyan had three thousand guest masters under his residence, and every one of them was a significant person in the Jianghu, and had great background and divine abilities.</p>
 <p>In these years, when Yu Feiyan had combated against the Right Minister, these guest masters were one of his most important aids.</p>
 <p>Under Ye Qingyu's gaze, from the crowd of guests, there was a young man who carried a blade that walked out.</p>
 <p>This person wore earthen green clothing. His black hair that was like a waterfall dangling on his shoulders that constantly fluttered under the fierce wind. There was a cold expression on his face, and both his hands were behind his back, calmly staring out. There was not the slightest of emotions in his eyes, a cold haughtiness written on his face.</p>
 <p>After experiencing near death in these years and having walked the boundary of life and death for so long, Ye Qingyu's sensitive sense could detect a concealed danger from this person.</p>
 <p>There was a charming expression on Yu Feiyan's face. Looking at Xing'er, then at Ye Qingyu, he seemed to have thought of something. He brought his two hands out from his luxurious sable gown, and clapped it. Laughing loudly, "Little girl, it seems that someone is not satisfied with your friend. Why don't I Iet little Ye cross hands with my guest who doesn't seem to listen to instructions? This will also allow your uncle I, to see if your carefully chosen little boyfriend will meet the requirements?"</p>
