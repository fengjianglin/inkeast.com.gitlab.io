Not only had the wounds on their bodies healed, but they had also regained their previous strength. Once their life force and blood qi were at their peak condition, it would aid in the recovery of their physical body and inner yuan.</span></p>

However, according to the daily report provided by Wang Zhen, it was only a matter of time before these people made a full recovery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only exception was Great Dragon Turtle Demon's injuries, for it involved the mysterious secrets of the foundation of his vitality. Wang Zhen and his team did not seem to make any major progress but Great Dragon Turtle Demon himself did not seem too concerned. He maintained a positive mindset and with the Violet-Gold Dragon King Ginseng to support his life force, he could now walk on his own. With the assistance of his great-great-great-granddaughter, Zhong Xuan, he walked around the various sections of the Green Xuan Hall. He looked like he was in good spirits.</span></p>

The Divine Dragon Turtle Race is naturally blessed with long lifespans but only have middling talent for cultivating the Ways. I had once thought that I would lead an ordinary life in the Southern Waters. Never did I imagine that I could exit the Heaven Wasteland Domain to see for myself the amazingness of the Vast Thousand Domains. I've seen things that my ancestors were never able to see and made valuable contributions to the Heaven Wasteland Domain. I can die without regrets now," Great Dragon Turtle Demon declared to everyone in the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps.</span></p>

He already had a rough idea, but this idea needed to be refined and tested before it could be implemented.</span></p>

Coupled with the reaction of the life force within Great Dragon Turtle Demon's body, he slowly realized that he seemed to have stumbled across something extremely heaven-defying and guessed that this mystery was not something that someone at his cultivation realm should be able to grasp.</span></p>

Her black hair was swept into an intricate bun and was decorated with the seven treasure corals and golden hair accessories. She looked gentle and graceful, and coupled with her elegance, her aura was that of a dignified and authoritative Empress.</span></p>

His dark hair was swept up behind him, neat but without losing its flowing grace. His long robes were as white as snow, and flowing clouds had been sewn with silver thread onto the hem of his robes. He exuded warmth and maturity and his claws were drawn in. He was handsome and carried himself with ease and confidence and, thus, gave off the aura of a peerless Immortal who had descended from the Nine Heavens.</span></p>

This time was no exception, and the ceremony was held before they traveled to the Alliance of Domains divine temple.</span></p>

Not everyone was allowed to enter the temple, only Ye Qingyu and Yu Xiaoxing had received invitations this time.</span></p>

The airship was completely white, as though it was carved out of white jade, and its streamlined body was very alluring. It gleamed faintly in the sun and a layer of barely decipherable formations could be seen, faintly expanding and contracting.</span></p>

After he verified their identities, he led them into the cabin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the crowd from the diplomatic corps sent them off with hopeful and expectant gazes, the flying ship slowly ascended into the sky like a silver eagle and headed in the direction of the Alliance of Domains divine temple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon after, the airship disappeared into the sky.</span></p>

There were no other outsiders on the ship other than them. The deck of the ship was not very big and was milky white interwoven with dark green patterns, which made it extremely beautiful.</span></p>

Now that he thought about it, other than the time that he had witnessed Heaven Connect City's glory from the airship the previous time, he had not stepped out of the Green Xuan Hall thereafter. Thus, this was only the second time he viewed Heaven Connect City's scenery.</span></p>

The difference was as vast as comparing a village to a sprawling city.</span></p>

The congress divine temple was humongous, as though it could support the heavens, and it did not look as though it was built by mere mortals. Despite the fact that he stood on an airship that was more than four thousand meters above ground, he still had to raise his head to look up in order to view the divine temple as they drew closer. The black divine temple almost completely blocked the sun's rays and cast a large shadow across Heaven Connect City.</span></p>

It looked more like a huge city that reached toward the heavens. The temples were all connected and divine statues filled the place. It was as though numerous grand divine temples and divine statues had combined to form the most majestic of buildings in the world. A broad, stone staircase and a wide road weaved through it like a divine belt as though silver dragons and golden serpents were slithering through the main buildings. The buildings that surrounded it would be considered landmarks in other cities but next to the divine temple, they faded into the background.</span></p>

Ye Qingyu tried his best but still could not spot the tip of this divine temple, as if it were never-ending.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The airship was at least six thousand meters above the ground, and just like the previous time that they passed by the divine temple, it could only maintain the same height as the platform beside the divine temple.</span></p>

These squares were suspended in midair, halfway up the divine temple, and were at least five thousand meters above ground. They seemed to be floating in the clouds and came in all sorts of shapes, but their floors were all paved with black jade and engraved with drawings and patterns from the era of ancient gods and demons. They were beautiful and elegant, beyond the imagination of mere mortals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The divine temple also had lifelike statues of all sorts of ancient spiritual birds and mythical beasts that were scattered throughout the divine temple like giant pillars that reached for the heavens. These statues stood tall and imposing and they all contained formations that were almost transparent and rippled slightly as the wind blew. However, the power contained within them caused Ye Qingyu to shiver. He could sense a terrifying ancient aura from these statues.</span></p>

They ascended and descended, all in a flurry of activity. Several warships were docked at the ports; some of them were awaiting the signal to ascend, while some wove through the clouds and made their descent to the ground.</span></p>

This scene seemed to explode in his mind and left him shaken.</span></p>

This is how a prosperous, advanced civilization on the martial way should function. It's no wonder that countless forces and people look down on the Heaven Wasteland Domain and frequently refer to us as a 'lower domain'. From their perspective, they're not wrong. Compared to this scene, Heaven Wasteland's civilization is indeed lagging behind by thousands of years."&nbsp;</span></p>
