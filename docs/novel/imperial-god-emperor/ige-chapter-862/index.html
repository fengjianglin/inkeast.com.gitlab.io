We've heard that the person who stood up on behalf of Qin Hui, that lowly maid was none of other than Ye Qingyu of the Heaven Wasteland Domain. This [Ice Sword Killing God] was someone who did not even take the Black Moon Immortal Palace seriously." One of the disciples looked a little nervous. He looked completely different from the posturing and arrogant person earlier.</span></p>

Above all, he was even powerful enough to cause the Great Saint, an elder of the Black Moon Immortal Palace, to flee in terror.</span></p>

Otherwise, they would have faced the same fate as the disciple who was frozen into an ice block.</span></p>

What are you arguing about? You are all spouting nonsense! This matter has become a little tricky..." Elder Mingjue suddenly interrupted them and broke his silence. "Ye Qingyu is an accomplished young man who has special amnesty. We can't afford to have him as our enemy because he is far too powerful. However, we definitely can't let Qin Hui and her son off either. Since Ye Qingyu has already declared that he will visit our sect, we should first make our way back and report this incident to our sect leader and Elder Cang Li to send out letters of invitation to our allies requesting their support. Then, we should set up a killing formation, so in the event that he truly dares to come, the Ancient Sky Dragon Domain shall be his burial place.”</span></p>

Qin Hui and her son must have garnered the support of an ancient divine mountain and he naturally would not search for them to engage in senseless arguments.</span></p>

Countless sects, forces, chambers of commerce, distinguished families, and financial groups had all visited and requested to work with the Heaven Wasteland Domain.

Everything they had now was the result of brother Ye Qingyu's hard-fought battles where his life was on the line each time. No one knew how much pressure he faced, or how many times he was injured, or how much blood he shed, or the sacrifices he made… The prestige they enjoyed was all due to brother Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
