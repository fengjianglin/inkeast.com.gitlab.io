 <p>Chapter 374 - The Two River Gang of the Imperial Capital</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu stood silently basking in the first rays of the morning sun.</p>
 <p>Bai Yuanxing slowly stretched his body. His every movement was very simple, but exuded a sense of rhythm, like a beautiful dance. This was the ordinary moves of the [Heavenly Blind Dao]. This cultivation technique used the fists and feet, and paid particular attention to the physical strength of the body. This does not mean relying on brute force to win, nor sheer force to oppress others, but replacing the eyes with fists and feet.</p>
 <p>Bai Yuanxing’s current performance evidently showed that he had understood the essence of the cultivation technique.</p>
 <p>[Heavenly Blind Dao] places emphasis on the refining of the body, but not only in the cultivation of strength. It also focused on the sensitivity of the body and developing the body’s perception of force. Through the changes in body position, it affects the surrounding flow of air, energy and qi, and then through the changes in flow of air, energy and qi to determine the existence of foreign objects.</p>
 <p>According to the introduction of [Heavenly Blind Dao] in the ancient bronze book, this technique was divided into 12 levels.</p>
 <p>On successfully passing the first four levels, one's strength is comparable to the peak of the Spirit spring. With that, one could hear the sound of a piece of petal falling to the ground in the midst of rain and wind. With this, one could perceive the surroundings like a normal person, and engage in hand-to-hand combat, without being at a disadvantage.</p>
 <p>Once they successfully advanced through the middle four levels, ones combat strength was comparable to those in the realm of Ascending Heaven. They can sense a mayfly beating its wings thousands of miles away, can differentiate colours, temperature, and can perceive the track of a grain of dust rolling across the air under the sunlight.</p>
 <p>After successfully reaching the top four levels, standing in the central area, one can see all four directions, roam the world, see all living things clearly, go up to heaven and down to hell. They were capable of seeing what deities could see, and there was nothing one cannot do.</p>
 <p>This cultivation method, once it was cultivated to it’s very depths, was indeed unfathomable.</p>
 <p>It is also the most suitable cultivation method that Ye Qingyu could find for Bai Yunaxing for now.</p>
 <p>On the premise of ineffective treatment of his eyes, only through the cultivation of techniques could he enhance his realm, and when advanced to the stage of the Ascending Heaven, he could change his fate and go against nature to regenerate limbs. Given Bai Yuanxing’s intelligence, it would be impossible for him to progress to this step through other cultivation techniques. [Heavenly Blind Dao] was the only possible cultivation method.</p>
 <p>His progress in the future depended on himself.</p>
 <p>This day, Bai Yuanxing had completely obtained the mantra and profound meaning of the content of the [Heavenly Blind Dao].</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu also took some time to teach and give advice on Jin Ling’er, Li Ying and Li Qi’s martial arts. Ximen Yeshui, who was free and had nothing to do, would also occasionally guide the children. His martial road was obviously of the ancient martial school, and took the approach of the former sect era, but his every sentence was very insightful.</p>
 <p>In the evening, the medicine god and pill god still had not yet returned to the [Medicine Hut].</p>
 <p>Early in the morning, Wen Wan went out carrying a bowl, looking busy. No one knew what he was doing. Ever since arriving at the imperial capital, he had became a little weird.</p>
 <p>Mother Wu prepared dinner, and after Ye Qingyu and Bai Yuanxing and other people had dinner together, Lin Baiyi escorted them back to the military building.</p>
 <p>On the way back, Lin Baiyi revealed that his father—the current head of the Lin clan, wants to meet Ye Qingyu. Ye Qingyu smiled and agreed, but because the military matters had not been sorted out yet, he temporarily could not leave and estimated that it would be after the military have appointed the 18 young experts, when he would be free.</p>
 <p>Lin Baiyi happily agreed.</p>
 <p>As they were bidding goodbye at the door of the military building, Ye Qingyu told Lin Baiyi that if medicine god and pill god have not returned from the palace tomorrow, then he does not need to come collect him.</p>
 <p>Returning back to the 55th floor training camp, the majority of the young experts were still there.</p>
 <p>[Flowing Light] told Ye Qingyu news that were not too good——the [Avalanche] who had gone to the camp of the Thunder Deity within Snow Capital with Qiu Fenghan had not returned yet.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu nodded, noting it down.</p>
 <p>At this time, the two instructors were not in the building and there was no way they could investigate the matter.</p>
 <p>On the same night, Ye Qingyu basically swapped pointers with the young experts to pass time.</p>
 <p>The next morning, Lin Baiyi did not come to collect Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>This meant that the medicine god and pill god had not returned from the palace.</p>
 <p>Ever since coming to the imperial capital, Ye Qingyu’s mind had always been loaded with one matter. And that was to find ways to enter the Imperial Offering Temple, to find the secret of his father’s last words. But this matter was very important, and Ye Qingyu obviously could not directly ask the medicine god and pill god. After he inquired about it, he realized that with his current position and status, it was basically impossible for him to get into the Imperial Offering Temple.</p>
 <p>The Imperial Offering Temple, also known as the Imperial Ancestral Hall, was the ancestral land of the current Snow Country imperial household, the Yu clan’s ancestral land. The place was heavily guarded, and it was said that only the members of the imperial family and relatives by blood were allowed to enter. Even relatives of the emperor cannot get close to the ancestral hall and must stay thousands of meters away. If there were places in the Snow Capital that were absolutely prohibited, then the Imperial Ancestral Hall must be one of them, and would be ranked in the top three.</p>
 <p>Given Ye Qingyu’s current status and identity, it was absolutely impossible for him to enter the Ancestral Hall.</p>
 <p>And with his present strength, it was almost impossible to infiltrate the Ancestral Hall.</p>
 <p>But Ye Qingyu would not give up.</p>
 <p>After the trip to Deer City, Ye Qingyu was more curious about the identity of his parents. He already had speculations in his own heart, and he increasingly wanted to prove that his speculation was right. No matter what, he must give it a try.</p>
 <p>Early in the morning after registration, Ye Qingyu left the military building.</p>
 <p>This time, he did not head for the [Medicine Hut].</p>
 <p>But he left alone on a formation airship, changing several routes, before eventually getting off at a station of the City’s North district South Temple Street, and entered into the busy crowd.</p>
 <p>The whole morning ended in a seemingly pointless stroll.</p>
 <p>At noon, he casually walked into a small restaurant to eat something, and then continued strolling.</p>
 <p>Until coming into a quiet alley without anyone, and almost reaching the end of the alley, Ye Qingyu suddenly sped up, shot out like a lightning, and instantly disappeared from his original place.</p>
 <p>The next moment, two blurred shadows appeared in the air, like ghosts, flashing, and then rapidly chasing after in the direction that Ye Qingyu disappeared.</p>
 <p>A moment later.</p>
 <p>A faint white mist gleamed in the alley, turning into Ye Qingyu’s figure.</p>
 <p>“You followed so closely, but I still don’t know which sect you people are from.” Ye Qingyu shook his head.</p>
 <p>From the moment he left the military building today, he knew that he was being followed. He spent the morning trying to gather some clues, but he did not expect the people that were tailing him to be so strong and are tracking masters. Ye Qingyu carefully dealt with the people for a half-day, but failed to observe anything and finally had to use the [Flowing Light] technique to lose them.</p>
 <p>“It seems that after a battle with [Purple Eye], I have aroused some people’s attention.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu had already realized this long ago, so he was not too surprised.</p>
 <p>Having managed to shake off the pursuers, Ye Qingyu concealed his aura, left the alley, went to a tea house, and sat there for half an hour. Until he determined that there was no one following him, he got up and entered the teahouse's backyard.</p>
 <p>The backyard was also a teahouse.</p>
 <p>A beautiful tea-girl who looked only 17 or 18 years old came over to greet Ye Qingyu and led him into the first tearoom. The green bamboo teahouse looked like it was naturally formed, very aesthetically pleasing, if one looked at it from the street outside, it would be difficult to think that the winding path leads to a secluded quiet place, and that there would be such an elegant place.</p>
 <p>“Sir, please go ahead.” The beautiful girl’s gesture was elegant and her smile was gentle.</p>
 <p>Her skin was fair like milk, and her facial appearance was very delicate, as though painted. If not seen with his own eyes, it was hard to believe that Lang Zhong had such a attractive sister who was like a painted picture.</p>
 <p>This beautiful, fair young girl is the younger sister of the head of the Two River Gang Lang Zhong, who was now solely responsible for all kinds of matters of the Imperial capital’s division of the Two River Gang. According to Lang Zhong, his younger sister had a brilliant tactical mind and was a person difficult to deal with.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu received the news two days ago, but today he was finally able to spare time to see Lang Yong.</p>
 <p>Lang Yong was the name of this beautiful maiden.</p>
 <p>A very masculine name.</p>
 <p>And her name together with her brother’s name was Zhongyong[1].</p>
 <p>[1]meaning loyal and brave</p>
 <p>It is said that this is not a beautiful name, but a name she gave herself.</p>
 <p>Lang Zhong’s name was given by Mother Ye back then. When Lang Yong was still young she only had a nickname, and later Mother and Father Ye were killed and could not give this little girl a name. In order to cherish the memory of Father and Mother Ye, and remember the blood feud, the little girl gave herself the name Lang Yong, meaning to be brave, to investigate the cause of Father and Mother Ye’s death, even in the face of any difficulties, and would never retreat.</p>
 <p>When Ye Qingyu heard about this, he was also very moved.</p>
 <p>Today was Ye Qingyu’s first time meeting Lang Yong.</p>
 <p>Perhaps because of their relationship with his parents Lang Zhong and Lang Yong were also regarded as adoptive children of his parents, when Ye Qingyu saw Lang Yong, it was like seeing his own little sister. There was an extremely close feeling.</p>
 <p>The door of the teahouse slammed shut.</p>
 <p>Lang Yong knelt down and greeted him. “Young master.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu waved dismissively and immediately supported the young girl up. “Don’t be so polite, call me Xiaoyu. Sister Lang is older than me by one year, I should be the one greeting older sister.”</p>
 <p>The maiden still very stubbornly knelt down. “The difference in status must not be forgotten, now that Lang Yong is working for young master, I must strictly adhere to the rules. Otherwise the Two River Gang would not follow the rules in the future.”</p>
 <p>On the painting-like face, there was a seriousness that was not commensurate with her age.</p>
 <p>Then she respectfully began presenting jade scrolls of document, which were organized by category, and consisted of information on the major factions of the imperial capital that Lang Yong personally selected herself. In her view, this information would be very useful for Ye Qingyu in the imperial capital.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu expressed his thanks and then began examining them carefully.</p>
 <p>Lang Yong was standing at the side brewing tea for him, her movements were very skilful, but as before, her manner was still very serious. Ye Qingyu could not help but think of the little boy servant of the [Painting Saint] Liu Yuqing, Xing’er, who was also an expert in tea making. When he was brewing tea, his movements were very natural, and graceful and elegant like a woman. Compared to the seriousness of Lang Yong, a real woman, there was a clear-cut difference.</p>
 <p>On the jade scrolls, there was a lot of information.</p>
 <p>It was clear that in these days the Two River Gang had done a lot in the imperial capital.</p>
 <p>There was some information in the scrolls that Ye Qingyu had never read before in the information that Ouyang Buping and Dugu Quan provided, and the majority of the information were more or less related to Ye Qingyu and were gathered and listed in Ye Qingyu’s point of view. In a way, this information indeed has important significance to Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>In the last document scroll, Ye Qingyu could see the response of the great forces of the imperial capital after his battle with [Purple Eye] Du Heng.</p>
 <p>This sensational effect seemed more frantic than what Ye Qingyu had anticipated in the beginning.</p>
 <p>The most straightforward reason was because of that strand of silver hair known as [Three Thousand Feet of White Hair].</p>
