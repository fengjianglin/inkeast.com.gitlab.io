 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 1: Thrown into the Lotus Pond</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>While she was dreaming, Mu Yunjin suddenly felt as if she were being suffocated. “<i>Swish…”</i>. The next moment, her eyes opened, and she felt as if she were in the midst of the boundless cold night. Currently, two hands were fiercely strangling her.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin reacted instinctively as she immediately gripped the hands that were strangling her, and immediately twisted them. She only heard the sound of &nbsp;bones cracking.</p>
 <p>“Ah……”</p>
 <p>The blood curdling screams resonated in the midst of the tranquil horizon.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin sat up from her bed. With the aura of an experienced person, she locked her gaze upon some unknown area. She opened her mouth and said coldly, “So useless. Who sent you?”</p>
 <p>As she said this, some faint running sounds could be heard from outside her door. After that, some people pushed her room door open. They were holding some lanterns, which pretty much filled the dark room with light.</p>
 <p>“Miss, are you okay?”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin did not answer the man, choosing instead, under this light, to examine the place that she was in.</p>
 <p>She immediately raised her eyebrows and opened her eyes wider in surprise as she saw that standing in front of her was a young lady holding onto a lantern, and an elder woman holding onto her wrist. The woman was in so much pain that she was clenching her teeth hard enough &nbsp;to break.</p>
 <p>Both of them were clad in clothes from the ancient times.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin was a bit in shock as she tried to think. She clearly remembered &nbsp;that she was on a mission. But, &nbsp;as she was on her &nbsp;way, the plane that she was on suddenly exploded. She must have died.</p>
 <p>Then why...</p>
 <p>“Eh, Aunty Su, why are you here?” The young lady, who was holding onto the lantern, suddenly asked, looking at the elder woman with shock.</p>
 <p>After hearing what the young lady asked, Mu Yunjin regained her wits, focusing once again on that elder woman.</p>
 <p>Who knew that, under the gazes of both Mu Yunjin and that girl, she wasn’t even the least bit afraid. Instead, she ground her teeth and said, “Third Miss has committed a violent crime in the middle of the night, and has broken my wrist. I must immediately report this to the Master.”</p>
 <p>After she said this, the elder woman struggled to stand up.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin was actually still feeling a bit muddled &nbsp;However, after hearing the elder woman say the two words ‘Third Miss’, some memories started to flash in her brain, causing her head to hurt so much that she had to bury it in her hands.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin, the Third Miss of the Mu Residence. She was the most beautiful woman in the country of Xiyuan, but because she lacked any scholarly knowledge, and had a cowardly personality, she was looked down upon by her father. She spent her days confined in the Ascending Blossoms Pavilion and was not allowed to go out.</p>
 <p>This elder woman in front of her was her younger sister, Mu Lingzhu's wet nurse- Aunty Su.</p>
 <p>Thinking up to this point, Mu Yunjin flashed a cold smile. She looked straight at the arrogant Aunty Su and said, “This kind of small matter does not require Aunty Su to go and report to father.”</p>
 <p>Aunty Su looked at Mu Yunjin and thought that she was afraid, so she started to become even more aggressive. &nbsp;She simply walked over to a chair in the corner and sat down, ignoring the pain that was coming from her wrist. Her eyes spinning she asked, “Then how does Third Miss plan to settle the issue of hurting my hand?”</p>
 <p>“Aunty Su, isn’t this simply a misunderstanding? How could Miss injure your hand?” The servant girl, Zi Xiang, could not help but blurt out. She really wanted to ask Aunty Su what she was doing &nbsp;running over to Miss’s room in the middle of the night . However, after thinking it through, she didn’t dare to ask.</p>
 <p>“Shut up. I am talking to Third Miss, when did it become your turn to speak?!” Aunty Su glared at Zi Xiang. She wanted to reach out her hand and slap her a few times, but her hand was hurting so much that it could not move.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this, Zi Xiang was so afraid that she retreated, not daring to speak another word.</p>
 <p>By this time, Mu Yunjin had already digested the strange occurance of the reincarnation of her soul. Thinking of the situation that occurred the moment she had awakened, she stretched out her hand and rubbed her neck, which had been strangled.</p>
 <p>After what seemed like half a day, Mu Yunjin revealed a bloodthirsty smile. She blinked her eyes, “Zi Xiang, daylight is approaching, just let me suffer a bit today. Go to the Lotus pond to feed the Koi.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“<i>Splash…”</i></p>
 <p>The peaceful Lotus pond suddenly began to &nbsp;ripple, splashing against some flowers in the water, causing a ruckus in the middle of the night.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin stood at the side of the Lotus pond, hugging her arms. She looked at the Lotus pond and at the silhouette of the person who kept struggling. Her lips curled into a smile of contempt.</p>
 <p>When they had thrown Aunty Su into the Lotus Pond, it had managed to keep her quiet. If not, this would definitely not be fun anymore.</p>
 <p>On the side, Zi Xiang watched all of this happening, and she was so terrified that her face was a sheet of white. She tilted her head to look at Mu Yunjin and saw that she was wreathed in smiles. For a moment, Zi Xiang felt that the person standing in front of her was not the same Mu Yunjin that she used to know.</p>
 <p>“Miss, while Aunty Su still has her life, should we fish her out?” Zi Xiang was a bit hesitant as she looked at Mu Yunjin.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin smiled lightly. Her gaze still lingered on Aunty Su, “Fish her out? Then let her go and complain? What for? By that time, it will be uncertain as to whether or not we will be the ones thrown into the Lotus pond.”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin’s words caused Zi Xiang to blank out once again. She was totally surprised that these words actually came out from Mu Yunjin’s mouth.</p>
 <p>It looked like she had yet to understand Miss completely.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin glanced at Zi Xiang. This girl had grown up with her. In the past, when the original Mu Yunjin had been bullied everyday, she would always stand in front to protect Mu Yunjin. She should be trustworthy.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go. It’s time to go back.”</p>
 <p>“Miss, what if Fourth Miss comes to call on us tomorrow?” Zi Xiang asked worriedly.</p>
 <p>“Ah, I’m only afraid that she won’t come.”</p>
 <p>After walking two steps, she suddenly heard a clatter. Mu Yunjin felt that something had dropped out from within her clothes.</p>
 <p>After hearing the sound, Mu Yunjin squatted down and picked up a white jade pendant [1]. Her body scattered what appeared to be white rays coming from the pendant, causing the light to seep into the quiet black night.</p>
 <p>Under the white-jade glow, one could faintly make out the word ‘Yunjin’ carved onto the Jade pendant.</p>
 <p>Mu Yun Jin examined this jade pendant. It was extremely pure and polished extremely meticulously. It was probably a first class item.</p>
 <p>“I really didn’t expect that such an expensive treasure would be found on my body.” Mu Yunjin laughed at herself mockingly.</p>
