 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 2: Looking for Trouble</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>The next day, Mu Yunjin managed to relax her mind and body for the first time in a long while. &nbsp;She slept all the way until noon, which was something that she had never even dreamed about in her previous life.</p>
 <p>She had wanted to fall into a deep sleep for an entire day and night. &nbsp;However, Zi Xiang was unable to let go of the events that had taken place on the previous night and stubbornly woke Mu Yunjin up, helping her to dress &nbsp;and look presentable.</p>
 <p>Standing in front of the copper mirror, she had a small smile on her face. She had makeup on and was toying with the two pearl hairpins in her hand, smiling widely as she saw her gorgeous reflection from the mirror. She was extremely beautiful the makeup highlighting her beauty by many times.</p>
 <p>When Mu Yunjin saw her reflection in the mirror, her heart lightened considerably. Who would have thought that she would have taken possession of such a good body.</p>
 <p>“Miss, which pearl hairpin do you want to choose?” Zi Xiang had finished fixing up Mu Yunjin’s hair into a bun, and asked when she saw Mu Yunjin toying with the two pearl hairpins.</p>
 <p>After she said this, Mu Yunjin handed a jasper green hairpin to Zi Xiang.</p>
 <p>As the jasper hairpin was stuck into Mu Yunjin’s hairdo, the sound of footsteps were heard outside of her door. Then, a ‘<i>bang’ </i>was heard and the door was fiercely pounded upon before &nbsp;a pair of people entered.</p>
 <p>When Zi Xiang saw these people enter, she was so afraid that her hands started to tremble. She lowered her head and a look of fear came across her face. She did not dare to raise her head.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin was calm and unhurried. She turned around and saw the people standing behind her. She put on a beautiful smile, “So it’s Fourth Sister and Fifth Sister. &nbsp;it’s been a long time since we last met.”</p>
 <p>The people who had come were her blood sister Mu Lingzhu, and the daughter of the third mistress, Mu Xiarou.</p>
 <p>“Hello sister.” Mu Lingzhu wore a smile that was not quite a smile, as she walked closer. Her gaze was locked on Mu Yunjin, and looking at the beautiful smile on her face, Mu Lingzhu felt that it was completely offensive to her eyes.</p>
 <p>After what seemed like half a day, Mu Lingzhu regained her senses and said meaningfully, “Aunty Su drowned in the Lotus pond, has elder sister heard about this?”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin looked at Mu Lingzhu, and in front of this average face, she could only verify that sentence…&nbsp;<i>The Mu&nbsp;residence has two wonders-&nbsp; Third Miss, Mu Yunjin was born with such gorgeous features, magnificent beyond compare; however, she’s an idiot who lacks substance. Fourth&nbsp;Miss Mu Lingzhu is full of wisdom, extremely knowledgeable in all scholarly aspects, but she is just mediocre in appearance and possesses such average looks</i>.</p>
 <p>Both these women had their own flaws. Since this was the case, her father, Mu Xiang, had favored Mu Lingzhu, who had ability, knowledge and insight.</p>
 <p>“Oh? Aunty Su drowned?” Mu Yunjin’s eyes revealed a trace of astonishment, which was noticed by Mu Lingzhi. After that she continued to sigh, “Aunty Su is old, walking has become difficult, losing her footing and falling into the Lotus pond is not such a strange occurrence.”</p>
 <p>After she said this, Mu Yunjin stretched forth her hand to touch her neck, pretending not to notice that her collar had slipped a bit. Her white neck revealed traces of a scar</p>
 <p>Mu Lingzhu saw what she did and her eyes flashed with a peculiar light. She bit her lip and began to scrutinise Mu Yunjin’s neck, her fingers uncontrollably clenching together lightly.</p>
 <p>She deserved to die. Wasn’t the scar on Mu Yunjin’s neck due to someone strangling her?</p>
 <p>So the meaning behind this action, was clearly telling her that she was the one who had caused Aunty Su to drown in the lotus pond?</p>
 <p>But since this was the case, she could not expose what Mu Yunjin had done.</p>
 <p>This was because she was the one who had gotten Aunty Su to go to the Ascending Blossoms Pavilion to take Mu Yunjin’s life. Who knew that Mu Yunjin had gotten away completely unscathed while it was Aunty Su whose life had been taken away.</p>
 <p>The more Mu Lingzhi thought about it, the angrier she became. There were just some things that she could not expose. Or else, if her father caught wind of it and traced it back to her, the one who would suffer would be her.</p>
 <p>This Mu Yunjin used to be have such an insipid character, who was no better than a walking corpse. Where did she find the courage to actually do something like silencing Aunty Su by killing her?</p>
 <p>Just now Mu Yunjin revealed traces of her scar; it could only be to also give her a warning.</p>
 <p>Mu Lingzhu wanted to tear her to shreds with her teeth. But just as she was about to open her mouth to say something, she heard Mu Yunjin say lightly while turning around, “ &nbsp;I really want to offer my condolences to Aunty Su. It’s just a pity that Father has confined me here. Without his order, I’m not allowed to leave Ascending Blossoms Pavilion.”</p>
 <p>When Mu Lingzhu heard what Mu Yunjin had said, her face turned ashen.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Mu Xiarou, who had remained quiet the entire time, suddenly felt a peculiar atmosphere in the room that made her look around. Suddenly, her jaw dropped and she pointed at the jasper hairpin in Mu Yunjin’s hair, “Third Sister, that’s a jasper hairpin. Is that the hairpin Imperial Concubine Qin &nbsp;bestowed upon you not long ago?”</p>
 <p>“Why?” Mu Yunjin glanced over at Mu Xiarou.</p>
 <p>Mu Xiarou suddenly smiled and her eyes flashed as she thought of a sly idea: “You know, Third Sister, you spend all your days inside this Ascending Blossoms Pavilion without going out. It’s such a waste for you to put on such a good hairpin.”</p>
 <p>“Why don’t you take it off and gift it to Fourth Sister? In any case, Fourth Sister is a smart and beautiful citizen of Xiyuan Nation, so at the very least, she won’t step all over Imperial Concubine Qin’s kind intentions.”</p>
 <p>Mu Xiarou’s words greatly delighted Mu Lingzhu.</p>
 <p>That’s right, Mu Yunjin was someone who had no scholarly knowledge; an idiot with no substance. How was she compatible with Imperial Concubine jasper hairpin!</p>
 <p>Although she did not view the things that &nbsp;Imperial Concubine Qin had given to Mu Yunjin in high regard, she found it extremely irksome to see the way Mu Yunjin wore the hairpin.</p>
 <p>When Mu Yunjin heard what Mu Xiarou said, she didn’t have any reaction, nor did she say anything. She continued to wait and see what Mu Xiarou would do next.</p>
 <p>Mu Xiarou saw that Mu Yunjin was not speaking, so she simply pretended to be bold and walked over to Mu Yunjin. She stretched forth a hand, wanting to pluck out the jasper hairpin in Mu Yunjin’s hair.</p>
 <p>“When Fourth Sister wears this jasper hairpin, she’ll definitely… ah!”</p>
 <p>Mu Xiarou’s hand had not yet touched the hairpin on Mu Yunjin’s head when she felt that her waist had been hit by something, hurting her so much that she could not bear to stand up straight.</p>
 <p>“Ah, it hurts so much!” Mu Xiarou clutched onto her abdomen with her face completely pale.</p>
 <p>When Mu Lingzhu saw this happen, her eyebrows furrowed, subconsciously looking towards Mu Yunjin.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Mu Yunjin was also looking at her. Her face contained a sneer, one hand taking off the jasper hairpin in her hair.</p>
 <p>“Lingzhu, Fifth Sister’s stomach hurts, you should quickly bring her to see the physician. If you take too long, she might be buried together with Aunty Su.”</p>
