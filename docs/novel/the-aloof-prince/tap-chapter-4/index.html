 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 4: The Shame of the Mu Clan</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>A deep and resounding deep voice came from behind her. Even Mu Yunjin was caught off guard. She cursed herself silently for not paying attention to the activity around her, while also unhurriedly turning around.</p>
 <p>Perhaps that voice was really very loud, as Mu Lingzhu and the other middle-aged woman who were in the residence just now, had walked out the door.</p>
 <p>The moment Mu Lingzhu saw the scene at the courtyard entrance, she laughed while removing all traces of shock. After that, she paid her respects to the people at the door, “Father, big sister.”</p>
 <p>The moment Mu Yunjin &nbsp;heard her greet her father , Mu Yunjin’s eyelids flickered. Afterwards, Mu Lingzhu put on an act as she also bowed.</p>
 <p>“Kneel down!” Mu Xiang glared at Mu Yunjin, who stood in front of him. All his annoyance was written on his face.</p>
 <p>The Mu Clan could be considered a prestigious and famous Clan in the entire Xiyuan Nation. Everyone from the Mu Clan, generation after generation, were all giants among men. However, when they reached this generation, an idiot like Mu Yunjin actually surfaced. Usually, she was timid and cowardly, with frail speech, really a walking disaster. While she was alive, she pulled all the prestige of the Mu family down to a whole new level. She was definitely the biggest stain on the Mu Clan.</p>
 <p>Thus, whenever Mu Xiang saw Mu Yunjin, he would feel like he had let down his ancestors. Even if she had the appearance of a celestial being, in Mu Xiang’s opinion, she did not have anything of true value and was completely useless.</p>
 <p>Standing at the &nbsp;side, the Madam next to Mu Lingzhu, Su Biqing, had also opened her mouth to say, “Yunjin, without your father’s order, how dare you go out of the Ascending Blossoms Pavilion without explicit approval? Indeed, you do look upon yourself too highly.”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin heard this, and the corner of her mouth &nbsp;curved faintly upwards. &nbsp;Directly ignoring Mu Xiang’s words, she focused on the Madam, Su Biqing, “I merely went out to stroll around. Mother, does this count as looking upon myself highly? It seems like your words are too serious.”</p>
 <p>“You…” Su Biqing’s complexion became ashen in a flash. She totally did not think that Mu Yunjin would dare contradict her.</p>
 <p>At the side, Mu Xiang watched this scene, and immediately bellowed, “Rebellious girl! You dare contradict your mother? Kneel down!”</p>
 <p>She heard Mu Xiang’s voice again but continued to plaster on a faint smile. It seemed that this Mu Xiang truly loathed Mu Yunjin. After his arrival, he had only spoken three sentences but every sentence had brimmed with anger. Today, he had even cursed her with words like “rebellious girl”.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin, Mu Yunjin, you are really too pitiful.</p>
 <p>“What if I do not kneel?” Mu Yunjin slightly raised her chin, her sight fixed on Mu Xiang’s two eyes that had become red with anger.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin’s words made the three people in front of her stumped for words. They definitely didn’t think that the sentence that had just been spoken had actually come from Mu Yunjin’s mouth.</p>
 <p>Especially, Mu Xiang, who was used to seeing the chicken-hearted Mu Yunjin. Hearing her say these words, made him feel that his own authority was being challenged in a split second. His anger flared up even more, as he lifted up his hand and prepared to shower blows down on Mu Yunjin.</p>
 <p>Before Mu Xiang made a move, Mu Yunjin drew back a step, easily evading Mu Xiang, as she waved her hand.</p>
 <p>As she watched the scene in front of her, Mu Lingzhu covered her mouth and laughed. &nbsp;She said indifferently to Mu Yunjin, “Big sister, even if you’re about to be married into the residence of the 6th Prince and you are the future Consort of the 6th Prince, you have not married yet. Mother and Father have raised you for so many years, so you ought to still respect your parents.”</p>
 <p>When she heard Mu Lingzhu’s words, Mu Yunjin faintly glanced at her, pondering things over in her heart. Sure enough, this Mu Lingzhu had skill. With a few words, she could turn her into a thankless wretch who was ungrateful to those who had taken care of her.</p>
 <p>“Where did your nerve come from today? You not only left your Pavilion, you also contradicted your father and I. It turns out it’s because you think you are already the 6th Princess.” Su Biqing eyes were full of disdain as she spoke.</p>
 <p>After a pause, Su Biqing cast a glance at Mu Yunjin, and opened her mouth again, “Lord, you have also seen that it will be hard for Mu Yunjin, this girl, to improve herself and become better.”</p>
 <p>“What about tomorrow I enter the Palace, and report these events to the first rank Imperial Concubine Qin, and ask her to cancel this marriage that will connect our families? Or perhaps, we can switch people out?”</p>
 <p>Mu Xiang’s eyebrows creased when he heard what Su Biqing had said. However, he still nodded, agreeing to Su Biqing’s words.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin watched the family of three echoing one another in front of her and she felt like she really couldn’t stop herself from wanting to pour ice water over all of them.</p>
 <p>Thus, they only heard Mu Yunjin begin to speak coldly, “Since things have come to this, tomorrow I shall go with Mother to visit Imperial Concubine Qin.</p>
 <p>“It just so happens that I have many things that I also want to go talk to Imperial Concubine Qin about.”</p>
 <p>“For example, Imperial Concubine Qin may not know all the matters about my confinement in the residence. Father has definitely been fooling Imperial Concubine Qin in many matters...”</p>
