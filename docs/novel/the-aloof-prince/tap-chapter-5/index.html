 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 5: Winning first place for three consecutive years</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>After she spoke, Mu Yunjin looked at the startled expressions on the three people in front of her, feeling very pleased. She wore a smiling expression with a cold gaze, as she waited for what they would say next.</p>
 <p>Mu Lingzhu bit her lip, her heart wondering what demon had been possessing Mu Yunjin for the past few days. Unexpectedly, her temperament had changed extremely, even daring to contradict Father.</p>
 <p>Right when she was about to &nbsp;speak, Su Biqing, who was standing next to her, pulled at her sleeve. She shot her a glance, hinting that she should not speak.</p>
 <p>Mu Xiang returned to his senses quickly. There was a flash of a killing intent in the gaze that he shot at Mu Yunjin. Perhaps it was because he was so enraged, he seemed hot like he had a fever. Mu Xiang shouted loudly, “Someone come! Tie this rebellious girl up! Today, I shall definitely whip her ten times, to make her taste the law of the Mu Clan!”</p>
 <p>Just when a few servants appeared to tie Mu Yunjin up, a voice travelled into the courtyard, “Master, Madam, Elderly Lady Qu of Imperial Concubine Qin has come into the residence.”</p>
 <p>The moment they heard it was someone from Imperial Concubine Qin’s side, the faces of Mu Xiang, Su Biqing and all the people present &nbsp;changed. They glanced at Mu Yunjin who was standing at the side, but in the end, they walked towards the hall with large strides.</p>
 <p>In the hall, an old elderly woman stood there, dressed in palace attire. When she saw Mu Xiang and Su Biqing, she bowed to the two of them.</p>
 <p>“Elderly Lady Qu need not be over courteous. Please sit.”</p>
 <p>Elderly Lady Qu shook her head and laughed, “This old servant has come today to convey the orders on behalf of my Master, the Imperial Concubine. In three days, at <i>chenshi</i> (7-9 am), the Third Lady of the Mu family as well as the Fourth Lady of the Mu family are to enter the palace.”</p>
 <p>“Lingzhu’s presence has also been called for?” The moment Su Biqing heard the request for the Fourth young lady, her eyes brightened.</p>
 <p>Elderly Lady Qu nodded, “This servant has already passed on the orders. In three days, I also ask that these two Ladies will have prepared themselves well.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>After Elderly Lady Qu left, Mu Yunjin looked at Mu Xiang’s angry, ashen face, as the corner of her lips curved. In her heart she shouted. <i>This Elderly Lady Qu certainly came at the right time.</i></p>
 <p>After three days passed, they had to enter the palace to meet the Imperial Concubine. She presumed Mu Xiang would not dare carry out the family’s punishment on her at this moment. Otherwise, when the moment came and her body was covered all over in scars and wounds, Mu Xiang would not meet with a good ending.</p>
 <p>Mu Lingzhu stood at a side, looking at the Mu Yunjin’s smile. Her fingers slightly tightened their grip. She wanted to speak, but she was once more stopped by Su Biqing. Su Biqing cast a sidelong glance at Mu Lingzhu, as she laughed, “Zhu'er, tomorrow is the annual Great Literary Competition of the Flowery Butterflies City. Presumably, there will be numerous elegant scholars who will gather there. You have been the top ranked scholar for the past three years. Therefore, this year, you must not disappoint your Father and Mother.”</p>
 <p>Su Biqing’s words fell as she she swept a glance over Mu Xiang and Mu Yunjin again.</p>
 <p>The moment Mu Xiang heard of the Great Literary Competition, his complexion somewhat eased. After shooting a glance at Mu Yunjin, who was still standing in the hall, he coldly bellowed &nbsp;“Why are you still standing here? Still not getting lost and going back to your Ascending Blossoms Pavilion?!”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin did not rebut, and after curling her lip, she walked out of the hall.</p>
 <p>When she returned to the Ascending Blossoms Pavilion, she saw Zi Xiang standing outside the door, her face full of anxiousness. When she saw Mu Yunjin’s figure, Zi Xiang immediately grinned and ran over.</p>
 <p>“Miss, you have finally returned.”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin poked Zi Xiang’s forehead as she laughed, “Look at you sweating so much. What were you panicking for?”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin smiled as she spoke, and walked inside.</p>
 <p>After she stepped into the room, Zi Xiang helped Mu Yunjin pour a cup of tea. After Mu Yunjin drank a sip, she spoke, “What can one gain from winning the Great Literary Competition of Flowery Butterfly City?</p>
 <p>“The Great Literary Competition is the competition that the citizens o Flowery Butterfly City look forward to the most because the person who chooses the questions is the current emperor. Thus, many scholars use this competition as a pretext to obtain the emperor’s recognition.</p>
 <p>“Ever since our Fourth Miss attended this competition, she has always been the first. Thus, it has also increased the splendor of the Mu family by quite a bit.”</p>
 <p>Zi Xiang spoke, radiant with delight. When she finished her last sentence, she subconsciously covered her mouth and glanced at Mu Yunjin’s expression.</p>
 <p>However, Mu Yunjin had closed her eyes as she listened to Zi Xiang’s words. Not taking it seriously at all.</p>
 <p>After quite a long time, Mu Yunjin sipped some more tea, as the corner of her mouth curved, “Since this competition is so fascinating, I have to go take a look at this tomorrow no matter what.”</p>
 <p>“Miss, you…” Zi Xiang’s eyes widened, and she was a bit afraid to continue.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin’s eyebrows rose, “Why are your eyes so big? Did I scare you?”</p>
 <p>Zi Xiang nodded.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin had a smile on her face, as she amusedly looked at Zi Xiang and sighed, “Having so little courage is not a good thing.”</p>
