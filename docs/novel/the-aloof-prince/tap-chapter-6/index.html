 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 6: Because I Hate Her</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Early in the morning of the next day.</p>
 <p>“Miss, you really want to go?” Zi Xiang wrinkled her brows, tightly grasping a dress in her hands.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin looked disapprovingly at Zi Xiang, reaching out her hand to grab the dress in Zi Xiang’s hands. Soon after, she unhurriedly dressed, “Right, I would like to go take a look at &nbsp;the exciting scene.”</p>
 <p>“Miss, even if you really want to go, shouldn’t you conceal yourself?” Zi Xiang looked at Mu Yunjin’s simple yet elegant adornments , as her pretty appearance showed completely . She felt a bit worried.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. In the past, I was confined to this Ascending Blossoms Pavilion all day long. No one will recognize me.” Mu Yunjin’s words fell, and she then pushed the door of the bedroom, walking out quickly.</p>
 <p>Zi Xiang immediately chased out after her , but outside of her bedroom, Mu Yunjin’s figure was already long gone.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin quietly jumped over the stone wall from Ascending Blossoms Pavilion. Her motions were very quick and nimble. She did not alert any of the guards in the residence.</p>
 <p>After she got out of the residence, Mu Yunjin took out from her sleeves, a veil that she had prepared earlier. She used it to cover her face, and quickened her pace to head towards the bustling area nearby.</p>
 <p>After a short while, she reached the Cultural Building where the Literary Competition was going to be held today.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin stood in front of the Cultural Building for awhile. After a period of time, the people who entered and left were many, and they were gossiping non stop…</p>
 <p>“Brother Lin, I’ve already converted my silver, this year I still want to bet that Fourth Miss Mu will win. My profits were even double the previous year!”</p>
 <p>“Of course, Fourth Miss Mu is Xiyuan Nation’s number one talented Miss, even winning three times in a row. This time will she will surely continue to win.”</p>
 <p>“……”</p>
 <p>After listening to this, Mu Yunjin had pretty much figured things out and so she followed them into the Cultural Building.</p>
 <p>Stepping into the Cultural Building, she saw an elevated fighting arena in the centre. The fighting arena was surrounded by a sea of people, and after Mu Yunjin surveyed the place she decided to walk towards the gambling area.</p>
 <p>When she walked to the gambling area, she saw a middle aged man standing there. After he saw Mu Yunjin, he beamed at her, “ Young Miss, I assume this is your first time coming to observe this Literary Competition?”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin nodded her head silently.</p>
 <p>That middle aged man continued to smile as he said while pointing towards the gambling pot, “Look at these two pots. One represents Fourth Sister Mu and the silver inside is so full that it is almost going to overflow. The other pot is still quite empty.”</p>
 <p>“This is the Young Miss’s first time here, and if you really want to gamble, an experienced person will definitely recommend that you place your bets in this one.” The middle aged man said as he pointed at the pot full of silver.</p>
 <p>When Mu Yunjin heard this, she smiled and her eyes flashed with disdain. After this, without thinking about it, she took her purse from her waist and threw the entire thing into the empty pot.</p>
 <p>“<i>Crash</i>…” the purse of silver was flung into the empty pot with a large noise, attracting the attention of the spectators.</p>
 <p>“Young Miss, could it be that you don’t believe my words?” The middle aged man was quite surprised and forced a smile on his face with a bit of displeasure.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin smirked as she hugged her arms, saying extremely calmly, “It’s not that I don’t believe you, it’s just that I feel that Mu Lingzhu will not be able to win today.”</p>
 <p>“Tch, ignorant child, you will cry later on.” The middle aged man was speechless as he turned his head, refusing to speak to Mu Yunjin anymore.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin’s actions made many people stare at her. With Mu Yunjin covering up her face, many people had heard what the middle aged man had said and had indeed taken Mu Yunjin to be an ignorant child.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>At this moment, in the private room on the second level, sat a person clad in purple flowery clothes. He looked unenthusiastically down at Mu Yunjin, his eyes flashing with an unknown light, as he started to ponder.</p>
 <p>“Ding Xian, who do you think this prince should bet on?”</p>
 <p>After the man called Ding Xian was called, he immediately lowered his waist and said, “Your Highness has yet to bet on anyone, I assume that it is because you have other plans.”</p>
 <p>Downstairs, Mu Yunjin hugged her arms as she returned to stroll around. She faintly felt that there were a pair of eyes watching her, causing her to feel uncomfortable.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Mu Yunjin stopped walking and looked towards the second level. It happened that her gaze met that pair of eagle-like eyes, and Mu Yunjin had the feeling of wanting to tremble in fear.</p>
 <p>“Have you looked long enough?” Mu Yunjin took the initiative and asked, lightly raising her eyebrows, and her eyes &nbsp;completely devoid of any fear.</p>
 <p>At this time, the competition had yet to start. The place was completely rowdy and Mu Yunjin was unable to confirm whether or not the person upstairs was able to hear what she said.</p>
 <p>“What if I haven’t looked long enough?” The voice that came from upstairs carried with it a certain chill.</p>
 <p>When Mu Yunjin heard the reply, she squinted her eyes and increased the length of her strides to head towards the place on the second level.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin had just stepped on the last step that led to the second floor, when she saw a purple clothed man sitting there. She only saw his side profile, but it made Mu Yunjin think of the term “unparalleled beauty”.</p>
 <p>Next to the purple clothed man stood a man that looked like a guard. But based off of Mu Yunjin’s experiences fighting against terrorism in her past life, she felt that in the surroundings, she could sense that there were many hidden guards concealing themselves.</p>
 <p>The purple clothed man before her eyes seemed like he was not a simple person.</p>
 <p>“You don’t dare get closer to me?” The purple clothed man saw Mu Yunjin standing at the edge of the stairwell, motionless, so he opened his mouth slightly, his eyes deep and bottomless.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin smiled weakly and shook her head. She walked slowly over, bluntly sitting down on another chair at the other end of the table. When she looked down, she soon cried out in surprise, “Wow, this seat is really not bad. One can see everything happening below clearly and distinctly.”</p>
 <p>When Ding Xian saw this, he was just about to step forward to block her, when he was stopped with a glance from the purple clothed man. After that, he could only stand in his original place. He paused before opening his mouth, “This Young Miss, why did you not bet that the Fourth Young Miss of the Mu Family would win?”</p>
 <p>“Why would I bet that she would win?” Mu Yunjin answered a question with a question.</p>
 <p>Ding Xian was thrown off, and he looked at the man in purple, but he saw that he was currently sipping some light tea. He appeared not to be listening to his conversation with Mu Yunjin anymore.</p>
 <p>Thus, he asked again, “The Fourth Young Miss of the Mu family has won for three consecutive years. This fourth year, the possibility of victory is very big.”</p>
 <p>“She won’t be winning today.” Mu Yunjin looked down to the elevated stage, and the corner of her mouth slightly curved, revealing a confident smile.</p>
 <p>“Why?” Ding Xian curiously opened his mouth again.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin laughed, and cast a glance at Ding Xian, “Because I hate her.”</p>
 <p>Ding Xian was completely speechless towards Mu Yunjin. He shut his mouth and did not speak to Mu Yunjin again.</p>
 <p>“Ding Xian, go place a bet.” At that time, a flash appeared in the eyes of the purple clothed man as he spoke indifferently.</p>
 <p>Ding Xian was thrown off again. But he immediately responded and ran down the stairs.</p>
 <p>After a short moment, the sound of money dropping into the empty pot was heard again. Once more, this made many people stop walking to stand in a circle and watch.</p>
