 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 7: Stepping in to Destroy</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>A peal of sighing sounds came from below. Originally, they were certain that there would not be any idiots that would not bet for Mu Lingzhu but in just a short while, two had appeared.</p>
 <p>Anger began to develop in the hearts of the people from Mu Xiang’s residence, especially those who were already sitting downstairs. As of now, Mu Xiang was already seated in the position that was most centric to the elevated stage. When he saw that people had put money into the empty basin, he subconsciously looked towards the second floor.</p>
 <p>However, right at that moment, the second floor had just so happened to put down its muslim covering veil. One could only faintly see a man and a woman sitting there. No one could see anything else.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, ignorant fools!” Mu Xiang coldly huffed, and immediately drank a cup of tea, waiting for the competition to begin.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>On the second floor, Mu Yunjin could clearly hear the burst of anger that came from Mu Xiang downstairs. Her pair of eyes slightly bent, but she maintained her smiling expression.</p>
 <p>“It seems you do not only hate Mu Lingzhu.” At the other side, an apathetic yet probing voice was heard.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin heard this, and her eyebrows slightly raised. Soon after, she unrestrainedly picked up a piece of osmanthus flowers cake [1] on the table, and raised her veil a little to eat a bit of the cake.</p>
 <p>“Mmm the flavor is not bad.”</p>
 <p>At the side, Ding Xian stood there, his mouth slightly curving. He subconsciously looked at his neglected Master. His heart lamented, <i>Where did this strange girl come from?</i></p>
 <p>When he was just about to remind Mu Yunjin to conduct herself better, he saw that Mu Yunjin had turned her head towards his own Master. Her lips were gentle as they opened like petals, “You didn’t bet for Mu Lingzhu either. Thus, do you also hate people from the Mu family?”</p>
 <p>Towards the man in front of her, Mu Yunjin was a little curious. He had hidden many guards all around them, and this made her guarded at all moments. She didn’t dare thoroughly relax.</p>
 <p>“It has begun.”</p>
 <p>The indifferent voice came from the other end. Mu Yunjin’s peripheral vision glanced at the person beside her, as her eyes revealed a thread of disdain. He was so cold like a block of ice.</p>
 <p>If it weren’t for the fact that the view from the second floor was excellent, and did not attract attention, she would be disinclined to pay any attention to this person.</p>
 <p>She lost interest.</p>
 <p>Ding Xian wanted to throw this woman, who didn’t respect his Master down the stairs, but his Master didn’t seem to care if this woman stayed here. Thus, it was not good if he rashly added more to his tasks.</p>
 <p>Speaking of this, it was really strange. What play was his Master acting in? He actually let a woman like <i>that</i> sit here, and watch the competition with him? He had really met a demon.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Below, many people were already standing on the elevated stage. Mu Lingzhu stood in the center-most position, a sweet-tempered smiling expression on her face. Her eyes revealed pride and arrogance.</p>
 <p>“We have arrived at our Great Literary Competition. The topic that the Emperor shall bestow today is ‘Wise Monarchs’. Please follow your order and give your viewpoints. The person remaining at the end will be first in the whole competition.”</p>
 <p>The words of the old man, who was hosting the Great Literary Competition finished, and an excited crowd gathered below the stage, forming a dense mass.</p>
 <p>On the second floor, when Mu Yunjin heard the topic, she coldly jeered. Her fingers lightly rapped against the tabletop, somewhat impatient.</p>
 <p>She originally thought it would be a wonderful topic, but it turned out that they were competing in boot-licking!</p>
 <p>She had overestimated this competition.</p>
 <p>However, in coming here today, she did not come to simply watch the competition. She had things to do.</p>
 <p>She stopped thinking about the competition, and Mu Yunjin wryly laughed. From her sleeve, she took out a pouch that she had already prepared beforehand and slowly opened it.</p>
 <p>From within, she took out a white colored pill, and a slingshot.</p>
 <p>All of Mu Yunjin’s movements were completely taken in by the man beside her. His pupils that were as black as jade, slightly stirred.</p>
 <p>After she took the pill and fastened it into the slingshot, Mu Yunjin lightly pulled at it, holding the slingshot firmly. She pointed it at Mu Lingzhu, who stood there, and took aim.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>At that moment, on the elevated stage on the first floor, a few elegant scholars, who came from the past competition, were currently relating all their knowledge, one after another about ‘Wise Monarchs’. Right when Mu Lingzhu was about to open her mouth, no one noticed that from within the muslim canopy on the second floor, a little spherical object flew out.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin flung the white pill out right before Mu Lingzhu was about to speak. That pill accurately hit Mu Lingzhu’s body. From the original spherical shaped pill, it instantly changed into a pile of fine powder, sprinkling over Mu Lingzhu’s body.</p>
 <p>After hearing the original topic that the person before her had elaborated on, she was about to smile and begin speaking when suddenly the space between her eyebrows furrowed, and she began to crazily use her hands to itch at her own face and her neck. Apparently, it wasn’t only a momentary craze. Soon after, she pulled out her own comb from her orderly hairstyle, to exert all her strength to use her two hands to itch her own scalp.</p>
 <p>“Ahh…….”</p>
 <p>“So itchy……”</p>
 <p>Mu Lingzhu cried out in fear. The audience members below, opened their eyes wide, as they watched. Seeing the scene in front of them, what was wrong with this Young Lady from the Mu family?</p>
