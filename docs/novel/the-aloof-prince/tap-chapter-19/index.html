 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 19: Name Your Price</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>The moment those people saw Mu Yunjin, practically all of their eyes brightened. In their hearts, they yelled, <i>This girl is so pretty like a fairy. If……</i></p>
 <p>Those robbers became more and more excited. Among them, the gang leader of the robbers suddenly laughed loudly and pointed at Mu Yunjin, “Today we have finally picked up a great advantage. Hurry, let’s take this lady back.”</p>
 <p>“Leader, then what about this one?” Among them, one person pointed at Mu Lingzhu who leaned against the carriage.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Mu Lingzhu’s face was no longer as afraid as in the beginning. While Mu Yunjin’s back was towards her, she even threw a meaningful glance at the robbers.</p>
 <p>The leader of the robbers looked at her and nodded. The two people reached a common understanding.</p>
 <p>“With such a pretty girl, why would we need that one?” The leader of the robbers suddenly got off his horse, evilly laughing as he walked towards Mu Yunjin.</p>
 <p>“What shall I do? I can’t resist; I want to have you right now!” The leader of the robbers walked in front of Mu Yunjin and began to undress himself.</p>
 <p>Nearby, a few robbers chuckled and got into a circle, “Leader, wasn’t that carriage specially offered to you as a big prize?”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, you’re absolutely right!”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin heard these perverted words, and looked at Mu Lingzhu and Hong Xia again, who now had expressions of rejoicing in someone else’s misfortune and calamity. Mu Yunjin coldly hmphed.</p>
 <p>The dagger within her sleeve was ready to appear at any moment. Mu Yunjin warmed her neck up, and a blood-thirsty murdering flash appeared in her eyes.</p>
 <p>It had been so long since she had last made a move. Her hands were itching for action.</p>
 <p>“Come, little wife. Let this old gentleman show you what is heaven, hehehe.” The leader of the robbers extended his hand and right when he was about to grab Mu Yunjin’s shoulder, all he &nbsp;saw was Mu Yunjin take her hand and grab his wrist. Immediately, peals of pain burst through his wrist.</p>
 <p>The gangleader immediately retracted his hand. When he looked at his wrist, he found there was nothing strange about it, so he thought the pain from a moment ago was just a coincidence.</p>
 <p>But when he extended his hand again…..</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin saw that the moment was most about opportune, so she didn’t feel like wasting her time with these robbers. Her dagger was already revealed, and right when she prepared herself to begin killing, a masked man, clothed in black appeared from a mysterious place, moving quickly in midair, as a concealed weapon flew from the crack in between his fingers.</p>
 <p>Immediately, screams burst everywhere. The originally swaggering bandits fell on the ground, crying.</p>
 <p>As Mu Yunjin was trying to guess where this man had appeared from, the man in black grabbed her hand and flew away from this quarrelling place.</p>
 <p>“Miss, what shall we do?” Hong Xia couldn't anticipate that this scene would have occurred either, and stood beside Mu Lingzhu as she spoke.</p>
 <p>Mu Lingzhu pursed her lip as she looked at the robbers on the ground. She unhappily spoke, “Cao Pan, you may first bring them away. Do not leave any traces behind.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, Fourth Miss.”</p>
 <p>---</p>
 <p>The man in black brought Mu Yunjin to a small stream. Right when she wanted to ask the man in black of his origins, she noticed a white jade-ish figure &nbsp;who stood next to the creek.</p>
 <p>That figure only revealed his side face, making Mu Yunjin feel a coldness and alienation that emitted from her surroundings.</p>
 <p>Thus, she could only stop after she was a meter from the figure and touch her nose, “Chu, Sixth, Prince. What a coincidence meeting you right here.”</p>
 <p>Chu Li flicked his eyes over, his thin lips smoothing over, a deepness in his eyes. To Mu Yunjin, he replied with an affirmative sound.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin felt he was so boring, and refocused on the man in black behind her. At this time, the man in black had already pulled off the black fabric that masked his face. It was Ding Xian.</p>
 <p>Seeing this, Mu Yunjin laughed, “I really didn’t think that your martial arts would be so awesome! I truly admire it!”</p>
 <p>Because she had grown up in an anti-terrorist organization, she was exceptionally sensitive towards nimble and skilled people. Thus, Mu Yunjin’s heart was inevitably admiring.</p>
 <p>Ding Xian choked, feeling embarrassed. He coughed and said, “Third Miss has overpraised me. My martial arts is not anything compared to that of His Highness’s.”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin heard this, and turned back at Chu Li. Then, she looked back at Ding Xian and pursed her lip as she embarrassedly said, “Right, how come you only saved me? My little sister is still there!”</p>
 <p>“What? His Highness only ordered me to save you……” Ding Xian touched his head. After Chu Li suddenly shot a glance at him, he closed his mouth.</p>
 <p>“You did awesome!” Mu Lingzhu gave Ding Xian a big thumbs up.</p>
 <p>Mu Lingzhu had been the one who found the robbers in the first place. Nothing would happen if they left her there, and saving her would waste human resources.</p>
 <p>Ding Xian saw this, and silently cursed, <i>The internal conflict in the residence really is pretty intense.</i></p>
 <p>From start to finish, Mu Yunjin had not heard Chu Li say one word. Thus, she was unwilling to stay at that place, but after she glanced around her unfamiliar surroundings, she found that she was at a loss.</p>
 <p>“Third Miss, this place is a bit far from the city. If we were to return, I’m afraid it would take us until dusk.” Ding Xian saw through Mu Yunjin’s thoughts and coldly spoke. He glanced again at his Master.</p>
 <p>When Mu Yunjin heard this, her brows furrowed, and her heart silently cursed at Mu Lingzhu for really knowing how to pick her location.</p>
 <p>“At night, someone will come to pick up His Highness. Third Miss, you should rest here, and in a moment, His Highness will go with you and return to the city.” Ding Xian spoke.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin pursed her lip and nodded. Afterwards, she walked towards a great tree and sat down, leaning against the tree as she began to rest for a bit.</p>
 <p>After she closed her eyes, Chu Li’s vision followed her, his eyes slightly narrowed as he silently appraised Mu Yunjin.</p>
 <p>She really was a thoughtless girl.</p>
 <p>Ding Xian saw his Master’s sight and couldn’t help but become speechless. He lowered his voice and said, “Your Highness, Third Miss’s jade pendant is still with us. Do you want to find an opportunity to let her know?”</p>
 <p>When he brought up the jade pendant, Chu Li’s brows furrowed, and his countenance appeared uncomfortable. His thin lips slightly pursed, inwardly sighing.</p>
 <p>He had never felt like taking someone else’s belongings before.</p>
 <p>But that jade pendant……</p>
 <p>When Ding Xian saw this, his heart also felt it was a pity, as he glanced at Mu Yunjin who lay under the tree.</p>
 <p>---</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin didn’t know how long she had slept before she was shaken awake. Looking at the sky, she saw that it had already passed noon.</p>
 <p>“Are we returning to the city now?” Mu Yunjin sat up, looking at Ding Xian who had woken her up. Then, she looked at the carriage, of which she did not know when it had gotten there.</p>
 <p>Ding Xian nodded, “Yes, Third Miss, hurry up.”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin got up, and walked towards the carriage. Ding Xian followed behind her. Originally, he wanted to support her up the carriage, but he saw that Mu Yunjin had casually jumped in, and gotten into the carriage.</p>
 <p>Ding Xian stood where he was, his heart feeling strange.</p>
 <p>The moment Mu Yunjin entered the carriage, she felt a dark and heavy atmosphere. She glanced at Chu Li who was already in carriage. Mu Yunjin pursed her lip, suddenly feeling that returning to the city with this person was also a type of torment.</p>
 <p>Thus, after she tugged at her lips and smiled to Chu Li, she leaned against the carriage and closed her eyes, pretending to rest.</p>
 <p>“In the Cultural Building, the veiled girl sitting next to this prince was you, right?”</p>
 <p>Chu Li’s voice suddenly rang in the carriage. His thin lips curved, his eyes lighting up with interest.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin who was leaning against the carriage, suddenly startled. Afterwards she opened her eyes and boldly admitted it, smiling, “Sure enough, Sixth Prince is incredible. I could not hide it from you.”</p>
 <p>Thus, that day when she entered the palace as the Third Miss of the Mu family, Chu Li had already known she was the girl from the Cultural Building.</p>
 <p>She stopped thinking about it, as Mu Yunjin stroked her neck, curling her lips. She angrily cursed, <i>Why did you even keep up the act and fight her!</i></p>
 <p>“It was not that this prince was incredible. Instead, this prince found one of your belongings.” After Chu Li said this, he took out the moon-white jade pendant in his palm.</p>
 <p>When Mu Yunjin saw the jade pendant, her eyes immediately flashed, as she yelled, surprised, “I’ve looked for this for so long. It turns out, you &nbsp;found it.”</p>
 <p>Right when she was about to grab the jade pendant, Chu Li closed his palm, putting the jade pendant within his hands.</p>
 <p>“What?” Mu Yunjin did not understand Chu Li’s meaning.</p>
 <p>“Name your price. This prince wants the jade pendant.” A coldness flashed in Chu Li’s eyes as he iterated his words calmly, looking at Mu Yunjin.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin could not understand what Chu Li would need it for. Even though she had heard Zi Xiang say that this pendant was worth ten thousand gold pieces, Chu Li was the Sixth Prince. He had seen all types of valuable things, so why was he so fixed on her jade pendant?</p>
 <p>In addition, that jade pendant even had her name on it.</p>
 <p>“What if I don’t sell it?” Mu Yunjin smiled, as she cocked her brow.</p>
 <p>When Chu Li heard this, his face that had warmed up a bit, immediately darkened. His complexion immediately closed up, and she couldn’t tell what he was thinking. The atmosphere in the carriage immediately went down by several degrees.</p>
 <p>“Hey, I was just kidding. How come you’re like a child? Your temper comes when it wants.” Mu Yunjin took the moment to speak, smiling at Chu Li.</p>
 <p>Afterwards, she extended three fingers to Chu Li, “Thirty thousand gold pieces, and not a single less.”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjun said as she smiled lightly.</p>
 <p>Zi Xiang had already said that jade pendant was worth ten thousand gold and she merely increased its price by a little bit. She wasn’t going overboard, right!</p>
 <p>In any case, with regards to her, that jade pendant was really useless. She might as well take advantage of the situation to raise a good price to save half of it and spend the other half on clothes and food to pass the time!</p>
 <p>When she thought about this, Mu Yunjin felt that she was really too wise!</p>
 <p>“Okay, it’s a deal.” Chu Li straightforwardly agreed before smiling indifferently, “Three days later, this prince will send thirty thousands gold pieces to you without tarry.”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Chu Li agreed so straightforwardly, Mu Yunjin felt a bit hesitant and could not help but to feel increasingly curious about that jade pendant, “Why are you so attached to that jade pendant?”</p>
 <p>“You don’t need to know.” Chu Li’s face was a little unnatural, and he had a kind of expression that she could not read.</p>
 <p>When Mu Yunjin saw this, she had a smile that was not quite a smile, but she could not be bothered to be tangled up with whatever Chu Li had to do with the jade pendant. She began to think about returning to the residence in a moment and how she would teach Mu Lingzhu a lesson.</p>
 <p>She always believed that if others did not provoke her, she would not provoke others. Since Mu Lingzhu had decided to scheme against her today, she would definitely find a way to call her to account for it.</p>
 <p>After thinking over it for awhile, when Mu Yunjin’s gaze landed on Chu Li, who was standing beside her, the tip of her brow raised slightly and she started to scheme in her heart.</p>
 <p>When one wanted to kill a snake, they had to hit it where it mattered, at the seventh inch. Mu Lingzhu’s seventh inch was Chu Li, right?</p>
 <p>“Sixth Prince, you’ve rescued Yunjin today and Yunjin is incomparably grateful. In order to show my thanks, why don’t we head back to the residence and eat together?</p>
 <p>When Chu Li heard Mu Yunjin’s voice, his gaze which held hidden meaning landed on her body. After a moment, an idea flashed through his eyes.</p>
 <p>After hesitating a moment, she heard Chu Li open his mouth to say gently, “Ding Xian, head to the residence.”</p>
 <p>Upon Chu Li’s agreement, Mu Yunjin could not help but to become increasingly curious about the significance the jade pendant had towards Chu Li. Could it be that Chu Li was afraid that she would go back on her word that he would even agree to her invitation?</p>
 <p>This appeared to be different from the Sixth Prince in the rumors.</p>
