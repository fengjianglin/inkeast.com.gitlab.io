 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 3: Who Allowed you to go outside</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>When she saw Mu Lingzhu support Mu Xiarou out of the Ascending Blossoms Pavilion, Zi Xiang pinched herself savagely. When she realised that this wasn’t a dream, she looked at Mu Yunjin with eyes filled with shock.</p>
 <p>“Miss, you…” Zi Xiang walked closer to Mu Yunjin speechlessly.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin opened her eyes wider, “If you have something to say then say it.”</p>
 <p>Zi Xiang pursed her lips, silent for a period of time before she could not hold it back anymore, “Miss, you never used to contradict Fourth and Fifth sister, allowing...”</p>
 <p>Allowing them to bully you.</p>
 <p>Zi Xiang stopped talking, not daring to say a single word more.</p>
 <p>Of course Mu Yunjin knew what Zi Xiang was going to say next, so she smirked and stretched forth a hand to pat Zi Xiang on her shoulder, “I was truly stupid in the past, that’s why I just sat there and let the two of them bully me.”</p>
 <p>“While we’re on this topic, although Father has been enduring me, no matter what, I am still the eldest daughter of the Mu Family. How can it ever be acceptable for them to bully me?!”</p>
 <p>“Today was just to give them a bit of a lesson. If it looks as if they dare to continue bullying me in the future, I will definitely rip their flesh from their bones.”</p>
 <p>This one sentence from Mu Yunjin thorougly astonished Zi Xiang. She glanced over at Mu Yunjin and felt that something about her had definitely changed, except that she was unable to pinpoint what it was.</p>
 <p>However, now that Miss knew how to retaliate, it was definitely good news.</p>
 <p>“Oh right, what is Imperial Concubine Qin like?” Mu Yunjin asked. &nbsp;She was just going to stand up and walk out of the bedroom when she suddenly stopped in her tracks, turning her head to look towards Zi Xiang.</p>
 <p>Zi Xiang was stumped, her gaze revealing astonishment once again, “Miss, do you not remember Imperial Concubine Qin?”</p>
 <p>Mu Yun Jin smiled lightly. Although she had some memories from this body, they were only fragments. How would she know this kind of detail?</p>
 <p>“I’m afraid that Aunty Su &nbsp;used the Confusion Incense on me last night in order to sneak into my room, causing me to suffer some repercussions.” Mu Yunjin said helplessly as she massaged her temples.</p>
 <p>Zi Xiang nodded her head and walked to Mu Yunjin’s side. She supported Mu Yunjin as she sat down and poured tea for her.</p>
 <p>“Imperial Concubine Qin is the birth mother of the current Emperor. Her status is lower that the Empress Dowager, but she is able to be on equal footing with the current Empress Dowager.” Zi Xiang said softly.</p>
 <p>“Is her relationship with me very good? She even bestowed this jasper hairpin on me.” Mu Yunjin took off the jasper hairpin from her hair and examined it in her palm.</p>
 <p>Zi Xiang sighed lightly when she saw that Mu Yunjin had really completely forgotten everything from her past, but she still explained everything in full detail.</p>
 <p>“Imperial Concubine Qin used to be good sisters with the Madam of the Mu residence back when she was younger, so now that she has a grandson- Sixth Prince, she wants to build a connection with the Mu residence through your marriage.</p>
 <p>“So, Miss being the eldest daughter of the Mu Residence, would definitely gain the favor of Imperial Concubine Qin.”</p>
 <p>After listening to what Zi Xiang had said, Mu Yunjin's eyebrows creased together, “Since Imperial Concubine Qin likes me so much, how can Father be so daring as to confine me to this place? Is is not afraid that Imperial Concubine Qin will punish him?”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin was a bit puzzled, but she had pretty much understood what was happening.</p>
 <p>It turns out that this body was someone who has already been betrothed to someone. Furthermore, it was the Sixth Prince.</p>
 <p>When Zi Xiang heard what Mu Yunjin had said, her small face fell. She stamped her feet and said in a low voice, “Miss, the Master has managed to conceal it well. Imperial Concubine Qin, has no idea that you have been confined.”</p>
 <p>“Oh?” When Mu Yunjin heard this, she immediately exclaimed excitedly, “So you’re saying that I have absolutely no reason to fear my father’s confinement orders.”</p>
 <p>After saying this, Mu Yunjin increased her pace and walked outside of the Ascending Blossoms pavilion.</p>
 <p>Zi Xiang was completely shocked and she rushed up, holding on tightly to Mu Yunjin, “Miss, don’t run around recklessly. If the Master knew about it, you would be subject to the family law.”</p>
 <p>“Family law?” Mu Yunjin raised her eyebrows, “Let him try!”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin had finished speaking and she didn’t care about Zi Xiang’s nagging. She walked outside Ascending Blossoms Pavilion while Zi XIang’s face was a sheet of white and was completely filled with worry.</p>
 <p>Miss had only suffered under the Confusion Incense for a short period of time, how did her entire character change completely? If the Lord of the manor caught Miss walking out of the Ascending Blossoms Pavilion recklessly, there would be no end of trouble!</p>
 <p>Even though she was thinking this way, Zi Xiang still followed behind Mu Yunjin.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin walked out of the Ascending Blossoms Pavilion with large strides. However, when she had not taken more than a few steps out of the Pavilion, the family servants that were all around the place saw Mu Yunjin’s silhouette. Some strange expressions appeared on their faces but they did not dare to say anything.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin had good hearing ability. When she had walked past a few of these family servants, she had heard them whispering.</p>
 <p>“Where is Mu Lingzhu’s residence?” Mu Yunjin asked.</p>
 <p>Zi Xiang paused for a moment then pointed West, “In the Pearl Building.”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin heard this and raised her eyebrows. Pearl Building versus Ascending Blossoms Pavilion; how biased.</p>
 <p>“You should go back first. I want to walk around alone.” Mu Yunjin said towards Zi Xiang.</p>
 <p>Zi Xiang was shocked. She had wanted to say something but looking at Mu Yunjin, she still nodded her head and walked back. She still was quite worried as she said, “Miss, you must be careful. You definitely cannot be reckless.”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin smiled and nodded.</p>
 <p>When Zi Xiang had left, Mu Yunjin walked towards the bustling area in front of her. She had initially thought that the Ascending Blossoms Pavilion where she lived &nbsp;was not bad, but in looking at the Building’s Courtyard in front of her, she knew that the place that she lived in was nothing more than &nbsp;a doghouse.</p>
 <p>When she had entered the door to one of the courtyards, Mu Yunjin suddenly heard an indistinct voice coming from inside...</p>
 <p>“Mother, in three more months, your daughter will soon reach the marriageable age of 15. At that time, the palace will call for elder sister to marry the Sixth Prince. How is this all right?”</p>
 <p>Mu Lingzhu’s voice transmitted out from the inside.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin heard Mu Lingzhu’s voice and stopped in her tracks. She leaned on the door to listen to what the voices inside were saying.</p>
 <p>“Zhu'er [1]<i>,</i> do not worry about these kind of things, leave it to Mother to think of something.” A middle-aged woman’s voice was also heard.</p>
 <p>“Mother, you also know, this daughter entered the palace and saw the Sixth Prince when she was just eight years old. Ever since then, her heart has always longed for him . It’s already been eight years. It’s a pity that you were late in giving birth to me. If you had strived to give birth of me before elder sister, I would be the eldest daughter of the Mu Clan.” Mu Lingzhu’s miserable voice carried outside.</p>
 <p>Outside, Mu Yunjin carefully pondered over what Mu Lingzhu had said. She finally understood the reason why Mu Lingzhu had dared to get Aunty Su to get rid of her.</p>
 <p>It turned out that only if she died would Mu Lingzhu be able to become the eldest daughter of the Mu family and marry the Sixth Prince.</p>
 <p>What a vicious girl. Just for the sake of marrying a man, she would actually kill off her blood sister. This Mu LIngzhu really wasn’t human.</p>
 <p>“Disgraceful thing, who allowed you to go outside!”</p>
 <p>--</p>
