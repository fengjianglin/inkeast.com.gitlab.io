 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 10: Entering the Palace to Attend a Banquet</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Going to Pearl Pavilion at this time, it could be considered that Mu Yunjin got an unexpected profit. Originally, she only wanted to talk glibly with Mu Lingzhu and make a few cutting remarks. But who knew that this mother-daughter pair would think of new ways to harm her?</p>
 <p>However, she was pretty curious. Was she really Su Biqing’s blood-related daughter?</p>
 <p>As the saying goes, ‘Although a tiger is cruel, it will not devour its cubs’ [1], so how was it possible that Su Biqing could do something like this to her own flesh and blood?</p>
 <p>Some other day, she would have to carefully look into this.</p>
 <p>As she returned to Ascending Blossoms Pavilion, Mu Yunjin came across quite a few of the old servants who had come together to whisper amongst themselves. But Mu Yunjin’s listening ability was excellent, so she still heard some information from within……</p>
 <p>“I heard Second Young Master’s wounds are pretty heavy. In the future, he won’t be able to have sex.”</p>
 <p>“For real? It’s unexpectedly that serious. Then we must continue to burn incense in front of the temple for this Mu family, otherwise, wouldn’t Eldest Young Master be the only one left?”</p>
 <p>“Don’t mention it. As of now, that Second Madam has already cried until she’s practically blind. The Master angrily wanted to kill the perpetrator, but it’s a pity they can’t find him.”</p>
 <p>“Hey, that really is too bad. It seems that someone sincerely wants to set himself or herself against the Mu family.”</p>
 <p>Hearing this news, Mu Yunjin bit her lip, restraining her smile. She sped up and returned to Ascending Blossoms Pavilion.</p>
 <p>Zi Xiang saw that Mu Yunjin had come back unscathed, and immediately released her breath. Concerned, she spoke, “Miss, you left so hastily. You didn’t even eat anything. You’re hungry now, right?”</p>
 <p>“Huh? Why don’t you think that I ate at Pearl Pavilion?” Mu Yunjin blinked at Zi Xiang a bit curious.</p>
 <p>“Miss, this servant has been by your side since you were little. This servant is most clear on how Fourth Young Lady and the Eldest/Great Madam treat you.” Zi Xiang bent her head down, her voice weak.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin heard what was said and immediately felt like this was true. She laughed and walked over to her room.</p>
 <p>A simple bowl of clear congee, as well as two side dishes, sat on the table inside the room. Mu Yunjin looked at the sky that was about to reach dusk. She then looked at the dishes on the table again.</p>
 <p>It seemed, the days were indeed not easy for this Third Young Lady of the Mu family.</p>
 <p>Ceasing her thoughts, Mu Yunjin grabbed a spoon and slowly began to eat.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The next day, the sun had just begun to shine. Mu Yunjin, who had been sleeping heavily, was lightly awoken by Zi Xiang. In her ear, she whispered, “Miss, today is the day you are to enter the palace to see Imperial Concubine Qin. You must not be late.”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin was very drowsy-eyed. Although, her sleepiness lingered on, she still obediently got out of bed and began to freshen up and dress herself.</p>
 <p>“Miss, what would you like to wear?” Zi Xiang took two brocade dresses out of the wardrobe that could be considered presentable. She wore a smile as she allowed Mu Yunjin to choose one.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin looked at those two dresses full of decorative designs and their silk girdles, and she slightly knit her brows. She shook her head and sat up, instead choosing some relatively simple yet elegant clothes.</p>
 <p>“Miss, today you are to meet the Imperial Concubine in the palace. Wearing something so bland can’t be good right?” Zi Xiang looked at the clear green brocade dress that Mu Yunjin had taken out, and felt a bit astonished.</p>
 <p>It seemed that Mu Yunjin had not heard of Imperial Concubine Qin's reputation yet. After she wore the dress, she smiled to Zi Xiang, “Don’t worry about it. It’s best to wear simpler clothing. If any trouble arises, we can run out quickly.”</p>
 <p>“......” Zi Xiang choked on her words. Even though she wanted to continue speaking, it seemed she couldn’t find any words to retort with. Thus, she could only help her put her hair into a simple coil, following Mu Yunjin’s intent.</p>
 <p>After she finished making herself presentable, Mu Yunjin brought Zi Xiang as she walked towards the direction of the hall.</p>
 <p>When she had just gotten to the hall, Mu Yunjin saw that Mu Lingzhu was already standing there, wearing a pink hibiscus brocaded dress, with not a single hair out of place. On top, she wore several beaded and pearled hairpins.</p>
 <p>Mu Lingzhu shot a glance at the light Mu Yunjin, her eyes showing a trace of disdain. She rolled her eyes at Mu Yunjin and soon after, she moved her eyes away as if she had not seen her.</p>
 <p>“Fourth Young Lady, it’s getting late. We should set off.”</p>
 <p>After a short while, a lady of the house who looked quite motherly walked up. She spoke respectfully to Mu Lingzhu, while completely ignoring Mu Yunjin at the other side.</p>
 <p>Mu Lingzhu nodded and under the escort of a group of people, she walked over to the gate.</p>
 <p>“Miss, Imperial Concubine Qin obviously invited you primarily, while only inviting Fourth Young Lady secondarily, but how come the guest is acting as the host?” Zi Xiang looked at her neglected Miss, her heart secretly crying out against injustice.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin’s line of sight stopped on Mu Lingzhu’s rear view. Her lips curved up in a smile, “What you have said is correct. She is only the supplement.”</p>
 <p>When she finished speaking, she walked towards the Great Gate.</p>
 <p>Outside the residence, at this time, a red sandalwood carriage was stopped. With the support of the old lady, she sat inside the carriage. After seeing that Mu Lingzhu was settled, that old lady seemed like she did not see Mu Yunjin who had stepped out of the gate, and yelled at the coachman, “Let’s set off.”</p>
 <p>That coachman heard what was said, and picked up his horsewhip. When he was about to drive his vehicle, an impatient female voice yelled, “Hold on! Third Young Lady hasn’t gotten on the carriage yet!”</p>
 <p>Zi Xiang immediately dashed towards the coachman to stop him.</p>
 <p>When that old lady heard it, her mouth suddenly smiled, as she embarrassedly looked at the slowly approaching Mu Yunjin, “Oh, I have become old, and my memory is no good. I forgot that the Imperial Concubine Qin also invited Third Young Lady.”</p>
 <p>“As it turns out, Third Older Sister hasn’t gotten onto the carriage yet. Auntie Li, this is your negligence. In any case, today the Imperial Concubine Qin also invited Elder Sister.” The Mu Lingzhu sitting inside the carriage, pushed aside the curtain, protesting coquettishly to Auntie Li who was outside the carriage.</p>
 <p>“Right, Fourth Young Lady has spoken correctly. This old servant is indeed getting on with her years, so my memory is a bit bad. However, who was the one who prohibited the Third Young Lady from riding on the precious red sandalwood carriage in the residence? I cannot think of anyone at this moment, so it can only be considered pardonable.”</p>
 <p>Mu Lingzhu heard what was said and slightly curved her lip, laughing with contempt, “Right, Auntie is right. I believe that older sister won’t bicker with Auntie.”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin heard the master and servant singing a duet and putting on a show [2], and the corner of her mouth curved, as her eyes were gradually suffused with chilliness.</p>
 <p>If she didn’t properly teach this servant dog a lesson, who threatened others based on her master’s power, she wouldn't be Mu Yunjin.</p>
 <p>“Zi Xiang, what is the time at this moment?” Mu Yunjin opened her mouth suddenly, turning to Zi Xiang.</p>
 <p>Zi Xiang bowed slightly, and spoke, “It is only a short time before <i>chenshi</i> (7-9am).”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin nodded, focusing her attention on Auntie Li. Soon after, like she was making an unreasonable scene, she spoke, “Imperial Concubine Qin ordered that younger sister and I have an audience with her at <i>chenshi</i>. This is great. There is no time left. You know how Imperial Concubine Qin will punish younger sister and me!”</p>
 <p>“Third Young Lady, this……” Facing a Mu Yunjin who suddenly displayed her temper, she was a bit unable to respond. But chilliness flashed through Mu Yunjin’s eyes, unexpectedly making her shiver.</p>
 <p>“I remember what Father said. If you do something wrong, you must be punished. Today, you caused little sister and I to be late. The correct punishment should be to slap you ten times.” When Mu Yunjin’s words fell, she didn’t wait for Auntie Li to speak, and directly took the palm of her hand and fanned it back and forth over her face.</p>
 <p>Her strength was vigorous, and Auntie Li had not stood firm, so she immediately fell on the ground, seeing stars. Really, she had almost been knocked out by Mu Yunjin’s slap.</p>
 <p>When Mu Yunjin prepared her second slap, Auntie Li was so afraid, she recoiled, “Third Young Lady, it was this old servant’s wrong. You must hurry and go, otherwise we will really be late.”</p>
 <p>“Hmph, I’ll return to count your debts. If today, Imperial Concubine Qin punishes me and little sister, I will come back and beat you to death!”</p>
 <p>When her words fell, Mu Yunjin stepped on the carriage.</p>
 <p>Auntie Li sat on the floor. When she saw Mu Yunjin get on the carriage, she mouthed, “Bah! A little lowly hussy like you can speak so coarsely. How are you even a little bit soft and tactful like Fourth Young Lady?!”</p>
 <p>Mu Lingzhu leaned against the carriage with her eyebrows creased. She incessantly rubbed her temples.</p>
 <p>From beginning to end, the scene between Mu Yunjin and Auntie Li just now was impossible to get rid of in her brain . She couldn’t help but feel how humiliating it was to be seen &nbsp;together with the idiot.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin leaned on the other side of the carriage, sizing up Mu Lingzhu. When she saw that her face still had some scars that could be seen, she had no choice but to become curious again about the so-called 6th Prince.</p>
 <p>What kind of a person was he, to make Mu Lingzhu want to go to the palace, even though her face was injured?</p>
 <p>“Mu Yunjin, you better keep in mind, after we enter the Palace, speak less, you hear me?” Mu Lingzhu suddenly opened her mouth, her face full of annoyance as she looked at Mu Yunjin.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin slightly rose her brows, revealing an innocent face, “Why?”</p>
 <p>“Speaking less means, don’t humiliate our family, otherwise when we return, Father and Mother will definitely not spare you.” Mu Lingzhu said.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin slightly nodded, a smile on her face, “Speaking of Mother, yesterday what happened to her?”</p>
 <p>“Shut up!” Mu Lingzhu glared at Mu Yunjin. Then, she turned her head around, ignoring Mu Yunjin.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin pursed her lips, really wanting to laugh, but she still fiercely endured.</p>
 <p>She suddenly discovered that these types of days filled with acting stupid and staring blankly were also pretty fun.</p>
 <p>A long time had not passed before the carriage stopped in front of the palace.</p>
 <p>After Mu Yunjin and Mu Lingzhu got out of the carriage, she found that two other carriages were parked outside the palace. Two girls left the carriage, their clothes fresh and beautiful. From their looks, she reckoned they belonged to an official’s family.</p>
 <p>“Elder sister Chang, elder sister Han……” Mu Lingzhu seemed like she knew those two girls. She walked past and expressed her goodwill to them .</p>
 <p>When the two people saw Mu Lingzhu, they slightly bowed their body, laughing afterwards, “Little Sister Lingzhu, we haven’t seen each other in such a long time. Today, you also received the invitation of Great Imperial Concubine Qin?”</p>
 <p>Mu Lingzhu nodded.</p>
 <p>Seeing this, the three people immediately formed an intimate group and walked towards the Palace doors.</p>
 <p>At this time at the Palace doorway, Imperial Concubine Qin had already arranged someone to escort them in. When she saw the girls come, she deferentially spoke, “Young Ladies, Imperial Concubine Qin has already set up a feast in the Plum Blossoms Main Hall. Please follow this old servant in.”</p>
 <p>After her words fell, the group followed the escort in.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin walked behind them. She saw the fake manner in which the three girls in front of her acted, and her heart felt out of sorts for awhile, so she couldn’t help but start walking slower and slower.</p>
 <p>The people in front of her did not slow, and eventually a distance was created between Mu Yunjin and them.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin was too lazy to chase after them, so she unhurriedly followed in the rear of them , looking around from time to time, appreciating the so-called Imperial Palace.</p>
 <p>When Mu Yunjin’s line of sight fell on a wall, she suddenly &nbsp;saw a black figure flip over it from the outside, with an extremely quick speed. If Mu Yunjin had not received special training, she would have thought that this was a figment of her imagination.</p>
 <p>Seeing this scene immediately aroused Mu Yunjin’s curiosity. She saw that there was someone who was already walking ahead of her, and immediately quietly ran over in the direction that the black figure had disappeared.</p>
 <p>After running for awhile, Mu Yunjin stopped in front of an abandoned palace hall. Looking around her, she did not see the black figure from just a moment ago.</p>
 <p>Right when she was about to leave, her earlobes slightly moved, as she heard tiny sounds come from within the palace hall…...</p>
