 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 15: Su Biqing is Injured.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>“I want to meet Mother. Please go in and notify her.”</p>
 <p>The moment Auntie Li heard Mu Yunjin’s words, her fury surged, and she spoke coldly and sarcastically, “Madam is resting. Third Miss should return at a later time.”</p>
 <p>“Are you going in to notify her or not? If you don’t go in, I’m going to report this to Imperial Concubine Qin next time and tell her you are bullying me. Imperial Concubine Qin said that in a few days I’ll be invited into the palace.” Mu Yunjin purposely brought out Imperial Concubine Qin as she provokingly looked at Auntie Li.</p>
 <p>Auntie Li immediately glared at Mu Yunjin, completely filled with anger but with nowhere to vent it. Her heart could only silently curse, <i>This lowly hussy actually climbed up Imperial Concubine Qin to go against her?</i></p>
 <p>This time, she unexpectedly rose, arrogant and willful.</p>
 <p>However, Imperial Concubine Qin wasn’t someone an old servant like her could offend. After thinking about it, Auntie Li still went in to report her arrival.</p>
 <p>After a moment, Auntie Li walked out, casting a sidelong glance at Mu Yunjin, “Madam is in the garden. You may go in.”</p>
 <p>After entering the courtyard effortlessly, Mu Yunjin walked towards the garden. She hadn’t walked &nbsp;a few steps when she saw Su Biqing sitting in the pavilion, a silk kerchief bound around her head, revealing only a pair of eyes.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin saw this, and her mouth slightly curved. Presumably this Fishtail Sunflower fruit made Su Biqing suffer sufficiently.</p>
 <p>“Mother.” Mu Yunjin faced Su Biqing and called her.</p>
 <p>Su Biqing looked over in the direction of Mu Yunjin, but she quickly flicked her eyes back, and irritably spoke, “You won’t obediently stay in Ascending Blossoms Pavilion. Why did you come over for me?”</p>
 <p>“Yunjin came to give Mother a valuable present.” Mu Yunjin laughed as she spoke, taking the porcelain bottle that Wei Hanqiao gave her, and placing it in front of Su Biqing like she was offering a treasure.</p>
 <p>Su Biqing suspiciously looked at that porcelain bottle. She really didn’t know what kind of &nbsp;treasure Mu Yunjin could have. Thus, she embarrassedly opened her mouth, “What is this?”</p>
 <p>“It is a beauty enhancing product. Reportedly, it can get rid of wrinkles. I’ve especially bought it for you Mother, to show my filial respect.” Mu Yunjin happily laughed.</p>
 <p>Su Biqing heard this and her sight landed on the porcelain bottle again. She reached out her hand and lightly took the bottle. Afterwards, she suspiciously opened the bottle and sniffed.</p>
 <p>In a flash, Mu Yunjin only saw Su Biqing’s eyes harden as she took her hand and unhesitatingly smashed the bottle on the floor. The bottle immediately split into pieces, expressing Su Biqing’s fury.</p>
 <p>“You shameful creature! Where did you get this? Do you want to kill me?” Su Biqing sat up, roaring at Mu Yunjin, her other hand preparing to slap her.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin immediately stepped back, hiding from Su Biqing’s palm. Afterwards, she bit her lip, revealing a surprised and frightened state, “Mother, what happened to you? Why are you so mad?”</p>
 <p>“Where did you get this?” Su Biqing glared at Mu Yunjin. Seeing her bewildered appearance, her anger surged up again.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin furrowed her brows, hesitating. After a while, she lowered her head, and cried as she opened her mouth, “Second Mother gave it to me.</p>
 <p>“She said that this was a beauty enhancing product. She wanted me to give it to Mother with my own name, and this way, Mother would be happy, and love Yunjin a bit more…..”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin spilled &nbsp;all the beans.</p>
 <p>Su Biqing heard this, slightly thrown off. When she looked at the powder on the floor, her fingers slightly tightened.</p>
 <p>She was too familiar with this powder.</p>
 <p><i>Fishtail Sunflower fruit</i>.</p>
 <p><i>However, how come Wei Hanqiao would have Fishtail Sunflower powder? According to reason, almost no one knew about Zhu’er getting injured due to this poison.</i></p>
 <p><i>Even she had just found out about its effects a few days ago.</i></p>
 <p><i>Could it be…...</i></p>
 <p>The person who poisoned Zhu’<i>er</i> was Wei Hanqiao?</p>
 <p>It was definitely her. Otherwise, how would Wei Hanqiao know that Zhu’<i>er</i> had been injured by Fishtail Sunflower powder when obviously no one else knew?</p>
 <p>All right, she had really travelled far and wide looking for something, only to find it easily, forcing her own Lord to look for so long, and yet never find the culprit.</p>
 <p>It turned out it was someone hiding within the residence.</p>
 <p><i>Wei Hanqiao, since you have the guts to recklessly harm my daughter, don’t blame me for being impolite</i>.</p>
 <p>“Mother……” Mu Yunjin saw Su Biqing’s furrowed brows in thought, so she called her softly.</p>
 <p>Su Biqing heard Mu Yunjin’s voice and felt irritated immediately. She yelled, “Idiot! You’ve been manipulated by someone else and you don’t even know it! If I hadn’t grown another heart, you would have to pull my corpse away!</p>
 <p>“Hurry up and get lost to your Ascending Blossoms Pavilion. Without an order, you are not allowed back!”</p>
 <p>“Yes, Mother.” Mu Yunjin pursed her lips, knowing her wrongs. Afterwards, she bowed to Su Biqing and walked out of the courtyard.</p>
 <p>After Mu Yunjin left, Su Biqing called Auntie Li over, casting a glance at the broken pieces on the floor. Her mouth curved up a bit more, “Auntie Li, tell my Lord Husband that something has happened to me……”</p>
 <p>“Yes, Madam!”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin quickly walked back into Ascending Blossoms Pavilion. Zi Xiang had just closed the door to Ascending Blossoms Pavilion when Mu Yunjin began to laugh.</p>
 <p>“Miss, how come you can even laugh after coming out? Just now, you made Madam so angry.” Zi Xiang couldn’t understand it as she looked at Mu Yunjin, who laughed until tears were about to come out of her eyes.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin looked at Zi Xiang with laughter in her eyes. She reached out her hand to touch her face, “In the past, I was bullied extremely miserably by Second Madam and Second Master, right?”</p>
 <p>Zi Xiang nodded.</p>
 <p>“This time, we found something to help us vent our frustrations. In a moment, you’ll see a great show. We’ve lived so miserably in this Ascending Blossoms Pavilion for so many years. It’s time to turn our lives around.”</p>
 <p>“As for the people in this residence, whoever made me unable to live in the past, I will now repay them doubly!”</p>
 <p>---</p>
 <p>Within Blue Sky Courtyard.</p>
 <p>By the time Mu Xiang hurried over, Su Biqing had laid on her bed, her face full of blood and scars. Her mouth wouldn’t stop bawling/howling. When she saw Mu Xiang, Su Biqing cried and yelled……</p>
 <p>“Lord Husband, you must help me!”</p>
 <p>The moment Mu Xiang saw this scene, he suddenly frowned, and snapped, “What’s the matter? You were perfectly all right; how did you get like this?”</p>
 <p>At the other side, Auntie Li immediately stepped forward and followed up, “Reporting back to Master, today Second Madam used Third Miss to send Madam a beauty enhancing product.</p>
 <p>“But when Madam used it, she became like this. These symptoms match Fourth Miss’s injuries from a few days ago exactly.”</p>
 <p>When Mu Xiang heard this, his eyes narrowed, and his mind seemed to have formed a line of thought. Afterwards, he waved his hands, “Someone come! Go bring Second Madam and Third Miss over.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, Master.”</p>
 <p>When Mu Lingzhu stepped into Su Biqing’s bedroom and saw the scene before her, she stood there blank for a second. Then, she sent a deep and penetrating look to Su Biqing.</p>
 <p>Su Biqing blinked at her, and Mu Lingzhu understood.</p>
 <p>After hearing Auntie Li’s story, Mu Lingzhu’s eyes turned. According to what Auntie Li said, Mu Yunjin was manipulated by Second Madam, and the matter had nothing to do with her.</p>
 <p>But as of today, Su Biqing had given her such a good chance to ruin Mu Yunjin, so how could she not take advantage of this?</p>
 <p>She stopped thinking about it, letting the scheming take over her heart.</p>
 <p>Outside of Green Void/Blue Sky pavilion, Mu Yunjin who had been summoned by Mu Xiang just happened to meet Wei Hanqiao.</p>
 <p>“Second Mother……” Mu Yunjin intimately called Wei Hanqiao.</p>
 <p>Wei Hanqiao &nbsp;glanced dully at Mu Yunjin, her pupils light and clear. How was she still as enthusiastic as when she had been in White Poplar Pavilion?</p>
 <p>After lightly hmphing, Wei Hanqiao stepped into Blue Sky Courtyard.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin stood where she was, looking at Wei Hanqiao’s rearview. Her eyes slightly squinted, as a cold smile formed.</p>
 <p>Zi Xiang looked at this scene. Even if she wasn’t smart, she could still sense a hint of conspiracy.</p>
 <p>When Mu Yunjin stepped into Su Biqing’s bedroom, she heard Wei Hanqiao’s shriek, “Elder sister, what happened to you? You were so well; how did you get like this?”</p>
 <p>Su Biqing lay on the bed, watching the pretending Wei Hanqiao. Her eyes fell on Mu Yunjin who was slowly walking into the doorway.</p>
 <p>“Yunjin, come over here.”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin was called, so she nodded and walked over.</p>
 <p>“Who gave you this bottle?” Su Biqing spoke. Auntie Li, who stood at the &nbsp;side immediately understood and took out a porcelain bottle from her sleeve.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin saw this and her heart could not help but silently complain about the rate at which Su Biqing was coordinating the matter. In such a little time, she had found another bottle that looked the exact same as the original bottle.</p>
 <p>Su Biqing’s question made everyone’s eyes fall on Mu Yunjin.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin pursed her lips. She turned around, her eyes exposing a cowardly appearance, before falling on Wei Hanqiao, “It was… it was Second Mother who gave it to me…….”</p>
 <p>“Hogwash!” Wei Hanqiao immediately denied it, and said sharply, “Third Miss, I have nothing to do with you. How can I give you things?”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin heard this, as if she was extremely surprised. Afterwards, she became anxious and her words began to stutter, “This, Second Mother, it was obviously you who invited me to White Poplar Pavilion, and then gave me this bottle, saying it was a beauty enhancing product. You even said that usually, I don’t receive any care or love from my Mother, and let me give it to Mother so that she would be happy.”</p>
 <p>Wei Hanqiao choked. She didn’t think that this idiot had always been timid and cowardly, and idiotic to no end. However, these words were said with reason and evidence.</p>
 <p>In a flash, she saw that Mu Xiang was also looking at her, full of questions. Wei Hanqiao immediately yelped, “Master, I have been wronged. Everyone in the residence knows that this concubine and Third Miss have never interacted with each other. How can I suddenly give her a beauty enhancing product?</p>
 <p>“In addition, if this concubine were really to poison my Elder Sister, why would I borrow Third Miss’s hand and send this object out in broad daylight? Isn’t this concubine asking to die?”</p>
 <p>After Wei Hanqiao spoke, everyone rethought the matter, and looked at Mu Yunjin again with investigative eyes.</p>
 <p>“Father, Mother, Second Madam’s words aren’t wrong. Everyone in the residence knows that Third Sister was confined for a long time, and so why would Second Mother care about idle matters and teach her to gain Mother’s favor?,” Mu Lingzhu spoke.</p>
 <p>“In addition, right after Third Sister left the courtyard, Mother became like this. Even though I am her little sister, and I should not suspect my own elder sister, this matter has already harmed my Mother’s safety. I hope that Father and Mother will forgive Lingzhu for being rude.”</p>
 <p>Mu Lingzhu’s words immediately scattered Wei Hanqiao’s suspicion away, and completely blamed the matter on Mu Yunjin.</p>
 <p>On the soft bed, Su Biqing heard Mu Lingzhu’s words and cast a glance at Mu Lingzhu. Her heart realized Mu Lingzhu’s intention, and thus, she gritted her teeth and followed Mu Lingzhu’s words.</p>
 <p>“That’s right, when Zhu’<i>er</i> mentions this, I do remember a bit. This child came back from Imperial Concubine Qin today, and then came to my courtyard and even sent me this bottle.</p>
 <p>“Yunjin, can it be that usually, Mother is too negligent, and you have always kept it in your heart? Is that why before you are to enter the palace and become Sixth Prince’s consort, you are helping yourself by venting some of your anger?”</p>
