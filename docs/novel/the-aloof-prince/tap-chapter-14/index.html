 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 14: Attacking Using the Strength of Another.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin was returning to Ascending Blossoms Pavilion when she just so happened to run into Second Madam, Wei Hanqiao.</p>
 <p>Of course, Mu Yunjin also saw Wei Hanqiao. When she noticed that her clothes were simple and her face was haggard, she felt that Wei Hanqiao was definitely heartbroken over Mu Yiyang’s injury.</p>
 <p>Originally, she had wanted to pretend that she did not see Wei Hanqiao, and walk alone, but Wei Hanqiao just had to glance at Mu Yunjin. The moment she saw Mu Yunjin, Wei Hanqiao came over without preamble.</p>
 <p>Face to face, she began to curse at Mu Yunjin, “You little b*tch. Your Second Brother got hurt in your Ascending Blossoms Pavilion, but you actually didn’t know about it! If you found him earlier, perhaps your Second Brother wouldn’t have……”</p>
 <p>Wei Hanqiao couldn’t continue on, and gritted her teeth, fiercely glaring at Mu Yunjin.</p>
 <p>When Mu Yunjin heard Wei Hanqiao speak so impolitely, her mouth curved into a sneer and her eyes blinked lightly, “Second Mother, are you calling me a little b*tch?”</p>
 <p>When Mu Yunjin pointed it out, Wei Hanqiao was stunned, and then realized that she had directly cursed her with words from her heart.</p>
 <p>In the past, even if she didn’t like Mu Yunjin, she definitely wouldn’t curse her so directly. In addition, she was the daughter of Great Madam. Even though Great Madam and Mu Xiang did not like this daughter, she still shared their flesh and blood.</p>
 <p>She could not help but begin to feel uneasy as Mu Yunjin glared at her. However, when she thought about her own pitiful son, her anger surged up again.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, she lost some of the sense she had just recovered, and began to scold Mu Yunjin again, “So what if I did? I am still your elder, so can’t I say a few words about you?</p>
 <p>“Your Second Brother was injured so severely- he definitely yelled a few times. He was right outside your Ascending Blossoms Pavilion, so did you purposely pretend you didn’t hear him, and intentionally prolong the time your Second Brother would have to get help?”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin looked at Wei Hanqiao’s shrewd appearance and indolently squinted her eyes, slightly sighing, “Second Mother, you have really treated Yunjin unjustly.”</p>
 <p>“My mother taught me from a young age, that I should not care about matters that I am not apart of. Plus, even if that second Brother of mine can’t go on, isn’t there still my big Brother? Second Mother need not worry that our Mu Family will no longer have an heir to continue on our legacy.” Mu Yunjin laughed, embarrassed. Her words were deliberately spoken without processing them first. Her sight landed on Wei Hanqiao’s body, waiting for her reaction.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin’s words had fiercely stabbed into Wei Hanqiao’s heart. Fury rose from deep in her heart, her mind not thinking of the other side of things.</p>
 <p>Could it be that her blood-related son’s injury had something to do with Su Biqing?</p>
 <p>That was right. Su Biqing’s eldest son had gone out to battle with the Rear General Qin of the Qin Family to the northwest. He had captured three cities in a row, and it was almost about time for him to return home.</p>
 <p>Could it be that Su Biqing purposely hurt her Yiyang and made her Yiyang handicapped so that he would never be able to manage the power of the Mu Family?</p>
 <p>That was right. It was definitely Su Biqing. Besides her, no one else had the motive to hurt Yiyang! Plus, Yiyang’s lifeblood was the exact position that had been harmed. This was really very vicious. It directly made her son’s life plummet towards something like death.</p>
 <p>“Su Biqing, you’re so great, Su Biqing!” Wei Hanqiao bit her teeth as she yelled, becoming gloomy and cold in an instant.</p>
 <p>“Second Mother, what happened to you? Don’t get angry. You know that I won’t say anything. If what I just said made you unhappy, don’t take it to heart.”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin astutely blinked her eyes, thinking of another thing afterwards, “Right, has Second Brother awoken?”</p>
 <p>Wei Hanqiao’s heart was in chaos. When she looked at Mu Yunjin, she suddenly formulated a plan in her heart. She didn’t only sigh, but her complexion also became slightly kinder.</p>
 <p>“Your Second Brother hasn’t awoken yet. As Yiyang’s favorite sister, why don’t you accompany your Second Mother to the White Poplar Pavilion to check on your Second Brother?,” Wei Hanqiao spoke.</p>
 <p>“All right,” Mu Yunjin happily agreed.</p>
 <p>On her other side, Zi Xiang pulled on Mu Yunjin’s sleeve, her brows furrowed. In a short amount of time, this Second Madam’s attitude had suddenly turned &nbsp;180 degrees. If there wasn’t a scheme behind all this, that would be strange.</p>
 <p>What was with her Miss recently? How come she liked to provoke great people whenever she could?</p>
 <p>“You may return first.” Mu Yunjin looked at Zi Xiang. This girl’s nerve was too little. If she were to stay by her side, that would easily ruin matters.</p>
 <p>Zi Xiang subconsciously shook her head, her footsteps never leaving Mu Yunjin. She didn’t seem like she was going to leave.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin saw this and did not speak further. She went with Wei Hanqiao into White Poplar Pavilion.</p>
 <p>Not much time had passed when Mu Yunjin stepped into White Poplar Pavilion. Seeing how this building used jade for the floors, she realized again, what bias was.</p>
 <p>Mu Yiyang, the son of a concubine had been given so many luxuries. How come she, the daughter of the main wife, was so impoverished it was sad?</p>
 <p>Wei Hanqiao brought Mu Yunjin into Mu Yiyang’s bedroom. Inside the bedroom, there were many great doctors guarding the door, and some had even collapsed on the floor. Mu Yiyang’s face was pale, as he lay on the soft couch, &nbsp;his eyes closed tightly.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin glanced at Mu Yiyang, who was in a stupor. A cold smile formed on her face. The Mu Yiyang before her now and the Mu Yiyang who had gone to Ascending Blossoms Pavilion to strut around in the past were completely different.</p>
 <p>“Yunjin, come, sit.” Wei Hanqiao suddenly moved a chair over for Mu Yunjin, allowing Mu Yunjin to sit.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin looked at the chair, and then sat down.</p>
 <p>“You may leave first.” Wei Hanqiao made the people in the bedroom leave.</p>
 <p>After everyone left, Wei Hanqiao walked to the other side of the room, and took out a brocaded box from Mu Yiyang’s drawers. In front of Mu Yunjin, she opened it.</p>
 <p>The box was full of gold. Mu Yunjin saw the expression in her eyes, and knew that it was a high quality product.</p>
 <p>“These &nbsp;are things that Yiyang bought for me for my birthday, but my age is old now, and these kinds of flowery and exquisite accessories do not suit me anymore.”</p>
 <p>“Yunjin, you are so pretty. If you were to wear one, it would definitely be very fitting. Thus, I will give this to you.” As Wei Hanqiao said this, she took the jewelry box and shoved it into Yunjin’s chest.</p>
 <p>Wei Hanqiao’s generous move made Mu Yunjin a bit confused. She didn’t understand what medicine Wei Hanqiao was selling in her bottle.</p>
 <p>“Over the years, you’ve suffered so much pain, and Second Mother has always kept it in my heart. Look at yourself, born with such a beautiful appearance that makes the moon hide and shames the flowers. Your mother, however, only cherishes Fourth Miss. Alas, Second Mother feels sorry for you from the bottom of my heart.” Wei Hanqiao sighed.</p>
 <p>“Say, you are all sisters. But how come the disparity between you and Fourth Miss is so great? Alas, sometimes, Second Mother really wants to beg your father to send you over to my place. But every time I have wanted to speak, your mother has stopped me.”</p>
 <p>As Wei Hanqiao said this, she even took a handkerchief to wipe at her tears.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin definitely understood now. This Second Madam had probably heard her words just now, and thought this Su Biqing was the criminal who harmed her son.</p>
 <p>This time, she had probably purposely brought her over to manipulate her to get back at Su Biqing.</p>
 <p>What a great move of attacking using the strength of another.</p>
 <p>After thinking for awhile, Mu Yunjin followed Wei Hanqiao’s words and revealed an extremely wretched appearance, “With Second Mother’s words, what do Yunjin’s wrongs count as?”</p>
 <p>“Good child. In a moment, I’ll help you organize those accessories, otherwise, if Fourth Miss and the others see it, they will gossip.” Wei Hanqiao glanced at the jewelry box and said this to Mu Yunjin.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin nodded and hugged the accessory box tightly.</p>
 <p>Wei Hanqiao saw the way Mu Yunjin was acting and silently cursed her for not having her eyes opened to the world around her. Afterwards, she pretended she was chatting idly, “Yunjin, do you know why Fourth Miss got injured a few days ago?”</p>
 <p>“Actually, I don’t know why. That day, I went to call on Lingzhu. I didn’t speak too much with her before she kicked me out.” Mu Yunjin murmured.</p>
 <p>Wei Hanqiao sighed, “What a little sister. She’s really been pampered with no manners at all.”</p>
 <p>She ceased her words and sat up straight. From the bottom of another box, she took out a porcelain bottle.</p>
 <p>“Yunjin, I’ll let you look at something else.” Wei Hanqiao held the bottle and began to speak as if she were presenting a great treasure to her.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin nodded, her face full of confusion as she looked at Wei Hanqiao, “Second Mother, what is this?”</p>
 <p>“This is something I bought from the marketplace a few days ago. It can enhance your beauty. Reportedly, if you rub it on your face, it can get rid of wrinkles.”</p>
 <p>Hearing this, Mu Yunjin pretended to be shocked, “It’s actually that awesome?”</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Originally, I wanted to give it to your mother in a few days, but you just happened to come today. So you can help me give this item to your mother.</p>
 <p>“It just so happens that it can also help tighten the relationship between mother and daughter.”</p>
 <p>Wei Hanqiao stopped and shoved the porcelain bottle into Mu Yunjin’s hands. Her eyes flashing, she said, “Yunjin, remember. Definitely don’t tell her that Second Mother gave it to you. You must say that you gave it to your mother especially. This way, she will be happy. And only then, will the present be significant. Got it?”</p>
 <p>“I understand. Thank you Second Mother.”</p>
 <p>“All right. It’s getting late, so you better quickly send the present to your mother. Second Mother will wait for your good news.”</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin nodded. Afterwards, she stood and walked out of the door.</p>
 <p>Behind her, Wei Hanqiao was still worried, so she urged, “Remember. You are the one who wants to give it to your mother.”</p>
 <p>After Mu Yunjin walked farther away, Wei Hanqiao stopped smiling, revealing a cold expression, “Hmph, Su Biqing. In a moment, you will see what it is like to live while wishing for death.”</p>
 <p>---</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin walked out of White Poplar Pavilion, and considered the porcelain bottle in her hand. She opened the bottle and lightly sniffed. Afterwards, she looked at Zi Xiang who held the jewelry box and coldly spoke.</p>
 <p>“Throw these accessories into the pond.” Mu Yunjin pointed to the pond nearby and spoke.</p>
 <p>Zi Xiang was thrown off. She couldn’t understand it, “Miss, this is from the good intentions of Second Madam.”</p>
 <p>“Good intentions? In a moment, you’ll see. Quickly throw it away!” Mu Yunjin said.</p>
 <p>Zi Xiang paused, but she still listened to Mu Yunjin and threw the box into the pond, creating many ripples.</p>
 <p>“Bring me to the place my Mother lives.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, Miss.” Zi Xiang followed, as she happily spoke.</p>
 <p>She really didn’t think that with the Second Master being so arrogant and despotic in the past, Second Madam would be so kind and generous. It turned out that in this residence, there were still some people that cared for her Miss.</p>
 <p>As of today, Second Madam thought of this method to allow her Miss to rekindle her relationship with her mother, Great Madam. Zi Xiang stopped thinking about it. Her heart couldn’t help but feel a bit respectful towards Wei Hanqiao.</p>
 <p>Mu Yunjin looked at Zi Xiang’s face full of yearning. This girl was really innocent and cute!</p>
 <p>After awhile, the two people came to Su Biqing’s Blue Sky Pavilion. Auntie Li who had slapped Mu Yunjin before was currently guarding the entrance. When she saw Mu Yunjin, she turned around immediately.</p>
 <p>“Has Third Miss went the wrong way? This is not the way to Ascending Blossoms Pavilion.”</p>
