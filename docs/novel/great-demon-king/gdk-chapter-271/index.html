 <p><span style>Chapter 271: The tri-colored bone staff</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aowuuuu…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Shuo was screaming in extreme agony on the oval altar in the second layer of the Cemetery of Death. Thick green light wreathed his body. His head in particular was showing a jasper-like luster. The ethereal light seemed to be the color of the most lustrous of green jade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Shuo's mental strength still grew at a crazy rate during this process. However, the brand from the evil god from an unknown source actually wanted to penetrate deep into his soul, ordering him to become a loyal follower of the religion of the evil god until death. This was a kind of soul brand similar to the one that Han Shuo imprinted on the little skeleton and earth elite zombie. Once his soul was stamped by this brand, he would never be himself again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was absolutely something that Han Shuo didn’t want!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although his brain felt like it was being cut by ten thousand blades, Han Shuo still held on, his eyes bulging in agony. He roared madly in rage, trying to alleviate the pain in some way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the power of the soul brand was becoming ever greater as the growing green halo above the altar grew brighter. In his panic, an enormous, pitch black figure appeared in Han Shuo's consciousness. The massive body seemed to blot out the sky. Its green pupils were like two huge full moons, as it glanced over all beings as if looking down upon weak, tiny ants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The enormous pressure filled the heavens and earth, making it difficult for Han Shuo to even breathe. This kind of endless presence tasted of immortality, like a star existing for billions of years in the galaxy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Submit. There will be no pain, only eternal life!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A spirit imprint suddenly broke into Han Shuo's mind, repeatedly tempting him. It seemed that if he just relaxed and accepted this brand, the suffering would be gone in the next moment, and his life would be endless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Shuo screamed tragically, his hands clutching his head as he rolled around on the ground. The Demonslayer Edge stored in his body abruptly shot out terrifyingly intense killing intent. The negative feelings of fear, resentment, and thirst for destruction coalesced into a force that instantly flowed into the demon infant to form a resistance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demonslayer Edge shrank into a beam of light, bringing every fiber of power within Han Shuo to bombard the shadowy figure that'd been born from the panic within his mind.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Crack...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A crisp sound, like the breaking of fragile glass, resounded clearly in Han Shuo's mind. The colossal figure shattered into spots of starlight. The lights suddenly gathered into the Demonslayer Edge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the blink of an eye, the agony that had ripped apart his heart and pierced his lungs disappeared. Within his consciousness, the frenzied rate of growth that his mental strength had enjoyed suddenly stopped. The green light curtain above the altar also disappeared without a trace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Eye of Darkness in Han Shuo's hand vanished, replaced with a green bone staff. The upper part of the staff was formed by three skulls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bone staff was one meter and thirty centimeters in length, and was made out of a green, jade-like material. The three skulls weren’t human, and were respectively yellow, blue, and purple. The yellow skull had three big eye sockets, the blue one had a horn, while the purple one was riddled with finger-sized holes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although their shapes were strange, the skulls were as small as a fist, each one looking more sinister than the one before. These three skulls integrated perfectly with the staff, the three skulls looking in different directions as they crowned the staff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Shuo slowly calmed his breathing. In the end, he fainted and fell listlessly to the ground in a comatose state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, whilst unconscious, the bone staff in his hand emitted yellow, blue, and purple rays of light from the three differently shaped skulls. The three lights were like silk ribbons that glided into his nose and mouth at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood was still flowing from Han Shuo's mouth and nostrils due to the piercing agony he had just experienced. Each plume of hot blood slowly drifted into the three skulls under the guidance of the tricolored lights. The three skulls gleamed with increasing light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three skulls finished absorbing the fresh blood from Han Shuo's mouth and nostrils. The staff shone with brilliant light that then slowly dispersed, returning to its normal lustre.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After who knew how long, Han Shuo gradually came to. His whole body ached to the extreme, as if his meridians and bones had shattered. There wasn't a place that didn't scream out with pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, after experiencing explosive agony, his mind was now much more clear and comfortable. When Han Shuo looked down at the bone staff, he was startled. His eyes were full of confusion; he simply didn't know where this bone staff had come from.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, where is the Eye of Darkness?!” Han Shuo was greatly shocked in the next moment as he discovered that the Eye of Darkness, that had been in his hand during the whole ordeal, had vanished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Eye of Darkness was the key in and out of the Cemetery of Death. Once it disappeared, he could only use the transportation matrix to leave the Cemetery of Death, which would be a tremendous setback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Han Shuo looked closely at the bone staff and noticed that its jade-green color was the same as the color of the Eye of Darkness. The staff felt extremely familiar in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A thought struck him. Han Shuo tried to use the bone staff in the same way he'd used the Eye of Darkness. When the bone staff immediately shot out a familiar green halo, Han Shuo understood what had happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Staring fixedly at the bone staff for a while, Han Shuo became more and more surprised. However, when he recalled the matter of the evil god invading his soul, he fearfully put the staff back into his space ring. He didn't dare to try out its power in a situation when his magical yuan was exhausted and body was extremely fragile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Closing his eyes to recall the events that occurred before he fell unconscious, Han Shuo couldn't help but feel fortunate. He secretly thought that this Cemetery of Death was really not that simple. When that evil god infiltrated his mind, the horrifying pressure from that shadowy figure on him had been truly unthinkable for Han Shuo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Shuo was certain that the colossal figure was definitely the true appearance of the evil god. Han Shuo completely understood what the evil god’s brand wanted to do to him. This made him even more grateful to have escaped, and he became more cautious of the Cemetery of Death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next moment, Han Shuo remembered what the shadowy figure said, “Let go of everything and accept this spirit force. It will help you reach the power of a grand magus!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ecstatic, Han Shuo chanted a spell to summon one ordinary skeleton. Eight skeletal warriors immediately appeared on the altar. Feeling the smooth circulation of his vast mental strength, Han Shuo was overjoyed upon discovering that his mental strength had made a shocking advancement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The same necromancy spell meant that the results would be different based on the level of one’s mental strength. Generally speaking, a magic spell could be divided into five levels based on one’s mental strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Take summoning a skeletal warrior for example. A novice magic apprentice with weak mental strength could only summon one skeletal warrior. However, for journeyman mages, they could unleash the second level of the spell due to their stronger spirit force, allowing them to call upon two skeletal warriors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Shuo summoning eight skeletal warriors meant that he had reached the fourth level of the spell. This was more than enough proof for his terrific improvement in mental strength. According to the explanation in necromancy magic books, Han Shuo understood that one would reach the fourth level of the skeletal warrior summon only when their mental strength advanced to grand magus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Truly unexpected! This was all true! To advance to grand magus all of the sudden! This Cemetery of Death is strange, but truly miraculous!” Han Shuo was ecstatic. He couldn't help but laugh heartily despite his current fragile state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Struggling to sit up, Han Shuo's eyes shone brightly as he look around. He saw that this second level was half the size of the first one. The surrounding area was empty, except for the oval altar in the center. No items were stored in this secret room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The second level was centered around the altar beneath Han Shuo, a mysterious magical formation was set up to occupy the entire room. There was nothing else except for it, seemingly a place to cleanse the soul and improve mental strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Shuo rested for a while before leaving the second level of the Cemetery of Death. He sat in the center of the magical formation, slowly gathering his exhausted magical yuan and restoring it bit by it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After about five days, Han Shuo heaved a sigh of relief and murmured in good spirits, “Although the evil god invaded my soul this time, it was actually rather useful. Not only did my mental strength advance to grand magus level in one fell swoop, even my magic cultivation showed signs of great improvement!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Shuo wasn't in a hurry to leave. He stayed in the Cemetery of Death, spending the entire day and night to indulge himself in the study of necromancy magic. Although he had the power of a grand magus, he still needed to brush up on some necromancy spells. Thanks to the absorbed memories from Clarendon, Han Shuo could officially begin his preparation for the archmage level, and those memories played an important role.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Shuo practiced necromancy magic in the Cemetery of Death without rest or food, as if he was possessed. He repeatedly cast all archmage level spells. He practiced every day until his mental strength was completely exhausted. Afterwards, his mental strength improved slightly with meditation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Over ten days, Han Shuo could skillfully release the several archmage level necromancy spells that he’d gained from Clarendon. As for the two new spells written in the book of “Necromancy Magic” that he’d picked up in the Cemetery of Death, it was difficult to grasp them in a short amount of time. Han Shuo decided to not waste any more time and left the Cemetery of Death via the transportation matrix.</span></p>
