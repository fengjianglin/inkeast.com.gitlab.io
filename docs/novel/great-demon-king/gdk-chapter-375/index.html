 <p><strong>This chapter is unedited. etvolare will be halting translation of GDK this weekend. Please <a href="https://twitter.com/etvofluff" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go here for future news of the series.</a></strong></p>
 <p><span style>Lancelot Empire’s Ossen City. Boozt Merchant Guild Headquarters. </span><span style>Phoebe and Lawrence sat upright sipping tea within an elegant secondary courtyard. Lawrence wore a clouded expression. Although his identity as a prince was already recognized by the king, he was still living miserably.</span><span style>In contrast, Phoebe, who sat opposite from him, had a charming appearance that was becoming increasingly natural and elegant. But because she also held that divine weapon, “Starry Sky”, she even had a somewhat icily arrogant charm. As Phoebe fondled with the “Starry Sky” within her hands, unwilling to part with it, her thought began uncontrollably floating towards the distant Brettel City. </span><span style>“Junior sister, your current Boozt Merchant Guild is becoming more and more influential thanks to your work. Bryan is also like a fish in water in Brettel City. However, my days just aren’t so well. I will probably be immediately killed by Charles right after royal father passes away. Did you truly help me deliver my letter to Bryan or not?” Lawrence looked at the Phoebe in front of him and asked somewhat helplessly.</span><span style>“Senior Brother, it’s not like Brettel City doesn’t have any of your people. You should be even clearer than me whether Bryan is within Brettel City or not. But what you're saying is also true. It’s already been so many months. Just why isn’t there even the slightest trace of him. Could it be that he’s gone to do another evil deed again?” Phoebe’s long eyelashes fluttered as her pupils sparkled with doubt.</span><span style>Lawrence had dispatched some people to Brettel City before, Faulke being one of them. Afterwards, Lawrence had also arranged some talented politicians to enter Brettel City one after the other. Although these people were currently holding suitable positions within Brettel City, they would continue to relay information to Lawrence just like before. From the information they had sent, it seemed that Han Shuo was really not within Brettel City.</span><span style>Lawrence sighed before suddenly saying to Phoebe, “I also have the Dark Mantle agents helping me inquire for any information of him. But, even until now, there has not been even the slightest hint of him at all. What do you think? Could something have happened to him?”</span><span style>Phoebe laughed proudly while promptly taking out the divine weapon “Starry Sky”, which emitted a bright and sparkling starlight. She shot a disdainful glance at Lawrence and said, “He could even kill Celt, the number one Redbud Knight commander out of the Continent’s ten great knight troops. Furthermore, Celt was also a very powerful dragon rider. Just what kind of mishaps do you think he will face?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That fellow is extremely crafty and sinister while his sensitivity is frighteningly sharp. Even if he encounters a dangerous situation, he would still be able to escape in advance. He definitely won’t have any mishaps. Instead, he is definitely doing some evil deeds in secret once again.</span></i><span style> These words were naturally not spoken to Lawrence, but secretly mused within her own heart instead. </span><span style>Lawrence carefully reconsidered and found it reasonable. It wasn’t his first day knowing Han Shuo, so he naturally understood that with Han Shuo’s personality and strength, he would absolutely not indulge in foolish and reckless actions of courage. The moment he noticed that he was in a helpless situation, he would always leave immediately in a sorry manner. According to reason, no accidents should’ve occurred to him indeed.</span><span style>As his hands massaged his temples, Lawrence said somewhat exhausted, “Junior sister, I must have been too anxious lately, causing my thoughts to gradually become somewhat chaotic recently.”</span><span style>“Don’t worry. With your relationship with Bryan, as long as he knows about the current circumstances within Ossen City, he should come back and help you. Mm, I have heard that not long ago, the seven grand duchies tried to unite and defeat Brettel City. I think Bryan has possibly gone to the seven grand duchies to do some secretive things. You needn’t worry about it. He will definitely come to find you after he has finished dealing with his matters.” Phoebe said, comforting Lawrence. She knew that Lawrence had really been forced to the edge by the princes and she naturally understood Lawrence’s current feelings. </span><span style>“Hopefully he will rush back before my royal father passes away. Besides, we also have no clue what’s going on with our master. The situation has already reached such a state, but he has yet to take a declarative stand. Even I have no idea if he will support me in the end or not.” Lawrence complained with a headache. Then, he turned to Phoebe, “Junior sister, you’re our master’s most loved disciple. Do you have a clue as to what our master will plan in the end?”</span><span style>Phoebe thought for a moment before replying, “Master has always been solely responsible for teaching us various kinds of knowledge. I feel like he wants you to become king relying on your own strength. You should also know, our master has always made us work hard for our own goals. He has never once relied on his identity to help us before.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sigh. If I really just rely on my own strength, it’s basically impossible for me to become king based on the current circumstances.” Lawrence seemingly knew about a bit of his master’s personality, as he couldn’t help but to sigh. </span><span style>“Although Master won’t justly and openly help you, however, he also wouldn’t let others bully you. If not for Master letting Grandpa Bollands secretly protect you, I’m afraid you would have already been secretly killed by others. This proves that Master also cares very much for you.” Phoebe continued to console Lawrence. </span><span style>Hearing this, Lawrence nodded his head and agreed, “This is also true. Fortunately Bollands was there to help me several times, otherwise I would have really have been killed long ago.”</span><span style>Phoebe did not continue to speak as she continued to focus on polishing the “Starry Sky” that was already clearly shining like a reflective mirror. She treated it as though this sword was Han Shuo. </span><span style>“When I came over, Master wanted me to tell you that you shouldn’t depend too heavily on the weapons in your hands. Weapons will forever be dead objects. They might be able to make you a little bit stronger but they won’t increase your personal strength.” Lawrence stood up and said to Phoebe. </span><span style>“Don’t worry, I have an even higher comprehension towards Master’s martial skills than you. You had better put more effort into thinking how you can get some additional advantages from your royal father instead.” Phoebe said indifferently before continuing to wipe the divine weapon within her hand. When she thought of the fact that this damned guy had still yet to see her after so long, she realized that, in the end, this long-distance relationship was definitely not going to work!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Phoebe reminisced and mentally nagged Han Shuo, he had already arrived at Ossen City. Only after arriving at Ossen City did Han Shuo notice that three months had already passed while he was unconscious and resisting spider goddess Rose’s power within the Cemetery of Death. During these three months, the seven grand duchies continued to unceasingly go on campaigns against each other while Brettel City and the Helon Duchy had already conducted numerous secret business deals in secret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Shuo did not make another move towards Narsen Duchy’s Benedict Sackville at all. On one hand, the opportunity was hard to seek while on the other, there were still other more important matters waiting to be done. After returning to Brettel City from Narsen Duchy, Han Shuo took the necessary materials to refine an elite metal zombie from Jack, entered Mount Silk, and planted the future elite metal zombie within. Then, after handing over some tasks to Jack and the others, Han Shuo left Brettel City, passed through Seamist City’s transporting array, and arrived at Ossen City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because Faulke and the other former subordinates of Lawrence had already told Han Shuo that he wanted to urgently see him, Han Shuo immediately left for Ossen City. Knowing Han Shuo’s destination, Faulke and the rest didn’t report to Lawrence about Han Shuo’s appearance because they knew that Han Shuo would arrive there first. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After entering Ossen City, Han Shuo hurried towards Fanny’s laboratory place first because the teleportation array was near Babylon Academy. Han Shuo had not seen Fanny for ages and was truly longing for the bright and beautifully moving teacher at the moment. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Shuo headed for Babylon Academy under the cover of the dusky night. On the road, Han Shuo avoided some relatively crowded areas and headed towards the necromancy major.</span><span style>The moment Han Shuo arrived at the long hallway with the sculptures that Jack and him frequently cleaned off, he suddenly noticed an extremely familiar-looking new sculpture. The finished sculpture was made of pure white, white jade and was meticulously carved. This imposingly tall sculpture faced the sky while holding a magical staff, and was posturing as if it was chanting a magical chant.</span><span style>Under this new sculpture, a glamorous engraving of small characters stated: </span><i><span style>Bryan, a graduate of Babylon Academy’s Institute of Necromancy. Graduated in two years and three months-the fastest graduation speed in history. He is currently an archmage necromancer and has formerly defeated Great Swordmaster Leah Cain….</span></i><span style>As Han Shuo looked at his own sculpture, he suddenly assailed with indescribable emotions. When he and Jack had been both wiping these sculptures, they had once been filled with ambition and desire to stand amongst these sculptures. But, after reminiscing through these times, he truly felt a spontaneous pride and satisfaction of attaining his achievements when he truly saw his own sculpture.</span><span style>“I... never expected - I really never expected that one day my own sculpture would be able to stand here and become a motivational model for future generations.” Han Shuo muttered to himself as he looked at his own sculpture in front of him. </span><span style>“It’s because of you that new student enrollment in the necromancy major has increased by many folds. Hehe, Fanny has become even more and more busy now!” A kind voice sounded from behind Han Shuo. Babylon Academy’s Dean Emma gradually walked in front of Han Shuo.</span><span style>As a space grand magus, Emma possessed a peculiar ability of walking through space. Within this region, as long as Emma wanted to find someone, she could immediately appear in front of that person’s face. </span><span style>After the space fluctuated, Han Shuo immediately knew that Emma had noticed his arrival. When Emma’s voice sounded, Han Shuo was not even a little surprised as he smilingly looked at the all too familiar Dean Emma, saying, “I truly never expected that my sculpture would be able to stand here.”</span><span style>“Hehe, you already had the qualifications to stand here when you advanced from a magical apprentice to an archmage in three years. Even more so, after you graduated from this Academy, your every action maintained this stunning incredulity. The necromancy major is this Academy’s weakest major, but such a character like you could still emerge from it! It’s only natural for your sculpture to be erected.” Emma smiled kindly&nbsp;as she walked in front of Han Shuo’s sculpture and lightly pressed her thumb on the annotation below the sculpture. She had just added another character, transforming the symbols of archmage into grand magus. Emma seemed to have already ascertained that Han Shuo was a grand magus necromancer. </span></p>
