 <p><span style>Chapter 293: The Temple Knights</span><span style>Han Shuo didn't expend too much effort in refining the water elite zombie. Thanks to the earth, wood and fire elite zombies, he was well versed in the process. After everything was finished, Han Shuo jumped out of the well and suddenly felt two unfamiliar presences. </span><span style>The deathly air of the Shura Soul Formation was quietly circulating in the shop’s courtyard. Dark grand magus Edwin of the Calamity Church and the female alchemist Belinda were wandering around outside. They didn't dare to come in, and could only look down in shock at this gloomy yard from the rooftop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A concentrated sense of death could be found within the Shura Soul Formation. The two people absolutely couldn't see what Han Shuo was doing inside. But for Han Shuo, he only needed to lift his head after jumping out of the well to see the two experts of the Calamity Church clearly.</span><span style>Edwin and Belinda obviously knew there was a great danger hidden below. They looked down, bewildered, at the changes, not daring to risk entering the formation. They appeared very wary and cautious.</span><span style>Thanks to the Rainbow Sickle ambush last time, the two already knew that this place was extremely dangerous. Han Shuo knew they knew, so it was understandable that these two didn't dare to draw close.</span><span style>After circling around the courtyard to inspect it, Han Shuo walked towards the eye of the formation and shot a black light onto it. The violent, gloomy deathly air in the formation instantly dispersed and the formation returned to its inert state.</span><span style>Han Shuo sat down on a chair in the courtyard, lazily looking up at Edwin on the rooftop. He asked indifferently, “Mister Edwin, it seems that you’re always this surreptitious when you pay a visit. Can it be that this is how your Calamity Church operates?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Edwin still didn't dare to come down even though the changes in the courtyard had disappeared. Having heard Han Shuo's words, he chuckled and said, “My apologies. We’ll stay up here for our little chat. Congratulations on killing Ferguson. However, you’ve also completely offended the Church of Light. They’ll spare no costs in dealing with you now. So, heh heh, our Calamity Church sincerely invites you to join us. We’re willing to pay any price as long as you're willing to join us.”</span><span style>“Sorry, not interested!” Han Shuo had declined before, and he was still determined to turn them down all the same. He left no room for further negotiation.</span><span style>“Alright then. Since you don’t want to join us, let's discuss a bit about cooperation instead. Hehe, the Church of Light has dispatched a small troop of Temple Knights, whose goal is to deal with you. The Temple Knights don’t number many, but each one is a true expert. This troop is the sword that the Church of Light uses to eradicate heretics. They are currently marching towards Brettel City, just waiting for you to arrive.”</span><span style>“Even if you hadn’t come to the Valley of Sunshine today, my people would have still gone to inform you when you arrived at Brettel City. But I didn't expect to be able to meet you here, and that's why I’m telling you in advance to see if we can possibly cooperate!” Edwin was truly sincere, he'd informed Han Shuo of this important information at first opportunity.</span><span style>Han Shuo involuntarily frowned at Edwin’s words. The main headquarters of the Church of Light headquarters was positioned in the most powerful nation of the Profound Continent - the Oden Empire. This Empire was separated from the Lancelot Empire by the Angel Empire. The Temple Knights had always protected the Temple of Light loyally. It seemed the Church if Light was truly determined this time if they’d dispatched a small troop of Temple Knight just for Han Shuo.</span><span style>“I won't cooperate with you for now. However if I need something, I just might contact you!” Han Shuo thought for a while before telling Edwin.</span><span style>Edwin immediately grinned upon hearing Han Shuo's words and said, “The Calamity Church and the Church of Light are death sworn enemies in the Profound Continent! Alright then, if you encounter any trouble, our Calamity Church may just appear at your side. Let's meet again then!”</span><span style>Edwin and Belinda didn't linger after speaking these words. They swept a casual glance around the surroundings before cautiously leaving Han Shuo's rooftop and disappearing out of sight.</span><span style>Han Shuo immediately stood up after Edwin and Belinda left. He released all three yin demons and had them follow after Edwin and Belinda. He intended to see why these two had come to the Valley of Sunshine.</span><span style>Edwin and Belinda were very careful, they made a lot of turns along the way, guarding against the tracking of any possible enemy. However, they couldn't hide their presence from the three yin demons’ surveillance.</span><span style>In the end, the two people unexpectedly entered the Cairo mercenary band’s headquarters. Han Shuo was secretly tracking them this time so he didn't enter the headquarters openly. Instead, he hid in a corner of the valley that wasn't very far away and used the three yin demons to spy on Edwin’s actions. </span><span style>To be honest, when he saw the two walk up to the door, Han Shuo could somewhat deduce that Edwin had reached an agreement with Laureton. Otherwise, Edwin and Belinda couldn't have come to Han Shuo’s door so quickly after he'd just returned to the Valley of Sunshine less than a couple hours ago. The Valley of Sunshine was within the Cairo mercenary band’s sphere of influence. The Calamity Church’s spy network had spread far and wide.</span><span style>“Mister Edwin, did you go see Bryan?” Laureton asked first when Edwin arrived.</span><span style>Nodding, Edwin thanked him with a smile, “Many thanks for letting me know. I've just seen Bryan. Right, how's the preparation going? Three hundred Death Guards from our Calamity Church will arrive at the Valley of Sunshine in two days. After all, anyone but the Church of Light can have the mithril mine. If they craft mithril armor for the Temple Knights, it will bring us great trouble in the future!”</span><span style>Laureton’s expression was cold as he said ferociously, “Rest assured. I will immediately mobilize the Cairo mercenary band as soon as your Death Guards arrive to flatten those powers around the mithril mine. Humph! I almost lost my life there last time, I won't be so careless this time. Those three great powers will definitely pay back this debt in blood!”</span><span style>“Heh heh, that'd be best. Since the Church of Light wants the mithril mine, we’ll fill the mine with their lives!” Edwin laughed in a sinister fashion as he discussed the details of the plan with Laureton. Han Shuo listened for a while and carefully memorized their conversation. When Edwin and Laureton were about to leave, Han Shuo moved one step faster than them and soundlessly exited the area.</span><span style>Han Shuo immediately departed the Valley of Sunshine after leaving the Cairo mercenary band. He returned to the Soul Destroyers to ask about the movement of Trunks’ group. From Grant, Han Shuo knew that it would be some time before those two returned.</span><span style>Han Shuo didn't linger in the Soul Destroyer base. Instead, he rushed back to the Cemetery of Death and returned to the secret chamber in his mansion. Kallas stepped into the secret chamber not long after his return and said respectfully to Han Shuo, “Your Lordship, a young lady called Fanny wants to see you. She said that you’d definitely see her if I informed you of her name!”</span><span style>Han Shuo was dumbfounded. He suddenly remembered his promise to Fanny. He'd said that he would find her in a few days when he’d left last time. He hadn’t expected to be so busy and had forgotten about this. Now it was Fanny who’d come looking for him.</span><span style>“Where is she? Take me to see her!” Now that Han Shuo had his own mansion, if Fanny and Phoebe came to find him too often, his relationships with them would be exposed sooner or later . Just thinking about it gave him a headache.</span><span style>Seeing him so anxious, Kallas was quite surprised. He immediately said in a respectful manner, “Your Lordship, please follow me!”</span><span style>After winding through a couple of hallways, Kallas led Han Shuo to the room where Fanny was. He pointed inside and said, “Miss Fanny is in there.”</span><span style>“Mhm, you are dismissed, don't let other people come here!” Han Shuo instructed.</span><span style>Han Shuo waited for Kallas to leave before he bit the bullet and walked inside. He immediately saw Fanny sitting in the middle of the room. She was wearing a navy blue dress instead of her usual magic robe. She instantly humphed upon seeing Han Shuo walk in, coldly looking at him as she said, “Your Lordship finally has some time to spare for us common civilians?”</span><span style>“I'm so sorry. There was something that happened so I was delayed a little. This won't happen again. Fanny, you must forgive me.” Han Shuo smiled wryly and apologized as soon as he came in. He was indeed in the wrong, it was natural for Fanny to be so angry.</span><span style>“This isn't the first time either. You never honor your promises!” Fanny still maintained her iron face as she fixed him with a cold stare.</span><span style>Han Shuo smiled wryly as he looked at Fanny, putting up his hands in surrender, “I was wrong. You can punish me however you want!”</span><span style>“Then good, just promise me that you‘ll be an honorary professor for our necromancy major and I’ll forgive you.” Fanny thought for a bit before glaring ferociously at Han Shuo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Honorary professor was just a title for show in the Babylon Academy of Magic and Force. A person with this title basically wasn't bound by the Academy’s rules. They only need to occasionally give a speech in accordance with the Academy’s request. There was strong competition amongst the different majors in the Academy. The ability to invite famous, powerful figures to be honorary professors was the standard with which to measure a department’s influence.</span><span style>“No problem!” Han Shuo readily agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You scoundrel, how do you have the ability to kill someone so evil as Leah Cain? How did you become an archmage necromancer? How many things are you actually still lying to me about?” Fanny was happy when she heard Han Shuo’s ready acquiescence, but then her many doubts flooded her heart and just burst out.</span></p>
