 <p><span style>Chapter 259: Assembly</span></p>
 <p><span style>Trunks’ expression was exceedingly unnatural as he dashed in front of the girl like lightning. He reached out a hand to touch the necklace of crystal shards on her neck. He said with a choked up voice, “Annie, it’s definitely you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The original Rainbow Sickle mercenary band members all clustered around Trunks and looked on with confused stares. Grant, who’d been tossed into the air by Han Shuo, couldn’t help but say, “Chief, Miss Annie doesn’t look like that!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s definitely Annie. I gifted her that crystal necklace, and the black mole behind her left ear are all proof that she’s Annie!” Trunks’ voice was thick was tears as he held onto the girl and sobbed with joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mercenaries, who’d been doubtful before, all cheered when they heard that Trunks could confirm her identity. They used their mallets to bash each other’s chest, seemingly wanting to use pain to express how excited and happy they were.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Annie, Annie, what’s wrong? Why can’t you speak?” Trunks asked frantically when he realized the girl in his grasp wasn’t moving, and was as quiet as a puppet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Allow me!” Han Shuo dashed in front of Trunks and placed his right hand on Annie’s back. A beam of black light entered her body and cleaned away the restraints placed on her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl, whose head was lolling to the side, suddenly had color suffuse her cheeks again. She seemed to feel Trunks’ shaking as her long eyelashes fluttered, suddenly snapping open to reveal bright eyes as she looked at Trunks, perplexed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Which lasted precisely a second before a shrill scream tore itself out of the girl’s mouth. She struggled fiercely and started to throw punches and kicks at Trunks. She resisted ferociously and cursed loudly, “Damn it, who are you? If Janet knew, she’d kill you for sure. Let go of me, let go of me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the girl didn’t seem to have practiced martial techniques. Her punches and kicks didn’t cause Trunks much damage when they landed on him. Trunks let go of the girl in bafflement, “Annie, do you not remember me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s Annie? I’m Betty. You must have the wrong person. You’re crazy!” The girl dodged Trunks and looked huffily at Han Shuo. “You evil robber, what do you want with me here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Shuo didn’t respond as he looked at Annie with deeply furrowed brows. Linley looked at the deeply emotional and dejected Trunks, “Trunks you’re not recognizing the wrong person, are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shaking his head firmly, Trunks said, “I gave her that crystal necklace, and the black mole on her ear is still there. This is definitely Annie, but I don’t know why her looks have changed and why she doesn’t remember me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then there’s nothing wrong about it. These marks mean that it must be her. Memories are sometimes forgotten after enormous stimulus, and some magical potions can be used to change one’s appearance.” Han Shuo said calmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right. That must be the case. Where did you find her?” Trunks immediately lit up when he heard Han Shuo respond. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You jerks, what do you want to do with me? Hurry up and let me go or Janet will never let you off the hook!” The originally gentle girl became a bit frantic because of her dangerous circumstances, and she kicked up quite a fuss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I grabbed her from Janet’s hands. It looks like we’ll only understand what’s going on after we find Janet. I have things to discuss with her anyways.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Annie, where did you get this crystal necklace?” Trunks asked in a shaky voice as he walked towards the girl and pointed at the necklace on her neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How would I know? It’s mine. You must have the wrong person. Please, let me go. I can have Janet let you guys go too.” The young girl seemed to feel Trunks’ affection for her and begged pitiably.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you remember your childhood, things from your youth?” Trunks eyes glimmered with light as he looked closely at the girl, asking anxiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shaking her head like a rattle-drum, the girl bawled, “I don’t remember, I don’t remember anything and I don’t want to. Let me go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>By now, even the original Rainbow Sickle mercenary band members could see that she had indeed lost her memory, and was sure that this had to be Annie, who’d been missing for three years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to find Janet and get to the bottom of this. Uncle Grant, take two small teams and make the trip with me.” Trunks had a resolute expression on his face and gave an order to Grant, then spoke softly to Annie, “Annie, stay here for now. They’ll take care of you like before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not Annie, let me go!” Annie wanted to cry when she saw that Trunks was about to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come, let’s do it all tonight.” Roughly wiping his eyes, Trunks couldn’t bear to look at the sobbing Annie and cast a glance at Han Shuo, walking down with large strides.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were 20 people in each small team, as well as Odysseus’ crew, Han Shuo and Gilbert walking along the flat ground. They climbed up the previously shaped stone stairs and climbed up out of the cliff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you leave in such a hurry last time?” Odysseus asked Han Shuo with a smile as Gordon and Aphrodite also chattered away. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It couldn’t be helped. I had a ton of stuff to do last time, plus that Ferguson was hot on my tail, so I had to leave in a hurry.” Han Shuo smiled apologetically at Odysseus. He looked to the right and left and saw that no one was paying any attention to him. Odysseus couldn’t help but ask a question in a low tone at this point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nodding, Han Shuo said softly, “Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gordon was delighted and chuckled, “You’re amazing to have created such a large mercenary band. We were only willing to join after Trunks said that the boss in the shadows was you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clapping Gordon’s shoulder, Han Shuo smiled faintly and nodded, not saying much. The friendship of life and death that Han Shuo had formed with them in the Dark Forest was indeed becoming to be of use.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A merchant happened to discover a silver mine in the mountain valley. It’s said that there’s even &nbsp;mithril inside. All of the powers in the Valley of Sunshine have fought several times for possession over this silver mine. I’ve received news that Laureton of the Cairo mercenary band will be going over tonight as well. The Cairo mercenary band has occupied all the high ground in the valley, and it’ll be difficult for the other powers to fight against him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Laureton has left the valley this time for mithril. The other power won’t let him off the hook either, so there’s certainly going to be a vicious battle tonight at the silver mine. I’ve come back to take some men and watch the show, and see if there are any benefits to be had.” Trunks explained as he arrived aboveground from the misty flat grounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Startled, Han Shuo said, “Silver mines are rare enough to begin with. Mithril is the ultimate material used in forging weapons and armor. No wonder everyone’s gone crazy over it. If such a mine were discovered, its value is truly unsurpassable. Therefore, all of the factions in the valley will want a share of the profits. The merchant who discovered it was killed in the first moment, but sadly the news had already travelled.” Trunks nodded in agreement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come, let’s go take a look as well. If there are no accidents, Janet will appear there as well.” Han Shuo thought for a bit and suggested to Trunks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, my thoughts precisely!” Trunks responded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group of thirty something people left the cliff silently, heading for their destination under Trunks’ instructions. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The mercenaries that Trunks had brought along were mostly the experienced, extraordinary members of the Soul Destroyers. They kept checking their equipment along the way and looked around alertly, carefully avoiding the other groups of people along the way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the sky darkened, before the crescent moon rose into the night sky, Trunks stopped in front of a boulder and pointed at a valley in the distance that was filled with ivy vegetation. “There it is, I think all the powers in the valley have arrived. The smaller forces like us who want to take advantage of the situation will also be dotted around the surroundings. It’s going to be a bit impossible to hide without anyone discovering us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The others remain here. You, me, and Gilbert will go inside first. Just follow me and be careful. No one will discover us then.” Han Shuo turned his head and calmly gave Trunks his orders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Trunks had witnessed Han Shuo’s miracles before. He immediately turned back to the others and said, “Uncle Grant, you guys remain here and hide yourselves for now. We’ll scout ahead. I’ll use signals to notify you if anything happens.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As experienced mercenaries, they wouldn’t have any objections about their chief’s orders once they started their operation. Grant nodded, saying in a low tone, “Understood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Follow me!” Han Shuo called out softly and lowered his body to the level of the shrubbery. He took a step out and sent the three yin demons out around him, keeping an eye on all movement around him.</span></p>
