 <p><span style>Chapter 288: Ripped asunder</span><span style>“Not bad, little guy!” Leah Cain could clearly sense the enormous amount of murderous intent coming from his opponent. His eyes shone with excitement for the fight. Fighting aura continuously gathered around his broadsword. He didn't wait for Han Shuo to land on the ground as the silver fighting aura shot directly at the latter's head like a silver arc.</span><span style>A murderous aura condensed around Han Shuo's body nonstop. His pupils became a deep red, his expression extremely ferocious. The sinister, evil aura formed a bloody mist that rushed forward to swallow Leah Cain. The two meter long purple-red spellfire floated down eerily at &nbsp;a strange trajectory, like a large, beautiful feather fluttering in the wind.</span><span style>An explosive rumbling echoed as the spellfire smashed into the silver fighting aura. Bursts of brilliant fireworks bloomed in the air as the two lights intertwined with one another. Deep red light, silver aura, and purple light shimmered endlessly. Metallic collisions resounded nonstop from the mystically beautiful fireworks.</span><span style>Leah Cain, standing on the ground, was forced knee-deep into the dirt due to the powerful pressure from the explosion happening overhead. The violent reactions rang through his ears. An alternating force of two polar opposite powers, hot and cold, shrouded his brain. The strange force was like a ghost slipping through his pores before violently flooding his internal organs.</span><span style>Leah Cain first shivered from the cold, feeling as if his body was frozen solid. A blazing hot current then coursed through his body like a volcano. The two hot and cold airs intermingled within, giving Leah Cain an extremely surreal and painful feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aowuuuu…”</span><span style>Leah Cain looked like a madman as he wailed crazily at the sky. He ripped apart the clothes on his upper body with one hand, revealing his strong muscles. Streams of silver light could be seen clearly as they orbited his bare upper body. Purple and red glints reflected from within. It looked extremely odd.</span><span style>“I’m going to tear you apart!” Leah Cain roared. The broadsword in his hand had gathered every fiber of silver light. He looked at Han Shuo, who happened to be standing indifferently in the air.</span><span style>The silver halo around the broadsword in Leah Cain's hand suddenly shrank. The silver light faded away, and the glossy broadsword didn't reflect a single gleam of light beneath the bright sun. This appeared extremely weird.</span><span style>Han Shuo understood that Leah Cain’s strength was indeed extraordinary after exchanging blows with him. He hadn’t gained any advantage even after utilizing the full force of the bloodlust realm. If it weren't for the Mystical Glacial Spellfire with the property of both fire and ice invading his body, Leah Cain wouldn't have ended up so miserable after the attack either.</span><span style>Han Shuo dived downwards while fiercely pouring magical yuan into the Demonslayer Edge despite his numb hands. Precisely the moment he’d focused his power and was waiting for a chance to deal a fatal blow, Han Shuo suddenly discovered that the light from Leah Cain's broadsword had suddenly vanished. Han Shuo’s instincts detected grave danger. His extraordinary senses were once again at play. Han Shuo immediately contacted the three yin demons. Just as the broadsword in Leah Cain's hand trembled, Han Shuo abruptly split into four clones and landed in four different directions.</span><span style>The previously dull broadsword suddenly burst with glaring light at the same moment. Icy awls, as sharp as needles, shot towards the sky in a drizzle, covering an area of about five meters. This attack had a terrifying penetration ability, in addition to its intensity. It pierced through the sky before disappearing in the blink of an eye.</span><span style>A yin demon had transformed into a clone, replacing Han Shuo in the place where he’d been standing. As the icy awls pierced through that area, the invisible yin demon was also penetrated by a strange force. The violent fighting aura had coalesced into tiny shapes, unexpectedly possessing a particularly destructive force towards the yin demon. The yin demon was pierced through like a beehive, its presence fading to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a terrifying attack!” Han Shuo couldn't stop feeling horrified after landing.</span><span style>Leah Cain was indeed terrifying. He could gather his fighting aura into such a small and intense form. When the fighting aura had condensed into thousands of icy awls, the destructive force hidden in those awls actually increased by a hundred times. Even an intangible existence like the yin demon had suffered injuries from this attack. Han Shuo believed that if he hadn't reacted fast enough and swapped his body out, he definitely would’ve become a mangled mess.</span><span style>While Han Shuo was shocked by Leah Cain's attack, Leah Cain, the attacker himself, felt even more incredulous. He never expected Han Shuo to evade his strike.</span><span style>Han Shuo's four clones landed on the flat ground. The three figures transformed back into yin demons and slowly faded like a reflection on a lake being hit with a stone. The shadows twisted and swayed for a bit before disappearing, leaving only one Han Shuo behind Leah Cain.</span><span style>“Too powerful!”</span><span style>“Woah! What was that just now? A rain of swords? So stunning! I didn't think that this ugly fellow could have produced such a beautiful attack!”</span><span style>“Bryan was the more formidable one here. If I didn't see incorrectly, there were four Bryans just now. My gosh, truly miraculous!”</span><span style>“You didn't see wrong. I also saw four Bryans. What kind of skill is this? It’s really too powerful!”</span><span style>The whole audience burst into a hubbub after a moment of silence. All of the watching nobles, along with their followers, were discussing with surprise. Their faces was full of shock and excitement after seeing the astounding performance earlier.</span><span style>“What, what’s going on?” Candide's expression was that of disbelief as well on the high platform. He exclaimed with incredulity while looking at the distant Leah Cain and Han Shuo.</span><span style>“That Leah Cain is truly terrifying. According to the intelligence of Dark Mantle, he’d always used that arc of silver sword aura to gain the advantage before defeating his opponents in his recent fights over the years. It seems that his trademark move is the attack he’d just deployed, that dense drizzle of ice needles. I could feel the destructive force hidden within. I really didn't expect this crude, brainless-looking Leah Cain to be hiding such a sinister and meticulous skill. Truly a terrifying person!”</span><span style>Sighing in astonishment, Amyes stopped for a bit and continued to exclaim in excitement, “Candide, your Bryan is even more magical. There's almost no way to avoid that attack, yet he used such a miraculous skill to instantly split into four and escape the area of attack. What an incredible boy!”</span><span style>“Of course, otherwise why would I spend so much effort on him?!” Candide was secretly taken aback, but still answered smugly after hearing Amyes’ words.</span><span style>The surroundings were filled with the mix of endless discussion and loud noises. Given this level of excitement from the audience, it was likely that the discussion would only stop when the two fighters resumed their battle.</span><span style>Leah Cain and Han Shuo now had some understanding of their opponent’s strength after such intense exchanges. The originally confident Han Shuo had to tread with more caution, and the dismissive Leah Cain had to put aside his arrogance and treat Han Shuo as his most powerful opponent thus far.</span><span style>The two were standing about fifteen meters from each other at the moment. Leah Cain once again stood on the ground, panting lightly as he glared at Han Shuo.</span><span style>The two men just stood there, staring at each other without a word. After a span of ten breaths, Han Shuo's lips curled into a grin, “Leah Cain, you’re going to die today without a doubt. Your attack just now was truly powerful. Unfortunately, it needs a long time to gather and moreover, exhausts a great deal of your fighting aura, doesn't it?”</span><span style>Leah Cain instantly paled in shock as Han Shuo’s words sounded. It seemed Han Shuo had hit upon the weak point of this skill!</span><span style>Han Shuo shot towards Leah Cain like a lightning bolt at that very moment. The Demonslayer Edge was flying one step ahead, like a snake baring its fangs and biting down on its prey. As Leah Cain used his broadsword to block, the Demonslayer Edge circled around to attack from the other side.</span><span style>Han Shuo also rushed towards Leah Cain, but didn't attack in the manner of the Demonslayer Edge. Instead, he flew into the air and leisurely took out the white bone staff, his mouth starting to chant some incantation. When the Canopy of Necromancy blotted out the sunlight, two evil knights, leading a troop of dark creatures, appeared one by one on the lawn and tightly surrounded Leah Cain.</span><span style>Two evil knights, five hate warriors, twenty zombies, seventy skeletal warriors, and two teams of thirty gargoyles had appeared. Leah Cain was entangled by the Demonslayer Edge and could only stare dumbly at the materializing dark creatures that had surrounded him.</span><span style>“Leah Cain is done for!” Amyes said gracefully before looking at Candide with a smile, and added, “Let's go, we will go together to meet His Majesty. His Majesty will definitely make the right decision with Bryan's value. Hehe, that boy Lawrence's luck isn't bad alright. We should grow closer to him!”</span><span style>“That's right!” Candide nodded before drifting away with Amyes in the direction of the Imperial Palace.</span><span style>The two had yet to completely clear the area when Leah Cain's tragic roars echoed nonstop throughout the entire Garden House area.</span><span style>Lurking underground, the earth elite zombie had grabbed Leah Cain's ankles. The humble little skeleton then caused great injury to Leah Cain with a surreptitious ambush. The two evil knights trampled him to death afterwards. In the end, over a hundred dark creatures had rushed in and ripped him apart. There wasn't a single bone left behind.</span></p>
