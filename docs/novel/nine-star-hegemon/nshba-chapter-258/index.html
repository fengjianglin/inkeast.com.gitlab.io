They had a pair of translucent wings as well as an extremely sinister looking pincer on their mouths.</span></p>

Their pincers were covered in a faint green liquid that emitted an unpleasant stink that caused people to feel a chill.</span></p>

He recognized those little things to be terrifying poisonous insects.</span></p>

They reproduced shockingly quickly, and the speed at which they grew was especially chilling.</span></p>

They weren’t picky about their food. Any corpse was alright with them, whether it was human or beast. The more rotted the corpse was, the more they liked it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to being specialized in eating a corpse’s flesh, their pincers all contained an intense corpse poison. Normally, that poison would let them ingest rotting flesh easier.</span></p>

That kind of poison had no antidote.</span></p>

That poison was different from ordinary poisons. It didn’t target people’s nerves, nor did it target a person’s organs. Instead, it directly rotted your flesh.</span></p>

So their poison was exceptionally terrifying.</span></p>

Tendon Transformation experts were more than capable of using the astral wind released by their weapons to crush them to pieces before they approached.</span></p>

There were three different lines on their bodies, meaning they had advanced three times.</span></p>

Within the thousands and thousands of insects, only one king would be born.</span></p>

In other words, they were kings amongst kings amongst poisonous insects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only were they defensively strong, but their attacking strength was even sharper. Furthermore, over ten thousand of those poisonous king insects had come out of his jar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha, brat, you’ve completely pissed me off now. I’ll let you taste the terror of ten thousand poisonous insects biting your body!” That Favored crazily laughed. However, inside, he was incredibly pained. Those poisonous insects were incredibly precious to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His family had raised them for hundreds of years only to make such a limited stock. It was his most powerful trump card. It was because of this trump card that other Favored were extremely apprehensive towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These poisonous insects’ major weakness was that it was extremely taxing to raise them. That was because once they reached their king level, they had essentially reached their peaks. And along with that, the toxicity in their bodies also reached a peak. Once they released their poison, it would require many years for that toxicity to replenish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most annoying of all, his Spiritual Strength wasn’t strong enough. He could only point out a target for them to attack. However, before they completely devoured that target, they would refuse to return. And so they would all just foolishly release all their toxicity as soon as they were released.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But there was also no way around that. Long Chen’s strength was too abnormal, and his saber was practically unblockable. Each slash of his saber was heavier than a mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could only resign himself to being unlucky. After he killed Long Chen, he would definitely receive a reward from Gui Yan. If that reward included a couple powerful corpses, he wouldn’t have lost out too badly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die!” That Favored roared and crushed a seal. Those ten thousand Corpse Devouring Insects all flew straight towards Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter how brave Long Chen felt himself to be, he still felt a chill in the face of this many sinister Corpse Devouring Insects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He hastily retreated, but he suddenly felt his arms go numb. Because he hadn’t summoned his divine ring while using his heavy saber, he had overexerted his physical body, making his arms numb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hastily putting Devil Decapitator back into his spatial ring, Long Chen quickly retreated. The sky was now filled with Corpse Devouring Insects.&nbsp;</span></p>

Back when he had just advanced to the thirteenth Heavenstage of Blood Condensation, the wind of his fist had been more than capable of crushing rock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, these little insects were only sent flying back for a moment before flying back as if nothing had happened.</span></p>

He was unable to use any strength, and he could only retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha, it’s useless. My Corpse Devouring Insect Kings were chosen out of millions of ordinary Corpse Devouring Insects! Just wait for your death!” That Favored had been chased by Long Chen for a long time, so he was absolutely delighted to see the tables reversed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen got goosebumps just looking at those poisonous insects. Although he didn’t know everything about them, his Pill God memories contained information on all sorts of poisons. He knew that the Corpse Devouring Insect’s poison possessed a terrifying rotting effect and didn’t have an antidote.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And even if he had an antidote in his memories, he had no time to make it now. As he ran, he continuously punched out, using the wind from his first to force them back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Resistance is futile. Just quietly enjoy the sweet release of death, ahahaha!” That Favored was still laughing <strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">crazily&nbsp;</span></strong>at Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Righteous path’s Elders were incredibly nervous. If Long Chen died, that would be a huge blow to all their disciples below. Their rhythm might immediately become unbalanced. That hard-fought advantage they now possessed would immediately disappear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Will Long Chen be okay?”</span></p>

Although Long Chen was a legendary Divergent and wasn’t supposed to die to others, that was just something limited to legends. There was no one who had followed a Divergent’s growth from the start. Otherwise, Ling Yun-zi wouldn’t have taken such a huge risk to determine the truth.</span></p>

He was clearly at the end of the line. His death was only a matter of time.</span></p>

They didn’t even know about his predicament. And even if they did know about it, they were unable to help. The current battlefield was in an odd equilibrium.</span></p>
