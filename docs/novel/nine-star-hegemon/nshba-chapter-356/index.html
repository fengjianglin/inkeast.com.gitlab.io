This was a soul art that took incorporeal Spiritual Strength and turned it into a tangible attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason Beast Tamers were powerful wasn’t just because of their powerful housepets. Their spiritual attacks were also terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This spiritual arrow was three meters long, appearing like a translucent spear that stabbed at Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen punched out. His punch contained his powerful will, and it smashed apart the spiritual arrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, although the spiritual arrow’s outer form had been destroyed, its spiritual attacking power had not weakened at all. A formless energy surged into Long Chen’s forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A spiritual attack was specialized in attacking the soul, and outer forces were unable to affect it. It was impossible to use physical strength to block it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That Spiritual Strength surged into Long Chen, and he immediately felt a burst of intense pain, as if tens of thousands of needles were stabbing into him. He hastily circulated his own Spiritual Strength to defend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen had no techniques when it came to how to properly use his powerful soul. He could only use the simplest and crudest defensive method to block the spiritual attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He involuntarily took a couple steps back, his face slightly pale. Although he had blocked it, he still felt an immense pain.</span></p>

They were extremely terrifying. It was no wonder why senior apprentice-brother Qi, while only being ranked a core disciple in his sect, was still so arrogant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Snow was connected to Long Chen’s mind and soul, so he immediately roared and attacked senior apprentice-brother Qi when he saw Long Chen was injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come be my housepet!” In the face of Little Snow’s charge, senior apprentice-brother Qi wasn’t the slightest bit afraid. In fact, a fanatical expression appeared on his face and he quickly formed hand seals. “First let me erase your spiritual imprint!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following his hand seals, a bizarre mark appeared in front of him. It shot towards Little Snow and directly landed on his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, senior apprentice-brother Qi was shocked to find that there was no reaction at all from Little Snow, and a huge claw smashed down on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?! There’s no spiritual imprint?” He had never imagined that Little Snow was a contractless Magical Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His technique was used to erase Long Chen’s spiritual imprint. Beast Tamers had an understanding of Magical Beasts that others simply did not possess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the spiritual imprint of a contracted Magical Beast was erased, that would be a huge impact on the Magical Beast’s soul, and they would instantly faint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Removing the spiritual imprint in this manner would cause a great deal of harm to a Magical Beast’s soul. A spiritual imprint on a Magical Beast was like a lock on a door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only the owner possessed the key. If they wanted to, they could remove their own spiritual imprint and grant a Magical Beast their freedom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the more domineering method to remove that imprint was to use a powerful soul art and barbarically erase it. It was like taking a hatchet and forcibly cutting off the lock of a door. Naturally, that would badly damage the door as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Senior apprentice-brother Qi had already realized that Long Chen was only a dabbler and not a true Beast Tamer. He fundamentally didn’t understand ways to use Spiritual Strength. It was unknown just what trick he had used in order to obtain this mutated Snow Wolf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was why the first thing he tried was to remove Little Snow’s spiritual imprint and make him lose consciousness. Then when he awoke, he would place his own spiritual imprint and make Little Snow his housepet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Little Snow didn’t have a spiritual imprint. And yet, he had clearly seen Little Snow be summoned out of Long Chen’s spiritual space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before senior apprentice-brother Qi even realized what was going on, Little Snow’s claw ruthlessly smashed into him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BANG!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A shield suddenly appeared in front of senior apprentice-brother Qi’s body. That wasn’t a physical shield he was holding with his hand, but a shield formed from Spiritual Strength. It floated in front of his body and blocked Little Snow’s attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Senior apprentice-brother Qi retreated quickly after blocking his attack. He was completely bewildered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fine. Since you don’t have a spiritual imprint, then I’ll help you gain one!” He once more formed hand seals. This time, his Spiritual Strength was completely activated, and a strange mark appeared behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen recognized that as a character from ancient times: SLAVE. He wanted to enslave Little Snow. Killing intent surged out of Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Senior apprentice-brother Qi seemed fanatical as he poured in more Spiritual Strength. Millions of threads began to shoot out of the SLAVE character, attempting to reach Little Snow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Snow instinctively had a bad feeling, and shot backwards. He felt an extremely uneasy sensation when he looked at that character.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe, it’s useless! You’ve been locked onto by my soul so you can’t run! Just obediently become my housepet!” Senior apprentice-brother Qi smiled sinisterly. Currently, all he was focused on was Little Snow. He didn’t even glance at Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From his previous attack, he could already tell Long Chen’s strength. Although Long Chen had a vast Spiritual Strength, he had no idea how to use it. He could easily kill him whenever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he felt that killing Long Chen just like this wouldn’t be able to resolve the hatred he had for him, so he was thinking of subduing Little Snow and then using him to kill Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To die to his own housepet, that was an interesting punishment. And so he chose to ignore Long Chen for now and focus on Little Snow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that he was on guard, even if Long Chen wanted to sneak attack him, it would be useless. That was why he was brazen enough to ignore him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Snow was panicked. No matter how he dodged, that huge spiritual imprint continued to attempt to trap him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He even tried shooting out a wind blade, but it passed straight through that spiritual imprint as if it were smoke. It was sliced in half, but it quickly reformed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can’t run!” Senior apprentice-brother Qi was watching Little Snow be entrapped by his spiritual imprint with zeal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a Beast Tamer, he was an expert at capturing Magical Beasts. As long as Little Snow was trapped by that spiritual imprint, he would never be able to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buzz.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“AHHH!” Senior apprentice-brother Qi immediately screamed mournfully, sounding like a malicious spirit. He clenched his head and crazily rolled on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen apathetically put down his hand. Just now he had used his thunderforce to destroy senior apprentice-brother Qi’s spiritual imprint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had long since heard of the power of Beast Tamers. If he didn’t have his own ways to protect himself, he would have instead instantly killed senior apprentice-brother Qi so that there would have been no way for him to counterattack with his special skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Long Chen had always been curious about the ways Beast Tamers attacked. That was why he had just been probing senior apprentice-brother Qi’s abilities. But that idiot had taken that to mean he was completely helpless and just waiting for death.</span></p>

It had an immense suppressive effect against Spiritual Strength.</span></p>

That was the only way to use a steady flow of Spiritual Strength to control the Magical Beast.</span></p>

The amount of pain he was enduring now was a hundred times what Long Chen had endured previously.</span></p>

If you kill him in one attack, that’ll be letting him off far too lightly. For such a person, you have to play with them with a proper sequence, a good rhythm, and creativity, all so you can play them to death. Otherwise, how will you make it up to his parents who raised him while cleaning up his crap and piss?” Long Chen shook his head, disagreeing with Little Snow’s suggestion.</span></p>

He no longer cared about subduing Little Snow as a housepet. The space between his eyebrows split apart and blood flowed out. “Blood Soul Spear!”</span></p>

Magical Beasts had an innate fear of spiritual attacks. That was because Magical Beasts possessed extremely weak Spiritual Strength.</span></p>

Those three Magical Beasts he had controlled were his limit. With his current level of Spiritual Strength, there was no way for him to control more. If one of those Magical Beasts launched a counterattack while his Spiritual Strength was stretched to its limit, he would be doomed.</span></p>

That way his strength would greatly increase.</span></p>

Although it was also a fourth rank Magical beast, in front of Little Snow, it was unable to endure a single blow. Right now, it was still lying powerlessly in the distance.</span></p>
