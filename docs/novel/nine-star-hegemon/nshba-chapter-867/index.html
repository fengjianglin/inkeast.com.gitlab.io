 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen was startled, thinking Leng Yueyan had attacked Yue Xiaoqian. But that azure light was just a spiritual imprint, and it didn’t possess any offensive power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yue Xiaoqian extended a hand and caught it. The light disappeared, but Yue Xiaoqian was delighted. “Many thanks, big sister!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leng Yueyan shook her head. “Although there’s nothing I need inside, I still owe you a favor. If it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t have recognized what these coffins were. I, Leng Yueyan, dislike owing favors. Now that I’ve returned it, we’ll be enemies the next time we meet, because next time, I will cut down this fellow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After saying that, Leng Yueyan walked away in front of everyone’s uncomprehending gazes. She clearly was intent on leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen also didn’t comprehend it. Leng Yueyan had clearly told Yue Xiaoqian something, but for her to leave just like this surprised him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing her leave, everyone relaxed. With her here, the pressure was just too great, especially in this region where magical arts were forbidden. Her speed was too shocking, and without magical arts, they wouldn’t even have a chance to run.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahaha, I didn’t expect this place to be so lively. Even some legendary figures have appeared. Looks like my luck isn’t bad.” Suddenly, a thunderous laugh rang out from the sky. A large figure with wings floated down slowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yu Changhao?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was startled. The only people that naturally had wings in the Eastern Wasteland were the Feather race. Furthermore, this person’s incredibly powerful aura meant he had to be their number one expert, Yu Changhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Changhao floated within this forbidden zone, as his wings were not formed through a magical art. In this region, perhaps he was the only one capable of flying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once he arrived, he stopped right in front of Leng Yueyan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leng Yueyan paused and icily looked at him. “Scram!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Changhao didn’t get angry. In fact, he laughed. “As expected, you’re just like the legends. I’ve long since heard the grand name of the arrogant god-like Devil Empress Leng Yueyan. Excellent, you’re very much to my taste. Only a woman like you is worthy of me subduing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leng Yueyan examined Yu Changhao and shook her head. “I’m not interested in a man like you. Get out of my way. I still have things to do, and I’m too busy to kill people!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Changhao was slightly surprised. Although he had long since heard that Leng Yueyan was incomparably arrogant, he hadn’t expected her to treat him like he was nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A wild horse is the best. Hehe, then let me see whether I can subdue you or not!” Yu Changhao snorted and extended a hand toward Leng Yueyan’s chest. He was originally three hundred meters from her, but as he moved, he suddenly appeared before her. Almost nobody was able to see how he had done that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your speed’s not bad, but it’ll still not enough,” said Leng Yueyan indifferently. Suddenly, her bone blade slashed through the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her terrifying speed made it look like she was directly cutting through space. People even saw the space around her sword twist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That wasn’t from a magical art, but something that would happen when something’s speed was pushed to the pinnacle. When Leng Yueyan had attacked Long Chen, no one had seen it clearly since they hadn’t been expecting it. It was like it had ended before starting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, they had long since been waiting with rapt attention. But even so, they were only able to see that blade’s image flash for a moment. They were fundamentally incapable of tracking her sword with their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leng Yueyan’s sword was slashing straight toward Yu Changhao’s throat with her terrifying speed and at a crafty angle. Yu Changhao, who had long since been prepared, snorted. He continued with his claw, while his other hand reached toward her sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leng Yueyan’s mouth curled into a smile of ridicule. When he saw that smile, Yu Changhao finally had a bad feeling. But as a peak expert, he had confidence in his move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as his hand was about to touch her bone blade, countless tiny runes appeared on his palm. That wasn’t a magical art, but his bloodline runes. They were also his core runes. This formation did not strip him of those.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was one of Yu Changhao’s most effective moves. Countless experts had fallen to this move. He had absolute confidence in it, which was why he dared to block Leng Yueyan’s bone blade with his bare hand. Even if it was a Treasure item, he had confidence in stopping it within one breath’s time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was enough to determine victory or defeat. This was a move he had tempered through countless battles and the lives of countless experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His hand caught Leng Yueyan’s sword. Yu Changhao was delighted, thinking to himself that Leng Yueyan was only at this level. As expected, rumors were always exaggerated. He smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But that smile quickly disappeared, because he was horrified to sense fluctuations constantly coming from the bone sword. His hand only caught it for a moment before it slicked through his grasp as if it was covered in oil. It was impossible for him to hold it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leng Yueyan’s slash turned into a pierce. Her bone sword was now piercing straight toward his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Changhao was horrified. He had no choice but to stop his attack. The hand grabbing the bone blade fiercely pulled away, causing her attack to deviate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But just at that moment, he found that the bone sword began to release an absorptive force. It pulled him in closer. Leng Yueyan seemed to have long since expected all of this, and the moment he tried to pull her sword away, she used that opportunity to escape his grasp. Even with Yu Changhao’s quick reactions, he still staggered forward half a step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not good!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just at that moment, the soft absorptive force from the bone blade disappeared. It slashed straight toward his head. If this attack struck, half his head would be sliced off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wings behind Yu Changhao’s body suddenly lit up, and he shot back. It was like something had fiercely pulled him from behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This happened incredibly quickly. It was over in the blink of an eye. People felt like their vision had merely blurred for an instant before everything became still.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Changhao was back in his original position, three hundred meters from Leng Yueyan. It was like that exchange hadn’t even happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leng Yueyan sheathed her bone blade and indifferently said, “You want to subdue me with just this little ability? I have to admire your courage. Your speed is insufficient, and your battle techniques are also not good enough. Perhaps by relying on your core energy, you can fight me for a short while, but you don’t even have a ten percent chance of defeating me. Letting you see some of your own blood can count as an admonishment for your arrogance. If I didn’t have more pressing matters, this world would no longer have a Yu Changhao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leng Yueyan’s icy voice was beautiful, but it caused everyone to feel a chill. They saw a stream of blood coming from Yu Changhao’s forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Changhao had managed to block her fatal attack, but he had still been injured. From that injury, it was possible to see bone. If he had just been the slightest bit slower, he would be dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as everyone was filled with shock, Leng Yueyan stamped lightly on the ground and shot into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once free from the formation, a pair of runic wings appeared on her back. Her scarlet dress danced in the wind, making her look like a goddess. Her sapphire eyes locked onto Long Chen. “Long Chen, you’re the man I care about the most. Don’t disappoint me. Next time we meet, I hope you can block my attack.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After saying that, Leng Yueyan’s wings flapped, and she disappeared in front of their gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Crazy, absolutely crazy. Long Chen raged to himself. Just how had he brought such a crazy woman upon himself?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xiaoqian, what did she say to you?” Long Chen asked Yue Xiaoqian secretly using a spiritual message. This kind of spiritual message was something that could only be used between two people that trusted each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they were strangers, both parties wouldn’t want to accept the spiritual message. If someone had evil intentions, they could use a spiritual attack during the transmission while the other party’s guard was down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for that azure light Leng Yueyan had shot out, it was a different kind of spiritual message. Yue Xiaoqian had been able to safely accept it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That big sister said-”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t call her big sister. She’s just a crazy woman, and my enemy. Don’t get tricked,” warned Long Chen. Yue Xiaoqian had pitifully little experience. It was best if she didn’t mistake Leng Yueyan for an ally. After all, Leng Yueyan was a vicious character. Being merciful to her was suicidal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay. She told me that there is something I need within one of these coffins,” said Yue Xiaoqian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Her Voidpiercing Eyes are said to be able to pierce through all fabrications to see the truth. Perhaps she really did see something. Although she’s crazy, there’s not much of a problem when it comes to her trustworthiness,” said Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She isn’t tricking me. I am extremely sensitive to other people’s lies, and that sense is unrelated to cultivation base. I’m sure,” said Yue Xiaoqian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, then we’ll trust her this once. But even if we know this, it’s useless. With this protective formation, we can’t go in.” Long Chen couldn’t help but curse Leng Yueyan inside. If she wanted to be a good person, she should have acted good all the way until the end. If they weren’t able to get through his formation, what she had told them would be useless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Long Chen was wondering how to get through this formation, the others finally recovered from their shock at Leng Yueyan and Yu Changhao’s exchange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although that had been a simple exchange, it had contained the essence of battle, the essence of the Martial Dao. There was a great deal that could be learned from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Changhao also only recovered from his shock now. He had never expected Leng Yueyan to be this powerful. He was also furious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His previous words had truly been too arrogant. Now he had fallen into this miserable state in front of countless elites. It could be said that he had lost all his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, Yu Changhao saw Yue Xiaoqian whispering to Long Chen. It was unknown whether it was because of what Leng Yueyan had said just before leaving, but his fury immediately erupted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Die!” Yu Changhao’s wings lit up as he shot toward Long Chen with incredible speed. One of his claws reached toward his throat.</span></p>
