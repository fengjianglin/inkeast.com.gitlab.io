 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sparkling yuan spirit stones lay in Long Chen’s hand. They were definitely yuan spirit stones, as their specific spiritual yuan seeped out of them. However… there were only three pieces of them in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, just three. The three Kings glared at him, their eyes almost spitting flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking of how Long Chen had put on such a pained expression, then adding on their previous expressions of delight, these three yuan spirit stones were a resounding slap in the face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who has time to dupe you? Everything else I had was used on the protective formation. Now, I only have these three. They’re the only ones I have for my own use,” raged Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three of them didn’t believe a word he said. He was clearly being a cheapskate, but they were powerless to do anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hand over your spatial ring and let us investigate it! If there really is nothing, we’ll leave!” said the ancient family alliance’s King, his eye on the spatial ring Long Chen was wearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen’s ‘expression suddenly changed’, and he shouted, “Fuck off, why should I let you investigate my spatial ring? It’s mine!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three of them immediately assumed he had to have plenty of yuan spirit stones in his spatial ring. The ancient races’ King shouted, “Hmph, if you really were telling the truth, then hand over your spatial ring. If you really don’t have any, we’ll leave just like this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You… you really are intolerable bullies! Lu Tianhua, what do you say?” demanded Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Tianhua immediately became stuck in an awkward position. Although he was greedy for Long Chen’s yuan spirit stones, he also felt that offending a madman like Long Chen wasn’t a smart decision. The gains might not make up for the losses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But in the end, he stood with the other two, thickening his face and saying, “Long Chen, don’t make a fuss. It’s rude to try duping people as prestigious as us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ouyang Qiuyu sighed inside. A small Sea Expansion brat had forced a King to this point, making it so he could only say such cowardly words. Perhaps only Long Chen was capable of that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Tianhua continued, “But we won’t bully you. You killed two of my beloved apprentices and exterminated countless members of the ancient races and ancient families’ disciples. How about you just split us half the yuan spirit stones in your spatial ring?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Changfeng nodded inside. Lu Tianhua had already conceded. Li Changfeng’s guess was that since Long Chen could use over a thousand yuan spirit stones on the protective formation, he had to have at least around ten thousand yuan spirit stones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Parting with half of them might be a bit painful, but Long Chen really had caused too much trouble this time. Even his heart was pounding hard. If this matter could be settled just like this, it was probably the best case scenario.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, those are your own words! Here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen harrumphed and took off his spatial ring, tossing it to Lu Tianhua. Lu Tianhua extended his divine sense into it, and his expression instantly became exceedingly ugly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This spatial ring was incredibly precious. It had reached the Treasure item level. The space inside was dozens of miles wide, and there were even tens of Treasure items inside it. The medicinal pills, armor, and materials inside were innumerable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a yuan spirit stone inside. Yes, just one. It lay there, isolated and alone. Its sparkling light was like a silent laugh of derision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, you’re the one who said that you would only take half. Originally, I only had four yuan spirit stones after setting up the grand formation, so now you have to give me back one of the three I gave you. Then I can properly hoard those two yuan spirit stones,” sneered Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen had long since expected such a scene. All his valuables were within the primal chaos space. This spatial ring was just bait for others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With just a thought, he could move items from the spatial ring to his primal chaos space. The spaces and treasures inside were essentially connected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To make his spatial ring seem more real, he had even added a few Treasure items. But they were all garbage. Most of them were damaged. Considering what had happened in the Immemorial Path, it would only make sense for him to have some battle spoils. If he didn’t even put one Treasure item inside, it would appear fake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the Treasure items obtained in the battle against the Corrupt path, they had all been given to Ouyang Qiuyu. The King items had broken, and Long Chen hadn’t kept any of the Treasure items. They had all been left for Ouyang Qiuyu so that she could raise the Xuantian Dao Sect in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t believe you! You definitely left your yuan spirit stones on one of your confidants!” raged the ancient races’ King when Lu Tianhua passed him the spatial ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Idiot, yuan spirit stones are spiritual treasures of heaven and earth. Only my Treasure-class spatial ring is able to just barely manage to store the yuan spirit stones. The others don’t have such a high-level spatial ring,” sneered Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing that, they realized it was the truth. Was that supposed to mean Long Chen only had this spatial ring? Then they would basically be leaving empty-handed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, from his confidence, he didn't seem afraid of them investigating further. Then thinking of his feigned ‘changed expression’, they all realized they had been duped. They had already promised that they would leave like this. To go back on their word was just smearing themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Which one of you was the one who said-”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen was just about to continue pushing them when Li Changfeng suddenly said, “Long Chen, there’s no longer any need for you to stay here. Bring our two guests to experience the Xuantian Dao Sect’s scenery. Don’t neglect your respected guests.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Changfeng also realized that no one could force Long Chen to spit out more yuan spirit stones if he didn’t want to. He directly began to act as if Long Chen really didn’t have any more of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no longer any need for Long Chen to stay here. This disobedient disciple should be sent off as quickly as possible. Only once he was gone would this matter be easier to settle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, then disciple will take his leave.” Long Chen bowed slightly to Li Changfeng. After all, the feeling he got from Li Changfeng wasn’t that bad. He was someone worthy of respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ling Yunzi and Feng Xinglie disapproved of this kind of negotiation, especially Feng Xinglie. He was sneering disdainfully at their display.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three of them left. Ling Yunzi said, “Long Chen, you can accompany senior brother Feng for now. I came over here not just to see you, but also to see Zifeng. I’ll go see him first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once Ling Yunzi had left, Feng Xinglie patted Long Chen on the shoulder and said, “Brat you have some guts. I like it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xinglie greatly appreciated Long Chen. He had always thought only the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect could raise a figure like him who was unafraid of heaven or earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Third uncle, you came this time to…?” probed Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come, let’s find a place to talk.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen hadn’t expected that the place Feng Xinglie would choose was a secluded valley outside of the Xuantian Dao Sect. On the way, Long Chen learned that when Feng Xinglie had been roused out of meditation to go handle his matter, he had irritably started a fight with his senior who had ordered him. Unable to defeat the senior, he could only dejectedly come over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, I was pretty pissed when I got here, but now I’m happy. I didn’t expect you to be this mature,” laughed Feng Xinglie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Third uncle, you rushed all the way here over for this little one…” Long Chen was grateful. He hadn’t expected the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect to look after him so well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t talk about such useless things. The matter from the Jiuli secret realm has already passed. Our Heaven Splitting Battle Sect protects its people, but that also depends on the person. Our disciples have to be tough and courageous. A greedy little fellow willing to work together with others to kill someone for greed can’t count as a disciple of my Heaven Splitting Battle Sect. The fact that you killed him is a good thing, or it’s unknown how much embarrassment he would have brought to the sect in the future.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That little fellow transmitted the second form of Split the Heavens to you last time, and he also received some benefits from you and returned to the sect. When he did, the sect found you to be a hotblooded man who cares for ties and relationships. And so it was decided that we would not pursue you for learning Split the Heavens. Furthermore, you were pretty good, killing expert after expert during this time. The higher-ups are satisfied, especially with what you did in the Immemorial Path. To tell the truth, the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect needs fearless geniuses like you. Your ability to cause trouble is perfect. Even the old man said that although you haven’t formally been accepted into the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, you will still be viewed as one of our disciples,” said Feng Xinglie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen really hadn’t expected the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect to be so magnanimous and understanding. Instead of finding trouble for him because he had killed one of their disciples, they took him in as one of their own.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Full power?”</span></p>

That will could shatter the world and perfectly accorded with the will of Split the Heavens.</span></p>
