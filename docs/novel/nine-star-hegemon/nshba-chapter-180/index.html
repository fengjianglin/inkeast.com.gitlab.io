By the time the third day was over, everyone’s spirits had already recovered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that life and death experience, after a tempering of blood and fire, the brilliance within this group of spoiled disciples had finally begun to blossom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they couldn’t be said to have already unsheathed their sharp airs, at the very least they were no longer a group of trash. They already had the embryonic air of experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thousands of disciples had gathered in the Xuantian plaza. This huge plaza that was hundreds of miles wide was bustling with noise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the center of the plaza was a huge sculpture hundreds of meters tall. That sculpture was of a man with a longsword in his hand. He pointed up to the heavens with a will that wished to destroy the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That statue was said to the be Xuantian Dao Sect’s ancestral founder. However this statue seemed as if it had already existed here before the Xuantian Monastery had even been established. After the erosion of time, it was already somewhat broken down. But that disdainful will hadn’t changed in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Below that huge statue were hundreds of green-robed disciples that were frantically bustling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were men and women amongst them, but the majority were women. They were currently nervously sticking some small syringes into the arms of the disciples. After taking out a drop of blood and putting it into metal container, they also recorded the name, gender, age, and other information about that disciple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the fringe of the plaza were two youths sitting below a large tree. One of them was squinting at that sculpture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After staring for a while, he asked the other, “Guo Ran, are you sure we should go up last?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Guo Ran confidently said, “Trust me boss, according to my information, those people collecting blood are all newbies who just joined the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Letting them collect blood is a trial for them. At the beginning they’ll all poke you several times with those needles before finally getting a drop of essence blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you don’t believe me, just look at how nervous they are. Even their hands are trembling. Trust me boss, I can’t possibly be wrong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen truly did see those people were extremely nervous. But wasn’t it just to take out a drop of blood? There was no need for them to be like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, to give Guo Ran face, Long Chen didn’t say anything. The two of them just stared up at that statue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t know why, but looking at this statue, it almost felt as if this statue was alive. Although that kind of thinking was laughable, he was sure he felt it. That feeling was extremely mysterious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay boss, it’s time. Almost everyone’s gone, so we can go now too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The time had flown by without him knowing as he stared at the statue. Almost everyone had finished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen nodded. Previously there had been many people, including Lei Qianshang and Qi Xin. He also saw a couple of very powerful fellows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had agreed to Guo Ran’s suggestions also because he didn’t want to run into those fellows. As soon as they saw Long Chen they would start wildly sneering and barking at him like a dog.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen felt there was no need to disgrace himself by exchanging insults with them. He didn’t want to be mocked by the people of the other four areas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he had secretly observed that there really were many powerful figures appearing. Their auras were shocking, not at all inferior to Lei Qianshang and them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just now Lei Qianshang had almost gotten into a fight with another core disciple. The both of them were extremely arrogant and had disdainfully looked down on the other, creating sparks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But unfortunately, just as those sparks were about to explode, they were shooed off by the senior disciples in charge of this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those disciples were actually familiar to Long Chen. One of them was that grave senior apprentice-brother Wan he had seen at the beginning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Guo Ran and Long Chen walked up now that everyone had left, so senior apprentice-brother Wan just happened to see Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He nodded to him, “Not bad. I heard everything about what happened in the trial.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe, didn’t I end up failing in the end? Don’t tease junior disciple like this. Sorry we came late. The inspections aren’t over yet, right?” laughed Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen’s gut told him this senior apprentice-brother Wan was an old-fashioned person who wouldn’t casually laugh at others. That kind of person was extremely upright, causing others to easily form good opinions of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re not late. I still have some work to do so I’ll be going.” Senior apprentice-brother Wan turned and left, but before he did, a strange light flashed in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen immediately felt something was off. Looking at the place to register, he saw there were over a dozen maidens that were red from being scolded by their senior apprentice-sister.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had no idea what they were doing. One of the people in charge of the registration was just boringly playing with her brush.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sorry to trouble you, but we came late. Can we still register?” politely said Guo Ran.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That person turned to look at Long Chen and Guo Ran, her expression filled with absolute delight, looking as if they had just saved her life. She excitedly called out to the people behind her, “Those of you who haven’t finished the trial, quickly come! There’s two more people here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those maidens who were dispiritedly being scolded immediately became like they had heard the sounds of heaven and turned to stare at Long Chen and Guo Ran.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of them were given a fright. They looked like hungry wolves looking at two sheep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A quarter hour later, both Guo Ran and Long Chen dispiritedly left the plaza, their entire upper arms feeling like they had been stung by bees.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In all his years, Long Chen had never been used as an experimental object to be used by others. But in front of those lovely and pitiful junior sisters, how could he have the heart to refuse?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person in charge of that trial had said that if those maidens’ techniques were not satisfactory, they would be forced to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a result, those sisters had practically begged them for help. Guo Ran and Long Chen had surrendered to them, resulting in this miserable end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Guo Ran, this was your plan?” Long Chen took a deep breath, trying to keep his contempt from his voice. However, he found he really was unable to do that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“About that… boss, that was definitely just an exception. Next time it won’t happen again.” Guo Ran was also depressed. No one could have expected the situation would end up like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Xuantian Monastery was extremely large, so even walking back took a long time. Just to go from the plaza to their mountain required a full two hours of their time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time they got back, everyone was already gathered. Tang Wan-er glared at the two of them angrily, “What were you two doing?! Hurry up, the rewards are already being passed out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only then did Long Chen realize there was a small jug in front of everyone. Those jugs were similar to wine jugs, but he wondered what was inside these.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Guo Ran was given a jug, but as for Long Chen’s portion, Tang Wan-er did not give it to him. “Inside the jugs is Ten Thousand Beast Essence Blood. Absorb the essence blood inside and your body’s blood energy will rise to the peak, giving you a high chance of a flawless advancement.”</span></p>

It would definitely have an effect on their future cultivation, but it was much, much less than the impact of a flawed advancement.</span></p>

It was even more flawless than flawless, a level of advancement that simply could not be hoped for. Even monster-class geniuses would need to rely on luck and opportunity for that. And so most people wouldn’t even try for such an extravagant level.</span></p>

You have to drink enough that you don’t even recognize your own family and boast so shamelessly than even you can’t believe your own words. Ah, young people really do need to train more.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wan-er rolled her eyes at him and taunted, “Keep laughing. If you don’t want top grade Ten Thousand Beast Essence Blood, then just keep on laughing there. I’m going home.”</span></p>
