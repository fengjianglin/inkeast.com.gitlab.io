Their lives were much more important. No matter how good the opportunity was, if you didn’t have your life to enjoy it, it was still no use.</span></p>

Within the cultivation world, time was like a constantly flowing river. Three months went by extremely quickly.</span></p>

That image was an endless blood sea. Although it looked like a picture, an incredibly concentrated blood odor came from it, one that caused all of heaven and earth to change color.</span></p>

I’ll flay your skin, tear out your muscles, and turn your bones to dust.” These words were normally ones that were spat out through clenched teeth, but they were said with such a calm expression that it was even more frightening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A tall man was standing with his hands clasped behind his back. His eyes radiated a bright light that was like the point of a sharp blade, making it so others didn’t dare look directly at him.</span></p>

His handsome face contained an endless iciness.</span></p>

However, he was even more handsome than him. He was Han Tianfeng’s big brother, the supermonastery’s number one expert, Han Tianyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, there were over a dozen people surrounding him. One of those people was the one Long Chen hated with all his being, Yin Wushuang. Yin Wushuang wrapped around Han Tianyu’s arm and said, “Brother Tianyu, let’s go kill Long Chen right now to get revenge for Tianfeng.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Wushuang had truly been terrified by Long Chen. Long Chen had become a serious heart-devil for her, and she couldn’t even close her eyes anymore without seeing his face. That face was one filled with killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had become incredibly cowardly now, not even able to travel alone. She had to have a large group of people by her side so that she could use them to run in case Long Chen found her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These past three months had felt as long as thirty years for her. She wasn’t even able to sleep, let alone cultivate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once Han Tianyu had left seclusion, he had activated his specific communication device, and Yin Wushuang had immediately rushed over. She felt that the safest place in this world was by Han Tianyu’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let him live a few more days. To directly kill him is letting him off too lightly. Send out the news that I’ve exited seclusion and that depending on my mood, I’ll take his life whenever I want. Tell him to wash his neck and wait for me,” said Han Tianyu lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then that’s good. Let’s make it so he has to spend every day restlessly waiting to die.” Yin Wushuang clenched her teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>

Countless experts were coming out of their seclusion. The secret realm immediately became lively again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this liveliness was accompanied by endless slaughter and blood. As experts came out, huge battles were fought everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people exiting seclusion at this time were all top experts extremely confident in themselves. As for those people who were weaker, they were still in seclusion. Just increasing their cultivation base by the slightest bit was worth it to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Atop Compass Mountain, Long Chen and the others also exited their seclusion. What gratified Long Chen was that everyone’s cultivation bases had reached the mid Bone Forging realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Tang Wan-er, who possessed a gold Spirit Root, she had reached the seventh Heavenstage of Bone Forging, which was the highest out of all of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, as she constantly refined the purest energy from the wind spirit stones, her wind energy once more transformed, and her wind blades had become much more solid and sharp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wan-er was the one with the highest cultivation base, but second place was not Meng Qi or the others. What was surprising was that it was actually Guo Ran. He had reached the peak of the sixth Heavenstage, and he could advance to the seventh Heavenstage at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That had shocked all of them. Only Long Chen was still calm. He knew that Guo Ran walked an alternative path, and he wouldn’t run into any bottlenecks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As long as he continued to firmly believe he could rely on forging items to become a crafting god, then by continuously consuming medicinal pills, his cultivation base would grow quickly and constantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But as soon as he received an impact on his Forging Dao, as soon as his confidence was shaken, then his cultivation base would forever stall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen had already warned him about that, but Guo Ran had still decided to choose that path. He was blazing an unwalked path to godhood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Walking that path was extremely dangerous, but at the same time, high risk signified high reward. Up until now, Guo Ran’s decision had been extremely correct.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Other than Luo Cang who was still at the fourth Heavenstage, the others had reached the fifth or sixth Heavenstage. That level of cultivation base was enough to shock the entire secret realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was all because Long Chen had decided to refine ringed high grade pills. Because of that, his pill furnaces had all been ruined, and he didn’t have a single one anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, those trash furnaces had at least served their mission in the end before breaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, Wilde also had come over. He had already finished the Violet Phoenix Sparrow and was now working on the Barbaric Wind Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wilde’s body hadn’t necessarily changed much this entire&nbsp;time, but his skin had turned a bronze color. With his current strength, he could crush steel into smithereens. His physical body was even more powerful than a Magical Beast’s.</span></p>

Even when Song Mingyuan launched a full power attack, he was only able to leave a small white mark on Wilde’s skin.</span></p>

This was no longer even human. Was there really someone who was impervious to sword or spear?</span></p>

This mark wasn’t something Wilde had called out, but something that had automatically appeared. That mark seemed to be hiding a volcano that might explode at any moment.</span></p>

Now their squad could truly be called elites amongst elites.</span></p>

It was just that those with softer temperaments like Meng Qi and Chu Yao wouldn’t release that kind of undefeatable will.</span></p>

Their hearts had long since become tempered, and when they fought, their will far surpassed the other so-called Chosen.</span></p>

They were completely different.</span></p>

The reason they had all managed to grow so fast was because they had alternated hunting and cultivating.</span></p>

They weren’t as berserk as their mother, and they were extremely loyal. There was basically no need to worry about them suddenly betraying the ladies. This was definitely because of the great care the four women had given them as they grew up.</span></p>

Once they fully accepted a master, they would never betray that person in their lifetime. Compared to fickle humans, Magical Beasts were actually much more trustworthy.</span></p>

Little Snow had shrunk a great deal and was now only ten meters long.</span></p>

In other words, Little Snow had truly completely mutated and his rank would no longer be held back by his bloodline. As for how far he could actually grow, no one knew.</span></p>

But even that ancient text had only said that this was only a theoretical possibility. As for whether it was actually possible, it hadn’t said.</span></p>
