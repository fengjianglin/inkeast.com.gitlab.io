 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A life and death match?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was shocked. Long Chen wanted to kill? Did he really have the confidence to fight a rank two Celestial?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, how ignorant!” snorted Shui Yuncong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, truly ignorant.” Shui Wuhen nodded. But the same word had a different meaning in her mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Wuhen knew that Long Chen was truly furious. He could accept anything, but he couldn’t accept others hurting his comrades, especially not when they were someone impossible for them to defeat and when they used such despicable methods. Once that happened, Long Chen would become a completely different person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you think you’re fit to have a life and death match with me? I won’t kill you today, but I’ll crush every single one of your bones to dust!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Long Chen walk out of the storm zone, Shui Guanzhi was delighted. As long as he wasn’t in the storm zone, then he didn’t have anything to worry about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen, I’ll make you regret provoking me!” Shui Guanzhi suddenly spread his hands. Countless runes appeared in the space between them, forming a huge arrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The arrow continued to grow, becoming hundreds of meters long. It was formed entirely of his runes, and a terrifying pressure spread that caused the other disciples’ expressions to change. This level of attack could instantly kill them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The huge arrow shot toward Long Chen. It wasn’t fast, but it caused the void to rumble. Its powerful aura had locked down Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t play this kind of senseless game. Bring out your full strength, or you’ll die.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Long Chen completely disappeared. When he reappeared, he was right by Shui Guanzhi’s side, and his saber was slashing at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?!” Everyone was shocked that Long Chen could ignore Shui Guanzhi’s lock and escape this attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But was Shui Guanzhi trying to make a joke? If you wanted to lock down your opponent, you either needed stronger Spiritual Strength or a greater aura than your opponent. He had truly underestimated Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite immediately summoning a water shield and retreating, Shui Guanzhi was still cut by Long Chen’s Saber Qi. Blood burst from his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he had been any slower, he would have been cleanly cut in two. Long Chen’s Netherworld Ghost Steps were too difficult to deal with. As his cultivation base had grown, he discovered just how exquisite this technique was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His speed was too fast, so fast that others couldn’t even react. The Celestials were especially horrified. They would be killed without even realizing it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The vice sect master narrowed his eyes upon seeing Long Chen’s footwork. He felt it was a bit familiar, but he wasn’t sure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Yuncong and the rest of the Shui family all jumped upon seeing Shui Guanzhi injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heavenly Dao Recovery!” Shui Guanzhi was also shocked. Just now, he had instinctively shot back upon sensing the danger. If he hadn’t, he would have died. Now, he no longer dared to be careless. He directly summoned his true Cry of the Heavenly Daos. Previously, he had only activated a portion of his runic power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had always thought that summoning the Cry of the Heavenly Daos would just be elevating Long Chen’s status. But now he finally realized that if he continued playing around like this, he might play himself to his grave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BOOM! With Shui Guanzhi at the core, two kinds of Heavenly Dao runes erupted. Space trembled as they interweaved. Even the flow of the current was forced aside by his power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For many people, this was their first time seeing the manifestation of a rank two Celestial. It was much more terrifying than ordinary Celestials. Even from a hundred miles away, this pressure made it hard for people to breathe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are they really going to undergo a heaven-shaking battle?” The disciples were filled with anticipation. It was rare to witness a battle on this level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Long Chen began to rush away, instantly disappearing from other people’s sights. People were at first astonished that he was running, but then Long Chen said, “Let’s switch locations.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In order to not disturb others, Long Chen wanted to change the battlefield. That filled these disciples with gratitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Guanzhi snorted and followed. Today, he was completely infuriated. This was his first time being slapped in the face. Although he couldn’t kill Long Chen in front of everyone like this, he could definitely humiliate him as much as he pleased to retrieve his dignity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, he no longer even cared that much about the trial. If he didn’t defeat Long Chen, he would become the Xuantian Dao Sect’s laughingstock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t just stand there. Even if you want to watch the fight, watch from inside,” said Long Chen to the Dragonblood Legion. Because he was following the current, he reached the edge of the basin in just a moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Yang and the others hastily nodded. This trial was an extremely rare opportunity. They had already sensed immense benefits. The people who had been knocked unconscious had awoken, and they once more returned to their original location.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With their previous experience, their speed was much faster. By the time they reached their original location, Long Chen and Shui Guanzhi were already facing each other in the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The vice sect master didn’t stop them, nor did he have any plans to. For a genius to rise within a sect was a good thing. But if multiple geniuses rose, they would definitely fight. Geniuses were all extremely self-confident. They only wanted to recognize themselves as geniuses. Each of them wanted to be king, to be the sole ruler.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That wasn’t a bad thing. Geniuses needed all kinds of motivation and passion to get stronger. If everything was peaceful and perfect, a genius would have no drive. It was an iron law of the world that competition was required. This was a rule that no one could change, and so the vice sect master only watched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whether it was the disciples in the Xuantian Sea or the four families’ experts, everyone’s focus was on Long Chen and Shui Guanzhi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Although I can’t kill you, I can return the humiliation you’ve given me a thousand times!” said Shui Guanzhi arrogantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then be careful. I, Long Chen, am not good at fighting. I’m only good at killing. If I accidentally kill you, don’t blame me!” Long Chen shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Arrogant! I’ll let you experience the true power of a rank two Celestial, a power you can only look up to!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BOOM! Shui Guanzhi’s runes suddenly blossomed with light as if they had come alive. A terrifying pressure crashed down on the ground, causing space to tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ground beneath Long Chen’s feet suddenly cracked. Although Shui Guanzhi hadn’t attacked yet, the aura he had released had already locked onto him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen was under Shui Guanzhi’s terrifying pressure. Now that Shui Guanzhi had released his full strength and summoned the Cry of the Heavenly Daos, this pressure was no weaker than at the edge of the storm zone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the storm zone’s power was spread throughout a large area, while Shui Guanzhi’s power was completely focused on Long Chen, which was the only reason it could match the storm zone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As expected, a true rank two Celestial is much more terrifying. That idiot Huo Wufang didn’t even have half this power.” Battle intent soared out of Long Chen. It had been a long time since he had exchanged blows with a true expert. It would be good to have a fight. “Divine ring!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the divine ring appeared, his powerful aura was like a dragon soaring into the sky. The divine ring had three colors, but on the edge, there was an incredibly indistinct color, one that was practically impossible to see.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What magical art is that?!” asked a monastery head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This divine ring possessed a will that could subdue the entire universe. Even heaven and earth would have to lower their heads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such a technique was something they had never seen or heard of. The most shocking thing was that this divine ring was actually able to resist Shui Guanzhi’s Cry of the Heavenly Daos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It wasn’t like this before! Why are there more colors now?” Some people had seen photographic jades of when Long Chen had previously summoned the divine ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But those images were from when Long Chen had fought in the Jiuli secret realm. The divine ring had completely transformed, and its new power had reached an inconceivable level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen, let me see just how strong you are.” Shui Wuhen was full of anticipation. Although she had known Long Chen for so long, she was never able to tell what his limit was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Long Chen summoned the divine ring, Shui Guanzhi immediately felt a great deal of pressure. That kind of feeling was something he had only sensed when he fought the other rank two Celestials. Did Long Chen truly possess the power of a rank two Celestial?</span></p>
