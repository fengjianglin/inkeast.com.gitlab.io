 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re the one who should die, you old ghost!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A huge giant appeared in the sky, breaking his palm-image with a single blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wilde had activated the Barbarian Blood Bronze Body. He smashed apart his attack and then sent another smash toward him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Corrupt Blood Grand Formation!” shouted the Foundation Forging expert. He suddenly transformed to look like a ghoul who had just flown out of a pool of blood. Ghost Qi soared out of his body, and with a wave of his hand, a blood-colored spear shot toward Wilde.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BOOM! The blood-colored spear was shattered by a single blow from Wilde.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Impossible! How can you not be affected by the blood soul impact?!” Seeing Wilde had no reaction, that Corrupt Foundation Forging expert was shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That blood spear of his was not just a physical attack. It also contained a powerful spiritual aspect, one that would confuse a person’s mind and make a person fall into illusions. They would fall into a blood sea that they couldn’t escape from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He couldn’t believe that Wilde really had no reaction to his attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What Corrupt Blood Grand Formation, what soul impact? My brother Long said that no matter what enemies I face, they can all be handled with a good smash of my club! If one smash isn’t enough, then two! If two isn’t enough, then I just have to continue until they’re dead! Watch!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wilde once more smashed his club at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Corrupt expert refused to accept this, and he launched seven of those blood spears again. But Wilde seemed immune to the blood soul impact, causing him to be so furious that he involuntarily trembled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Foundation Forging experts possessed a high level of comprehension into spatial energy. Thus, they were able to release the full power of magical arts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But no matter what magical arts this Foundation Forging expert used, whether offensive or defensive, Wilde would simply repeatedly smash his club at him. The runes of his magical arts would shatter each time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, Meng Qi, Tang Wan-er, Gu Yang, Yue Zifeng, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan all moved out, starting a fierce fight with the Foundation Forging experts. Ouyang Qiuyu and the others were shocked to see that they were able to fight Foundation Forging experts one on one without losing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally, they had been weaker than Wilde. But that weakness had been erased after consuming rank four Heavenly Dao Fruits and the Ten Thousand Spirit Blood. Their power had reached a completely new level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Should we first destroy their transportation formations and cut the reinforcements off?” asked Ouyang Qiuyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No need. Since we’re playing, let’s play bigger. I want to make the Corrupt path pay a miserable price.” Long Chen shook his head. Xue You had completely infuriated him. Right now, he wasn’t fighting for the Righteous path, but for revenge for Little Snow. A blood debt had to be paid with blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fine, up to you. In any case, I’m just accompanying you. I’ll go out first.” Ouyang Qiuyu smiled slightly. She felt a feeling of freedom she hadn’t felt in a long time. Long Chen was the true leader of this battlefield. Ouyang Qiuyu felt a feeling of delight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first time in many years that the burden on her shoulders was released. She felt relaxed and carefree. She had an urge to give Long Chen the title of sect master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, she felt like she had returned to the springtime of her youth back when her blood had been boiling as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brats from the Corrupt path, if you have any skill, come and try me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps it was because she had forgotten herself or perhaps she was just too excited, or perhaps Ouyang Qiuyu had always been hiding her craziness. But she actually shouted such an inappropriate thing as she charged out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ouyang Qiuyu attacked, blocking five Foundation Forging experts on her own. Her jade palm released powerful runes that caused the world to shake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What startled Long Chen was that Ouyang Qiuyu’s magical arts were different from others. She didn’t need any hand seals. With each wave of her hand, a rune flew out and transformed into a sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, Ouyang Qiuyu had been holding back when she had fought outside the spatial portal. She had been constantly thinking about what kind of victory she required in order to win back the Xuantian Dao Sect’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had possessed the power to kill those two Foundation Forging experts back then. After all, she had already touched the next barrier. Compared to an ordinary Foundation Forging expert, she was much stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, what she wanted was a total victory. She needed her disciples to win as well, as just slaughtering the Corrupt experts on her own wasn’t enough to raise their morale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, that would go against the unwritten rules of the Righteous and Corrupt battles. During huge battles, the experts on both sides couldn’t attack those of a weaker level. Once they did, the entire world would become chaotic. With each side doing their best to ruin the other, there was no way for either party to develop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This law of troops fighting troops, generals fighting generals had existed since a long time ago. Otherwise, if everyone started sending experts to kill their opponents’ children, this world would become completely chaotic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why even if Ouyang Qiuyu had killed those two Foundation Forging experts, it wouldn’t have counted as a victory to her. She had needed her disciples to kill the Corrupt experts and win a double-sided victory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, all of this had been changed by Long Chen. He didn’t give a damn about any of that. He directly charged into their hive, and his goal was only to cause their blood to turn into rivers. He wanted revenge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ouyang Qiuyu had thrown caution to the wind, allowing Long Chen to do as he pleased. She would rather be a merry warrior and charge into the front lines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen, what do you want us to do?” asked a monastery head. They had all made their preparations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just watch, or perhaps activate some photographic jades to record the battle. You can use those to encourage your disciples in the future,” said Long Chen indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What… Is that really alright?” he asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no choice. This battle is just the beginning. Look, another two Foundation Forging experts just appeared from the transportation formation. That means our enemies are still gathering. The battle will only grow more intense. You might have the correct heart, but you don’t have the power. In this battle, any random shockwave might kill you. Such death has no meaning.” Long Chen shook his head. The transportation formation was constantly lighting up. Groups of Corrupt experts were constantly appearing, and they had all at least reached Sea Expansion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The monastery head sighed despondently. The others also looked dispirited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t say these things because I’m looking down on you or because I want to insult you. I want you to know just how big this world is. As for us, for some insignificant advantages, we act like a leaf can blind us to a mountain. The only thing we do is use our small intellects to fight against each other. There is no meaning behind that. Although the lot of you don’t have the power to fight here, you have plenty of experience and can use that experience to raise your disciples in the future. Let them resolve the regrets you have,” said Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They all clearly understood his reasoning. Seeing these experts fighting, they felt even more regret for wasting all their time on useless things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just watch here. I have work to do.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen also charged into the battle in the air. That was the battle of the Foundation Forging experts. More and more Corrupt experts were appearing, and Long Chen went to replace Li Qi and Song Mingyuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the air, the two of them were like fish that had jumped onto dry land. They were already starting to buckle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go take a break. Remember my signal.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen summoned his divine ring and slashed with his saber, blocking three Foundation Forging experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Li Qi and Song Mingyuan both wiped off their sweat. They really were unable to bring out their full power in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen had joined the battle, but he didn’t use his full power. He was simply stalling as he fought with Ouyang Qiuyu and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More and more experts were arriving. The Corrupt path’s Foundation Forging experts now numbered twenty-five. That number was shocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Down below, the majority of the Xiantian experts had been killed. Blood dyed the ground scarlet, and corpses littered the ground. Right now, the battlefield on the ground belonged solely to Sea Expansion experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tens of thousands of Sea Expansion experts had surrounded the Dragonblood Legion. Despite their huge numbers advantage, they were unable to stop the Dragonblood Legion. With each passing breath, several of their experts died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the Dragonblood warriors, their morale only continued to grow as the battle progressed, and they became fiercer and fiercer. It was like a group of sheep was surrounding a group of tigers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Steady, steady!” shouted one of the squad leaders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dragonblood Legion had four captains, Gu Yang, Yue Zifeng, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan. Below them were the squad leaders. There was one squad leader for every ten warriors. Normally, they were only in charge of their squads, but now this squad leader had no choice but to give a warning to everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sorry, sorry, I was getting too addicted. I forgot,” apologized a Dragonblood warrior. They needed to kill at a steady pace so that their enemies only continued to increase. Long Chen wanted to play big and force the Corrupt path to bring out all their power. It was to give the Corrupt path an unforgettable experience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s twenty-eight of them already. How could the Corrupt path have hidden them so well?” Ouyang Qiuyu sent a spiritual message to Long Chen. She was extremely shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen, how do you plan on handling this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My appetite’s big, so we’re just going to continue until the Corrupt path uses up every last bit of their power,” said Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you confident?” Ouyang Qiuyu was startled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t I have you by my side? As the Xuantian Dao Sect’s leader, I don’t believe you don’t have some frightening trump cards,” laughed Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sly brat, so you even included me in your calculations!” raged Ouyang Qiuyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As time passed, more experts continued to arrive. Ouyang Qiuyu was shocked to see that the Corrupt path had over a hundred thousand Sea Expansion experts. As for Foundation Forging experts, they now numbered fifty-six. Long Chen and the others were in a dangerous situation now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How could the Corrupt path have so many experts? This power is already beyond the sum of the Righteous path!” The Sea Expansion elders watching the fight were stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they weren’t personally witnessing it, they would never have believed such a thing. When had the Corrupt path grown to such a level? Had they always been concealing their power? Had they been planning some immense scheme?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking of that, they felt a chill. One of them thought to leave now and spread the photographic jades while he could, letting everyone realize the scope of the Corrupt path’s forces. Even if they all died, at least the Righteous path could prepare themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Crap, the spatial portal has been sealed!” His expression suddenly changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More and more Corrupt experts arrived. After two hours, they finally came to a stop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s about time. Everyone, there’s no need to hold back! Start the slaughter!” shouted Long Chen. His saber lit up, and with a single slash, a Foundation Forging expert was killed. “Four Star Battle Armor!”</span></p>
