<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen’s words contained boundless killing intent, and they shocked everyone present. Long Chen was actually proposing a deathmatch with Yin Wushang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was different from before. Before, Yin Wushang had been worried Long Chen would refuse to fight him, and that was the reason he was willing to ruin his reputation. He had wanted to use a hostage to force the fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To experts, reputation was nonsense. In front of absolute strength, reputation was the cry of the weak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The martial path was one of competition, and only the winner was the king. No one cared about the process, only the result. That was the only reason Yin Wushang would use such contemptible methods despite his status.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But now, Mu Xue had been saved by Zi Yan. There was nothing he could threaten Long Chen with. However, Long Chen had still challenged Yin Wushang, a powerful Celestial, to a battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In other words, Long Chen had taken the initiative to challenge Yin Wushang. That was a completely different concept from before when Yin Wushang had been worried Long Chen would refuse to battle him. Long Chen was planning on killing Yin Wushang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen, don’t be impetuous. The Cry of the Heavenly Daos will form an absolute suppression against you. You have no chance of winning,” said Mo Yunshan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His old man really had been correct. Long Chen was too domineering, doing whatever he wanted without regard to the conclusion. Despite knowing it was a trap, despite the problem already being resolved, he actually took the initiative to jump in. That was folly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahahaha, good, good! Long Chen, you have guts. Then let’s have a life and death battle. Let me see just how much you’ve grown during this time for you to become this brave.” Yin Wushang laughed and began to walk forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This sudden turn of events shocked everyone. Originally, they had assumed that this matter would end here because of the Immortal Intoxication Pavilion’s Zi Yan. But now it was a complete reversal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This Long Chen truly is powerful, and he can fight across realms easily. But does he really think that that’s enough for him to challenge a Celestial? Then he has gravely mistaken,” sighed an elderly man in the crowd. He obviously didn’t think Long Chen had any chance of winning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Long Chen was also a Celestial, then that would be another matter. But it was as Mo Yunshan said: Long Chen would be suppressed by the Cry of the Heavenly Daos.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under that suppression, anyone in the same realm and even those in the realm above would be crushed by the Celestial. That was the terror of Celestials.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Previously, when Long Chen had killed Wang Yishan with one attack, that was nothing more than coincidence. Risking his life to take a life, he had relied on nothing more than his own life-preserving measures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But in front of a Celestial, such tricks were far from enough. So no one present thought Long Chen would win.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen…” Mo Nian said nervously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mo Nian, my temperament isn’t the same as yours. The path I walk is different from yours. I know what I’m doing. This is my Dao. Yin Wushang has gone too far, humiliating my friend and killing my brothers. Today, of the two of us, only one can leave this place alive. You don’t need to try and change my mind. Today, we’ll see which one of us has a hardier life.” Long Chen stopped Mo Nian and began walking towards Yin Wushang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Nian still wanted to say more, but he was stopped by Mo Yunshan. Zi Yan looked at Long Chen, also wanting to say something, but in the end, she held it back and also retreated along with Mo Yunshan and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That middle-aged man also led his Xiantian experts back with him. This region was left to Yin Wushang and Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything within dozens of miles of the Hidden Dragon Abode became silent. The only ones left were Long Chen and Yin Wushang who were staring at each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen, are you aware? Originally, I should have long since gone to kill you. However, because of some trifling matters, your death ended up being delayed. Otherwise, you would have already died,” said Yin Wushang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It should be because you were busy planning your cooperation with the power targeting the Mo family, correct? It seems they want to draw you into their camp as well, working with the Yin family to crush the Mo family. However, it seems your current actions are part of your own last minute plan. Most likely, you found that your cooperation wasn’t favorable enough, and you weren’t able to wait long enough. That must be why you used such shameless methods to draw me out,” said Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yin Wushang narrowed his eyes, slightly shocked. “I didn’t think you would know so much. It seems the Mo family is also busy investigating this matter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yin Wushang had concluded that it was the Mo family who had told this to Long Chen. Long Chen was entirely correct. As soon as he had heard Long Chen had appeared in Qing Prefecture, he had rushed over. However, he had been drawn into another plot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a strong power that was preparing to target the Mo family. The high level members of the Yin family had told Yin Wushang to postpone his plans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it had taken too long for both parties to negotiate their cooperation, and Yin Wushang had run out of patience. Thus, there was this trap today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, there’s one thing that you’re wrong about. The reason I have to kill you is because I’m about to advance. Right now, I’ve reached the peak of the third Heavenstage of Meridian Opening. I’m preparing to attack the fourth Heavenstage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You might not be aware, but Celestials are different from ordinary cultivators. We require a flawless Dao-heart. Only then can we perfectly merge with the Heavenly Daos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But previously, you managed to escape from my clutches. That left a stain on my heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Although it is just a small stain and I’m only advancing a minor realm, for insurance, I’ve still decided to kill you before advancing, not letting my Dao-heart receive the smallest imperfection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The current me is still the old me. But if I advanced to the mid Meridian Opening realm, my strength would explosively grow, and at that time, even killing you would be unable to wash away the stain in my heart. That stain might affect my future. So sorry, but today, you must definitely die!” said Yin Wushang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The millions of experts spectating were all startled. It seemed Long Chen had already fought with Yin Wushang, and Long Chen had managed to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yin Wushang, do you still remember what I said to you before?” asked Long Chen lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Unfortunately, I really am not in the habit of remembering other people’s words.” Yin Wushang shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In the Xuantian Supermonastery, I told you that with Han Tianyu’s death, the enmity between myself and the Yin family was over. But if you dared meddle with me again, I would personally exterminate your Yin family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Now, you’ve really done well. Not only did you try and kill me, but you even took your anger out on the innocent, causing them to lose their lives. The enmity between us has already reached the point where only one of us can live.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So whether or not it’s sincere, don’t apologize. I won’t accept it, and furthermore, when I destroy your Yin family, I also won’t apologize.” Long Chen looked at Yin Wushang calmly, but behind that calm was a terrifying killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing this, those spectators burst into a clamor. Exterminate an ancient family? Had Long Chen gone crazy?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ancient families had an inheritance that stretched back for countless years. They were huge existences with powerful foundations. Let alone Long Chen, even another ancient family wouldn’t dare say such a thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahaha! Even at this time, you still like to boast. However, I’ve already gotten tired of it. You can die now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yin Wushang suddenly roared, his voice shaking the sky like thunder. He extended a hand, and the void trembled. People were horrified to see countless palms emerge from his hand, and they filled all of heaven and earth. A terrifying pressure arose, seeming to want to crush Long Chen to dust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as he attacked, he used such a terrifying attack. That one attack caused every Xiantian expert here to be horrified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This attack had sealed every direction. There was nowhere to run. Most horrifying of all, these palm-images were not just illusions, but solid bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then let’s see just who will die today!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen felt no fear in the face of those palms. With an icy snort, he punched, and a thunderous explosion rang out that caused heaven and earth to tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BOOM!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The palm-images disappeared. Long Chen’s fist had collided with Yin Wushang’s palm. The ground quivered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Long Chen’s fist blocked Yin Wushang’s palm, Yin Wushang smiled coldly and caught hold of Long Chen’s fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You still haven’t improved at all. Die!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yin Wushang’s aura completely erupted, and astral winds surged, causing everyone’s expressions to change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ground suddenly exploded, and a terrifying qi wave spread from the two of them. The Hidden Dragon Abode was the first casualty. It was instantly blown to bits.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those distant spectators were horrified. As Yin Wushang’s aura was released, Long Chen’s aura also gradually grew.</span></p>

Then just how much pressure was Long Chen under?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After summoning his bloodline power, Yin Wushang’s aura once more grew, causing heaven and earth to shudder. At the same time, a sword appeared in his hand, and he had already leaped into the air, viciously slashing it down on Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It looked as if even space was being torn apart by this slash. Pressure erupted in all directions.</span></p>
