He was surprisingly a Chosen. His clothes marked him as a Righteous disciple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the shocking thing was that his eyes were absent-minded, and his aura was chaotic. His life force was rapidly fading.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That person seemed to have lost himself in panic, and his expression was full of terror. He was fleeing with all his might, not even caring about the direction. He was coincidentally running in Long Chen and Meng Qi’s direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That person was still dozens of meters away when he suddenly collapsed on the ground. Long Chen and Meng Qi hastily went over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let me.” Meng Qi had been about to extend her hand when Long Chen stopped her. He ran up to him and swept his divine sense over his entire body. Only when he didn’t find any anomalies did he turn him around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wake up! What happened?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Corrupt… Corrupt…” That person was already on the verge of dissociating. His eyes were losing all their light, and he was replying completely unconsciously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen’s heart chilled. From his previous examination, he had already seen that all this person’s meridians had exploded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Normally, he shouldn’t have even had any energy to even run. It was unknown what secret technique he had used. He had overdrafted his life force to continue fleeing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But his life force was no longer able to continue. His body was already starting to decompose. Long Chen hastily poured his spiritual qi into his body. “What happened?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the assistance of Long Chen’s spiritual qi, that person regained the slightest bit of energy. “Corrupt path… Yin Luo… killing… stealing…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where is he killing people?” asked Long Chen hastily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But after saying those last six words, this person was no longer able to hold on. His head tilted to the side, and his life force was completely severed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“His entire body’s meridians have exploded, and the majority of his bones are broken. It looks like he was crushed by a kind of a multi-target attack.” Long Chen’s expression was solemn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who could be so powerful that they could launch a group attack that is capable of one-shotting Chosen?” Meng Qi was shocked. But then her expression changed. “That Yin Luo he mentioned, he was referring to the Corrupt path’s top expert?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen nodded. “That’s the most likely scenario. Other than Yin Luo’s natural energy attacks, I don’t know any other kind of power that can practically decompose a Chosen.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just from looking at this person’s injuries, Long Chen could tell that that bastard’s ability to control natural energy had advanced once more. Yin Luo truly was terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, Chu Yao and Lu Fang-er had also rushed back due to the clamor. When they heard what had happened, their expressions changed. The Corrupt path’s number one expert, Yin Luo, was in the vicinity. That gave them a great deal of pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just Yin Wushuang was already terrifying. But now the Corrupt path’s number one expert, the one equally famed as Han Tianyu, was near them. Those two were truly unrivaled existences within their generation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What should we do? Should we leave?” said Lu Fang-er worriedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We can’t. As members of the Righteous path, we must be chivalrous, help out the weak, and uphold justice. I’ve decided to get revenge for this brother.” Long Chen shook his head, appearing like the picture of righteousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Qi and Lu Fang-er couldn’t help being stunned. They hadn’t imagined Long Chen would suddenly practically turn into a different person. Meng Qi advised, “Long Chen, it’s not like you had any relationship with this person…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sister, you’ve been duped. How would Long Chen have such good intentions as to getting this person a revenge? He’s just trying to kill people for their treasures.” Chu Yao pulled on Meng Qi’s hand and laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Cough, did you have to say it so directly? How about this, I will carry the pretense of stealing treasure all so that I can get revenge for this brother. After all, he did give me some clues,” said Long Chen with some embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Qi and Lu Fang-er looked at each other in dismay. Long Chen wanted to kill the number one expert of the Corrupt path for his treasures? That was too crazy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you serious Long Chen?” Meng Qi and Lu Fang-er asked at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sisters, you must still be unaware. Long Chen is already acquainted with that Yin Luo. Before the Jiuli secret realm opened, there was a great Righteous and Corrupt path war. For some reason, Yin Luo was sent to Long Chen’s particular war zone, and as a result, Long Chen severed one of his legs,” said Chu Yao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is that true?!” Meng qi and Lu Fang-er were both shocked. That was far too hard to believe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Yao told them about what had happened in that battle. From beginning to end, Meng Qi and Lu Fang-er were incomparably shocked. They had never imagined Long Chen had grown to such a terrifying realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back when they had first met him, Long Chen had been only at the third Heavenstage of Qi Condensation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But in just over a year, Long Chen was now able to stand shoulder to shoulder with peak experts like Yin Luo and Mo Nian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That battle didn’t really count. It was only because I had Mo Nian and Chu Yao with me that we won in the end. If it had just been myself, I would have been completely oppressed by Yin Luo.” Long Chen bitterly smiled. He had never considered himself to have been that amazing in that battle, as it had only been won through everyone’s contribution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Qi shook his head and praised, “That’s not the same. At that time, you were only at Blood Condensation, while Yin Luo had reached Tendon Transformation; you were separated by a major realm. Long Chen, you really are powerful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although countless people had praised him and he had seen countless worshipful gazes, those didn’t cause any great waves in Long Chen. But being praised by Meng Qi, pride involuntarily swelled within him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he still shook his head. “Yin Luo’s strength has reached an abnormal level. Back when we first entered the secret realm, he ended up immediately targeting me, and I almost died to him.” Long Chen told them about what had happened with Yin Luo at the beginning. His expression was extremely solemn. “At that time, Yin Luo’s control of natural energy was still coarse. But looking at this person’s wounds, it seems Yin Luo has already gained a measure of control over his Xiantian power, and so he must be even more terrifying.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most abnormal part about Yin Luo was that he had refined Xiantian essence blood, and was able to control a measure of natural energy, something only Xiantian experts should have been able to do. But Yin Luo was able to do so in Tendon Transformation. Although it was just a small amount, it was enough to allow him to dominate anyone on the same realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was unknown just what techniques Han Tianyu had for him to stand on the same level as Yin Luo. But Han Tianyu’s trump cards were definitely not inferior to Yin Luo’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Long Chen, how sure are you of being able to defeat Yin Luo?” asked Meng Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen hesitated. “Conservatively, it should be around fifty percent. But my chance of killing him is probably zero. So I’ll need your help.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You want to kill him?” The three women were all stunned. Long Chen was crazy. He wanted to kill a top expert?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is probably my only chance to kill Yin Luo. Back when Yin Luo chased after me, his cultivation base had already reached the ninth Heavenstage of Tendon Transformation. Now that over two months have passed, he should have reached the peak of Tendon Transformation, and perhaps he has already begun to touch that barrier. So killing him now is my only chance. If he advances to Bone Forging, there’ll be no chance at all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the assistance of his medicinal pills, Long Chen’s cultivation base had just recently reached the second Heavenstage of Tendon Transformation. Trying to catch up to Yin Luo in terms of cultivation base was just folly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So Long Chen placed great importance on this opportunity. The enmity between the two had reached the point that they would fight a battle to the death the instant they saw each other. This was the most opportune moment for Long Chen.</span></p>

It’s best if you conceal yourselves at first and just prepare to stop him from running. If we end up in a draw or I’m not able to defeat him, just give up on the plan and run. I have my own methods to escape him, so you don’t need to worry about me,” warned Long Chen.</span></p>

If even one of them ended up in an accident, then even ten thousand deaths wouldn’t be able to wash away his guilt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little Snow will lead the way. On the way, Meng Qi, show me your best attacks and your fighting style.” Long Chen summoned out Little Snow. With his nose, it was easy to trace where that fellow had come from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After burying that person, the four of them began to follow Little Snow even deeper into the Forest of Darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Little Snow leading the way, Meng Qi began to explain her various spiritual attacks. At the same time, she imparted several principles and usages of spiritual attacks.</span></p>

Compared to the ones Lu Fang-er had taught him, it was much more taxing to use these.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even with Long Chen’s incredibly vast soul energy, some of those soul arts would require his full strength to use.</span></p>

That was because her Spiritual Strength was too lacking to use these powerful techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From Meng Qi’s explanations, Long Chen couldn’t help sighing that soul arts were really too powerful. The amount of knowledge and theories contained within them were as vast as an ocean. As they travelled atop Little Snow, Meng Qi became Long Chen’s secret teacher.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen himself was an alchemist, and he possessed his Pill God memories. His ability to control his Spiritual Strength had definitely reached a masterful level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the methods to circulate soul energy was different between soul arts and pill refining, the countless differences didn’t change the fact that they were from the same origin. The principles were similar, and Long Chen comprehended them extremely quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a result, Meng Qi reacted in the same way as Lu Fang-er did and ended up completely stunned by Long Chen’s terrifying talent. No matter what soul art it was, Long Chen would essentially be able to comprehend the whole thing as soon as she explained it once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then he would ask her some questions about some specifics, and the questions he brought up were always the areas that were easiest to end up making slip-ups. After those few questions, he would have a fundamental understanding on how to use it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t just Long Chen who was benefiting from Meng Qi’s knowledge. Chu Yao was also learning many things, as her soul energy was also extremely powerful. She used her powerful soul energy to control her wood energy. These transformations and methods to use soul energy showed her many new ways to control her wooden stakes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Slow down.” Long Chen suddenly waved his hand. Little Snow had sent back news that there were traces of battle ahead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That should be the direction that injured person had come from. The four of them began to carefully advance. In just a couple hundred meters, they saw Little Snow. Not far from Little Snow were two corpses, and the ground was a complete mess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the two of them had died, their powerful auras had yet to completely fade, and it was possible to tell these two had also reached the Chosen-level.</span></p>

There’s a basin up ahead with mountains on all sides, and there’s only one entrance. Then let’s act according to the plan. You three guard the entrance here, and I’ll go on ahead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Be careful,” the three of them warned him at the same time.</span></p>
