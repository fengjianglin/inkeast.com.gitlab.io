 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen hastily pulled her up. “What happened with Xiaoqian?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The sacred daughter received a backlash while cultivating the Heavenly Devil Heart Grand Technique. Her soul was damaged. She needs a precious medicine known as the Heaven Netherworld Soul Replenishment Root. But our Skyscraping World doesn’t have that medicine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Furthermore, even in the outside world, this kind of medicine has almost gone extinct. The sacred daughter’s situation is something the entire race is helpless about. We… we…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She suddenly paused. It was Long Chen who continued, “You are all viewed as enemies of the world and unable to walk freely. You don’t dare publicly search for it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Long Chen’s cultivation base increased, he had gradually managed to come into contact with some ancient tomes. It was said that there was an extremely powerful race in this world that was called the original devil race.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were a bunch of fiends intended to overturn the entire world and exterminate all life. But in the ancient era, they were defeated by experts and almost exterminated. However, some dregs continued to live in the cracks of this world. They were viewed as enemies of the entire world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he read this, Long Chen had snorted disdainfully. Intended to overturn the world? It would have been best if they had succeeded. He didn’t like this idiot world the slightest bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So even after knowing Yue Xiaoqian came from the devil race, his feelings toward her hadn’t changed in the slightest. He also felt more favorable towards her race.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman was relieved to see Long Chen was still going to help despite knowing about the original devil race. “That’s not all. Our original devil race is cursed by this world. Here we will be exterminated by heavenly tribulation. If we want to come here, we have to use devil cores and refine them into special pendants that can conceal our aura from the Heavenly Daos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Last time, the sacred daughter secretly slipped away to gain experience, and she brought back tens of thousands of those cores. With these cores, our original devil race can enter this world, and as long as we don’t release our full strength, which would reveal the mark on our foreheads, people won’t be able to recognize us.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This time, many of us have been sent out to search for the Heaven Netherworld Soul Replenishment Root, but devil cores can only conceal the auras of Xiantian experts and below. It does not affect Sea Expansion experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Without the support of those stronger experts, there’s no way we can take such medicine by force. That’s why I came up with a plan, getting rid of the original woman here and taking her place. I pretended to be her, hoping I could subdue one of the three great families’ junior masters and obtain the Heaven Netherworld Soul Replenishing Root.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her face suddenly began to change. She didn’t move, but she transformed into a completely different person, one who was even more beautiful and moving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is our race’s innate skill. We can change our appearance at will,” she explained upon seeing Long Chen’s shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are all your devil race’s women so beautiful?” asked Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, haven’t you already seen the most beautiful one? The sacred daughter is publicly acclaimed as our devil race’s number one beauty,” she laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen nodded. Yue Xiaoqian’s face had truly reached a flawless level. That was especially true of her charm which seemed to exude from deep within her. It was a beauty that could not be refused, one that could steal away a person’s soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no need for you to go looking for the Heaven Netherworld Soul Replenishing Root. I have it here,” said Long Chen. That was a sixth tier medicinal ingredient, and with Long Chen’s character, how could he have not have prepared it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Really? Excellent! Then the sacred daughter won’t have to suffer the pain of her soul being devoured anymore,” cried the woman. Tears streamed out of her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you have alchemists in your race?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No. We are cursed by the world and only possess our core energy. None of the elemental energy in the world can be used by us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This world really must be sick.” Long Chen shook his head, feeling sympathy for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yue Xiaoqian’s entire race was cursed. But Long Chen wasn’t cursed, and yet the Heavenly Daos always wanted his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If the Heaven Netherworld Soul Replenishing Root is consumed on its own, it doesn’t have that great of an effect, and it acts very slowly. I’ll refine a few medicinal pills for you to bring back to cure Xiaoqian. Other than that, if you trust me, let me examine your body,” said Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She blushed but she nodded. “Of course, I trust senior apprentice-brother Long Chen. Xiao Die will listen to your instructions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey, wait! I don’t need you to take off your clothes for the examination. Just let my spiritual yuan circulate through your body for a moment.” Long Chen hastily waved his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He placed his arm on her back. His spiritual yuan flowed into her. He had to learn more about the devil race’s cultivation method to be able to help Yue Xiaoqian better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he examined her body, Long Chen was shocked to find that there was a strange energy in Xiao Die’s Dantian. This was an energy Long Chen had never seen before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was not spiritual qi, and it was not spiritual yuan. It was completely different from any other energy in this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That is our core energy. It’s completely different from the energy that you cultivate,” explained Xiao Die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen nodded, and going through her body structure, he gained a fundamental understanding of her spiritual fluctuation. Other than that core energy being different, everything else was similar to a human. There would be no problem consuming a medicinal pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You should rest and take care of yourself for the next few days. I’ll add a few ingredients to refine the Heavenly Star Soul Replenishing Pill and also refine a few other pills for you to bring to Yue Xiaoqian.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After saying that, Long Chen directly returned to the Fang family. Entering a private room, he locked the door and hastily took out the ingredients for the Heavenly Star Soul Replenishing Pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a sixth tier pill, and its difficulty was middling for its tier. It was still a bit difficult for the current Long Chen to refine it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But that was fine. With the assistance of an Earth Flame, it was no problem. Currently, Huo Long was looking after a group of beast flames and rapidly growing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that Long Chen summoned it to refine pills, it was like adding wings to a tiger. Because Long Chen’s mind was connected to Huo Long’s, their cooperation was seamless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BANG! Less than six hours later, a furnace of Heavenly Star Soul Replenishing Pills was completed. Other than one eight-ring pill, the rest all had nine rings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How regretful. The medicinal ingredients don’t possess enough spirituality, or with Huo Long’s strength, I could even refine top grade pills,” sighed Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Huo Long’s assistance, Long Chen’s refinement had been extremely relaxed and easy. Most importantly, Huo Long possessed its own spirit. The second time, Long Chen didn’t even need to control it. Huo Long was able to refine on its own, causing Long Chen to be incomparably excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huo Long, try it by yourself.” Long Chen directly stopped doing anything at all. Huo Long turned into a three-meter-long flame dragon and wrapped around the pill furnace. The flame control was exactly the same as when he had controlled it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BANG! When the furnace lid popped open, Long Chen saw that they all had seven rings. Although it wasn’t the same level as when he had refined them personally, this was already shocking enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huo Long, you really are amazing.” Long Chen laughed. Having obtained this praise, Huo Long excitedly wrapped around Long Chen’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, you can actually control the temperature on your own. In the future, you can help me refine pills when you’re bored.” Long Chen gently rubbed Huo Long’s head, filled with delight. Now he had a truly reliable helper. “Help me refine pills in the primal chaos space. I have some other things I have to do.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen placed Huo Long, the pill furnace, and the medicinal ingredients into the primal chaos space. Now he would have a steady supply of pills even without doing anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xiao Die said that Yue Xiaoqian has also reached the late Xiantian realm. I should refine her a few Bloodfiend Sea Expansion pills.” Long Chen suddenly took out a fist-sized, blood-colored fruit. That was the Bloodfiend Vermillion Fruit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it was not the same fruit that he had obtained in the chaos region. That one had been turned into a seed and given birth to a large tree filled with such fruits. It went without saying that the primal chaos space was too heaven-defying. No matter what seed it was, no matter what kind of living environment the plant needed, it would grow rapidly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Currently, there were seven medicinal fields near the center of the primal chaos space. Those corresponded to first tier to seventh tier ingredients.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although first tier ingredients weren’t very useful, there were some higher tier medicinal pills that required the assistance of some low tier ingredients to neutralize certain medicinal properties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An incense stick’s worth of time later, there were now over a hundred freshly-picked medicinal ingredients around Long Chen. Such fresh ingredients contained the densest energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen called Huo Long out of the primal chaos space to refine these ingredients to powder, and then began refining the Bloodfiend Sea Expansion Pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was also a sixth tier pill, but it was the peak of mid sixth tier pill. It was extremely difficult. Even with Long Chen’s abilities, he failed in the final moments of the refinement in his first try.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he didn’t get discouraged. He had as many ingredients as he needed. Without even taking a break, he tried again. That was the confidence that came with being a pro.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The second time, he succeeded but it was not ideal. Out of nine pills, two of them were trash, three had no rings, and out of the remaining four, the best one only had three rings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It really is worthy of being at the peak of mid sixth tier pills. This level of difficulty is truly abnormal,” muttered Long Chen before continuing to practice his refinement. After seven tries, he finally refined a nine-ring Heavenly Star Soul Replenishment Pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This nine-ring pill was for Yue Xiaoqian, and the other fifty-something pills would be given to Xiao Die for others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for his own people, there was no rush. Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength grew with his cultivation base. And the stronger his Spiritual Strength, the higher quality the pills he could refine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, the Dragonblood Legion was still at the early Xiantian realm, and there was still quite a bit of time before they attacked the Sea Expansion realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After tidying up, Long Chen left the room. Only then did he realize he had spent two days refining pills. It was already noon on the third day. He hastily rushed toward the House of Pleasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he had only just left his residence when he saw a gloomy-faced Fang Chang and Chai Liehuo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fang Chang said, “Long San, something’s happened.”</span></p>
