 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was a sword image that contained a heaven-toppling sword will.&nbsp;</span></p>

Long Chen was surprised to see that blood actually dripped from that seemingly illusory hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“LING YUN-ZI!” An angry roar rang out from the teleportation portal as that hand retreated back within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People then noticed there was also a teleportation portal behind Tu Fang now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In front of that portal was a certain figure. That figure wasn’t solid. In fact, it looked like a figure come straight out of fantasy. But its form was the exact same as the Xuantian Monastery’s sect leader.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Yun-zi’s held his hands behind his back, speaking back to the opposing teleportation portal, “Wu Li, it’s been thirty years. You’re becoming more and more pathetic. You actually attacked a group of little children? What happened to that pride of yours?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although it was just an illusory figure, Ling Yun-zi’s figure still contained a domineering sword intent. He now looked like an unsheathed sword, his sharpness so chilling that it would cause the world to shiver.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of Ling Yun-zi’s appearance, the pressure radiating from that huge hand was finally repelled by his sword intent, allowing everyone to breathe again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, now everyone was completely covered in sweat, their faces pale as paper. In front of that huge hand, they had all thought they would die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ling Yun-zi, I wouldn’t have thought that you’d have condensed a spiritual body.” A surprised roar came from the other side of the teleportation portal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Yun-zi’s spiritual body was more accurately a spiritual clone. It was something that could be condensed after entering the Xiantian realm when a person’s Spiritual Strength reached a certain pinnacle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a spiritual clone contained ten percent of the true body’s combat strength. It was an essential tool for experts to help support their junior generation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it wasn’t every Xiantian expert who could condense a spiritual clone. Not only did it require powerful Spiritual Strength, but it also required an extremely rare talent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s not like I can be as pathetic as you, bullying the junior generation all day.” Ling Yun-zi sneered, his voice filled with disdain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ling Yun-zi, are you trying to provoke me?” An angry roar came from his opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I suppose. Unfortunately, you no longer have the qualifications to fight me! Scram!” Ling Yun-zi snorted and his sword once more swept out. Sword Qi slashed down on that teleportation portal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That teleportation portal faded back to heaven and earth after being struck by Ling Yun-zi. As it broke down, it was possible to hear an angry roar coming from the other side, but it was too indistinct to hear what it said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After destroying that teleportation portal, Ling Yun-zi’s gaze swept over the battlefield, his gaze finally lighting on Long Chen. Although his spirit clone’s body was indistinct, Long Chen could sense he was looking at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha, Long Chen, well done. You really haven’t disappointed me.” Ling Yun-zi laughed and then stepped back into his teleportation portal, disappearing from people’s view. The teleportation portal faded along with it, and the crowd descended into complete silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one had expected that the battle this time would end up having Xiantian experts involved. Everyone was completely shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although that black hand and Ling Yun-zi had only released three attacks in total, that kind of destructive power awed them all. This was a Xiantian expert? They were definitely too terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In front of their strength, everyone else were just ants, unable to receive a single blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once Ling Yun-zi had left, Gui Yan knew that it was already a foregone conclusion that they had miserably lost. Three of their Favored had died, one had his courage broken and was only retreating, while the last one had had his leg severed. This was an absolute humiliation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the circumstances were pressing. There was no longer any way for him to reverse this battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Retreat!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following Gui Yan’s orders, the remaining one thousand Corrupt disciples began to retreat in relief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You think you can retreat just like this? Brothers, kill them all! Their spatial rings still contain the heads of our fallen brothers. We have to take them back! We can’t let our brothers die without a full corpse!” Seeing that the Righteous path’s experts, from disciples to Elders, actually didn’t move to stop any of them, Long Chen roared out angrily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those disciples who had just been about to cheer in victory suddenly heard Long Chen’s shout. Without even thinking about it, they began attacking the Corrupt disciples again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bastards, you’re breaking the rules!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Corrupt path had already retreated, declaring their defeat. According to the previous tacit agreement, the victor was not to chase. And so Long Chen really was breaking the rules, shocking and infuriating Gui Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tu Fang also felt that this was inappropriate. He was about to stop it, but then after a moment’s thought, he icily shouted, “Long Chen is the commander of this battle. I have no authority to meddle.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gui Yan raged, “Bullshit! Do you think I’m an idiot? You self-acclaimed bastards from the ‘Righteous’ path are clearly not abiding the rules!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could only watch as his disciples below were crazily chased by the Righteous disciples. The Corrupt disciples’ morale had already been broken, and they couldn’t form the slightest bit of effective resistance. They were killed one after another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You farting old ghost, shut your ass. Don’t stink up the air with your farts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen didn’t have any energy to kill others, but he still had his Spiritual Strength. That was definitely enough to curse others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you want to talk about breaking rules, then it was you guys who broke the rules first! That shameless old fellow actually passed through a teleportation portal to attack me! Why didn’t you talk about the rules then?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Now that it’s disadvantageous for you, you now start talking about the rules? Are your faces made of leather? You actually can say such shameless words?</span></p>

They had already overdrafted their strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And yet, Long Chen’s words were like stimulants for them, activating all their nerves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those Corrupt disciples’ faces still looked malevolent and sinister, but now there was also terror on their faces. That view excited them greatly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, everyone had told them that Corrupt disciples were savage, cruel, terrifying, and were dauntless in the face of death. But now, because of them, they were fleeing like rats. That was an absolute honor for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With this honor in front of them, even their lives didn’t seem as important. They all charged out recklessly to kill them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What they didn’t know was that they had long since reached their limit. They were relying solely on their willpower to keep fighting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were tens of core disciples who were completely focused on killing that they hadn’t even realized a faint mark had appeared on their forehead. That mark was constantly sending energy into their bodies, allowing them to continue.</span></p>

Those core disciples were perhaps their own family members. Back when they had seen the Xuantian Monastery’s core disciples had awakened their ancestral marks and how powerful they were, they had been filled with shock and envy. Now their own family’s disciples had awakened their ancestral marks. How could they not go crazy with joy?</span></p>

They were only out for their own selfish profit, and so the first thing they did after killing a Righteous disciple was to cut off their head and place it in their spatial ring.&nbsp;</span></p>

Our disciples’ spatial rings also contain all the treasures they’ve gathered over the years. How could we possibly give them to you? We’ll only give you the heads.” Gui Yan was incredibly infuriated. But in the end, he still compromised, agreeing to hand over the Righteous disciples’ heads.</span></p>

Don’t think everyone is as stupid as you. They have to hand over all their spatial rings, or how could we know whether or not you’ve secretly kept some heads? Do you think I’m an idiot like you?” Long Chen coldly snorted, not yielding a single step.</span></p>

He pointed at Gui Yan and roared, “Isn’t it just because you were stronger that&nbsp;you felt yourselves as the dictators of the rules? When we were weak, you talked with your fists, and when we’re strong, you want to talk about rules with me? Go shit yourself you old shithead!”</span></p>
