He vomited a mouthful of blood and became listless.</span></p>

Looking at that spear made of violet lightning, he was completely horrified.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beast Tamers were classified as a kind of soul cultivator. They had powerful spiritual attacks that few could block. In fact, even those on the Chosen-level would have to run far away from Beast Tamers if they didn’t have any spiritual defense treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they were surrounded by powerful Magical Beasts and also had to deal with powerful spiritual attacks, they would definitely suffer.</span></p>

However, senior apprentice-brother Qi’s powerful Spiritual Strength was completely destroyed by Long Chen’s lightning spear.</span></p>

Once it was destroyed by Long Chen’s spear, it caused a powerful shock to his soul.</span></p>

At the same time, he was greatly relieved inside. With his thunderforce, he wouldn’t need to fear spiritual attacks in the future. He would just need to be careful of sneak attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, the distant Rockscale Python charged over, biting at Long Chen. A bloody stench came from his huge mouth. At the same time, senior apprentice-brother Qi took that chance to flee.</span></p>

Although he didn’t know the origin of the lightning in Long Chen’s hand, he could tell that it had an immense restrictive effect on his Spiritual Strength.</span></p>

With his Spiritual Strength suppressed, there was no chance of him winning.</span></p>

He had sacrificed this fourth rank Magical Beast without hesitation.</span></p>

Long Chen had long since been prepared to stop him from running. As soon as the python attacked him, he saw through senior apprentice-brother Qi’s intentions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His lightning spear stabbed forward, literally streaking through the air like lightning. It collided with the python’s mouth, and the python’s head instantly exploded.</span></p>

But suddenly, Little Snow opened his mouth in preparation to shoot out a wind blade. Long Chen jumped in fright and hastily pushed Little Snow to the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his head tilted slightly to the side, his wind blade shot out, instantly flying by senior apprentice-brother Qi to land on the ground in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BOOM!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aowu!” Little Snow was clearly dissatisfied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. “I know you didn’t want to kill him, and I know you held back. But you don’t know that Beast Tamers have different physical bodies than other cultivators. With your attack, at that distance, just the slightest bit of error would have killed him. Then there’d be nothing to play with.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Beast Tamer had powerful Spiritual Strength and was able to control powerful Magical Beast housepets. However, their fatal weak point was that their physical bodies were too fragile. They couldn’t endure a powerful attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was why each Beast Tamer would possess at least one defensively powerful Magical Beast as a guard for themselves. Otherwise, if they were sneak attacked by someone, they would definitely die.</span></p>

However, if senior apprentice-brother Qi had been struck by it, then he would have immediately been sent off to his ancestors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen quickly rushed forward and pulled senior apprentice-brother Qi out of the ground. Seeing how he appeared to be on his last breaths, Little Snow rubbed the ground with embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe, don’t worry about it. In truth, I don’t really care that much about his life or death. I just want to ask him a few questions first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen fed senior apprentice-brother Qi a healing pill, and then like he was a dead dog, he pulled him towards that well.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He saw in front of him a handsome face that had a smile that looked as if he had just been blessed by the heavens. It was a warm smile, one that could lift up the coldest hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And yet senior apprentice-brother Qi couldn’t feel the slightest warmth from that smile. On the contrary, he felt goosebumps, as if some demon was staring at him, just waiting to devour his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What… what are you planning on doing?” Senior apprentice-brother Qi’s voice trembled with terror.</span></p>

Although you wanted to kill me just now, I won’t kill you at this time. There are some things I want to ask you,” smiled Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Senior apprentice-brother Qi edged backwards, trying to maintain a distance from that fiendish face. His hand pressed into the ground, but then he suddenly realized something was wrong. He saw his right hand was completely bare, and his expression changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You stole my spatial ring!”</span></p>

The breaks in his bones, which had only just begun to heal from the medicinal pill, once more broke, and senior apprentice-brother Qi screamed.</span></p>

With a final slap, he said, “Who let you not wear a hat?!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pow.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His reply was a slap in the face.</span></p>

My Wind Spirit Pavilion will never let you off! Even your monastery can’t protect you!” raged senior apprentice-brother Qi. Obviously he had recognized Long Chen’s robes.</span></p>

As long as he talked back, Long Chen would give him a slap in the face. After over ten slaps, senior apprentice-brother Qi once more fainted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aowu!” Little Snow was getting impatient to the side.</span></p>

We’ll just wait and mess around a bit. Back in Phoenix Cry, this bastard actually attacked me without even saying anything first. The grudge from back then had to wait until now. Now that I can finally take revenge, just let me play for a bit longer. Let me see just how hard his bones are,” laughed Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Snow wanted to directly kill senior apprentice-brother Qi to get it over with, but Long Chen really would hate to part with him so soon. Beating him wasn’t his goal; his goal was to beat him until he was convinced.</span></p>

This time he was much more obedient. He had finally realized that he had run into a ruthless person. His background was unable to suppress Long Chen.</span></p>

He was truly afraid Long Chen would kill him and then erase any traces of his actions.</span></p>

Even with that level of intelligence, senior apprentice-brother Qi was still able to live up to now. His luck really had to be heaven-defying.</span></p>

Let me repeat myself: when I ask a question, answer. Otherwise, we’ll continue this face-slapping game. In any case, this is just leisure time. I’ll just treat it as practice,” said Long Chen indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Senior apprentice-brother Qi shivered uncontrollably when he heard that. He didn’t resist in the slightest anymore. Whatever Long Chen asked, he would obediently reply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From senior apprentice-brother Qi, Long Chen learned that the Wind Spirit Pavilion was actually extremely powerful, not at all inferior to the Xuantian Supermonastery. It was no wonder he dared be so arrogant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Wind Spirit Pavilion’s disciples were all soul cultivators, and they were basically all Beast Tamers. Although they had few disciples, each disciple was extremely powerful.</span></p>

The branch pavilion that he and Meng Qi were in had over four hundred and seventy disciples that had entered the Jiuli secret realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that Meng Qi had also entered the Jiuli secret realm, a fire burned within Long Chen. Although his interaction with Meng Qi had been short, as time had passed, his longing for her had only intensified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Previously, he had thought he had just been attracted by Meng Qi’s immortal, fairy-like temperament and beauty, that it was a kind of attraction based on looks. However, later he realized that it was actually a profound love that came from inside his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Meng Qi had gone to withdraw from the marriage back then, Long Chen didn’t hate her in the slightest. In fact, he found her to be extremely kindhearted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that time, he had been an ant-like person, while she had been a heavenly genius. And yet, she had felt so many misgivings about breaking off their engagement all because she was worried about his honor and reputation. She had used the most tactful and gentlest way to express her wishes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Long Chen didn’t know just when he had begun to feel such a love for her.</span></p>

That was that the Wind Spirit Pavilion had a certain disciple with an extremely high status, Feng Xiao-zi. Within the Wind Spirit Pavilion, his position was equivalent to the Xuantian Monasteries’ top disciple, Han Tianyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Xiao-zi and Meng Qi were both peak geniuses of their generation, and had been termed the Wind Spirit Pavilion’s golden couple.&nbsp;</span></p>

His background was extremely powerful, and it gave Long Chen a sensation of crisis.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then he heard from senior apprentice-brother Qi that the pavilion master looked very favorably upon Meng Qi, and intended to play matchmaker for the two of them. Meng Qi had constantly been declining and trying to get out of it, however, under the pavilion master’s pressure, it seemed there was no way for her to refuse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fuck, you want to gang up on my fiancée? Do you think you can place your intentions on my woman?</span></p>

However, the Forest of Darkness was huge, and he had no idea where she was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After asking some more, he realized senior apprentice-brother Qi knew nothing more that interested him. A brick beat him unconscious and also broke all four of his limbs. This was the same treatment he had given Jiang Yifan. Long Chen tossed a buck-naked senior apprentice-brother Qi down the well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for what those two naked men would do down in that well, Long Chen didn’t care. He wasn’t in the mood to deal with the two of them. In any case, he had already fed them medicines, and they didn’t dare yell. They should not even think about being able to leave for now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once more sealing the well, Long Chen patted his hands and began entering deeper into the Forest of Darkness.</span></p>
