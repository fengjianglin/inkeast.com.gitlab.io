 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Monastery head!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Xuantian Supermonastery’s sect leaders and Elders all let out startled cries and bowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The person who had appeared was an extremely beautiful woman who only looked to be around twenty-five or twenty-six years old. She wore a green dress, and she was so beautiful, her face like a painting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, a powerful pressure came from her, and there were two huge wings on her back. Floating up in the sky, she was truly like an immortal who had descended upon the earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as she appeared, the entire world seemed to tremble, as if she was beginning to merge with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was smiling, her smile like a flower in bloom, beautiful beyond compare. But an icy light shone in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhou Qingyu, you really are amazing. Are you planning on bringing down the entire first monastery? Oh, I understand. You dislike the look of your son’s monastery and so you want to bring it down to build a bigger one, right?” She might be smiling, but her voice was filled with fury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Monastery head, let me explain-”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no need to explain. Zhou Qingyu, although I was in seclusion all these years, I know everything you’ve been up to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I was too lazy to bother with what you were doing since I was at a critical juncture in my seclusion, but I really did underestimate you. For a selfish matter, you actually wanted to kill this many geniuses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In truth, I already came out of seclusion half a month ago, so I personally saw everything you’ve done. The reason I didn’t say anything was because I was very curious just how selfish a person could be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I never expected you to teach me that a person’s evil desires really are boundless. From you, I see the most shameless and contemptible aspects of the entire Righteous path. Good, very good!” said that woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What no one had expected was for the powerful Zhou Qingyu to actually immediately kneel down on the ground and beg, “Monastery head, I was just confused for a while. I was poisoned by my unfilial son, which caused me to make such foolish decisions. Monastery head, please forgive me. My Zhou family will definitely be deeply grateful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now everyone was truly dumbfounded. They had never imagined Zhou Qingyu would kneel and begin weeping bitter tears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, Sha Qitian’s expression completely changed. At this time, his mother had actually pushed all the responsibility onto him, and his heart turned cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since you are the assistant monastery head, I only have the authority to record your mistakes. As for your punishment, it will be decided by the Dao Sect’s enforcement hall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve already reported everything that has happened here to the enforcement hall. As for what they’ll decide to do, it’ll be up to your luck.” That woman shook her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shui Wuhen!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Qingyu suddenly stood up and icily glared at the monastery head. Clenching her teeth, she raged, “You really schemed deeply this time! Good! This time, I, Zhou Qingyu, admit defeat. But don’t get too pleased. My Zhou family won’t leave it like this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Wuhen waved her hand, and a spatial door opened in front of Zhou Qingyu. “Leave. If you have anything to say, say it to the enforcement hall’s Elders. They’ll definitely patiently listen to your story.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing this spatial door, a bit of despair appeared on Zhou Qingyu’s face, but clenching her teeth, she entered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her body disappeared from everyone’s stunned gazes. The spatial gate also faded along with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sha Qitian, do you know your sins?” After sending off Zhou Qingyu, Shui Wuhen turned to her son.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sha Qitian turned pale as paper, and he hastily knelt down, “Monastery head, please spare my life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Wuhen shook her head and sighed. “I also want to spare your life. Unfortunately, I can’t. A person’s sins will always catch up to them sooner or later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a wave of her hand, a pillar of light slammed into Sha Qitian’s body, and his body immediately exploded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But what was shocking was that even after his body exploded, there was not the slightest bit of blood remaining. Instead, there was just some water residue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen’s heart almost leaped out of his body. This monastery head was truly terrifyingly powerful. That attack had clearly contained the aura of the water attribute. Somehow, when it had struck Sha Qitian, he had turned into water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was no longer within the classification of Battle Skills. Such an attack was simply called a magical technique, and it completely surpassed Long Chen’s current understanding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire crowd was silent. No one had thought that this matter would end up alarming the monastery head who had been in seclusion for hundreds of years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Monastery head Shui, my Yin family won’t bother with you about your supermonastery’s internal affairs. However, I absolutely have to bring Long Chen away today.” Yin Qing frowned when she saw that Shui Wuhen had appeared, but she still put on a brave act.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh? Why is that?” asked Shui Wuhen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Because Long Chen is shameless and contemptible. He poisoned one of my Yin family’s geniuses, and despite trying countless methods, the best my Yin family is capable of doing is keeping her just barely alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Most hateful of all is that this bastard Long Chen actually lied, saying if we found a Thousand Heart Snow Lotus, we would be able to save her life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We paid a huge sum in order to obtain a Thousand Heart Snow Lotus, but Yin Wushuang still continues to suffer from the pain of ten thousand ants devouring her heart. It didn’t have any effect,” raged Yin Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen snorted, “Idiot, how did I lie? Yin Wushuang only had seven days of life left to her, but she still hasn’t died now. How did I lie? Do you even have a head?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bastard, right now she has to suffer day and night from incredible pain that’s even worse than death! How can that count as saving her life?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re the bastard! Has your head been trampled by a donkey? You can’t even understand words? My boss said that the Thousand Heart Snow Lotus could save her life. When did he ever say it could relieve the poison? Furthermore, that despicable woman is absolutely vicious and ended up causing that many people to die. This is just her retribution. What are you so mad about?!” Guo Ran couldn’t hold back from cursing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beside him, Mo Nian clapped in praise towards his brilliant cursing. Guo Ran’s cursing truly was satisfying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re courting death!” Yin Qing raged. When would she have ever suffered such humiliation? For a junior generation to curse her in the face like this almost made her explode.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re the one courting death! If you keep being such a bitch and end up irritating uncle Mo, he’ll definitely kill you with a single arrow through the head!” Guo Ran stood behind Mo Yunshan, arrogantly cursing Yin Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Nian’s eyes suddenly brightened, and he raged at Mo Yunshan, “You damn dad, when you talk to me, you barely say a few sentences before just beating me. What, are you ruthless to children but a coward in public?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You actually wasted this many words to an outsider? Just which one of us is your son? Am I your son? Or is she your son?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone’s expressions became odd. Were these two really father and son? Was there really a son who would say such things to his father in public?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What absolute nonsense. Of course, you’re my son, or I’d have long since beat you to death. Furthermore, are you blind? She’s a woman, and she’s even older than your old man. How am I supposed to give birth to her?” roared Mo Yunshan, giving Mo Nian a slap in the face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone’s expressions grew even odder. Were they really one family? Was there really a son like this? Was there really a father like this? They really were a marvel pair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The solemn atmosphere became extremely strange due to their words. However, Yin Qing’s killing intent had boiled to a pinnacle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But at the same time, she also didn’t dare attack. There were too many experts here, and she would definitely end up losing if she started a battle. She could only endure it for now and contemplate getting revenge later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Monastery head Shui! Don’t you feel like you should give my Yin family an explanation?!” demanded Yin Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Wuhen’s faint smile disappeared to be replaced with iciness. “Let me tell you a few things. First, you and I are not on the same level, so when you speak to me, be more respectful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Second, I, Shui Wuhen, don’t need to give anyone any explanation about anything, especially not to a little girl like you who has only reached the half-step Sea Expansion realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Third, don’t think that just by using your family’s name you can run rampantly amok. Although I am just a single supermonastery’s monastery head, I am backed by the Xuantian Dao Sect. You ancient families don’t have the qualifications to suppress me, understand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yin Qing’s face went from red to white. In the outside world, she could always do whatever she wanted. She had never received such a humiliation. But she also didn’t dare publicly challenge Shui Wuhen, because she would be able to crush her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just as Shui Wuhen said. Although she was just a monastery head, behind her was the entire Xuantian Dao Sect, one of the cultivation world’s three heavenly sects. A single ancient family truly was nothing in front of such an enormous existence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ancient families might be able to be tyrannical in the rest of the cultivation world, but in front of the Xuantian Dao Sect, they still didn’t have the qualifications to be arrogant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go back and tell your family exactly what I’ve said. This matter is a private matter of the Xuantian Dao Sect, and we don’t need them to stick their noses into it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since you sent your disciple here as tempering, then you’ll have to comply with our rules. In other words, I have jurisdiction over everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As for Yin Wushuang’s conduct, I’ve heard of what she’s done. And so to settle this matter, I only have one phrase for you: she has only herself to blame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In this world, just having a strong background isn’t completely reliable. That is merely something your ancestors gave you, and it can disappear at any time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your disciple committed outrageous sins here. Did she think that her background placed her above the law? Perhaps that would have been true at other sects, but it isn’t here. And so, scram back to wherever you came from.” Shui Wuhen’s words were said indifferently, obviously disapproving of the Yin family’s conduct.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yin Qing was completely enraged. It was clear Shui Wuhen was protecting Long Chen and refused to give the Yin family any recompense for this matter. Now, she would be unable to obtain Long Chen’s secrets, and she had lost all her prestige.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Yin Qing was hesitating on what to do, Guo Ran cursed, “Hey, are you deaf? Our monastery head has already said it this clearly, but you still don’t understand? Alright, then let me simplify it even more. Our monastery head’s meaning is this: either scram, or die.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yin Qing’s teeth creaked as she clenched them from fury. She really was about to lose control. With a cold snort, she was just about to bring her people away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who is Long Chen?! Hurry up and come out!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a woman’s cry shook the entire sky, causing people’s eardrums to almost burst. Even Shui Wuhen’s expression changed.</span></p>
