 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His vision darkened for a moment, and then Long Chen and the others appeared in a huge transportation formation. They looked around and saw the same kind of scenery. Long Chen couldn’t help but sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The 108th monastery’s transportation formation had been nauseating to use. But now, they instantly arrived without the slightest discomfort. It was convenient, fast, safe, and painless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was reflected in their eyes was still a huge plaza, and at the center of the plaza was a statue three hundred meters tall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The statue depicted an elder with a tranquil expression who possessed an immortal air around him. It was the same statue as the one in the 108th monastery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But this statue was ten times larger, and it wasn’t at all damaged. It was incredibly lifelike, and Long Chen felt an odd charm from it, almost as if this statue was alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was an extremely mysterious feeling. It was clearly just a statue, and there weren’t even any formation runes carved into it. He couldn’t figure it out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Long Chen, sect leader Tu Fang has instructed you to take it easy.” As soon as they arrived at the Xuantian Supermonastery, an Elder hastily opened his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rules had been broken for Long Chen to be promoted to the Enforcement Elder position. In truth, Long Chen was simply wearing that title. Each second, he had an urge to tear that title off himself. He didn’t have time to deal with such trivial matters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, the first monastery now only had so few people. Perhaps before Long Chen had joined, there might have been some disputes and nonsense present, but after Long Chen had joined, those troublesome people had already gone into another world. There wasn’t even any need for law enforcement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only reason Long Chen was given the Law Enforcement Elder position was so he could represent Tu Fang to participate in this sect leader meeting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Tu Fang truly understood Long Chen, and before he had left, he had warned these Elders to look after him. After all, young people tended to be a bit too brazen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, he warned Long Chen, hoping for him to prepare himself. There were many internal disputes between the supermonastery’s 108 monasteries. After fighting for so many years, there was already a set of unwritten rules.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tu Fang was worried Long Chen might start facing off against others without awareness of those unwritten rules, which might cause trouble.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry, I know when to use hard force and when to use light force.” Long Chen waved his hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those Elders didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Who would believe such words from him? But they were already here, and so they could only follow Long Chen. In any case, they were just extras.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had only just arrived when a man ran over to lead them to the meeting place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But after that man saw Long Chen, he couldn’t help being flabbergasted. “May I ask, who are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is Long Chen, our first monastery’s Enforcement Elder. Our sect leader’s health isn’t good right now, and so Elder Long Chen has taken his place to represent the first monastery for the meeting,” replied one of the Elders by Long Chen’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen? I haven’t heard of him. How could someone at the early Bone Forging realm represent a monastery’s sect leader? The first monastery really has declined.” A touch of ridicule appeared on that man’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A hand directly slapped across his face, sending him flying. A miserable scream rang out, and his teeth were like bloodstained gems, flying gracefully through the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Long Chen!” Those Elders couldn’t help being dumbfounded. Didn’t he say he would hold himself back a bit? This was what he meant when he said he knew how to use light force?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I came here for the meeting, not to hear your taunts. A Meridian Opening trash dares insult me?” said Long Chen icily, ignoring the Elders’ cries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You dare strike meh?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That man was just an Elder within the supermonastery. His status was not particularly high. However, his cultivation base had already reached the early Meridian Opening, so he was shocked and infuriated at being slapped by Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He roared furiously, but with his teeth scattered on the ground, and his tongue swelling from the slap, ‘me’ ended up turning into ‘meh’.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As a dog, you should properly lead the way. Don’t say things you shouldn’t say. Can you lead the way or not? If you can’t, then scram back to your doghouse,” snorted Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You must want to die!” That man roared with fury, and he charged directly at Long Chen, a palm slamming towards his stomach. That power shook the void, and those Elders behind Long Chen were all terrified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They might be at the peak of the Bone Forging realm and had tempered eight bones, but in the face of a Meridian Opening expert, they were powerless to resist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen sent his palm crashing into his opponent’s palm. However, he used a skillful technique to strip his palm of any power, and no shockwave occurred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man felt as if his palm had struck cotton. There was nowhere for his energy to go, and he almost coughed up blood from that feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he could react and think of what to do next, he felt a powerful force at the back of his scalp, forcing his head down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As his head was forced down, all he saw was a sturdy knee growing larger in his sight. Only at that moment did he realize something bad was about to happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A sharp pain came from his nose, and the sound of bones breaking rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man was sent flying by Long Chen’s knee, falling amongst a cluster of flowers a few dozen meters away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The originally snow-white flowers were splashed by his scarlet blood, causing them to look mournful yet beautiful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, now I understand why flowers are red.” One of the Elders couldn’t help sighing upon seeing those bloodstained flowers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of the more experienced Elders couldn’t help grumbling, “Elder Long Chen, didn’t you say you knew how to use light force?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen waved his hand, innocently saying, “I said I’m someone who knows how to use hard force and light force. Look, I controlled my force perfectly. He’s not dead, but not really alive. It’s perfectly between hard and light force.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah, let it go. Although you’re all older than me, that doesn’t necessarily mean you can see things clearer than me.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“For such an idiot to come to find us for trouble, there’s definitely someone behind him who sent him here to deliberately make it hard for us.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tch, what kind of joke was this supposed to be? Within the supermonastery’s 108 monasteries, there might be some people who don’t know who the monastery head is, but there’s definitely no one who doesn’t know who I am.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You didn’t even see through such an obvious mistake? If I had just endured the words he said, he would have found other ways to provoke us.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you have to wait until you can’t endure it anymore before fighting? Sorry, but I’m not that kind of person. Once I finish slapping the left side of someone’s face, if they then stick out the right side of their face for me, I’ll definitely help slap them again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Look, there are already people coming over. This is all premeditated. Just don’t say anything and quietly watch the play.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as Long Chen said this, several experts appeared, rushing over. The person at the front was a middle-aged man wearing the robes of the supermonastery. His powerful aura marked him as a Xiantian expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What person dares behave so badly in my Xuantian Supermonastery?” shouted the middle-aged man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen acted as if he didn’t even see him, and simply continued walking forward. The Elders behind him hurriedly lowered their heads, not saying a word and also acting as if they hadn’t seen him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had now experienced Long Chen’s domineeringness, and they were also shocked by Long Chen’s intelligence. With a single glance, he had seen through this scheme. His vision was truly frighteningly sharp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey, I’m talking to you! After beating someone, you want to just leave?” raged the Xiantian expert.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Long Chen was still ignoring him, he furiously extended his hand to block Long Chen and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh? Why are you blocking me?” asked Long Chen curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You injured someone and then want to just leave?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen frowned slightly and asked one of the Elders behind him, “I can only understand human speech. Help me translate what he’s saying.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He said you injured someone, and he wants to find you for the bill.” That Elder turned green from being stared at by Long Chen, and could only thicken his face and help ‘translate’ for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You!” raged the Xiantian expert. Long Chen was actually cursing him as not being human.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen didn’t even glance at him, continuing to speak to that Elder. “Tell him I didn’t hit anyone. I just taught a dog that wouldn’t listen a lesson. If the supermonastery has any objections, then call out the dog’s master to talk. Otherwise, either attack or scram.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After saying that, Long Chen ignored the man and brought his people away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man was in a complete rage, clenching his teeth so hard he felt like they might break. Pointing at Long Chen’s back, he shouted, “Good! Just wait, Long Chen, I’ll report this matter to the higher-ups! Your first monastery should just wait for your punishment!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen completely ignored him, treating him as air. That person’s lungs almost exploded from rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The highest realm of humiliating someone was to ignore them</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">. If you cursed back at them, that was raising their status. Long Chen definitely wouldn’t give him that kind of chance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Long Chen couldn’t see through such an obvious trap, then he wouldn’t be Long Chen. So he handled it as directly as possible, too lazy to waste more words on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was his first time in the supermonastery. The supermonastery had countless palace halls, and if he had come by himself, he definitely would have gotten lost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luckily, two of these Elders had often accompanied Ling Yun-zi to these annual meetings before, and so they knew the lay of the land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An hour later, Long Chen arrived at an immense palace that was incredibly spacious and bright. As soon as he entered the main hall, he saw one hundred and eight seats.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Other than the first seat, the other seats already had people sitting on them. Those were naturally the 108 monasteries’ sect leaders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind each sect leader stood several Elders. It was unknown what they were whispering about. But when Long Chen appeared, they all turned silent, looking at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was absolutely silent. Hundreds of gazes focused on Long Chen, but those gazes weren’t friendly. Quite a few of them even contained intense jealousy and hate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of them all, the gazes from the second monastery and the new 108th monastery were the most intense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen smiled slightly. Ignoring everyone’s gazes, he walked over to the first seat. This was the throne of the first monastery and also the peak throne of all the 108 monasteries. Countless people longed to sit in that chair even in their dreams.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sitting on the chair, Long Chen didn’t have any particularly special feeling. It wasn’t even as comfortable as sitting on a grass meadow. But looking at those jealous gazes, no matter what, Long Chen still had to put on an extremely satisfied act.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nowadays, my monastery really has declined. For an incompetent youngster to take such a high position, it really makes a person sneer.” A sinister voice rang out from the crowd.</span></p>
