 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Wushuang’s sword was three feet long, a standard size. But Long Chen’s Devil Decapitator was seven feet long. Even though Long Chen was attacking after her, he still gained an advantage due to his weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Wushuang sneered when she saw Long Chen refused to face off against her directly. She gave up on her attack and her sword blocked Long Chen’s attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Devil Decapitator once more trembled. This time Long Chen was watching closely. He saw that the runes on her sword brightened for a moment when it collided with his saber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that instant, Long Chen sensed that thirty percent of his power had been absorbed and then rebounded back at him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had to endure thirty percent of his own attack, as well as Yin Wushuang’s own power. His wrist trembled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this time he had been prepared, and hadn’t attacked with his full strength. The backlash was much weaker this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As I thought.” Long Chen’s eyes brightened. He had finally seen through some of the intricacies of this silver sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stepped forward, spinning in a circle, cutting Devil Decapitator in an odd arc towards Yin Wushuang’s waist. He attacked like lightning, in a both bold and domineering manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Wushuang had only just blocked his previous attack. Before she could even attack again, Long Chen had already taken the initiative, taking her by surprise. Long Chen’s saber was only three inches from her waist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If she was hit, then that terrifying energy behind his saber would instantly cut her in two. She hastily went to block it in horror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But what made her even more horrified was that her sword hit nothing. This incomparably bold and powerful attack of his had been nothing more than a feint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her sword was blocking her waist, while Long Chen’s saber switched angles, turning from a cut into a stab, going straight for her lower abdomen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time she reacted, the tip of his saber had almost reached her. Yin Wushuang let out a panicked cry and frantically dodged to the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sound of clothing being cut rang out. People were shocked to see that the tip of Long Chen’s saber had cut open a gap in Yin Wushuang’s robes, revealing a silver soft armor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was shocked. Instead of a shocking, incredibly pressuring attack, it was a simple, seemingly ordinary saber move that had almost killed Yin Wushuang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Wushuang was pale with fright. Long Chen’s attacks were too incisive, and there was almost no time for her to react.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it hadn’t been for this soft armor, his saber would have very likely wounded her. But even so, she still felt a chill on her abdomen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As expected, she really does have many treasures,” Long Chen snorted to himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was his first time using this kind of skillful fighting method. This kind of fighting method was extremely common in the secular world, but it was very rare in the cultivation world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cultivators preferred to use absolute martial might to suppress their opponents. Ever since Long Chen had joined the monastery, he had also essentially used that kind of fighting method the entire time. That was because this kind of fighting method was the most direct and most effective.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amongst cultivators, they would rarely go all-out against people with equal strength as them. But in the secular world, your battle experience and technical skills were extremely important as to whether or not you could survive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one had taught Long Chen his fighting techniques. Instead, they were things he had figured out after experiencing countless life and death fights. These techniques could truly say to be things he had gained through bleeding blood and risking his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In comparison, Yin Wushuang was essentially a greenhouse flower. She had powerful fighting strength, but in terms of fighting techniques, she was not on the same level as Long Chen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If his first attack was ineffective, then Long Chen would switch moves. There was no pressure, no grandness. It was just an ordinary saber attack with nothing special about it. But it was filled with killing power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Long Chen once more slash out at her, sword-images once more spread from Yin Wushuang’s silver sword, completely protecting her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Continuous explosions echoed out. Long Chen attacked repeatedly, but they were all blocked by her. Yin Wushuang’s sword was flying all around and had formed an air-tight defense around her. Long Chen’s attacks were unable to break her defense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, Long Chen was continuously struck by the backlash from Yin Wushuang’s sword. That made his hand ache, and he grumbled inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That sword was far too evil. Long Chen didn’t dare release his full strength against it. It was like Yin Wushuang was a porcupine, and she made it so others couldn’t lay their hands on her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Long Chen, if I don’t tear out your muscles and flay your skin today, then I won’t be Yin Wushuang!” Yin Wushuang had finally recovered from her previous terror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That cut on her abdomen was pure humiliation to her. Now that she saw Long Chen was unable to break her defense, her timidity faded and her anger soared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her sword suddenly began to fly about even faster as she surprisingly took the initiative to charge forward at Long Chen. However, she didn’t release any attacks. Instead, all she needed to do was protect herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was using the reflective runes on her sword to kill Long Chen with his own energy. There was no way to block her properly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Wushuang’s silver sword was a precious treasure that an ancestor in her family had left behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those runes that had been carved into it were able to rebound a portion of an enemy’s strength. These runes were incredibly bizarre, and despite knowing what shape these runes were in, it was not possible to carve them into other weapons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A craftsman from Yin Wushuang’s family had researched these runes for countless years, and was still unable to carve them onto another weapon. In the end, he could only conclude that these were special runes that required a special carving method.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So this silver sword had become a treasure in her family. If Yin Wushuang’s position in her family was not special, she wouldn’t have been able to use it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now she was using this special sword to force Long Chen into desperate straits, causing him to retreat over and over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How come I can’t understand anything that’s going on?” There were some people who couldn’t help muttering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were completely unable to understand what was going on. At first, the two of their auras had reached a shocking level, and their pressure had forced them all back in terror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But once they had started fighting, all that imposingness had disappeared, and now their fight seemed like an ordinary, secular fight. How had they begun to fight like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the start, Yin Wushuang’s sword had constantly been blossoming with silver light that had concealed her runes. Those people were unable to tell what was going on from so far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen was clearly fighting evenly with her, and the fight didn’t seem too intense. And yet, those sharp-eyed people were all able to see that Long Chen’s hand was constantly bleeding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Yao and Lu Fang-er’s hearts clenched. They didn’t know what to do. Should they try and help Long Chen?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen basically had his hands tied against Yin Wushuang’s scoundrel-like move. He didn’t dare face off against her sword directly. Such a fight was far too stifling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How is it? Are you afraid now? What happened to your vigor from back then? How did you become a turtle sticking his head in his shell?” Seeing that this move of hers was effective, Yin Wushuang sneered at Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While blocking her, Long Chen was constantly wondering what to do. Continuing like this was far too passive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You care a lot about that woman, right? Then I’ll kill her right now and see whether you can still keep your head in your shell.” Yin Wushuang’s sword-images suddenly disappeared from in front of Long Chen. She had used some kind of unknown footwork to become like a phantom rushing towards Chu Yao and Lu Fang-er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Careful!” Long Chen was startled, and immediately used his footwork to catch up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Snow was connected to his mind, so he was the first to react. He immediately opened his mouth and spat out a wind blade at Yin Wushuang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Wushuang snorted and her sword broke apart Little Snow’s wind blade. Now that she had activated her bloodline power, she was incredibly terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Yao now reacted and formed a hand seal in front of her. Countless wooden stakes shot out of the ground, aiming to bind Yin Wushuang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Flickering Light, Sweeping Shadow.”</span></p>

Her sword flashed silver as it cut across the void, bringing with it endless pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sword caused all of heaven and earth to change color. It was clearly a full strength blow; she wanted Chu Yao and Lu Fang-er to die so that Long Chen would be filled with pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen was rushing back as fast as he could, but it was too late for him to save them. His eyes had turned scarlet, almost as if they were about to emit flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ten Thousand Wood Shield!” Countless wooden stakes shot out of the ground and formed layer after layer in front of Chu Yao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BANG!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wooden fragments shot everywhere. Yin Wushuang’s sword destroyed Chu Yao’s huge wooden shield. Chu Yao, Lu Fang-er, and Little Snow were all sent flying by a terrifying qi wave, smashing into the cliff behind her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Snow reacted first and placed his body in front of the cliff so that Lu Fang-er and Chu Yao smashed into his softer body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even so, since their constitutions were so weak, they still received a heavy impact, and blood overflowed from their mouths. Their internal injuries were not light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Little Snow hadn’t used his body to block for the two of them, then it was very likely for the two of them to have died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? You didn’t die?” Yin Wushuang was extremely startled that Chu Yao was able to block one of her attacks. That attack of hers had been released with hate, and she hadn’t held back at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She really did hate Long Chen now. Once Long Chen had appeared here, Yin Wushuang’s women’s intuition had told her that his relationship with Chu Yao was not ordinary. Long Chen had caused her prestige to drop, and he had then refused to clash with her directly in their fighting just now, so she had been unable to kill him. That was why she wanted to kill Chu Yao and Lu Fang-er first, all so she could provoke Long Chen. Once Long Chen was consumed by his fury and began to clash with her directly, he would definitely die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you didn’t die, then try and receive another blow”! Yin Wushuang was delighted in being able to get revenge on Long Chen, and her sword once more shone brightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as she was preparing to attack again, her body suddenly stiffened, and she felt as if she was being stared at by some ancient monster. At the same time, a voice that was as cold as ten-thousand-year-old ice rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die.”</span></p>
