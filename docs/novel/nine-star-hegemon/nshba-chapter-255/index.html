The entire world shook the instant they collided. Huge cracks spread out across the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good, you haven’t disappointed me! I didn’t run from my old man for nothing. This place is too small, so let’s switch locations.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Nian took a single step and appeared ten miles away. After just a couple steps, he was thirty miles away, his speed causing others to be speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Luo snorted and also moved. His figure was like a phantom as he went straight for Mo Nian. The golden spear in his hands brought with it heaven-piercing will as it stabbed towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Nian’s bow continuously shook, releasing a resplendent glow that lit up the sky. He shot out three consecutive arrows that appeared in midair, shooting at Yin Luo from three different angles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Luo roared, his long hair fluttering in the wind. His spear swung out, and suddenly thousands of spear images appeared around him, devouring those three arrows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BOOM BOOM BOOM! Even from a hundred miles away, anyone could still sense the ground quivering intensely with each blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How powerful!” Even Long Chen was awed. Mo Nian and Yin Luo’s fighting abilities far surpassed his expectations. Was that the strength of Favored?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kill them all!”</span></p>

Their spear and arrows caused powerful explosions, qi waves surging out whenever they collided. As for the Corrupt disciples on this side, they now began to attack Long Chen and the other Righteous disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their main target was Long Chen. Long Chen was clearly the spiritual support of the entire Righteous army. They didn’t know why a little Blood Condensation brat was their leader, but they did know that if they killed Long Chen, the Righteous path’s disciples would immediately become a pack of loose sand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An extremely pale man who almost looked like a zombie went straight at Long Chen. His fingertips grew, his nails becoming like claws. A metallic lustre shined from them, and a piercing sound came from them that shocked everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most frightening of all was that his hands were covered with blood-colored runes that emitted a dense aura of death. Even Long Chen’s heart shivered. It seemed as if those two hands contained countless vengeful spirits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little Blood Condensation brat, die!” The zombie man harshly shouted and arrived right in front of Long Chen. Long Chen didn’t dare be careless. He circulated all his energy to hack his saber at this Favored.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BOOM!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the zombie man, he was also shocked. He hadn’t expected Long Chen to be so powerful and be able to block one of his full strength attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was a Favored, someone unmatched amongst the same realm. Although he was only at the early Tendon Transformation realm, other than Yin Luo, there was no one within the entire Tendon Transformation realm who could suppress him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even late Tendon Transformation experts would be killed in an instant by him. However, Long Chen had not only received his attack, but he also didn’t seem to have been injured at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll take your life with my second attack!” That man coldly shouted, his aura exploding. Faint blood mist came out of his body. As soon as that blood mist appeared, Long Chen almost hear the miserable cries of mournful ghosts in his ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was one of the terrifying aspects of the Corrupt path’s techniques. Not only were their attacks terrifying, but their bodies had accumulated an endless amount of resentment and murderous aura which was specialized in breaking a person’s will. If your will wasn’t strong enough and you ended up being intimidated, you would immediately be done for.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Long Chen’s will was incomparably firm. He hadn’t even submitted in front of the pressure from heaven and earth. This little bit of resentment was unable to shake him in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wood Rock Thorns!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly a lovable shout rang out, and the earth split apart as hundreds of wooden thorns shot out of the ground, covering an area of forty meters as they stabbed towards the zombie man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was at first startled, but then he sneered, swinging his claws to destroy those thick wooden thorns.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those wooden thorns were thicker than a person’s thigh and were also as hard as steel. However, his claws still managed to break them to pieces. Unfortunately, the zombie man had underestimated the toughness of the wooden thorns. A single claw was only able to break a few of the wooden thorns at once, and was unable to break them all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And in the next instant, those thorns had already viciously broken through his defense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those wooden thorns encompassed all of heaven and earth, and it was impossible for him to dodge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re asking for it!” The zombie man angrily roared and a demonic red light shined from his body. He appeared to be covered in blood, and his aura became several times stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The energy surging out his body directly broke those wooden thorns. Those broken fragments filled the sky, making him appear incredibly imposing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Xuantian Monaster’s disciples had never seen such a terrifying figure. That kind of person was someone impossible for them to defeat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if they might not be afraid of death, they were unable to feel the slightest hope of defeating such a powerful person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Long Chen, leave this person to me. You have to be careful!” The person who had come was naturally Chu Yao. She smiled slightly to Long Chen, causing him to feel some relief, and then formed a hand seal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ten Thousand Wood Thicket!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The earth split apart, countless wooden stakes flying out in a range of several miles, going directly for the zombie man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Yao’s first attack had just been a quick move. Now she was releasing her full strength. Those thousands of wooden stakes moved like soft ropes that quickly surged over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The zombie man was horrified. He had already seen that from her previous attack that those wooden stakes were extremely strange, somehow being both tough, hard, and flexible. They were extremely hard for him to deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now seeing this many wooden stakes surging over, he hastily began to move, dodging as best as he could.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he couldn’t dodge them, then he would have to directly smash them to pieces. However, he didn’t dare release as powerful of a move as he had used to destroy those wooden thorns. That kind of move was something he could only use a couple times before running out of energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fighting a wood attribute expert in terms of stamina was just asking for death. Most wood attribute cultivators were specialized in assisting the real fighters. They had a vast ocean’s worth of energy, but their attacking strength was very ordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Chu Yao’s talent was exceptional, and her wood energy actually contained a trace of earth energy as well, giving her both the hardness of stone as well as the toughness of wood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was also why the Skywood Palace’s sect leader had directly taken her as an apprentice. The Skywood Palace’s sect leader was extremely prideful, and she had yet to take an apprentice before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After taking in Chu Yao, she taught her everything she could. So although Chu Yao had only been in the Skywood Palace for a short time, her foundation was extremely solid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, Chu Yao, in order to protect Long Chen in the future, put in all her effort to cultivate. That was why she now possessed such a terrifying combat ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wood had surged into the sky now, appearing like countless huge snakes, crazily attacking the zombie man. It was an incredibly powerful display, and Tu Fang was looking in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only Hua Yu excitedly said, “Hehe, this girl is extremely powerful. She raises the prestige of my entire Skywood Palace.”</span></p>

He had immediately been caught within a wood formation, and Chu Yao could be said to have placed herself in an invincible position.</span></p>

All the wooden stakes were under her control, essentially a part of her body.</span></p>

In fact, he looked even uglier than a real zombie. He had been completely trapped.</span></p>

But there was no way he could compete with a wood attribute expert in terms of stamina.</span></p>

As for a wood attribute Favored, who knew just how much energy she had?</span></p>

No matter how he tried, there was no way he could approach Chu Yao, let alone attack her. She kept him at a constant range of three hundred meters.</span></p>

As for his hatchet, it was incredibly huge. He was clearly a terrifying expert who specialized in brute power.</span></p>

Normally he never got to experience any satisfying fights due to a lack of opponents. Probably the only disciple who could exchange blows with him was Long Chen, but since he didn’t want to fight Long Chen, he had been extremely stifled during this period.</span></p>

Afraid of someone else fighting with him over that fellow, he had immediately charged over.</span></p>

A couple stones rolled off the mountainside.</span></p>
