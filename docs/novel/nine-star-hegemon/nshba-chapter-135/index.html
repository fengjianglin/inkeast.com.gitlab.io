 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The majority of these registrants were astonished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A seventy-five percent elimination? That was too much, wasn’t it?! In other words, amongst more than thirty thousand people present, less than eight thousand of them could pass! The rest would all be eliminated?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A chill descended over them. Although they had heard that the Xuantian Monastery’s disciple selection was extremely harsh, they had never thought it had reached such a level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the majority of people were shocked and worried, the stronger ones only indifferently smiled. They had the self-confidence to pass this trial.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Xuantian Monastery truly was ruthless enough. Just from the start of the trial, everyone could already tell how cruel the competition was in the monastery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Each one of you has a jade tile with one of four words on them: Tian, Di, Xuan, Huang. Once you enter the area for the trial, you’ll need to collect all four of them in order to pass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As for how you collect them, there’s no need to dance around it. I trust everyone here is smart enough to know how to gather them,” said senior apprentice-brother Wan lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is this a mistake? Isn’t this just you guys playing us like we’re monkeys? You want us to massacre ourselves? That’s not fair!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Someone angrily shouted out. That person came from a small power. There, he was counted as someone with both power and prestige. He would never receive such treatment there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But once he had come here, he had seen far too many powerful figures. He had realized that he was merely an existence that could only pad the bottom rankings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now he learned that the trial was a huge fight and scramble between everyone. With his power, he didn’t have the slightest hope of passing, and so he indignantly shouted out that it wasn’t fair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fair? Does this world have anything that is fair? You spoiled disciples, you’ve all been given the best resources and medicinal pills to cultivate. You even had experts that temper and cleanse your bodies. Is that fair to those martial artists who are born poor and desolate?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Remember, within the Xuantian Monastery, there is no fairness. Even the monastery’s rules favor the powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is a river of struggle. If you have the capability, then swim to the front. And if you don’t, then just obediently lie under other people’s feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you have no skill and you also don’t want to feel wronged, then just get lost. The Xuantian Monastery has limited resources and doesn’t raise trash,” shouted senior apprentice-brother Wan icily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen nodded. His words were completely correct. If a sect wanted to grow, it required powerful disciples to mature. Those cannon fodders were just wasting resources, slowing down the sect’s development.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although his words were difficult to accept, it was an indisputable fact that there was never anything known as fairness within this world. These spoiled young masters who had only known peace and comfort within their families were unable to understand the cruelness of reality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey, if you don’t have any skill then just fuck off. But before you leave, hand over your jade tile to me,” said another registrant disdainfully, perhaps hoping to gain a slight advantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fuck, I won’t hand it over to a bastard like you,” raged that person angrily. How would it be possible for him to obediently hand over his jade tile?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok, then just wait for me. Once I find you, we’ll see if you still have the same resolution.” The other one also wasn’t some tolerant person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Quiet!” shouted senior apprentice-brother Wan coldly. They both shut up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In any case, I hope you properly take care of your jade tile. There are only a total of 7963 sets. If you feel like you have no hope, you can always destroy your jade tile or throw it into a ditch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you can’t advance, then you can at least make it so that three others are also unable to advance with you. Although that doesn’t benefit you in the slightest, it’ll at least count as venting some anger,” said senior apprentice-brother Wan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Quite a few people’s eyes brightened as they thought, Haha, what a good idea. If I have no hope then you guys can also give up any thoughts of advancing either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen couldn’t help but shake his head. This senior apprentice-brother Wan really was ruthless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he understood that the Xuantian Monastery’s selection of disciples was not at an ordinary level of difficulty. But the more it was like this, the stronger the disciples that remained would become. They would become the best existences to groom. The important thing was to make sure he was one of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Guo Ran, are you confident?” Long Chen wasn’t worried about himself. But he did feel that perhaps Guo Ran was a bit too weak for this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he had perceptive eyes, no matter how he looked at him, he didn’t seem like an expert. After the start of the trial, everything would rely on strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry boss. I’ve long since made my preparations.” When he saw that no one was looking at him, his worried expression disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh? You have a plan?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, I won’t hide it from boss. I didn’t just gather all that information for nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Amongst the many medicinal pills I gathered, there are several which others would do anything for. There are many people who are about to wash out here. As long as I use my glib tongue, I can easily persuade them to exchange their tile for medicinal pills.” Guo Ran laughed confidently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even that was accepted? Long Chen really hadn’t imagined there was such a method. But with the high wash-out rate, Guo Ran’s method truly might be effective.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What if someone comes to fight with you over the tiles?” asked Long Chen suddenly. According to what senior-apprentice Wan had just said, these tiles couldn’t be placed into spatial rings. If they were, the word on top of them would disappear which would equal as a failure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, boss, don’t worry. I’ve long since made my preparations. I was just acting just now for others. I’ve already prepared all my escape plans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But on the other hand, I’m worried for you. Although the trial zone is extremely enormous, there’s still an off-chance you might run into Qi Xin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“And it’s not just Qi Xin. Even Lei Qianshang doesn’t like you now. If he really does want to force you out, it’d be impossible for you to pass,” said Guo Ran worriedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was a bit troublesome, but Long Chen wasn’t that worried. Although their strengths were terrifying to others, Long Chen wasn’t afraid of them. If he really did end up forced to fight them, it wasn’t sure just who should be fearing who.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“At this point, we’re entering the trial section. All your Magical Beasts must be put away. Send them back to your families. No one is allowed to bring a Magical Beast into the monastery.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen was startled by senior apprentice-brother Wan’s order. There was even such a rule? Other people had people from their households who would bring their Magical Beasts back, but Long Chen didn’t.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Snow definitely couldn’t part with him. But since the trial was about to start, he could only quietly whisper a few things to Little Snow. Hearing Long Chen’s orders, Little Snow quietly growled and walked off alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok, the rules have already been explained. The lines carved into the back of your tiles are your map. After entering the trial region, just insert your spiritual energy into the tile and you’ll be able to tell your position. The method is the same as the one for opening a spatial ring. Are there any other questions?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Senior apprentice-brother Wan looked over everyone. Seeing no one say anything, he nodded. “Then get ready for the trial. Remember, it is prohibited to maliciously kill others in the trial region. If you do, you will immediately be expelled.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Send them off!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following senior apprentice-brother Wan’s cold shout, their jade tiles suddenly became hot. Their bodies became light as the scenery around them twisted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen was completely astonished. This was the first time he had encountered such a thing. Before he understood what was happening, the space around him brightened and he arrived within a valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What dense spiritual qi!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surrounding spiritual qi here was like a spring wind blowing around him. Even without deliberately cultivating, just by breathing he could feel himself quickly advancing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Examining his surroundings, he saw he was at the bottom of a valley. Just below him was a slow, babbling creek.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior apprentice-brother Wan said there were countless opportunities within this region. First, I’ll take a look. In any case, the trial will continue for a month. As long as I find a full set of tiles before the time is up, it’ll count as a pass.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen gathered his thoughts. Examining the tile’s map and figuring out where he was, he disappeared from his original location.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Atop a distant mountain, there was an enormous tree. Atop its huge, heaven-reaching crown were two people. One of them was the one who had given Long Chen his registration card, Tu Fang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the other, he appeared to be in his thirties. His face was graceful and natural, and there was a simple longsword on his back. Within his eyes was a peaceful expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This man was the Xuantian Monastery’s number one expert, the sword expert who had become famous three hundred years ago, Ling Yun-zi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That person is Long Chen?” he asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. Originally, I wasn’t planning on giving him the registration card, but for some unknown reason I kept feeling that he would one day grow to become an outstanding existence, and so I still gave it to him,” said Tu Fang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah, congratulations Tu Fang. That proves you are becoming increasingly closer to the Heavenly Daos. Your breakthrough to Xiantian is only a matter of time,” smiled Ling Yun-zi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why do you say that?” asked Tu Fan with surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Only once you have approached the Heavenly Daos will you sense a few secrets of the unseen world. That is a sign you about to advance to Xiantian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even I only began to have such feelings over a hundred years ago. And so I am sure that your advancement to Xiantian is only a matter of time,” said Ling Yun-zi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then sect leader’s meaning is that Long Chen…?” asked Tu Fang probingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. His Dantian is completely still, but his blood and qi are like a roaring dragon. His physical body is comparable to a third rank Magical Beast. That is completely beyond common sense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But most inconceivable of all is that his energy is all gathered and hidden away within his left foot. Once that hidden energy explodes out, his strength will multiply.” Ling Yun-zi watched Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah, as expected of the sect leader. I could only see that his Dantian had no Spirit Root. I had no idea his energy was all concealed in his foot,” praised Tu Fang admiringly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I couldn’t see it clearly. I could only vaguely sense it. And furthermore, I was only able to do so because Long Chen’s cultivation base is low and is only at what seems to be the mid Blood Condensation realm. If he reaches Tendon Transformation, nobody would be able to sense anything.” Ling Yun-zi shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? You’re an existence beyond the Meridian Opening realm. Within the Xiantian realm, you might make a breakthrough any day and comprehend the Heavenly Daos. How would it be possible for you to not be able to see through someone at the Tendon Transformation realm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Once you reach my realm, you will understand a couple of things. Now that this Long Chen has arrived at our Xuantian Monastery, perhaps the Xuantian Monastery will never be calm again,” sighed Ling Yun-zi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sect leader, this is my fault. Please forgive me,” apologized Tu Fang hastily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ling Yun-zi smiled slightly. “This doesn’t have anything to do with you. It’s simply fate. But this youth can perhaps bring a couple of changes to our Xuantian Monastery. We can only hope those changes are for the good.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is this Long Chen really that hard to deal with?” Tu Fang couldn’t even believe his ears. But this was the most respected sect leader…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t know about how hard he is to deal with. But as long as he doesn’t die, perhaps the entire world will change because of him. That is because he is one of those legendary existences of heaven and earth - a Divergent.” Ling Yun-zi looked up at the sky, his voice filled with endless respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tu Fang was shocked to see him suddenly cough out a mouthful of blood.</span></p>
