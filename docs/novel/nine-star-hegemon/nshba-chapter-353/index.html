As soon as he caught sight of it, Long Chen urged Little Snow in its direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Snow was extremely fast, and those thousands of miles were traversed in just a short time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hide in the spiritual space for a moment.” Long Chen activated his Spiritual Strength to return Little Snow to his spiritual space. Glancing back at the Barbaric Wind Beast, he laughed mischievously.&nbsp;</span></p>

The lake was extremely deep, almost like an abyss, and just a few dozen meters from the shore, the water level reached a depth of hundreds of meters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, the water trembled and Long Chen felt a powerful undercurrent rushing towards him, accompanied by a terrifying &nbsp;pressure. He hastily swam further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could hear the Barbaric Wind Beast’s angry roar. Long Chen knew that it was currently attacking the lake.</span></p>

More and more undercurrents shot out around him, most likely created by wind blades from the Barbaric Wind Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the lake water was obstructing most of that attacking power. Other than the first few being a bit uncomfortable to Long Chen, the rest weren’t able to pose any threat to him once he was deeper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the center of the lake, the depth had reached a terrifying three thousand meters. The water pressure was strong, but it didn’t pose any danger to Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like that, Long Chen hid in a crack at the bottom of the lake, using his divine sense to keep track of the activity above water. At the beginning, the lake water had been constantly shaking, with countless fish being killed by the impacts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, those impacts were unable to threaten him. The crazy bombardment continued for two hours before gradually pausing. Perhaps the Barbaric Wind Beast had already left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen bitterly endured for a full day at the bottom of the lake before swimming back up to the surface. When he was about to reach the surface, he saw there were countless fish that were dead, floating on the surface. Many of them were species that Long Chen didn’t recognize.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Evildoer! Killing the innocent, and then shamelessly wasting it all! If only Wilde were here.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shit!” Long Chen hastily dived back into the water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BOOM!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A huge wind blade shot through the water. Even though Long Chen had reacted quickly, he had only reached a depth of thirty meters before a terrifying wave of energy struck him. It was as if a hammer had smashed him, and he vomited a mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, a strange energy struck his head. He became incredibly dizzy, and almost directly fainted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen was horrified. He endured the intense pain in his head and continued swimming downwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Continuous explosions rang out and Long Chen’s head continued to buzz. He felt like his head might split apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fuck, now I know how those fish died. They weren’t killed by direct hits, but by the vibrations of the water from its attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen once more reached the bottom of the lake, feeling like his head might split open. This time it had really been too dangerous. If he had lost consciousness, it would have been all too likely for him to have died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is no solution… the Barbaric Wind Beast wants to kill me and definitely won’t leave this place. I have to think of a way to get out of here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He began to swim over to the other shore. The part of the shore he chose to go to was like a steep cliff. It was still extremely deep here, and as long as he didn’t swim up, he still wouldn’t be noticed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Long Chen didn’t dare climb ashore. The lake might be three thousand miles wide, but that distance was nothing to the terrifying Barbaric Wind Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With its speed and its control over wind energy, it would easily be able to run across the water. These three thousand miles were no obstruction to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I guess I can only use this clumsy method.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength spread out and a golden page appeared in front of him. He began to cut through the rock. He wanted to cut a tunnel that stretched far away enough from here that it was out of the Barbaric Wind Beast’s line of sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although this method was a bit clumsy, Long Chen was unable to think of a better solution. It wasn’t as if he could try to compete in terms of patience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Magical Beasts had shocking lifespans. A year was nothing to them. However, Long Chen would be killed if he waited a whole year.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So he didn’t dare compete with it in terms of patience. He still needed to go looking for more opportunities for himself. He could sense that the mysterious feeling of something summoning him was growing more intense. That should be the greatest opportunity for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had no idea what this golden page was made of. It was thin as paper, but when he used Spiritual Strength to control it, it was capable of piercing iron like it was mud. Its sharpness was terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden page cut through this rock like a sharp blade cutting through tofu. In just a couple of breaths' time, a channel thick enough for him had been cut into the rock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen did this all very carefully. He replaced the rock behind him as he went. If he made too big of a movement, then it would be noticed by the Barbaric Wind Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Long Chen was pleasantly surprised to find that after he had excavated just a couple hundred meters, he actually managed to connect to a natural underground cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And the best thing about it was that he could feel wind within the cave. In other words, this cave had to be connected to the surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He sensed the wind and began walking with the wind. Generally, it was colder underground than the surface, so the wind would usually blow from underground to the surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In less than six hours of wandering underground, Long Chen finally saw light ahead. He was filled with an incomparable sensation of freedom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He carefully went to the edge of the cave and used his divine sense to scout the surroundings. Only when Long Chen confirmed this wasn’t near the lake did he dare walk out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He realized he had come out from halfway up a mountain. He hastily concealed his aura and snuck his way to the top of the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he had expected, he hadn’t gone far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the top of the mountain, he could see the lake that was now over two hundred miles away. The Barbaric Wind Beast was still closely staring into the lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hehe, just keep guarding here. I’ll be leaving first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Long Chen knew he no longer needed to be so careful here, he had truly been scared by the Barbaric Wind Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He carefully crept away. Only when he was two mountains further away did he finally relax.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Over these past few days of being chased by the Barbaric Wind Beast, Long Chen might have appeared relaxed, but in truth, his nerves had been constantly stretched taut. Even now that he had shaken off the Barbaric Wind Beast, he still almost felt like its huge head would come up from behind and swallow him at any moment.</span></p>

If it had been any other person, then even if they managed to survive after being chased for that long, they probably would have had a mental collapse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that he was further away, Long Chen began to increase his speed. When he was finally tens of thousands of miles away, he finally allowed himself to completely relax. He found a hidden area to rest.</span></p>

Long Chen found a cave and summoned out Little Snow. With Little Snow guarding him, he slept deeply while lying on Little Snow’s side.</span></p>

That allowed them to relax in the face of the pressure they were under. Long Chen slept soundly for three whole days before finally opening his eyes, feeling completely refreshed.</span></p>

Originally, three thousand meters was more than enough for Little Snow. But with the addition of the Wind Spirit Crystal, there were now terrifying gales surging around in his spiritual space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although there were no signs that it would cause the spiritual space to collapse for the moment, it was possible that it would pose a threat in the future. So now that he had escaped from the Barbaric Wind Beast’s chase, Long Chen was planning on settling this matter. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to put his heart at ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once he put Little Snow in his spiritual space, Long Chen used his Spiritual Strength to communicate with him. “I want to increase the size of the spiritual space. I’ll be using the Wind Spirit Crystal’s energy to evenly expand it. Little Snow, you do your best to try to spread the Wind Spirit Crystal’s energy evenly throughout the space.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aowu!”</span></p>

Little Snow was still growing smarter. He was easily on the level of a human, and capable of comprehending such things.</span></p>

His mind-sea shook, and his Spiritual Strength began to circulate.</span></p>

That was his spiritual space.</span></p>

They would normally have to destroy the original one to create a brand new spiritual space.</span></p>

However, it would exhaust far more time. It could easily take months. Long Chen didn’t have that much time.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In order to do this, there were two requirements. One was that there needed to be energy inside the spiritual space that was evenly expanding it. The other was that the owner’s Spiritual Strength had to have reached an abnormal level. Otherwise, there was a risk of the spiritual space exploding. However, this wasn’t anything difficult for Long Chen and Little Snow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three days later, the spiritual space in Long Chen’s mind-sea had reached a width of thirty thousand meters. Long Chen gave Little Snow a thumbs-up. Little Snow’s control had been perfect, and there had been no danger the entire time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen adjusted himself slightly.
