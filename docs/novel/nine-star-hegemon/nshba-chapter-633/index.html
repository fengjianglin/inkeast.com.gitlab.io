 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the battlefield was cleaned up, Long Chen examined everyone’s injuries. It went without saying that this battle had been extremely fierce.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although they had all undergone complete tempering before advancing to Meridian Opening, it was still difficult for them to battle Xiantian experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But luckily, there hadn’t been that many enemies. They had only been ten times the Dragonblood Legion. If it had been more, Long Chen wouldn’t have dared let them take this risk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The death of any one of his brothers would cause him great grief. But there was no way around this. They had to take advantage of this opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cultivation bases and numbers of their enemies had been perfectly at the limit of what the Dragonblood Legion could handle. If there had been more enemies, there would have been terrible casualties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their enemies had been just strong enough and the perfect number to give the Dragonblood Legion the best tempering. Too strong and they wouldn’t be able to handle them. Too few and there wouldn’t be any pressure or feeling of death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The most gratifying thing was that not a single person had died. Reality was just this cruel. Long Chen had no choice but to make everyone go through this danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, if they didn’t take this risk this time, the Dragonblood Legion’s power would be thrown behind. Next time when they had to face enemies, it would be even more dangerous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen’s own cultivation speed was too fast. If he continued like this, the Dragonblood warriors wouldn’t be able to keep up with him. They wouldn’t be able to fight shoulder to shoulder with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He understood each Dragonblood warrior. They were all hot-blooded warriors who would rather die on the battlefield than be abandoned, discarded, and thrown away. That was their own dignity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen also had never had any thoughts about abandoning them. So the only choice was for them to take on trials and dangers with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those who had been injured would be fully healed in just three days after consuming Long Chen’s personally refined healing pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen had everyone go rest. As for the mines? Fuck, if anyone could find the mines anymore, then they could go steal from them if they wanted to. Long Chen really had to admire himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire mining region had been destroyed. Who could find the entrance to the mines? Let alone the Xuantian Dao Sect’s mines, even two neighboring mines had been buried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it wasn’t so important. The black gold ore was almost depleted; thus, no one had any hope toward that elusive Phoenix Blood Black Gold. As for the miners, they only worked part-time nowadays. During the past few days, there hadn’t been any mining at all, so there was no one buried underground. And so, the mines could just be left buried. This way, they also didn’t need to worry about being attacked for the mines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The original buildings had been destroyed now, so everyone could only live in tents. Within a certain tent, Zhou Kun lay on the ground, his eyes closed and blood pouring out of his seven orifices. His face was an unhealthy yellow color, and his aura was incredibly weak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen, can you save the district chief? If this continues, he might die!” The elder who had once threatened Long Chen begged him for help now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This elder was bewildered. Zhou Kun’s cultivation base was the highest here, but then why was he the one to receive the heaviest injuries now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I could.” Long Chen rubbed his chin thoughtfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Really? Great! Hurry and heal him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The problem is, why should I save him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elder almost died from rage. “We’re all members of the same sect here! How can you just watch as someone dies?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How can I just watch as someone dies? I really have to admire you. Just how did you manage to make your skin so thick? When we were facing those Corrupt enemies, you all just hid in here like tortoises. Why didn’t you think of such sanctimony at that time?” snorted Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That was…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elder was speechless. At this time, Meng Qi suddenly sighed, “Long Chen, let it go. After all, we’re all members of the same sect. At this time, we should be united against outer enemies.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Right, right, this lady’s words are entirely correct. We should be united!” cried the elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen sneered and didn’t say anything. Meng Qi walked over and examined Zhou Kun. “The district chief’s cultivation base is high, but his Spiritual Strength is too weak. He definitely must have tried using his Spiritual Strength to examine the battle, and as a result, he didn’t retract his spiritual energy in time and received a backlash to his soul.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elder’s heart shook. Meng Qi was correct. The Zhou family didn’t have any talent when it came to Spiritual Strength. As for Zhou Kun, his Spiritual Strength was famed for being weak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t question her words at all. However, he couldn’t understand why Zhou Kun would use his Spiritual Strength that way. Perhaps only he knew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But then how can you save him?” asked the elder. After all, Zhou Kun was their leader. They had to rely on him for everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the elder was also a member of the Zhou family, he hadn’t been given knowledge about many things. Also, Zhou Kun hadn’t passed anything to him, so it was all too easy for him to mess up. That was why he was so anxious now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah, fine. I’ll sacrifice a portion of my Spiritual Strength to help heal his soul,” sighed Meng Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?! Who do you think he is? He’s not worthy of you sacrificing your Spiritual Strength. Have you gone stupid?!” Long Chen raged, his expression completely changing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen, you have to pay more attention to the big picture. Temporarily put down this enmity of yours,” said Meng Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen snorted with rage and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing this, Meng Qi said to the elder, “Help protect me. Don’t let anyone disturb me. I’ll heal the district chief’s injuries.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two hours later, Meng Qi left Zhou Kun’s tent. When she returned to the Dragonblood Legion’s area, Long Chen was already laughing, coming out of his tent. His previous anger had disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How was it? Did you get it?” he asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You really are a scoundrel. That act of yours was so real that I even thought you got angry,” said Meng Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, quick, get in. Tell me, what are they up to?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen pulled Meng Qi into his tent. Tang Wan-er was also present. After resting for a while, Tang Wan-er was no longer as pale as before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This Zhou Kun really did have a plot. Long Chen, you really were smart. You even thought of such a plan.” Meng Qi looked at Long Chen and sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, overpraise, overpraise!” Long Chen laughed mischievously. When it came to handling bad people, he always had many cons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Kun had truly been schemed against by Long Chen. When the shockwaves from Tang Wan-er and the Corrupt Celestial’s attacks had reached him, Long Chen had directly used his Spiritual Strength to force Zhou Kun into a slumber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Long Chen hadn’t expected Zhou Kun’s Spiritual Strength to be so weak. This move of his had almost dispersed his soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luckily, bad people always had the protection of the heavens. He hadn’t died. So Long Chen had come up with an act with Meng Qi, having Meng Qi go save him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, she was to save him. But at the same time, Meng Qi had used a secret technique to rifle through Zhou Kun’s memories.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was different from soulsearch. It required the target to not have the slightest bit of resistance at all and a comparatively long time to do. That was why Meng Qi had wasted two hours in order to obtain the information that she wanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, she had implanted some memories in him, memories that said that back then, he had used his Spiritual Strength to probe Tang Wan-er and the Corrupt Celestial’s battle. As a result, he had been heavily injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for why he would do something so stupid, that was his own problem. In any case, once he woke up, he would definitely remember that he had done that stupid thing, which had resulted in this. That was enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen, perhaps we’ve really fallen into a huge trap this time,” said Meng Qi worriedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s fine. I was aware of that. But to raise the Dragonblood Legion, we had no choice but to enter the trap. Otherwise, the Dragonblood Legion would require a long time to stabilize their foundations, and only then could they advance. But we don’t have enough time for that,” said Long Chen helplessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could he not know this was a trap? But he had no choice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Zhou family intentionally leaked the information that you’ve come to the chaos region to the Corrupt path. From Zhou Kun’s memories, I also learned that their attacks won’t stop here, nor will that Celestial today be the only one. In fact, the attack today was entirely not within their plans. They were supposed to gather multiple groups before giving us a thunderous strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Furthermore, behind this matter is also the Pill Tower. Although Zhou Kun isn’t aware of the whole plan, he has had interactions with the Zhou family’s experts, and they implied their intentions. The Zhou family originally had enmity with you. Now they can even get a favor from the Pill Tower’s Huo family, and they are using the blades of the Corrupt path. They don’t even have to get their own hands dirty to cut you down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then when the time comes, they’ll announce that the mine was sneak attacked, and all the ore in the mine was stolen. Then that ‘stolen’ black gold ore will enter the Zhou family’s pockets. It is truly a marvelous scheme,” sighed Meng Qi. She was extremely shocked by this plot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Long Chen’s expression was extremely calm. He wasn’t at all surprised by this kind of trap. He asked, “How much did Zhou Kun know?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He doesn’t have much information about the Corrupt path. All he knew was that they won’t just send one Celestial. They want to kill us in one, sudden strike. However, according to his expectations, the attack should have come between half a month to a month from now. As for these fellows today, they were a complete accident,” said Meng Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not just one? Half a month to a month from now? Hehe, not bad, not bad. They’re giving us a lot of valuable time.” Long Chen smiled. “Two days from now, I’ll bring all the members of the Dragonblood Legion away from here. As for Meng Qi, you focus on refining the Heavenly Dao Fruit, and Wan-er will protect you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re going to leave? Could it be…?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. You’ve also seen that the Dragonblood warriors have already steadied their auras after this battle. In truth, they’ve long since reached the peak of Meridian Opening. I had them suppress their cultivation bases, not letting them advance, but now I’m prepared to give them the Heaven Advancing Pills. They’ll be able to advance perfectly to the Xiantian realm. In other words, once we return… hehe, we’ll give those Corrupt experts a nice surprise.” Long Chen laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meng Qi and Tang Wan-er looked at each other. If all the Dragonblood Legion advanced to the Xiantian realm, then they would be a pack of wolves and tigers. Who could possibly defeat them?</span></p>
