But that wind blade wasn’t aiming at him. It ended up striking the ground in front of him, filling the air with dust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Luo’s heart shook. There was an ambush waiting for him? Behind him, Long Chen was quickly catching up. Yin Luo could only force his way through from the front.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Piercing through from the front would at least give him some chance of surviving. But if he decided to turn back and face Long Chen in his condition, his only possible fate would be to die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He quickly rushed forward. He recognized that attack as the one Long Chen’s Magical Beast had used before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although that Magical Beast’s attack power was terrifying, if he was prepared, it was unable to threaten to him. He had only just taken a couple of steps when the blazing flame swallowed him, and a terrifying heat immediately scorched the land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This entire time, Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and Lu Fang-er had been guarding the exit. From Long Chen’s shout, they saw Yin Luo really had been defeated by Long Chen and had begun to flee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They immediately acted according to the plan and Little Snow had attacked. However, Long Chen didn’t want Little Snow’ attack to directly hit Yin Luo, but to block his line of sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Snow’s attack had filled the air with dust. Following him, Lu Fang-er’s recently gained Scarlet Blaze Lion sent out the true attack, letting out a ball of flames that suddenly attacked Yin Luo out of nowhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Scarlet Blaze Lion’s flame was incredibly powerful. An ordinary Chosen would be unable to block it. Most frightening of all, the area of its attack was huge, so it was almost impossible to dodge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Endless Sinking Wood!” Suddenly, a clear shout rang out. Yin Luo was horrified to see the ground beneath his feet sink, and he was quickly subsiding. He hastily used his qi to protect his body, and he jumped out of this trap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he had only just flown out when countless wooden stakes instantly bound him tightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Luo’s heart turned cold. He struggled, but he found these golden wooden stakes were harder than steel, and he wasn’t able to break them like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“BREAK!” Yin Luo roared furiously, and he once more activated his Xiantian power. With natural energy backing his attack, these wooden stakes were instantly disintegrated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After escaping the wooden bindings, YIn Luo had just been about to continue fleeing when he saw even more wooden stakes. Those all-encompassing wooden stakes surged over to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fuck off!” Yin Luo brandished his spear, and he activated his Xiantian power again. Those wooden stakes were all broken. In front of natural energy, all other attacks appeared much weaker.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After destroying hundreds of wooden stakes, Yin Luo realized that two wooden stakes had stealthily wrapped around his feet. By the time he could let out another attack to destroy them, Long Chen would have already reached him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Luo was completely furious and shocked. He hadn’t even been able to get a look at who exactly was attacking him. He hastily took out a precious teleportation talisman. At this point, he had no choice but to use it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Soul Absorption Art.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following a cold shout, Yin Luo suddenly felt an intense pain in his soul, and he was horrified to find that his left hand refused to listen to his orders, and he was unable to activate the teleportation talisman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, Long Chen arrived, and his saber slashed down. The arm holding the teleportation talisman left the rest of Yin Luo’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The pain of losing an arm made Yin Luo crazy. His spear smashed at Long Chen with all his power, and Long Chen hastily blocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BOOM!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This attack had been backed by his Xiantian power. He had sent Long Chen flying, as well as broken the wooden stakes coiling around his feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bastards, all of you can die!” Yin Luo roared furiously. A spear-image hundreds of meters long extended from his spear, smashing down on Meng Qi and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two howls rang out at the same time, and a wind blade and a flame sphere collided into that spear-image. But that spear-image only shook ever so slightly before smashing apart those attacks and continuing down on them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Yin Luo was unable to see Meng Qi and the others, he could use his sharp intuition to sense their location. Thus, he had let out a full power attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Storm Slash!” Meng Qi and the others had just been about to block when a saber-image smashed into Yin Luo’s spear-image. Both images exploded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A terrifying astral wind shot out, and the three women were blown back. Even Little Snow and the Scarlet Blaze Lion were sent miserably tumbling back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the three women stabilized their positions, they couldn’t help being horrified. How could this Yin Luo be so terrifying? His aura was clearly much weaker than when he had first started this fight, but his attacks were still terrifying to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Long Chen hadn’t blocked it in the end, then Chu Yao’s wooden shield would definitely have been unable to block it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After shattering Yin Luo’s spear-image, Long Chen also reached the point where he was gasping for breath, and he had clearly overdrafted his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he also knew that this was the crucial moment. He took a deep breath and once more charged forward at Yin Luo like some berserk cheetah.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having lost an arm, Yin Luo had to do everything he could to block Long Chen’s tempest of attacks. However, he was still repeatedly forced back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he fell back, the ground was constantly crumbling. Although the two of them had already reached the point of exhaustion, each one of their attacks were still incredibly powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go help Long Chen,” said Meng Qi. Seeing Long Chen risking his life to fight, she was just about to rush out to help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t sister. If you go out, it’ll make Long Chen mad.” Chu Yao held Meng Qi back. Neither Meng Qi nor Lu Fang-er understood, so Chu Yao continued, “Long Chen’s extremely stubborn. He wouldn’t want anyone to change his plans. Have you forgotten? He’s already said that we’re only in charge of blocking Yin Luo once. After that, we have to distance ourselves from the battle. No matter what the result is, we’re not to interfere.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the beginning, Long Chen had already estimated Yin Luo’s strength. To kill Yin Luo would be as difficult as ascending to the heavens. It would be a bitter clash of power that didn’t rely on technique or skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even if he could force Yin Luo into a disadvantage, killing him would still be incomparably difficult. That was true even if he could force Yin Luo to the brink of despair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With how powerful Yin Luo was, it was unknown how many people he would be able to bring with him in his death. Other than Long Chen, no one else here would be able to block Yin Luo’s final deathblow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was why when Long Chen had come up with the plan, he had harshly warned them that they were only in charge of one block to slow him down. No matter what the result was, they were to then hide in the distance and not interfere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This fellow is far too overbearing,” sighed Meng Qi. But there wasn’t the slightest reproach in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them knew they were all soul cultivators who weren’t suited to close-range combat. That was true even for Chu Yao, who used her soul energy to control her wooden stakes. Long Chen was only doing this in consideration of their safety.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Look, Yin Luo’s started to run again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They noticed that after fighting for a bit, Yin Luo had finally recovered his senses and no longer faced Long Chen directly. He was already running, and Long Chen was chasing.</span></p>

Wait, we should collect the arm first. That’s Long Chen’s spoils of battle.” Lu Fang-er ran over to the arm Long Chen had severed.</span></p>

The two of them pierced through the dense forest. A desert area appeared in front of them, and with their speed, the sky was filled with sand, looking like a dust dragon. They travelled dozens of miles in an instant.</span></p>

But due to being hidden in the dust, it was difficult to notice him.</span></p>

If you leave me another leg this time, I swear I won’t kill you!” Having to chase behind Yin Luo, Long Chen was constantly getting dust blown in his face, infuriating him. He was unable to catch up to him no matter what, so he now shouted out a loud taunt.</span></p>
