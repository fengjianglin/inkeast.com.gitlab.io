 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were now at the lake, and the tents had been set up again. The Muxue Mercenary Unit’s members were all laughing cheerfully, drinking as much wine as they could in celebration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This battle had truly been fought too beautifully by them. Not one of them had died. In fact, only a few of them had even been injured before they managed to cut down the Hidden Ground Spider.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The most exciting thing was that their leader had truly broken through to the Xiantian realm. That made their unit’s strength increase to unprecedented levels.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps that was what it meant for happy things to occur in pairs. They no longer had any reservations and went all-out drinking and eating. Even Mu Xue drank over ten cups of wine, her face becoming slightly rosy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen was also celebrating with them. There were over twenty cups that challenged Long Chen in succession. Anytime someone touched their cup to his, he would down all his alcohol without the slightest hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, over two hundred cups had gone down his belly. Even with his tolerance, he was starting to feel a bit woozy, as he hadn’t used any spiritual qi to suppress it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He actually very much enjoyed this kind of feeling. They were all hot-blooded men, saying anything they wanted to say, their emotions painted on their faces. They lived very sincerely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From them, Long Chen learned they had come from powerful families or some other powers. After having been squeezed out by others, they had ended up leaving in fury to become wandering martial artists.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their talent was actually very high, but they had given up any hope in the powers they came from. They would rather be wandering martial artists than stay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They no longer treated strength as the most important thing. Their number one priority was their freedom, their emotions. It could be said that they were extremely unconventional cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although they had to work for their cultivation resources by completing missions, making their lives dangerous, it was also extremely thrilling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They all lived this kind of life. Perhaps in other people’s eyes, they were just a bunch of minor characters that would never have any success, but they still liked being themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen, you still haven’t explained why you pinched me today!” Their tongues had already grown loose now, and one of the mercenaries patted Long Chen on the shoulder while drinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That person was the one who Long Chen had pinched earlier today in order to make him wail. Afterward, they had been too busy and there had been no time to get his question answered. However, he hadn’t forgotten it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that he said it, everyone turned to Long Chen, wanting to know what had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen hiccuped, laughing and patting him on the shoulder. “Brother, are you dissatisfied? In truth, you should be very happy! Originally, I was planning on crushing your balls!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That person shivered, and he half came out of his drunken state. “Fuck, when did I piss you off this much?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is called sacrifice! If it weren’t for your shriek, do you think the leader would have become so furious and berserk, completely breaking through any restrictions?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If it weren’t for you, how could she have caught the chance to advance? And without advancing, how would we have stopped the Hidden Ground Spider from escaping?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Without killing the Hidden Ground Spider, what would we be celebrating here? In truth, you’re the one who contributed the most towards killing the Hidden Ground Spider. Here, let me raise a cup for you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen’s words made him very muddleheaded. He made it sound like their victory had relied entirely on him. Now seeing Long Chen drink, he also drank down his cup.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He might be too drunk to understand, but the others also heard it, and now they finally understood that everything had been within his control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Xue was the most surprised. It really was as Long Chen said. If she hadn’t advanced to the Xiantian realm, not only would many people have died, but they also wouldn’t have succeeded in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This meant Long Chen had already thought of this plan before they even began attacking the Hidden Ground Spider.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Xue couldn’t help feeling blessed. Long Chen was like her lucky star. If it hadn’t been for him, she really didn’t know what she would be doing right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen, let me offer you a cup!” Mu Xue raised her glass to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, for the beautiful leader to offer me a cup of wine, I really am honored!” Long Chen hastily raised his cup.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you.” Mu Xue looked sincerely at Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, you’re being too courteous. If you hadn’t helped me out, I would still be lost.” Long Chen touched his cup to Mu Xue’s cup and then downed the alcohol. “Come, you two beauties, let me also offer you a cup!” Long Chen raised his cup towards the other two women.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah, I don’t really have much capacity for alcohol. If I end up drunk, you’ll have to protect me.” That woman, who had once helped clean him up, spoke bashfully, but the passion in her eyes was extremely brazen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen laughed. “Don’t worry, with this many brothers protecting you, even if the heavens were to collapse, there would be someone to prop them up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An undetectable trace of disappointment flashed within Mu Xue’s eyes. Long Chen was intentionally keeping his distance from the woman, acting as if he didn’t understand her flirtation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Xue quietly retreated to her own spot. She watched as Long Chen drank with the others, playing a finger-guessing game and even occasionally spouting profanities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She quietly stared at this man. She felt this man to be very different from others, and yet his appearance wasn’t so out of the ordinary. It was food for thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This night, everyone drank a great deal, and even Long Chen was snoring afterward. It had been a long time since he had had such a good time drinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When morning came, everyone got up refreshed. After all, they were cultivators, and this amount of wine was unable to affect their powerful constitutions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After putting things away, they were preparing to head back to the city when Zhang Wu suddenly said, “Long Chen, do you think we can cut down the other brute?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This suggestion was very enticing to Long Chen. He had noticed the small trees in his primal chaos space had grown a great deal overnight. They had already reached a height of over one hundred and fifty meters. They were already able to provide a significant amount of life energy to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although each one could only give him a small amount, there were over a hundred of them. Each day, he could draw out life energy for himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he gained another Xiantian Magical Beast’s corpse, then that would be even more perfect, allowing the trees to grow even more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he didn’t want them to face danger for his own benefit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen, do you want to try it?” asked Mu Xue eagerly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, a Xiantian Magical Beast’s core was an expensive commodity. Whether it was used for refining pills or forging items, they were rare treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As mercenaries, when there weren’t any good missions available, they would go out killing Magical Beasts to exchange for cultivation resources.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What kind of Magical Beast is it?” asked Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s an Ironwing Horned Eagle. When we noticed it last year, it was at the early Xiantian realm,” said Mu Xue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, Mu Xue didn’t say anything definitively. After all, from their experience with the Hidden Ground Spider, she knew she couldn’t be sure whether a Magical Beast would have already advanced or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although it was said that Magical Beasts could spend decades or even centuries without advancing once, people still had to be prepared for bad luck. There was no way for her to be sure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s something even harder to deal with than the Hidden Ground Spider.” Long Chen frowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Hidden Ground Spider was a dark attribute Magical Beast, so it wasn’t specialized in attacking. It was a specialist in running. When it hunted, it would stay underground and lay a trap. It rarely fought head-on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the Ironwing Horned Eagle was different. It was a flying Magical Beast, and its build was much larger than the Hidden Ground Spider. Furthermore, it was extremely fast. If they weren’t able to defeat it, then they wouldn’t even have a chance to flee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Long Chen was still in the process of forming his new meridians. He had already strengthened them over thirty times, but there was still no sign of them reaching their limit. He could only continue with this process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But then thinking of its immense body, Long Chen was very enticed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How about I go by myself to try it?” asked Mu Xue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen understood her idea. She would fight it on her own, and even if she couldn’t beat it, it wouldn’t be able to kill her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll accompany you.” In the end, Long Chen decided to go with Mu Xue to take a look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although his cultivation base was the lowest here, they all respected him a great deal. They didn’t have any objections.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After traveling for half a day, a sharp cliff appeared before them. What Long Chen hadn’t expected was that the Ironwing Horned Eagle was different from ordinary flying Magical Beasts. It didn’t have a nest. Instead, it had excavated a cave in the cliffside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just looking at the huge cave, he could tell that the Ironwing Horned Eagle had to be shockingly huge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The rest of you should wait here. You absolutely can’t come over.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen had the others wait at a certain mountain. They would be able to see the cave from a distance, but it would be difficult for the Ironwing Horned Eagle to notice them from there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen and Mu Xue arrived in front of its cave. They didn’t sense any danger, surprising Long Chen. He sent his Spiritual Strength in to investigate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Ironwing Horned Eagle isn’t here. It probably went hunting,” he said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then what should we do?” asked Mu Xue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is a good thing, we’ll take advantage of this opportunity to set up a trap. That’ll save us effort.” Long Chen smiled mischievously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Setting up traps was something Long Chen delighted in. Setting up a trap in its own nest was especially delightful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the sky darkened, and a large figure appeared above the two of them. A powerful pressure spread.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, looks like there’s no need to set up anything. The master has returned.” Long Chen spread his arms and dashed to the side, leaving the battle to Mu Xue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, it still wasn’t suitable for him to fight. If it left a mark on his meridians, that would be something impossible for him to erase in his lifetime. He didn’t dare take that risk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BANG!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The immense figure crashed onto the ground. What startled Mu Xue and Long Chen was that it was a flying Magical Beast that was only at the fifth rank. It was three hundred meters long and was now unconscious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed to be the prey the Ironwing Horned Eagle had obtained. It had been preparing to enjoy it once it returned to its nest, but seeing people had invaded its territory, it directly dropped its prey and charged at Mu Xue.</span></p>
