<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>“Two hundred million!”</p>
 <p>A Blood Condensation expert was the first to shout out a bid. He hadn’t gained anything today as a result of the bidding being so fierce.</p>
 <p>Due to the prices steadily climbing, the final prices had already exceeded their market value. Thus, he hadn’t spent anything, which was currently his greatest advantage now.</p>
 <p>“Three hundred million!”</p>
 <p>An aged voice came from a white-haired old man in the corner.</p>
 <p>That old man had never made a bid the whole time. But as soon as he spoke, everyone immediately recognized him.</p>
 <p>“Isn’t that the Tuoji Empire’s grandmaster alchemist, Wang Luyang?”</p>
 <p>Although the Tuoji Empire wasn’t as large as the Phoenix Cry Empire and didn’t have an alchemist guild, it had its own alchemy hall.</p>
 <p>If a nation didn’t have the support of medicinal pills or martial weapons, it would eventually be destroyed. And martial weapons came second; after all, iron was never in short supply. However, medicinal pills definitely could not be lacking.</p>
 <p>That alchemist Wang Luyang was essentially the master of the Tuoji Empire. His status was even greater than their emperor.</p>
 <p>There was no way around that. Without the support of an alchemist, the Tuoji Empire would sooner or later be swallowed by one of the large neighbors.</p>
 <p>That was why as soon as Wang Luyang bid, it immediately scared off many people. That was because he was equivalent to an emperor. His financial resources were incredible.</p>
 <p>The reason he had never bid before was because he hadn’t seen anything that interested him. A person like him wouldn’t easily take action; but once he did, it would be a sure win.</p>
 <p>An ordinary second tier middle grade medicinal pill normally sold for three to four hundred thousand. But now the price had multiplied by a thousand, meaning that only a few could participate.</p>
 <p>Such a treasure was one that could only be found by luck. If someone lost an arm during a battle, then their combat ability would definitely sharply drop and they would eventually be killed.</p>
 <p>But the Flesh Bone Restoration Pill was equivalent to a life-saving treasure. Xia Changfeng and Xia Baichi were incredibly regretful that they hadn’t prepared more money and could only watch as this treasure was purchased by someone else.</p>
 <p>“Four hundred million!”</p>
 <p>Marquis Ying’s distinctive voice rang out. No one had expected that he would also participate.</p>
 <p>“Five hundred million!”</p>
 <p>Wang Luyang didn’t hesitate at all and immediately bid higher. That was his confidence. Although Marquis Ying was a noble, his financial resources were not as profound as Wang Luyang who controlled an empire.</p>
 <p>The entire crowd was stunned to find that an insignificant middle grade second tier medicinal pill was actually being sold at the same price as an Earth class Battle Skill.</p>
 <p>Even Long Chen felt his heart jumping wildly. It appeared this world had lost many pill formulas. Those ancient pill formulas in his Pill God memories were equivalent to an endless treasure trove.</p>
 <p>But he also felt a bit of worry. Just a Flesh Bone Restoration Pill could cause this much of an uproar.</p>
 <p>If others were to learn that this medicinal pill had come from him, that would definitely be dangerous. Perhaps he had been too reckless this time.</p>
 <p>But since it was already like this, regret was useless. Now he could only hope that the Huayun Pavilion’s reputation would protect this secret.</p>
 <p>The entire crowd had turned silent after Wang Luyang’s bid of five hundred million. Even Marquis Ying had become silent. Five hundred million was a price even he couldn’t bear to waste.</p>
 <p>Now that the auction had reached this point, there was no need for Yao Niqian to fan the flames of people’s passions. That would only cause people to feel disgusted.</p>
 <p>Seeing that no one else was bidding, Yao Niqian started to count down. In the end, Wang Luyang’s high bid won the middle grade second tier Flesh Bone Restoration Pill.</p>
 <p>“Everyone, don’t be in a hurry to leave. The show has yet to end.”</p>
 <p>Seeing that everyone was already preparing to get up, Yao Niqian smiled and received a jade case from another maid.</p>
 <p>Everyone’s expressions became a bit strange. The auction this year truly was full of interesting surprises. What was this next treasure that was even more precious than that pill?</p>
 <p>Opening the jade case, Yao Niqian revealed a medicinal pill that stunned everyone.</p>
 <p>That was clearly the exact same pill as the Flesh Bone Restoration Pill from before! Didn’t they say that it was one of a kind? Were they purposely playing with them?</p>
 <p>When Wang Luyang saw that pill, he immediately stood up. Everyone was expecting him to fly into a rage.</p>
 <p>But what no one expected was that he only foolishly looked at it for a moment before laughing. “Haha, good, this time I didn’t come for nothing.”</p>
 <p>Yao Niqian smiled and admiringly said, “Truly worthy of being an alchemist grandmaster. You can tell from that far away. Yes, this is also a Flesh Bone Restoration Pill. However, this one is not middle grade. Instead, it is high grade!”</p>
 <p>“What?!”</p>
 <p>“Yes, this is a high grade ancient pill. The middle grade pill was only useful in the Blood Condensation realm and below. But this precious high grade pill is effective even for Tendon Transformation experts,” Yao Niqian explained solemnly.</p>
 <p>A storm erupted in the crowd. Tendon Transformation experts? That was the peak of the Phoenix Cry Empire!</p>
 <p>“High grade Flesh Bone Restoration Pill. Starting bid: two hundred million.”</p>
 <p>“Four hundred million!”</p>
 <p>The first person to shout was actually Wang Luyang. Moreover, he immediately raised the bidding price, clearly not wishing to take it slowly and displaying that his determination to obtain it.</p>
 <p>Everyone sighed at how rich alchemists were.</p>
 <p>“Five hundred million!”</p>
 <p>Marquis Ying bid shortly after Wang Luyang. Everyone anticipated seeing the competition between the two of them.</p>
 <p>“Brother Chu Yang, do you think Marquis Ying can beat Wang Luyang?” asked Xia Changfeng.</p>
 <p>“This time, the medicinal pill is a must-have for Marquis Ying. Even if he has to spend his entire fortune, he would still bid,” sighed the crown prince.</p>
 <p>“Why’s that?” Xia Changfeng was a bit puzzled. It didn’t seem that just a medicinal pill could be so coveted.</p>
 <p>“Brother Xia must not know about this. A dozen years ago, Marquis Ying fought with an opponent, and in an effort to defeat him, he ended up losing a finger. Back then, he refused to seek treatment due to his pride. He wanted to use that event to motivate him to cultivate harder.</p>
 <p>“So from that point onwards, he started to train crazily, eventually breaking through and entering the Tendon Transformation realm. But after entering the Tendon Transformation realm, he realized that training in the Tendon Transformation realm required you to temper your tendons to connect them to your marrow. Having lost a finger, he was missing a tendon. Thus, it had an enormous impact on his cultivation.</p>
 <p>“But due to how long his finger had been severed, there was no way to fix it. He has spent several years roaming throughout empires without finding a way to heal it.</p>
 <p>“The reason he let Wang Luyang win last time was because that was just been a middle grade Flesh Bone Restoration Pill. It was only useful to Blood Condensation cultivators. If he had used it, the chances of it helping him recover were extremely remote. Spending five hundred million on just a small chance really was a bit too much, thus he let it go.</p>
 <p>“But now this high grade Flesh Bone Restoration Pill is practically godsend. So I can practically guarantee that he will obtain it. If that Wang Luyang refuses to give way, hehe….” Chu Yang coldly laughed and didn’t continue.</p>
 <p>But it was extremely obvious that if Wang Luyang refused to be tactful, it would be exceedingly difficult for him to be able to leave the Phoenix Cry Empire.</p>
 <p>Even if he was the ruler of an empire, that empire wasn’t comparable to the Phoenix Cry Empire. Marquis Ying wouldn’t mind killing someone for his treasures.</p>
 <p>Xia Changfeng and Xia Baichi nodded. Alchemists were all exceedingly arrogant. Perhaps the competition between the two of them would extend past this auction.</p>
 <p>Wang Luyang’s expression changed when he saw Marquis Ying bid against him so fiercely. He knew that Marquis Ying probably viewed this pill as a must-have. But getting him to give up instead was impossible.</p>
 <p>With a high grade Flesh Bone Restoration Pill, his chances of figuring out the corresponding pill formula would skyrocket. And once he figured out the pill formula, his name would shake the heavens.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, alchemists did not lack money. Of course, that was excluding beginners who failed their refinements so much that they often bankrupted themselves.</p>
 <p>Just as Wang Luyang was about to bid again, Marquis Ying’s soft voice rang out, “Grandmaster Wang, this medicinal pill is of exceedingly great importance to me. Please yield to me. I can even give grandmaster several days to study it after I obtain it. Harming the relationship of our two empires for just a small medicinal pill really isn’t wise.”</p>
 <p>This truly dazed the crowd. Marquis Ying was using both the carrot and the stick to force Wang Luyang to give up. It seemed this medicinal pill truly was exceptionally important to him.</p>
 <p>Yao Niqian’s expression became a bit ugly though. This move was clearly disrupting the auction, but both Marquis Ying and Wang Luyang had high statuses and were their customers.</p>
 <p>If she were to reprimand these two, not only would it not change anything, but the chances of them continuing to compete were no longer great.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, punishing the two of them would definitely have a negative effect on the Huayun Pavilion’s reputation. Yao Niqian began to hate that feminine voice of Marquis Ying’s.</p>
 <p>“Marquis Ying must be joking. This old man wants to compete, but unfortunately, I have no more money.” Wang Luyang laughed lightly.</p>
 <p>The conclusion was a boring disappointment. Just what kind of person was Wang Luyang? No more money? This was clearly his way of giving the face to Marquis Ying and getting out of an awkward situation.</p>
 <p>Although Yao Niqian was extremely angered, her face still maintained that perfect smile of hers. Now that the auction was nearing its end, she didn’t want to cause a huge fuss.</p>
 <p>“Master Marquis Ying bids five hundred million. Are there any higher bids?”</p>
 <p>“Five hundred million going once.”</p>
 <p>“Five hundred million going twice.”</p>
 <p>“Five hundred million going-“</p>
 <p>Marquis Ying had already relaxed inside his private room. Hearing the helplessness in Yao Niqian’s voice, he coldly smiled. Indulging in this kind of feeling was his favorite.</p>
 <p>But a lazy voice caused his expression to immediately change. Even the tea in his hand spilled out.</p>
 <p>“Six hundred million.”</p>
