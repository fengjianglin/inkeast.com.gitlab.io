 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A bang came from the bottom of the river. Within the muddy river, blood splashed and then rapidly dissipated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Killing a seventh rank Magical Beast from inside its body was extremely easy. That was especially true since most water Magical Beasts were weak to thunderforce. So Long Chen easily killed it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was surprising that even Meng Qi didn’t recognize it. It was strikingly similar to a catfish with four limbs. But Beast Tamers didn’t usually take fish housepets. Other than using them as rations, what were they useful for?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After killing it, Long Chen and Meng Qi didn’t immediately leap out of the water. They stealthily spread their Spiritual Strength to probe the situation. Finding that there was nothing strange, they crept ashore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, since Long Chen had the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art’s intuition, he didn’t really need to do this. But he was still afraid. He didn’t dare to be the slightest bit careless anymore. Whatever those unknown existences were, they were far from what he could currently handle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, he couldn’t help finding it odd. How was it that the forest divinity had been so kind and easy to get along with, but now they encountered berserk killers wherever they went? Each living thing here wanted their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen even suspected that this wasn’t the Spirit World. It was on a completely different extreme from the peaceful and tranquil world he had seen before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once they stealthily went ashore, they began to race back along the path they had come in. With the spiritual marks they had placed on the way, they didn’t get lost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After traveling further and finding that nothing was off, Meng Qi summoned the Blood Phoenix and they continued back to their original location.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they finally saw the spot that Long Chen had destroyed with his flames, they finally relaxed. They could finally return home. This Spirit World was too stifling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">According to the hourglass, they still had three days before it was a month.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Meng Qi, let’s take a bath together,” said Long Chen suddenly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tch, don’t be so indecent.” Meng Qi blushed. She hadn’t expected Long Chen to make such a rude request.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, as my future wife, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about. Furthermore, we have to completely cleanse our bodies. At the same time, we’ll have to destroy our clothes,” said Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Because this place is the Spirit World. The species here are completely different from our world. There are definitely all sorts of pollen and even invisible larvae stuck on our bodies. If we return like this, those species might end up destroying our whole world!” said Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? It couldn’t be that terrifying,” said Meng Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Meng Qi, you’re a Beast Tamer. You’ve only studied Magical Beasts and not vegetation. I really am not trying to frighten you. If the vegetation here is brought back to our world, then on the off chance that it can manage to survive in that soil, it will begin to rapidly multiply because it has no natural predators. It could break down the entire ecosystem of our world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haven’t you heard about ‘wild desolate land’? That was something that was sealed into a minor world by experts during ancient times. The ecosystem there was so badly damaged by foreign species that those almighty experts were helpless to do anything other than to seal that land away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Each world has its own survival rules. But creatures of different worlds aren’t within those rules. It’s like a killer was suddenly thrown into a group of peaceful people who don’t know how to fight. The results are obvious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So we have to completely cleanse our bodies. I will make a flame barrier to create a space for us.” Long Chen smiled naughtily. He took out a large wood bathing cask. It had already been filled with water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen began to disrobe. Meng Qi hastily turned away. Although her heart had already become completely devoted to Long Chen, her face was still as red as an apple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, she let out a startled cry as Long Chen grasped her waist. They jumped into the bath, and Long Chen began to take off Meng Qi’s clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t!” Meng Qi let out a sharp cry and tightly held onto her clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen smiled mischievously at the panicked Meng Qi. Meng Qi had always been the warm and calm kind of girl. She gave off a different kind of beauty now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I… I’ll do it myself.” Meng Qi blushed bashfully, not daring to look at Long Chen as she slowly removed her clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How about I help you? Don’t worry, I won’t force you. You’re my woman, and in this world, no one can make you do anything you don’t want to do, myself included,” said Long Chen softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen knew that Meng Qi was shy, but another reason was that she was afraid Long Chen would take advantage of her. Then she would become someone who broke her promises, and she naturally wouldn’t want something like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen…” Meng Qi trembled slightly. She looked at him with warm and tender eyes. A burst of warmth filled her heart, and she wrapped her arms around Long Chen’s neck and gave him a kiss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen didn’t have the slightest wicked thought right now. Meng Qi was like a fairy that couldn’t be blasphemed. She was like a flawless jade, so perfect that a person couldn’t bear to touch her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He lost himself in the feeling of her lips, in that connection between them. After an unknown amount of time, Meng Qi suddenly escaped from their embrace with a startled cry, her face even redder than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cough, sorry, it was just excitement. However, if I didn’t get excited while holding such a beautiful woman in my hands, I definitely wouldn’t be a man,” laughed Long Chen. He awkwardly shifted, as pointing at someone was rude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Meng Qi, let me tell you a story.” Long Chen began to tell a story to relieve the awkwardness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Meng Qi, she hadn’t recovered from that unique feeling and still couldn’t look at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There was a man who was bathing in a bathtub. Nothing strange happened, but suddenly, the water level began to rapidly rise. Do you know why?” asked Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, it was because he suddenly saw his beloved woman.” Long Chen suddenly began to laugh mischievously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At first, Meng Qi didn’t comprehend. But following Long Chen’s mischievous laughter, along with what had just happened, she immediately rebuked, “You scoundrel!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She slammed the water, and a pillar of water shot at Long Chen. Long Chen was laughing, and as a result, the water surged into his nose and mouth, making him appear incredibly miserable while Meng Qi laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come, let me clean up my wife.” Seeing that Meng Qi was no longer so nervous, Long Chen held her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, Meng Qi didn’t refuse him. She allowed him to take off the rest of her clothes, completely revealing her flesh to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meng Qi’s body involuntarily trembled as Long Chen’s hands touched her skin. Her eyes were half-closed, and some faint sweat began to collect on her nose. Her gaze was blurred, bashful, and extremely moving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the final piece was taken off, Long Chen couldn’t help being filled with praise. The heavens really did possess supernatural sculpting abilities to make such a beautiful woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Meng Qi, you really are beautiful,” praised Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His praise caused her to become a bit more clear-headed. Shaking off what had happened, she caressed Long Chen’s cheek and asked, “Long Chen, back when we first met in Phoenix Cry, did you intentionally put on an act because you wanted to obtain me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen nodded. “Yes, I did it on purpose. I deliberately made you feel guilty and feel pity for me. I used your kindness to seduce you.” He didn’t hesitate or try to cover up the truth at all. Caressing Meng Qi’s face, he looked into her eyes and said, “Because I know that in this world, no one else can love you more than I do. No one else can devote their heart and soul to protect you like I do. Through the countless battles I fought, whenever I faced death, I always told myself that I couldn’t die. Because if I died, then no one else in this would be able to love you the way I do.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen…” Meng Qi wrapped her arms around Long Chen and tightly embraced him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen took a deep breath and did his best to suppress his hot blood. He felt like something hot was flowing through his nose and about to burst. He hastily suppressed it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He now slightly regretted this. He shouldn’t have chosen to bathe together with Meng Qi, because she was truly too attractive. At the same time, he had also overestimated his self-control. Wasn’t he an idiot? Why had he decided to torture himself?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally, he had just been planning on helping Meng Qi clean herself off. Now he found that all his energy had to be focused on suppressing his own desires. It was Meng Qi who had to help him clean his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a bitter trial, they finally finished bathing.
