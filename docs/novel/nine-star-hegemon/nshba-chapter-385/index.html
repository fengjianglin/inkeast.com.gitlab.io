 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Qi’s expression changed. She recognized that marking, and she was shocked by this person’s background.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brat, if you’re smart, you’ll hand over that Violet Phoenix Sparrow. I can spare your life.” Huo Wufang icily glared at Long Chen with his hands clasped behind his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Long Chen, he comes from the Pill Tower. We can’t afford to offend him.” Meng Qi lightly pulled on Long Chen’s sleeve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen was confused. Pill Tower? Why did it sound so familiar?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You might not know about the Pill Tower, but you should know about the holy land for pill cultivators, Pill Valley, right? The Pill Tower is the direct branch of Pill Valley and is essentially their spokesperson. That makes the Pill Tower incredibly powerful. Anywhere there are cultivators, there are alchemist guilds, while the Pill Tower is the headquarters of all those alchemist guilds,” explained Meng Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen couldn’t help being startled. He hadn’t expected this person’s background to be so powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pill Valley was a holy land for pill cultivators, but it was isolated from the mundane world. So the Pill Tower had ended up with the entire authority of the world’s pill path. In other words, all those high tier medicinal pills of the Xuantian Supermonastery were bought from the Pill Tower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Pill Tower had essentially monopolized the entire medicinal pill market. If anyone dared offend them, then that really would be digging their own grave. Without the support of medicinal pills, then no matter how large the sect was, they would definitely decline.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was also why those two top experts had decided to withdraw from the fight without even using their full strength. They were worried about Huo Wufang’s background.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Pill Tower was a neutral party, not a member of the Righteous or Corrupt path. Anyone could do business with it, and so neither Righteous nor Corrupt experts would want to offend them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Long Chen, it’s no good. You should hand over the Violet Phoenix Sparrow to him. We can think of some other way to get you a beast flame,” advised Meng Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Pill Tower was truly just too terrifying. It was the spokesperson of Pill Valley, and almost the entire pill refining world was under their control. No one would dare provoke them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen had never imagined this bastard’s background would be so powerful. If he ended up completely offending him, then perhaps even the entire supermonastery would be unable to protect him from his retaliation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Forcibly swallowing his resentment, Long Chen said, “I was the one who noticed this Violet Phoenix Sparrow, and the Barbaric Wind Beast was also drawn over by me-”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shut up with your nonsense. Are you handing it over or not?” Huo Wufang waved his hand, cutting off Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen’s anger immediately flared, but he once more suppressed his temper. “I can split half the Violet Phoenix Sparrow’s Neidan with you. That’ll be enough for you to gather its beast flame. I also need its beast flame.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s nothing to discuss. Either hand over the Violet Phoenix Sparrow, or die. Your choice.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…!” Even Chu Yao was unable to endure it anymore, and her fury soared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen held her back. He now knew what kind of person Huo Wufang was, and he also knew what he was planning on doing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He smiled slightly. But that smile was slightly icy. For some reason, seeing Long Chen suddenly smile, the three women immediately felt their hair stand on end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fine, since you want it, then here, please receive it.” Long Chen suddenly disappeared from his original location.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At first, Huo Wufang had thought that Long Chen had finally become afraid of his background and was admitting defeat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he had just been about to sneer at him when his vision darkened. A hand came from an extremely tricky angle and swung in a profound arc to land on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An extremely crisp sound rang out. That slap sent Huo Wufang flying through the air. His teeth also flew through the air beside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That sound, that feeling, and that refreshness made Long Chen feel as if all his pores had been freshly opened and were singing emotionally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Long Chen…” The three women were all covering their mouths, filled with shock and horror. Had Long Chen gone mad?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t just them that were shocked. All the experts from both the Righteous and Corrupt path were stupefied. He had learned Huo Wufang’s status, and yet he had still dared to attack him? Furthermore, it was such a humiliating attack. He had to have gone insane, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who do you think you are? Do you think if you don your turtle shell status as a disciple of the Pill Tower, then no one will dare cut off your turtle head? Today I’ll let you open your damn eyes: not everyone is afraid of your Pill Tower! You want to use your background to suppress me? Your dog eyes must be blind!” cursed Long Chen furiously. This was his first time lowering his head to someone and taking a step back. But even after he had done so, this was the result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That made Long Chen understand a principle: there were some people that you absolutely could not indulge. If you gave them an inch, they would take a mile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You dare strike me?!” Huo Wufang let out a furious roar. He had been sent flying by Long Chen’s slap without even realizing what had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But that also couldn’t be blamed on him. The number of people that had fallen for this particular move of Long Chen’s could not be counted. As long as they weren’t one hundred percent focused, then within the same realm, there was practically no one that could block Long Chen’s divine face-slapping technique that had practically reached a supernatural level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The angle was practically devilish, while the arc was graceful and elegant. There wasn’t the slightest sign before he attacked, nor was there any killing intent to be sensed. His movements were quick, his posture was handsome, and it gave people a kind of pleasing and delightful feeling. It was wonderful to watch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But that kind of wonderful feeling was something only spectators and Long Chen got to enjoy. The person slapped felt so much pain that they wished they were dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was especially true in regards to those incredibly arrogant fellows who liked to look down their noses on people. That kind of mental wound far surpassed the pain of the flesh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Wufang roared, and fire-red runes flew through the air. A terrifying blaze soared, instantly spreading everywhere. Within a dozen meters of his body, everything was a fire-red, making him look like some flame god.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That kind of terrifying temperature could ignite the sky. For miles, the ground was roasted black by that temperature, causing many people to retreat in horror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What terrifying flame energy. Ordinary people are unable to even approach,” muttered a Corrupt Chosen with shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Chosen were unable to bear that level of heat. There was no way to approach him if they were to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pill cultivators were experts at playing with fire. When a beast flame entered their hands, with their special circulation techniques, it would be even stronger than when it was in the hands of its original Magical Beast owner. That was the most terrifying aspect of pill cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die!” Huo Wufang roared and his flame blade explosively grew, becoming a huge, blazing blade that was three hundred meters long. It cut through the void as it slashed down at Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That flame blade came crashing down from the sky, looking like some heavenly blade. This attack not only contained a terrifying flame energy, but it also contained Huo Wufang’s powerful will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In front of that will, the distant Chosen all turned pale, their bodies involuntarily quivering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were horrified to realize that Huo Wufang’s will also contained a formless pressure that suppressed their souls.</span></p>
