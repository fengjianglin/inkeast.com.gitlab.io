Although his Illusory Bone Armor had blocked Guo Ran’s attack, he was still covered in cold sweat. Seeing those scattered needles on the ground, the runic light coming from them gave him chills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he hadn’t reacted at the first moment and summoned the Illusory Bone Armor, he would have been turned into a sieve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No physical body could possibly block such sharp needles when they were shot out with this kind of force. Although it wouldn’t have necessarily taken his life, it would be impossible to avoid being heavily injured.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before the Righteous and Corrupt battle had even started, he had already been forced into a miserable position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, clapping sounds rang out. A group of people grandly walked over. The person at the front was wearing a white dress. She was tall and slender, her skin white as snow, and she gracefully walked over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s Hua Biluo!” The Righteous disciples let out exclamations. Hua Biluo was a peak expert in the Righteous path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xue Wuya’s arrival had been like a heavy stone oppressing the Righteous disciples’ hearts. Now that Hua Biluo had arrived, their morale immediately soared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were thousands of disciples behind Hua Biluo. Almost half of them were monastery disciples. Hua Biluo truly had skillful methods to be able to gather so many disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hua Biluo was clapping as she brought everyone to stand by Long Chen. “Wonderful, really wonderful. Who would have expected that brother Long’s subordinates were all hidden dragons and crouching tigers? My eyes really have been opened.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as Hua Biluo arrived, she had just managed to see Xue Wuya attacking. Her evaluation of Long Chen’s power rose even further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Previously, she had only been interested in Long Chen’s individual power. She hadn’t really cared about the others. But just now, whether it was Gu Yang or Yue Zifeng, the power they had released was far greater than ordinary Chosen. They wouldn’t even be much weaker than people on the level of Yin Wushuang. That gave her a shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sister Biluo is too courteous. After not meeting for so long, you’ve become even more beautiful.” Long Chen stood up and smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since they were allied, he naturally didn’t feel right sitting. The others also got up. Of course, Wilde was an exception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“To overpraise me like this in front of such beautiful women, if I didn’t know your character, I really would suspect you were intentionally mocking me.” Hua Biluo couldn’t help laughing when she saw Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and the other beautiful women. “Let me give you an introduction. This is senior apprentice-brother Chang from the fourth monastery, this is senior apprentice-brother Zhao from the sixth monastery…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hua Biluo introduced the leaders of her alliance, and Long Chen politely greeted them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he could see the contempt in their eyes. Although they weren’t looking down their noses at him, it was still obvious to him. However, Long Chen had to give Hua Biluo face. As for what those people thought of him, he didn’t particularly care.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Guo Ran and the others could also tell that these people were too arrogant, causing them to feel a bit uncomfortable. Just who had the qualifications to be so arrogant in front of Long Chen?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, who do you think you are? Is your status so amazing? You dare look down on people?” scolded Guo Ran.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Quite a few people’s expressions sank, and even Hua Biluo was slightly angered inside. Although she also knew these people were too arrogant, on the surface, they still hadn’t done anything. Scolding them like this was a bit too much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Guo Ran continued, “And you, in front of my boss, you are just a dreg. Just now, my boss decided not to do anything to you, but if he had, you’d have long since died. If you aren’t going to fuck off now, what are you waiting for? You actually don’t know how to do this little, but you still think you can call yourself an expert?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following Guo Ran’s gaze, they saw the distant Xue Wuya was just standing there, his expression extremely gloomy. He couldn’t leave, but he also couldn’t stay. Now he was in an awkward position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This still wasn’t the time for the decisive battle. He couldn’t rashly go all-out, but if he just left like this, he really would have lost all his prestige.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now people realized Guo Ran was cursing Xue Wuya. However, quite a few people could tell that Guo Ran was indirectly cursing others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These people actually dared look down on someone like Long Chen? Did they think a grand background was something so amazing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re looking to die!” Xue Wuya raged. This was the most humiliating moment of his life. He was already on the verge of exploding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xue Wuya, you should return. You won’t get anything from here,” said Hua Biluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her words were entirely correct. He really wouldn’t be able to obtain anything unless he decided to initiate the Righteous and Corrupt battle without care of others. However, he wouldn’t do such a thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When it came to the top experts of the Corrupt path, he was not the only one. If he did that, he would offend all those other experts that had yet to arrive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph, I’ll allow you to live for a little while longer.” Xue Wuya took a deep breath, in the end deciding to return to the Corrupt path’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was not able to be as free and unrestrained as Long Chen, capable of taking action whenever he wanted. However, he was an extremely quick-witted person. No one would be able to run from this battle, so a few more hours didn’t matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Long, don’t stand here. Come with us. After all, you are a member of our Righteous path, and we should be working together against our enemies,” smiled Hua Biluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Long Chen could reply, a man frowned and said, “That’s no good. By standing here, Long Chen has already expressed that he is no longer a member of our Righteous path. Why do we have to care about him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This person was a monastery disciple, and was also a Chosen. His words immediately caused Hua Biluo’s expression to change. She icily said, “In the Righteous and Corrupt battles, we should all be working together against our common enemy, the Corrupt path. What purpose do you have to say such a thing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She really hadn’t expected someone to interfere like this. Although Long Chen had had problems with the first monastery, the Righteous path’s inner strife had to be ignored so they could unify against the Corrupt path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sister Biluo, Long Chen’s reputation is something everyone knows. You want us to stand together with such a person? I, Li Changhao, am a true man, and I cannot forgive such a person,” he said righteously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shut the fuck up. My boss was framed by others!” raged Guo Ran.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Framed? Hmph, if he really was innocent, who would have wanted to frame him? Why didn’t anyone come frame me? Do you think we’re all idiots?” he said disdainfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Guo Ran was completely furious. This bastard really was looking to die. If he didn’t have misgivings about Hua Biluo, Guo Ran would have already taken out his battle armor and killed this idiot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only Long Chen’s expression remained indifferent. He didn’t say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hua Biluo’s expression was a bit unsightly as she icily said, “Li Changhao, we no longer welcome you. You can leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Changhao sneered, “I don’t need you to say that. I’m leaving. I really wouldn’t have thought that the goddess of our hearts would end up liking a perverted traitor. It really makes a person’s heart cold. Brothers, have you not seen this? Sister Biluo has already fallen for this Long Chen. Although he doesn’t have any other skills, it seems his seducing skills are really unrivaled beneath the heavens. What are you all waiting for?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, a large hand slapped across Li Changhao’s face. This slap had come completely silently, and he was struck so hard, his jaw shattered and his teeth flew out.</span></p>
