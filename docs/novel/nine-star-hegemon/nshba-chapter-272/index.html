 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe, don’t make any random guesses.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen didn’t say anymore about that topic. He felt that Tang Wan-er really had sensed something. He really had no choice but to admire her. A woman’s intuition really was frightening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen asked Tang Wan-er, “After you became a Favored, did you feel anything particularly special? Looking at that attack just now, it seems your attacks are a bit different from before!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wan-er was excited to talk about becoming a Favored. She told Long Chen that ever since she had absorbed that Dao-mark, she could feel a mysterious energy supporting her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her wind blades had also changed. Her control of wind energy had reached a kind of pinnacle, and her wind runes were clearer than ever. In terms of power, they were at least ten times stronger than in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In reality, a Favored’s Dao-mark was a natural mark of the Heavenly Daos. It was extremely ephemeral and mysterious. It was a mysterious existence that occured with karmic destiny.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When a baby was born, if their karmic luck was great enough, they would receive the approval of the Heavenly Daos, and that natural mark would adhere to their body in order to even further increase their karmic luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this kind of natural Dao-mark wouldn’t stay the same forever. As a person grew, if their karmic luck faded, that Dao-mark would also fade away to find another host or perhaps just disappear back into the heavens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was why their Dao-mark would automatically leave their body when they were killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A person could forcibly try to absorb that Dao-mark at that time. But as for whether or not you could succeed in having it stay in your body, that would essentially count on your karmic luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that huge battle, three people had had their Dao-marks stolen. But only Tang Wan-er had succeeded. And that was actually extremely lucky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was said that the odds of succeeding in absorbing another person’s Dao-mark were less than ten percent. However, once you succeeded, then with the Dao-mark’s karmic luck adding onto your own, your future would be limitless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was why Tang Wan-er was so excited. She was also deeply moved, and surprisingly, she held onto Long Chen’s hand warmly. “Thank you Long Chen. You aren’t even a Favored, but you gave me your chance to become one.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But just thinking about that actually filled Long Chen with resentment. When Tu Fang had told him to snatch that Dao-mark, he had sensed that it would most likely have no affinity with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And as he had expected, Chu Yao had told him that this Dao-mark was something that existed on top of the Dantian’s Spirit Root. If the Spirit Root was likened to a huge tree, then elemental spiritual qi was like the tree’s fruit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Other than being able to provide more karmic luck, that Dao-mark was also able to change a person’s spiritual qi attribute. It was able to increase the affinity and strength of a person’s elemental attribute by tens of times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Yao was an excellent example. She was a wood cultivator, and normal wood cultivators weren’t powerful combat experts. They were generally only capable of assisting the real fighters. Their greatest ability was their ability to heal wounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But as a Favored, Chu Yao’s wood energy had changed, containing a trace of metal element.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Metal and wood oppressed each other. It should have fundamentally been impossible to merge them, and yet the power of a Favored could not be judged according to common sense. And that was one of the reasons a Favored’s combat ability was so terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once Tang Wan-er had absorbed that Dao-mark, her wind energy had also changed. So now a random wave of Tang Wan-er’s hand was just as strong as one of her full strength attacks in the past. That was why Tang Wan-er was incredibly grateful to Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen had directly given that Favored’s corpse to her after he had killed him. She hadn’t even known what a Favored’s Dao-mark was, but she had simply listened to what he said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only once she had absorbed that Dao-mark had she realized that Long Chen had made a great sacrifice, leaving this huge opportunity to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also why Chu Yao sensed that Long Chen’s treatment of Tang Wan-er wasn’t just that of two friends. So she had taken the initiative to form a relationship with her. In reality, Long Chen had been misjudged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Dantian was completely empty. Where was there a Spirit Root for that Dao-mark to adhere to? Giving it to Tang Wan-er was simply the right thing to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With one hand held by Tang Wan-er, feeling her hand and how exquisitely soft it was, how could Long Chen contain himself?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gently rubbing Tang Wan-er’s hand, he acted completely infatuated. “If I can use just a Favored’s corpse to exchange for a beauty’s heart, then that really would be worth it. Looks like I’ll need to work harder in the future…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wan-er’s face was red from holding Long Chen’s hand. But she also didn’t have the heart to pull away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But then after Long Chen finished speaking, that bashful, gentle expression completely disappeared. Looking at the infatuated Long Chen, she asked, “Are you thinking of going out to kill a couple more Favored to exchange for some more beauties’ hearts?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course, of course- aiya!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rubbing her jade hand, that feeling really was infatuating for him. He hadn’t noticed that her tone had changed suddenly, and so he had just made a random reply. But then he felt a burst of pain from his waist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, he realized he was unable to move. His body was tightly bound with wooden stakes. Tang Wan-er’s other hand was viciously pinching him on the waist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, we were just talking nicely! How do you become so hostile so fast?!” cried out Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He saw Chu Yao was currently forming a hand seal with a naughty smile as she looked at Long Chen, not saying anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wan-er raged, “I just knew you were a womanizer! With your fickle heart, how are you worthy of big sister Yao-er’s devotion?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey! That was just a random reply. I wasn’t serious! Furthermore, you’re clearly the one that’s always seducing me! You’re forcibly captivating me! This is just your trap!” justified Long Chen. With those wooden stakes binding his body, he was unable to move at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What seduction?! Just listening to you is disgusting! Long Chen, you really are wicked!” Tang Wan-er blushed and raged at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That was just a slip of the tongue. And even if someone should penalize me, it should be Yao-er. Yao-er, I misspoke, so forgive me. Next time I definitely won’t.” Long Chen knew Chu Yao was the more kindhearted one. He directly admitted defeat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And as he had expected, Long Chen’s act of pity really was Chu Yao’s weak point. She was just about to release him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big sister Yao-er, you absolutely can’t listen to him! This fellow is most skilled in putting on an act. Don’t get tricked.” Tang Wan-er really understood Long Chen too well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having his trick be so suddenly broken, Long Chen raged, “Have you made a mistake?! This is a matter for a husband and wife, me and Yao-er. Why are you interfering?!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Yao blushed shyly, but she felt a burst of warmth. From the start, Long Chen had always viewed her that way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wan-er righteously replied, “Big sister Yao-er said that when she’s not present, I have to look after you and make sure you don’t go womanizing everywhere.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah, you gave me to her? Yao-er, aren’t you afraid of her cheating you? Yao-er, let me tell you, she’s been drooling over how handsome I am for a long time- aiya!” Long Chen was once more given a vicious pinch before he could finish speaking.</span></p>

In between her words, she would give Long Chen a vicious pinch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Yao was laughing to the side. She knew that Long Chen’s miserable cries were all fake just to intentionally tease them.</span></p>

How could Tang Wan-er’s pinches really hurt that much?</span></p>

Those wooden stakes all became as flexible as rope and returned to the earth, disappearing.</span></p>

Holding Chu Yao’s hands, Long Chen began to speak of proper things. “Yao-er, do you really have to return to Skywood Palace so soon? Didn’t you say you could stay at the Xuantian Monastery for a period? I really hate to part with you so soon after we have reunited.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Yao reddened slightly and gently caressed Long Chen’s cheek. “I also hate to part with you. But if I want to protect you, I need to constantly increase my strength.</span></p>

There was really nothing that could be done about this. Cultivation was inherently a struggle. They all had to make the most of their time to raise their strength, or they would be thrown behind by others.</span></p>

Long Chen had essentially only heard its name. He still didn’t know any of the details.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wan-er was also extremely curious. She said, “I’ve heard that the Jiuli secret realm only opens once every hundred years. There is also a limit on the entrances. Only those in the Tendon Transformation realm and below can enter. Bone Forging experts will only get exterminated if they try to force their way in. I wonder if that’s true?”</span></p>

But there is one thing that is certain. My master said that the Jiuli secret realm is definitely extremely ancient. It is essentially it’s own world. There are many strange beasts living inside.</span></p>

He hadn’t expected the Jiuli secret realm’s origin to be so mysterious. But for some reason, every time he heard the Jiuli secret realm’s name, his FengFu Star would begin to crazily circulate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s why you have to work hard Long Chen.
