 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Spiritual Illusion!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Qi shouted and an illusory image appeared in front of that person. That illusion was transparent, and it had&nbsp;the same form as Meng Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person rushing forward was that mustached man who hadn’t said a single word from the very start. It was unexpected for him to take action at this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph.” The mustached man snorted and an ancient copper bracelet on his wrist lit up. It protected him and directly smashed apart Meng Qi’s spiritual avatar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A soul suppressing item!” Meng Qi was startled. It had to be known that the attack she had just used was incredibly powerful, as she had sensed that this man was extremely terrifying, perhaps not even lacking when compared to Han Tianyu or Yin Luo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So this spiritual attack had contained her full power. Even ordinary protective soul items would have instantly been broken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had to be known that Meng Qi’s vast soul energy was even stronger than Long Chen’s. With just one ultimate move, she had managed to block all those charging experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There had been quite a few people amongst them who possessed soul items to protect themselves. But in front of Meng Qi’s powerful soul energy, those soul items would run out of energy in just a moment, and they would still be killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was the most terrifying ability of soul cultivators. Their attacks silently targeted the soul, causing a person to die in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, her attack had been destroyed by this mustached man. Meng Qi could sense that his bracelet contained a huge amount of soul energy. That soul item was not ordinary, and had to be high grade amongst soul items. Their other name was soul suppressing item.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A soul suppressing item had a higher quality than ordinary soul items, and it didn’t even need to be activated. When it encountered a spiritual attack, it would instantly activate to protect its owner. Meng Qi could sense that the soul energy within that bracelet was incredibly condensed. That was something only possible if a Xiantian soul cultivator had poured their soul energy into it. Meng Qi was unable to do anything to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After breaking past Meng Qi’s blockade, he directly charged at Long Chen. He was incredibly fast, and before people could react, he was already past them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Should I catch him?” Wilde, whose hands had long since begun feeling itchy, raised his club.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t.” Meng Qi hastily stopped him. “Long Chen already said that you’re our secret weapon and can’t be revealed too easily. When a critical time comes, you can give our enemies a fatal blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Furthermore, Long Chen also told you that when he needs you to attack, he will tell you. As long as he hasn’t said anything, it means he still has enough power to handle everything. Just wait here patiently. Otherwise, Long Chen will get angry.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, okay. But I feel like if this continues, I might get hungry soon,” said Wilde with a bit of distress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can sit here. I’ll use my wood spiritual energy to help you absorb a bit of energy. That way you won’t exhaust yourself too fast.” After saying that, Chu Yao summoned a wooden chair for Wilde to sit on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had no other method. The rate at which Wilde grew hungry made everyone feel helpless. In order to keep Wilde in his peak state, they could only do it this way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you feel hungry, take out a few pieces of meat to eat from your spatial ring.” Chu Yao formed hand seals in front of her, all while focusing on the entire battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen didn’t want her personally joining the battle. He just needed her to help heal everyone as soon as they suffered any injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whenever someone was injured, a root would grow out of the ground beside them and pour a powerful life energy into their body. As long as it wasn’t an instant death, practically all injuries were immediately healed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, Chu Yao’s range was extremely large. She could even grow out her wooden stakes a dozen miles from her. Whenever anyone ran into danger, wooden stakes would grow out of the ground around them to save them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After absorbing the tree-heart, her wood energy had become even more powerful. Wherever there was ground, she could bring out her full abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, her wooden stakes could be small or big, capable of helping in all kinds of situations. Their strongest point was their hardness. A single wooden stake was something a Chosen would require a full strength attack to destroy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With just a wave of her hands, Chu Yao could summon thousands of wooden stakes. Although their attacking strength wasn’t very high, in terms of defense, Chu Yao was number one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Chu Yao’s assistance, their entire group had a powerful insurance, and they could focus on attacking with all their might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the spot where the peak experts were fighting, there was Mo Nian and Zheng Wenlong who were entangled with others. There was also Guo Ran in his armor. He carried two sabers in his hands, leading Gu Yang and the others on a rampage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the Huayun Sect disciples that Zheng Wenlong had brought, they were surprisingly powerful. The weapons in their hands had all been made from the best materials.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Basically, each one of them had a soft armor protecting them. Taking a person’s attack, they would just get a light cut, while they could directly kill the attacker.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thing that made the Righteous disciples the most furious was that the Huayun disciples had protections all over them. Even their pants had a powerful defensive strength. Blades were almost unable to cause them any injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When a certain Huayun disciples’ shoe broke apart from an attack, people saw that even their socks were made of golden thread. That angered the Righteous disciples so much that their eyes turned green.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That golden thread was from gold silkworms and was incredibly expensive. Normally, they were all used for soft armors. They were practically priceless treasures. In other words, even the Huayun disciples’ socks were priceless treasures. That almost angered them to death. These fellows really had too much money.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Huayun disciples fought at the front, while the Mo Gate disciples continuously rained down arrows from further back. Each of their arrows easily pierced through armor and flesh. In fact, several people would fall with each arrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their strength was just too great, and each arrow could pierce through multiple bodies before stopping. Such archery arts were truly intimidating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the core of their group were the five women and Wilde. The women were their core power, and they wouldn’t easily attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A trump card was something only revealed at a critical moment. You had to cut down your opponent in a single blow. You could not give your opponents time to figure out a way to counter your trump cards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Mo Nian, Zheng Wenlong, and all the others fighting so fiercely, Hua Biluo was filled with pain. Originally, these were the allies she should have been fighting shoulder to shoulder with. But now, she had essentially abandoned her promise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This fucking Huo Wufang and his fucking Pill Tower! This is fucking stupid!” One of the experts behind Hua Biluo couldn’t help cursing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were also manly men, and which of them didn’t have any arrogance? But they were humiliated by Huo Wufang, and they could only watch as Mo Nian and the others fought so valiantly. They were filled with fury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that person cursed, another expert stealthily poked him, glancing furtively at Hua Biluo. When he saw Hua Biluo’s frosty face, he immediately shut up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">None of these people felt good about this. But the one who felt the worst was naturally Hua Biluo. It was just that she didn’t complain about her suffering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That mustached man with the broadsword has reached Long Chen!” Someone let out a cry that drew Hua Biluo’s attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen’s divine ring was constantly absorbing spiritual qi. Not only was he exhausting Han Tianyu’s essence blood energy, but his own spiritual qi was gradually recovering. At this point, he had already recovered to eighty percent.</span></p>

Panic had finally appeared in his eyes. If this continued, he would definitely die.</span></p>

If this continued, it would gravely harm his foundation, and he would very likely have to fall from the ranks of heavenly geniuses.</span></p>

He was ready to receive an attack from him, but hearing him ask this, he came to a sudden comprehension.</span></p>

The first form of Split the Heavens? In other words, there was a second form and even a third form? He replied, “This is something I bought at a market in the secular world.”</span></p>

After a moment, he said, “The Split the Heavens Battle Skill is a secret technique that cannot be transmitted outside my Heaven Splitting Divine Sect. I must take it back. What do you say to that?”</span></p>
