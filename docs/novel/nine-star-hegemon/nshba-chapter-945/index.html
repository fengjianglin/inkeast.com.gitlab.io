 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was like the crowd’s passionate cries were cut off by a knife. A group of people walked grandly into the Remote Heaven Gang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s the Xuantian Dao Sect’s people!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The whole nest came out? Are they going for a decisive battle?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Long Chen led over a hundred thousand of the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples over, it caused countless cries to resonate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, only one hundred thousand people. We’ve gathered all the Eastern Wasteland’s Righteous path, so exterminating them is as easy as turning a hand,” sneered someone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The current Xuantian Dao Sect was no longer the old Xuantian Dao Sect. The Corrupt path’s sneak attack had heavily injured their core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The thirty-six supermonasteries took heavy damage. Thus, these hundred thousand disciples were the Xuantian Dao Sect’s full force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally, Long Chen had only been planning on leading the Dragonblood Legion to this battle. But he hadn’t succeeded. The Xuantian Dao Sect’s thirty-six supermonasteries and all their subordinate monasteries had moved out in full force, except for some people to look after their sects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had all heard of what Long Chen had encountered In the Immemorial Path. As for the Corrupt path’s sneak attack, although they had no proof it was due to a collusion between the Corrupt path and the Remote Heaven Gang, there was a ninety percent chance that it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After paying that painful price, the Xuantian Dao Sect’s experts had finally erupted. This matter had provoked the fury within them. They decided to advance and retreat with Long Chen. Even if they knew that they might never return after advancing, they had still come.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen also hadn’t expected the Xuantian Dao Sect to possess such passion when pushed to the brink of despair. He really hadn’t been able to tell before that these disciples possessed such courage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen and Ouyang Qiuyu walked side by side, and behind them were Meng Qi, Tang Wan-er, Wilde, and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind them were the Dragonblood warriors. After the baptism of that large battle, they were like unsheathed blades. The killing intent coming off of them had almost taken solid form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Xuantian Dao Sect’s experts were behind them. However, these disciples were all very weak. There were quite a few that had only reached Meridian Opening, and some were only just Bone Forging disciples</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although their cultivation bases were very low, they were fearless in the face of millions of experts. They all held their weapons tightly, their eyes icy-cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brazen Long Chen, you irredeemable brute, you dare-”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Xiantian expert was the first to begin cursing at Long Chen. With a point from Guo Ran, a golden ray killed him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bastard, you-”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another person was killed by Guo Ran.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the top of the stage, Ji Changkong shouted, “Long Chen, as expected, you are brutal and vicious. Even when others point out your crimes, you simply kill them cruelly. Do you think you can keep your crimes quiet? Even if you kill a hundred people, a thousand people, or even ten thousand people, can you kill all the Eastern Wasteland’s Righteous path’s experts? Do you think the saber in your hand can extinguish the righteousness in people’s hearts? In the Immemorial Path, this is exactly how you killed the Righteous path’s experts. You are a savage fiend. Has everyone seen it clearly? This is exactly how mercilessly he attacked the people of his own sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Changkong was delighted to see Long Chen arrive. But he put on a righteous expression, passionately stirring the flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Hongling was the first to start a cheer with the Remote Heaven Gang’s experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kill Long Chen!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kill Long Chen!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kill Long Chen!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These ignorant people all looked as if they would only be happy once Long Chen was killed. Gu Yang and the others clenched their fists. Even the always peaceful Meng Qi was angered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Surprisingly, Long Chen was the only one with an indifferent expression. He didn’t even look at those people who had been bought by the Remote Heaven Gang. He icily stared at Ji Changkong. “Not bad. This field is bigger than last time. But this shouldn’t be all of it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen, don’t try to talk your way out of this. No matter what you say, you can’t talk your way out of the fact that you colluded with the aboriginals to kill people of the Righteous path. If you don’t die today, there’ll be no way to pacify the souls who died because of you! The Devil Execution Conference is being held just for you. I really didn’t think you’d come, but that’s also good. I’ll publicly list your innumerable crimes so you’re convinced!” sneered Ji Changkong. He cast a glance to a certain person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dozens of experts immediately walked out. When they appeared, an uproar erupted amongst the Xuantian Dao Sect’s experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those people were the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples. The people at the front used to be part of the Four Heavenly Geniuses, Zhao Wuji and Yue Qianshan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhao Wuji, Yue Qianshan, you traitors actually joined the Remote Heaven Gang?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These two had been the Xuantian Dao Sect’s peerless geniuses. They had countless worshippers and followers. Now seeing the people they had worshipped be so lacking in integrity as to join the Remote Heaven Gang, curses rained down upon them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, what do you understand? We renounced the darkness to join the light. The Xuantian Dao Sect is evil and is harboring a criminal like Long Chen. That’s the height of foolishness. And what we did wasn’t join the Remote Heaven Gang. Instead, we’re standing up for the Righteous path. In front of everyone, we’ll testify to Long Chen’s crimes. The higher-ups from the Xuantian Dao Sect, are you all blind? Can you not see how fake this criminal is? It seems there really is no need for the Xuantian Dao Sect to exist any longer,” sneered Zhao Wuji.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You…!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Wuji and Yue Qianshan had clearly betrayed them, but they still acted so sanctimoniously. The Xuantian Dao Sect’s people clenched their teeth. The monastery heads who had raised them were so furious that they quivered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen, in the Immemorial Path, you raped and looted, not shrinking from any crime, and-” Zhao Wuji started a steady stream of words that he seemed to know by heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait a moment. If you want to kill me, there’s no need to make it so complicated. Let me first ask, are all of you sure you want to stand there?” Long Chen interrupted Zhao Wuji and looked at the Xuantian Dao Sect disciples behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, we were forced! We-” cried one of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Courting death!” One of the Remote Heaven Gang expert’s expression changed. He immediately charged over and let out a punch, wanting to kill that person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a translucent, icy Sword Qi flew over, accurately landing on that person’s body. That person transformed into ice and then shattered. A Foundation Forging expert was killed in one blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples can’t be killed by someone like you,” said Ouyang Qiuyu icily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as Ouyang Qiuyu attacked, seven of the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples ran over to Long Chen’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Half-step King.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Remote Heaven Gang’s patriarch didn’t particularly care about those people. It was Ouyang Qiuyu who drew most of his attention. He had long since investigated her and knew that she was stuck at the peak of Foundation Forging. When had she become a half-step King?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sect master, senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, please get us justice! These bastards, they…” One of them knelt down in front of Ouyang Qiuyu and began to weep. “As soon as we exited the Immemorial Path, Ji Changkong, Zhao Wuji, and Yue Qianshan forced us to join the Remote Heaven Gang. The senior apprentice-brothers who refused were killed right there and then. They are the real brutes…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ouyang Qiuyu’s expression sank. At first, she had also been curious as to why other than Long Chen’s people, none of the other disciples had returned. Now she understood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhao Wuji, Yue Qianshan, you should still remember the number one punishment of the Xuantian Dao Sect’s law enforcement hall!” Ouyang Qiuyu glared at them hatefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them had not only betrayed them, but they had forced the others to defect as well. Furthermore, they had personally slaughtered people from their sect. That was inexcusable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Wuji and Yue Qianshan’s expressions changed. The Xuantian Dao Sect’s number one punishment was something even traitors wouldn’t normally receive. Only people like them who had betrayed the sect and killed people while doing so had the qualifications to enjoy it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Xuantian Dao Sect’s number one punishment was called the Five Heart Living Lotus. It sounded like a very refined name, but those who knew what it meant all got chills upon hearing it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Normally, one would think the five hearts referred to the two palms, two feet, and heart. But the Xuantian Dao Sect’s five hearts didn’t include the real heart. Instead, the fifth heart referred to the heart of the head, or the space between a person’s eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Heart Piercing Lotus’s seed was planted in each of those five spots. It was said that this lotus seed originated from hell. It was only able to survive off other people’s bodies. During that process, it would extract a person’s soul and blood to nourish itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, the person infected with the lotus would feel endless pain during this process. The lotus would take root within the body, and the pain was indescribable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This kind of pain was enough to cause a person to die. But because a seed would be planted in the head as well, it would cause a strange cycle. It made it so a person could die, but they would still feel every little bit of the pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The most terrifying thing was that the lotus would feed the energy back to the heart. It allowed a person to live three times longer than normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the Xuantian Dao Sect’s cruelest punishment. It had only been used a few times in all of history. Unless a person was completely evil, it wouldn’t be used. Even those who betrayed the sect were normally just killed instead of being inflicted with this punishment. But today, Ouyang Qiuyu was truly infuriated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ouyang Qiuyu, you really are despicable. Do you think using a soul art to control a few disciples would be enough to invert black and white? Laughable! Do you think the Righteous disciples are idiots?” Ji Changkong hastily took Zhao Wuji’s place to respond when he saw that he was terrified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ouyang Qiuyu, you’re too shameless and despicable!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A person like you can be a sect master? Garbage! A garbage sect master and a garbage sect!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Exactly, such a sect is just garbage. The existence that raised a devil like Long Chen definitely isn’t anything good and should be destroyed with him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a subtle hint from Ji Changkong, countless people began to furiously roar, cursing Ouyang Qiuyu. She trembled from rage, having an urge to slaughter them all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Die!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Surprisingly, Long Chen suddenly roared. It was like the roar of a god, and it contained his powerful Spiritual Strength.</span></p>
