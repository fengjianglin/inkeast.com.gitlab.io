His saber ended up hitting nothing but air.</span></p>

He had actually forgotten about this thing, allowing that woman to escape again.</span></p>

He directly went to attack Han Tianfeng.</span></p>

I’ll tear your body apart and play all your women to death! Haha, just wait!” Han Tianfeng also took out a teleportation talisman, his eyes filled with rancor. “You won’t be able to kill-”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Tianfeng had just been about to crush the talisman when a wave of Spiritual Strength surged over. He suddenly found he was unable to crush the talisman. An instant later, Long Chen’s saber had already cut off his arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before he could even scream, his saber was pressed against his throat. That icy blade made it so Han Tianfeng didn’t dare say a single word, as he was filled with terror.</span></p>

He hoped he could use his powerful background to intimidate Long Chen. Otherwise, he really would die today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’ll believe it in a bit.”</span></p>

A portion of these people were monastery disciples, and Long Chen also saw several wearing the first monastery’s robes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He said to them, “I know there are quite a few of you using photographic jades to record all this. Right now, I’ll give you a good opportunity. Properly prepare your photographic jades to record this next moment, because this next moment will be very precious!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen’s words caused everyone’s expressions to change, as they all knew what he was planning on doing. He was about to kill Han Tianfeng in front of all of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Long Chen killed Han Tianfeng, then that was equivalent to provoking an enormous disaster. He would have to face Han Tianyu’s wrath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You dare, Long Chen?!” Han Tianfeng was startled and infuriated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Correct, I really do dare.” Long Chen nodded, approving his viewpoint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… if you kill me, you also won’t be able to live! No one will be able to protect you!” Han Tianfeng sharply cried. He was now afraid, truly afraid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, you don’t need to worry about whether or not I’ll be able to live. Just go to the otherworld and properly repent.” Long Chen’s voice sounded like the summoning of a death god.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, no… Long Chen, don’t kill me… we… we can discuss this!” Han Tianfeng sensed Long Chen had truly set his heart on killing him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Discuss this? As soon as we entered the secret realm, you all tried to entrap me, smearing my name, wanting to destroy my reputation. Did you ever come find me to discuss this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“After entrapping me, you then sent out proclamations, painting me as a heinous criminal. Then using the image of justice warriors, you came to try and kill me, all in order to raise your own glory. Did you ever come find me to discuss this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When you failed to kill me, you shamelessly put your targets on the people by my side, slaughtering the weak, all to make me feel endless pain. Did you ever come find me to discuss this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With each word he spoke, Long Chen’s voice became clearer. With each word he spoke, his voice filled with more emotion. By the end, his voice was full of endless hatred, and it had become a heaven-shaking roar that caused even the void to shudder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even those distant spectators felt that Long Chen seemed like an angry lion. His fury could ignite the dome of the sky, and no one could possibly calm that fury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Now that your life is in my hands, you still have the face to want to discuss things with me? If you had just targeted me, then there would still be room for discussion. But when you extended your hands towards the people beside me, then that means no rest until death!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No rest until death… no rest until death… no rest until death…” Those four words continued to echo throughout the mountains, shaking people’s ears. The killing intent contained within those words caused people’s hearts to tremble with fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Han Tianyu, I know you’ll see this video. Don’t think that by hiding behind others, I don’t know what you’ve done. Don’t you want to play with me? Now I finally have time to accompany you. For now, I’ll first accept your brother’s head. Next time I’ll accept Yin Wushuang’s head, and if you dare try to stop me, then I’ll also cut off your head.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nooo-!” Han Tianfeng’s scream was cut short by a blood-colored saber. His head flew into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a moment, the entire world was silent. Time seemed to slow down as everyone clearly saw Han Tianfeng’s head flipping through the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His expression was still filled with terror, worry, and an endless thirst for life. Unfortunately, that was not able to change his fate. A generation’s genius was killed just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen looked at those distant spectators and icily said, “I know there are many people who have been targeting me in secret. However, you’re all quite lucky that you haven’t directly attacked me or anyone by my side. Otherwise, even if you had ascended into the heavens or dug your way into hell, I would still have cut off your head. Fuck off, and don’t forget to spread your photographic jades. Tell all those people targeting me that if they want to die, they can come anytime!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only after Long Chen finished speaking did people begin to hurriedly leave. They were like stray dogs, fleeing for their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The current Long Chen was just too frightening. He seemed like a merciless fiend, killing people without batting an eye. Just being stared at by him was enough to break their courage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Previously, they hadn’t dared to run. Running would have indicated their guilty conscience, and who knew whether or not they would be mercilessly cut down by Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that Long Chen had told them to fuck off, it was as if their lives had been pardoned, and they fled with all their might. The battle today had completely wrecked their courage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Tianyu’s brother had been killed. That was a huge matter. Apparently, Han Tianyu only had this one brother, and he loved him dearly. Once he heard this news, he would definitely become crazy. Long Chen had declared war on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With all of these people fleeing, the shocking news of what had happened also spread rapidly, reaching every corner of the Jiuli secret realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?! Han Tianfeng was killed?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If there wasn’t a video of it, no one would have believed it. A generation’s genius, second only to his brother, had fallen just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And it wasn’t just Han Tianfeng. If Yin Wushuang hadn’t realized so quickly what a disaster she had provoked and activated a teleportation talisman, she would also have definitely been killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even with a teleportation talisman, Han Tianfeng had still been slaughtered by Long Chen. That filled everyone with a terror of Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Once Han Tianyu hears this news, he’ll definitely go crazy and kill Long Chen,” guessed many people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I doubt this news will reach Han Tianyu for now. I heard he’s currently in a dangerous area and has obtained a shocking treasure. He’s busy refining it, and so he temporarily doesn’t have time to come out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But as for whether or not Han Tianyu knew this news, it no longer really mattered. That was because practically everyone within the Jiuli &nbsp;secret realm, other than some secluded people, had heard of it.</span></p>

They liked to target him? Then they could come. Long Chen had long since been stifling his anger. Now, he wouldn’t hold it back any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fact that Han Tianfeng had chased down Tang Wan-er twice had already touched on his taboos. That had made this into a battle with no rest until death. And since there would be no rest until death, Long Chen no longer had any misgivings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Long Chen!” Everyone had already parted. Tang Wan-er ran up to Long Chen and threw herself into his embrace.</span></p>

He tightly hugged her, saying, “Sorry, I’ve caused you to suffer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, Tang Wan-er had long since lost her usual liveliness. That meant she truly had suffered during this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking of that, Long Chen was filled with hatred. “I actually let that slut Yin Wushuang run. That pisses me off.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If she’s run, she’s run. Now that I’ve seen you again, I don’t really feel much hate.” Tang Wan-er softly leaned against his chest, feeling a great sense of safety.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the Jiuli secret realm, there were countless dangers. Not only did you have to face the attacks of the vicious beasts inside the secret realm, you also had to handle being chased down by members from both the Righteous and Corrupt paths. She was already exhausted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen was like a mountain she could finally rely on in these times. Right now, she didn’t want to think about anything. She just hugged Long Chen as hard as she could, seeming afraid that he would fly away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well, I’m not so tolerant. Those idiots really are too hateful, and this time I’ll definitely settle our disputes.” Long Chen ground his teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Long Chen, you killed Han Tianyu’s brother, provoking a huge calamity. Even if you can leave the secret realm, you still won’t be able to survive your punishment.” Tang Wan-er was very worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a trap that had been meticulously prepared. Most of the evidence was already in the hands of the enemy. Killing people was just making his own sins even greater.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he did manage to leave the secret realm, he would have to face the first monastery’s wrath. As for the supermonastery, they had a deep relationship with the first monastery. Once they started an investigation, no one would be able to protect him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their 108th monastery was last place. They didn’t even have the right to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s nothing to be afraid of. Different situations call for different actions. Cultivation is a path of no retreat, and since there’s no retreat, what’s the point of caring so much about what the next step is? I don’t care about how far I can walk on this path. I just want to be able to not receive any bullying. If it’s foreordained that I can’t walk far on my path, then I would rather be a firework. Although my time would be short, at least I would release my most dazzling light.” Long Chen smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen had now found that he had been far too careful. A person should face his difficulties head-on, advancing bravely. Having too many misgivings, making all sorts of calculations and schemes, that would only impact your Dao-heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since he had chosen to believe in his martial strength, then he would use the most direct, most barbaric method to smash apart all the obstacles in front of him. If those obstacles were people, then he would kill people. If those obstacles were gods, then he would kill gods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cultivation was a path of no retreat. Once you stepped on it, there was no way to look back. No one knew just when they would fall. So what was the point of having so many misgivings? If a person wanted to kill you, then hack them to death. It was just that simple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blindly enduring wouldn’t cause them to stop. Instead, your enemies would work even harder, bringing endless pain to the people by your side. So Long Chen had finally chosen to no longer endure. He would slaughter out his own dignity, making his enemies too afraid to even be enemies with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you want to be a firework, then I will also be a firework. We’ll blossom together, and we’ll fall together,” said Tang Wan-er gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wan-er, I’m not used to you being so gentle and warm. You couldn’t have been possessed, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Scoundrel, is your skin itching again?” Tang Wan-er became bashful as well as enraged upon seeing Long Chen’s doubting expression. She viciously gave him a pinch on the waist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha, now this is my familiar Tang Wan-er.” Long Chen couldn’t help laughing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Scoundrel, are you cursing me for not being gentle enough?” Tang Wan-er rained a furious beating on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, no, no, in truth, you really are gentle. But your gentleness is different from other people.” Long Chen covered his head, letting Tang Wan-er’s fists rain down on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wan-er couldn’t help laughing. It seemed her mannerism really didn’t have any relation to the word ‘gentle’. But for some reason, she liked acting in this kind of unreasonable manner with Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as they were messing around, a violet ball of flame suddenly appeared in Long Chen’s hands and flew at a distant boulder.</span></p>
