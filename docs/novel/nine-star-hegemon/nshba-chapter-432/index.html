That was a huge, black arrow that instantly pierced through his chest and exploded.</span></p>

Dozens of Corrupt disciples were hit by the aftermath, and only a few of them managed to survive through luck.</span></p>

Resting his crossbow on his shoulder, he continued walking behind Long Chen.</span></p>

This person was over six feet tall and his cultivation base had reached the mid Bone Forging realm. The fluctuations from his body were extremely powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as that person stood out, quite a few Corrupt experts took out their weapons, ready to attack at any time. Obviously, this person’s status in the Corrupt path was extremely high.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen paused for a moment to look at this person. He shook his head. “For you to put it like this, I really am hurt. Don’t make me out to seem so vile. In truth, I really am a kindhearted person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kindhearted? Everyone’s faces twitched. He killed people like killing chickens- no, that wasn’t right. When people killed chickens, they usually had to at least look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He killed people without batting an eye as if crushing an ant. Did the word kindhearted really have the slightest bit of relation to him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Long Chen, you actually sneak attacked members of my Corrupt path. Do you think my Corrupt path is easy to bully?” raged that person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Have you taken me to be an outsider? The Righteous and Corrupt paths have fought for so many years. You’ve bullied us, and we’ve bullied you. Everyone is already familiar with that. So do your words have any meaning?” said Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…! Do you believe me when I say with a single word, I can instantly wipe out all of you?!”</span></p>

Currently, Long Chen was independent of either the Righteous or Corrupt path. He was also the smallest group present.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter how powerful Long Chen was, he was just one person. However, they had over ten thousand Corrupt disciples present, and they were sure that if they suppressed Long Chen, no one from the Righteous path would come out to help. Instead, they would probably cheer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you believe me when I say that if you continue talking, I will immediately cut off your head?” Long Chen indifferently looked at him. Who didn’t know how to brag?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That person’s aura immediately erupted furiously. At the same time, hundreds of people by his side released their auras, ready to attack at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the Righteous disciples, they celebrated when they saw this. They really hadn’t expected Long Chen to be so brazen as to directly kill so many Corrupt disciples. That was a head-on provocation to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were also many who silently admired Long Chen inside. This was a true man. Normally, the countless Righteous disciples were always terrified of the powerful Corrupt disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Long Chen’s group only had twelve people, and in the face of over ten thousand Corrupt disciples, he didn’t seem the slightest bit concerned. What kind of boldness was that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Long Chen had shown up, becoming the&nbsp;third power outside the Righteous and Corrupt paths. This group of his had far too few people, and yet, the imposingness he had displayed had shocked all of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was all done on purpose by Long Chen. He could already tell that there was no longer any retreat for him. The Righteous path refused to tolerate him, and the Corrupt path also refused to accept him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that kind of situation, he needed to show his own power, making people too intimidated. Otherwise, if he revealed the slightest weakness or tolerance, all that would come for him was death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen had already told his people that there was no way they could smoothly leave this place. If they wanted to live, then they needed to climb out of an endless pile of corpses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Qi and the others had long since prepared themselves now. Since this battle was inevitable, then what was the point of being so careful? Since they could die at any time, why not go out with a bang?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen expressionlessly looked at that Corrupt Chosen. Even the ones behind him were just looking on indifferently. They hadn’t even raised their weapons. They were completely ignoring them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was a silent ridicule and insult to them. That Corrupt Chosen’s face turned purple from rage. Right now, he was stuck in a hard position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was a top expert and was on the same level as Han Tianfeng and Yin Wushuang. Although the current him had tempered four bones, he had no assurance when it came to Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Long Chen’s gaze was truly unendurable. If he retreated at this time, his reputation would plummet. That was practically worse to him than being killed. Clenching his teeth, he was just about to charge at Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Wu, wait a moment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as he was about to charge out, he was held back by another person who said, “Long Chen is already about to die to Han Tianyu. He only has a short time before his death. Why bother lowering yourself to his level? If you attack, wouldn’t you just end up helping Han Tianyu?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person who had been called brother Wu sighed in relief. He didn’t want to fight with Long Chen. He had just been putting on a bold face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, he could borrow this person’s words to withdraw. He gratefully said, “Thank you for the reminder, brother Zhao. Otherwise, I would have ended up helping those idiots from the Righteous path.” He turned and looked icily at Long Chen. “I’ll allow you to live for a few more hours. I’ll let you enjoy your time before your miserable death.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tch, gutless.” Guo Ran sneered, his eyes containing a trace of disappointment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why aren’t they coming over?” asked a confused Wilde.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Because they’re afraid of death.” Guo Ran shrugged helplessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh. Then are we fighting?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’re definitely going to have to fight. But it will probably have to wait for a while.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright. Then I’m going to take a nap.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After saying that, Wilde lay down just like that, falling asleep. Laying down his club, he ended up using it as a pillow. He would occasionally let out a loud snore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen and the others were already accustomed to seeing this. Wilde’s body was different from others, and his body was unable to hold any spiritual qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In other words, he would only have energy once he had eaten. But as soon as he became hungry, that energy would sharply fall. Sleeping was the best way for him to conserve his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They knew that, but the Righteous and Corrupt disciples didn’t. They all looked on with bewilderment. At this kind of tense time, he was still able to sleep just like that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These people had already been waiting here for many days, and their nerves had been stretched taut the entire time. They didn’t even dare blink their eyes, afraid they would never be able to open them again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen swept his gaze over the crowd, and his heart sank slightly. He had still underestimated the power of the seven prefectures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There had to be at least thousands of Chosen-level experts present amongst the crowd. As for experts on the same level as Han Tianfeng, there were over a hundred of them.</span></p>
