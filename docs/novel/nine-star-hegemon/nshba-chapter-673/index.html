<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen turned and saw five people walk in. What startled Long Chen was that these people were all wearing red robes. That red was the kind of red that looked like blood. An image of a fierce fiend was embroidered on their chests.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Corrupt path.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen immediately recalled that this was Pill Yang Prefecture, and it was considered neutral territory. As long as they didn’t intentionally cause trouble for the other, the Righteous and Corrupt paths wouldn’t fight here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the curious thing was that out of these five people, two of them had the aura of the Heavenly Daos around them. There were actually two Celestials.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The words just now had come from one of those Celestials. He was clearly trying to find trouble for the three of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without even thinking, it was obvious these people were participating in the ceremony of Huo Wufang marrying his concubine.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This grand ceremony was something the Huo family was holding to tell people it was time to bring gifts.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for these people, considering how arrogant they were acting, they definitely had received the Huo family’s support and had intentionally come here to cause trouble for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the Fang and Chai families were part of the Pill Tower, the selling of pills was still controlled by the Huo family. Their two families had no direct contact with the buyers, which was why these Corrupt experts dared to do this. To put it simply, they were simply currying favor with the Huo family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fang Chang and Chai Liehuo were just about to furiously retort when Long Chen stood up with a faint smile and walked over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who was it that just farted?” asked Long Chen, looking as if someone needed a spanking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of the Celestials glanced at Long Chen and disdainfully said, “Who do you think you are? Fuck off-”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he could say more, Long Chen’s hand viciously slapped across his face. This time Long Chen hadn’t held back at all. These people weren’t alchemists, so their physical bodies were strong enough that he didn’t have any misgivings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BOOM! An explosive sound shook everyone’s eardrums. It was something possible to hear within several miles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Let alone the fact that he hadn’t had any defenses up, even if he had guarded, at such a distance, he still wouldn’t have been able to dodge. He was like a shooting star, piercing through the window and flying into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, the Celestial ended up flying dozens of miles away, and he crashed into Huo Wufang’s newly constructed manor. The collision directly destroyed the entire building.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chai Liehuo and Fang Chang were shocked. Just what kind of monster was Long San? If he possessed such terrifying strength, was he even an alchemist?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You-” The other Celestial was the first to recover from his shock, and he smashed his fist at Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But just as he punched, Long Chen had already slapped him across the face. He staggered back, and his punch ended up striking one of his own people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That person let out a scream as his bones broke. The Celestial hadn’t even realized what had happened when Long Chen once more slapped him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time he hit him in the other direction and with greater power. He spun through the air. He had barely stabilized himself when he saw a sinister face winking at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was horrified. Having been slapped twice, he knew he had run into an expert. He was just about to retreat to widen the distance before attacking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where do you think you’re going? Get back here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had only just moved when he felt two hands grab his hair. Long Chen pulled, at the same time raising his knee, smashing it against the Corrupt Celestial’s high and lofty nose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sound of bones breaking rang out throughout the hall. Chai Liehuo and Fang Chang both winced. They all sympathized with this pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The nose was an extremely weak spot. It was where countless nerves connected. After this attack, the Celestial’s face had caved in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fuck, fuck, fuck, who let you be a dog?!” With each word, Long Chen would punctuate it by slamming his knee into the Celestial’s nose again. The Celestial’s blood, snot, and tears were flowing down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Get lost!” With a furious roar, he struggled free. But as a result, because of Long Chen’s hold on his hair, a large swath of his scalp was torn off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He endured the pain to escape. His head was covered with blood, and he was just about to attack when a silent kick struck him in the crotch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For a moment, everyone was silent. The only sound was the sound of balls breaking. That sound resounded heavily through the air. Fang Chang and Chai Liehuo involuntarily clenched their legs, trying to not let their balls feel distressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Celestial held his lower parts. He slowly knelt on the ground and then collapsed. This attack had hit his most vital part, and he was in so much pain that he hovered between life and death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Long Chen directly slapped the two other Corrupt experts who were still stunned by the scene before them. He sent them flying on the same path as the first Celestial, and they smashed into Huo Wufang’s newly destroyed manor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the final Corrupt member who had been struck half-dead by the first Celestial accidentally, Long Chen was too lazy to bother him. He arrived in front of the unconscious Celestial and kicked him a few times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“AHH!” The unconscious Celestial immediately let out miserable shrieks, but a kick to his jaw cut off that sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen dragged that person like a dead dog, dropping him in front of the table and then using him as a chair. But this chair was a bit uneven, so he pushed down a bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This push caused the Celestial’s entire body to twitch, and froth came out of his mouth. Seeing this scene, the three women were pale as paper, unable to make a sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were also Xiantian experts. Although they were unable to sense this person’s Heavenly Dao energy, they sensed a terrifying pressure from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But this terrifying figure had been beaten into a dead dog-like state by Long Chen, and was then used as a chair. They had never seen such a terrifying fiend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Fang, brother Chai, let’s continue drinking.” Long Chen raised his cup toward the two stupefied fellows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only now did they recover from their shock and drink with him. Chai Liehuo asked, “Long San, how are you so strong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, I won’t hide anything from my two big bros. I, Long San, have had a life full of trouble and misfortune. My road was full of bumps, and I’m always surrounded by all kinds of brutes. If I didn’t kill them, they would kill me. I also had no one to help me. So if I wanted to live, I had to make myself more vicious, and so I trained a body of brute strength. To tell the truth, anyone who sees me fight would never believe that I know alchemy,” laughed Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fang Chang and Chai Liehuo were speechless. That last statement was too true. Even having personally seen him refine pills, they could barely believe he was an alchemist now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fang Chang said, “Long San, you really are a monster. You know alchemy, and you know martial arts. Dual martial-pill cultivation is a path of no return, but you have actually reached this level. That really is amazing. However, this fellow is a Celestial. The only reason you managed to get an advantage over him was because he didn’t have time to use the Cry of the Heavenly Daos. In the future, you have to be careful!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who cares if he is a Celestial? As long as it’s someone Huo Wufang sent to target you two big bros, I’ll go all-out against them. Fuck, if they want to bully you, they’ll have to do it over my corpse.” Long Chen patted himself on the chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chai Liehuo and Fang Chang were incredibly moved, their eyes almost filling up with tears. This Long San was so loyal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You bastard Long San, hand him over!” Suddenly, a furious roar came from outside. They looked outside to see Huo Wufang furiously glaring at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As expected, these people were sent by you as a provocation. Your person is in my hands, so if you want him, come fight over him.” After saying that, Long Chen pulled the Celestial out from under him. Carrying him by his foot, he shook him outside the window a few times. The Celestial was completely unconscious and simply dangled like a corpse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other Celestial that Long Chen had sent flying was standing beside Huo Wufang. Seeing this, he wanted to immediately charge up and tear Long Chen to pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey, little fellow, what are you staring at me for? You still refuse to obey, right?” raged Long Chen. He raised the unconscious Celestial out of the window and slapped him in the face a dozen times, causing his face to swell. He then disdainfully pointed at the Celestial on the ground. “Little fellow, do you want to keep looking at me like that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Celestial had practically gone insane from rage. He was just about to charge forward when Huo Wufang stopped him. “This isn’t a good place to fight. It’s too small, and Long San’s body is extremely powerful. If you don’t use your full strength, you won’t be able to subdue him. Furthermore, he also has Chai Liehuo and Fang Chang beside him, and you can’t injure them. We can’t rush this matter recklessly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, this was the treasure tower region. It was filled with buildings and people. If they fought here, there would be many casualties. The Pill Emperor Competition was currently being held, and if the higher-ups were to learn of this, they would all be doomed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long San, what do you want to release him? Could it be that you’re a petty little person who only knows how to threaten others to raise your status? If that’s the case, then I really will have to look down on you,” said Huo Wufang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His answer was sixteen slaps in the face. Of course, the face that was being slapped was the unconscious Celestial. His face once more swelled, looking like a balloon that might burst at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Idiot, do you think I’m someone scared by insults? Why don’t you keep trying such a childish move?” retorted Long Chen disdainfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother, if this continues, senior apprentice-brother Yaoqi will be killed,” said the Celestial.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shut up. Aren’t I trying to think of something right now?! This Long San is someone unmoved by force or persuasion,” raged Huo Wufang. He hated when others pushed him and already had a stomach full of fury. He had wanted them to bully Long San, perhaps by humiliating him or beating him. That would have been a blow to the Fang and Chai families’ morale. But as a result, this matter had turned to its current state. He was already incredibly furious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long San, what do you want?!” shouted Huo Wufang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can release him if you want. I just want one thing. If you can bring it out, I’ll immediately release him.” A certain thought popped into Long Chen’s head.</span></p>
