From the intense tremors, he could tell the Barbaric Wind Beast was currently chasing someone and heading in his direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cruel sneer appeared on his face. He wanted to see just who dared use him as a tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, he heard a noise coming from the other side of the mountain valley. He hesitated about whether or not he should sneak over to look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BOOM!</span></p>

It happened so quickly and out of nowhere, that he didn’t even have time to raise any defenses. A large portion of the mountain slammed into him from above, causing him to vomit a mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A pity it was slightly slanted.” Long Chen’s divine sense had seen it extremely clearly. If the Barbaric Wind Beast’s attack had been just a few meters lower, Han Tianfeng would have been instantly killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the mountain valley in front of him pierced through, Long Chen shot through the opening without hesitation.</span></p>

Now adding on Long Chen’s intentional blow with his foot, his injuries were exacerbated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, as a top expert, despite being buried under the rubble, his divine sense still locked onto Long Chen.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This fucker!” Han Tianfeng shook with fury. How could he, a grand Chosen, have ever endured such frustration? How could he not tell that Long Chen’s kick to the ground was intentional?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his fury, he recklessly charged out of the rubble and stuck out his head, just happening to see Long Chen’s figure disappear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Monastery robes!” Han Tianfeng ground his teeth. He had recognized the robes, but the mark of the monastery number was on the front, and he couldn’t see it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So he had actually been used by a monastery disciple?! He was about to go berserk. There was actually someone in the monastery who would treat him like this?!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BOOM!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he dizzily stuck his head out of the ground again, he felt as if all his bones had been broken. He vaguely managed to see the Barbaric Wind Beast’s huge figure wildly rushing out of his vision range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“AHH!!! Intolerable!” Han Tianfeng clenched his teeth furiously. Previously he had been stepped on by Long Chen, and now he had even been viciously stepped on by the Barbaric Wind Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he didn’t know that this Barbaric Wind Beast had already reached full maturity, and there was no way to tame it, he would have thought those two had purposely worked together to humiliate him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bastard! I won’t let you off like this! I’ll definitely find who you are, and when I do, I’ll tear you apart!” Han Tianfeng viciously swore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Tianfeng began to follow in the direction Long Chen had left. He chased for over a hundred miles when he heard a distant rumbling that was quickly approaching him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They’re returning? Hmph, are you going to let me see who you are this time?” Han Tianfeng looked around and saw a good place to hide himself behind a boulder. He hid and waited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he was disappointed to see that whoever it was that was fleeing from the Barbaric Wind Beast wouldn’t pass through here. Their path was two mountains over, and he didn’t dare go over to look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he appeared himself, then that might very well draw the Barbaric Wind Beast’s fury. Just as he was hesitating about whether or not to switch locations, the ground trembled, and he was delighted to see that this time, that fleeing person was getting closer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was definitely getting closer. Much, much closer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BOOM!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mountain beside Han Tianfeng once more exploded. Before he had even realized what was going on, he was buried, but this time his injury was even more severe, and he vomited three mouthfuls of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Tianfeng once more vomited out a mouthful of blood. But before he could even get angry, an even greater pressure descended from above, and he felt as if his body might explode.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hastily circulating his spiritual qi, he stubbornly withstood the pressure, feeling as if he might instead explode with rage. This time was the exact same as last time, except now his injuries were even worse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crawling out of the ground, he noticed that the two of them had already disappeared before he could get a glimpse of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You goddamn bastards, just wait for me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Angry veins bulged across his forehead. However, he still maintained his reasoning and didn’t go chase after them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is that bastard doing this intentionally?” Doing his best to suppress his rage, he calmed himself down to consider what had happened. This was definitely too coincidental. “This bastard very likely possesses some unknown way to track down my location. Tch, I can’t continue like this. I should first go back to those wind spirit stones.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Tianfeng absolutely refused to believe that Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength was powerful enough to cover such a huge distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He also refused to believe a disciple’s Spiritual Strength could reach the level that even he was unable to sense it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So he assumed Long Chen must possess some sort of treasure on him that was allowing him to keep track of the surroundings, which was also why he would dare enter the Misty Mountain Valleys.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once he thought of all that, he calmed down greatly. He no longer bothered trying to figure out who that person was. As long as they didn’t die, he would find out their identity sooner or later. The Wind Spirit Crystal was more important. Consuming a healing pill, he began rushing back to that place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen had brought the Barbaric Wind Beast to attack Han Tianfeng twice, but its attacks had missed him, causing Long Chen to sigh regretfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, he cursed the Barbaric Wind Beast for not being accurate enough. However, that was not something he could control. He could only continue running.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In truth, the Barbaric Wind Beast’s top speed was definitely greater than his. However, these mountain valleys criss-crossed like a maze, and there was no way for it to release its full speed. All it could do was furiously roar and continue chasing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? As the saying goes, if you worry about something, it’ll happen. That little fellow is actually going back. Tch, I’m working so hard, yet this fellow’s being lazy. My treasures aren’t so easily taken by others. You’ll have to come and do some work with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen started rushing back to that mountain of wind spirit stones. This time, Long Chen was essentially going in a straight line because the Barbaric Wind Beast’s attacks had already destroyed the original mountains.</span></p>

The two of them were like two bolts of lightning returning to their original location.</span></p>

Seeing that the top portion of it was gone, he was both shocked and infuriated.</span></p>

If he gathered them all, he would instantly become the richest disciple of all the monasteries.</span></p>

The market price was around three ordinary spirit stones for one wind spirit stone. Furthermore, wind spirit stones rarely ever went on the market.</span></p>

With that kind of wealth, who could possibly compare to him in terms of money?</span></p>

Die!” Han Tianfeng was both startled and infuriated to see that this fellow was extremely crafty. He had torn off the marking representing which monastery he came from.</span></p>

Furthermore, the most hateful thing about him was that he was wearing a mask to conceal who he was.</span></p>

Thinking of everything he had experienced because of this fellow, Han Tianfeng’s hair was standing on end from anger. A dirt-yellow spear appeared in his hands and he stabbed it at Long Chen.</span></p>

Even the space around it seemed as if it might explode in the face of the spear’s pressure.</span></p>

Long Chen’s hammer was instantly sent flying, disappearing from sight.</span></p>

The reason he had sent his hammer flying wasn’t because he was stronger, but intentional. All his energy had been spent on sending that hammer flying, and now this unknown fellow had arrived right in front of him. A ball of violet lightning appeared in Long Chen’s hand.</span></p>
