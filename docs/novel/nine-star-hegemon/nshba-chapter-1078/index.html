 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The so-called hell said in stories is just a name. In reality, it is a spatial crevice between two worlds. It is the crossing zone between the Martial Heaven Continent and the Netherworld. Some creatures that die will have their souls drawn into the Netherworld-” The Xuan Master suddenly shut his mouth when he reached this point. “I can’t tell you too much right now. With your current power, touching the Heavenly Daos too early will draw karma for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen’s heart shook. The Netherworld? Wasn’t that a place of stories, where souls went after a person died?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The devil beasts you fight in the Infernal Devil Abyss are lifeforms that exist in the crevice between two worlds. The Martial Heaven Continent actually has countless spatial channels. The various large powers are all guarding those channels secretly. So although this world seems very peaceful, in reality, there is a great deal of internal trouble and external enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fortunately, the devil beasts that come from there have a trace of yuan spiritual energy in their crystal cores. We can purify them to help Foundation Forging disciples cultivate. Once you kill the devil beasts, people will come to clean up the battlefield and gather their crystal cores. They’ll give them to the sect to be refined, and a portion of them will be available for sale to Foundation Forging disciples, while a portion will be put out for sale to other sects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It can be said that defending the Infernal Devil Abyss has its drawbacks and advantages. It is a responsibility and a burden, but also good work.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Disciple understands. Xuan Master, can disciple brazenly ask you something?” said Long Chen after a long moment of hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“For even you to say that it’s brazen, it seems it must not be small. Ask,” said the Xuan Master, involuntarily laughing. For Long Chen to say he was about to do something brazen was almost a joke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen couldn’t help being embarrassed. But he thickened his skin and said, “Forgive disciple for his rudeness, but I want to know, if someone covets my secrets in the Dao Sect, will you, the Xuan Master, come out and protect me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he didn’t know what this Xuan Master was thinking, he could sense his good intentions. The Nine Star Hegemon Body Art definitely wouldn’t make such a mistake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, even if he had good intentions, Long Chen needed a promise from him. Otherwise, he would have no confidence in an existence that he couldn’t comprehend. People like him schemed so deeply. Long Chen was too lazy to do the same thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Xuan Master smiled. “Don’t worry, as long as the Dao Sect is within your heart and you don’t betray the sect, then let alone someone in the Xuantian Dao Sect, even if someone in the Martial Heaven Continent dares to touch you, I will help.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Many thanks, Xuan Master.” Long Chen was delighted, and he respectfully bowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For the Xuan Master to say that he would personally help meant that even if the Xuantian Dao Sect was unable to help him in name due to its politics, the Xuan Master himself would come out. That was what made him the most grateful, as well as what raised his confidence the most.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the thing that had made him the happiest since arriving in the Central Plains. He immediately felt much more assured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xuan Master, I have two brothers and a lover…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They are still in the Xuantian Catalog comprehending their Dao-paths. The Xuantian Catalog is actually a transformed portion of the Heavenly Daos. A person will only get one chance to comprehend the Xuantian Catalog in their lifetime. They are searching for their own inheritances within the Xuantian Catalog. It is an immense opportunity, but once they come out, they won’t be able to go back in. Most people are unable to enter the actual catalog when comprehending it, but you repeatedly entered over and over. Now, your fate with it has come to an end. It’s not that I don’t want to allow you to enter again, but that you can’t,” explained the Xuan Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only now did Long Chen understand that things in the Xuantian Catalog weren’t as simple as he had thought. He couldn’t help but feel regretful that he hadn’t obtained any lightning inheritance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that there was nothing more to ask, he bid farewell to the Xuan Master and left. When he left his door, he realized he was in the inner sect plaza. He didn’t even know where the Xuan Master’s private room was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he appeared in the plaza, all the people there jumped in fright. Long Chen ignored those people and returned directly to Crouching Dragon Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once he was there, all of Crouching Dragon Mountain erupted into wild cheering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only then did Long Chen learn that the Dragonblood Legion had taken first place in the competition. Each ninth rank devil beast was equivalent to ten million points, which shocked Long Chen. The ninth rank devil beasts he had killed had added up to four hundred million points. Adding on the devil beasts slain by others, they almost reached six hundred million and placed first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Second place was the Heaven Female Alliance. They had half their number of points. The reason they had taken second was all because of Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had killed quite a few of the top experts of the Flame Gate, Divine Beast Mansion, and Hegemon Hall. Once they were killed, the points they had earned were gone as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Third place was the Ten Thousand Insect Guild. Fourth was the Divine Beast Mansion, fifth was the Hegemon Hall, and last was the Flame Gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Flame Gate’s leader, Que Xinyan, had been killed by Long Chen. The Flame Gate had disbanded, which caused all its disciples to be dumbfounded. They didn’t know what to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Other than the Dragonblood Legion, Heaven Female Alliance, and Ten Thousand Insect Guild, everyone else was full of worry. This time, Long Chen had been too vicious. He had completely crippled the other three factions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, the Dragonblood Legion’s name was soaring, and Long Chen’s name shook the entire Xuantian Dao Sect. Countless people had heard of how he had repeatedly killed six rank five Celestials on the battlefield, but they didn’t dare to believe it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But after accumulating a mass of proof, they were forced to believe it. Now that Long Chen had returned to Crouching Dragon Mountain after ten days, it caused an uproar in the entire sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Hua Shiyu and Wang Zhen came over to celebrate. Hua Shiyu also brought her sincere thanks. If it hadn’t been for the Dragonblood Legion’s help, her Heaven Female Alliance’s losses would have been even more appalling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Hua Shiyu led her Heaven Female Alliance to Crouching Dragon Mountain, it evoked passionate cheering from the Dragonblood Legion. The Heaven Female Alliance received the warmest welcome possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen had Guo Ran arrange a grand bonfire party, and he also had Wang Zhen call over his disciples for the fun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Zhen was a man of few words, but he actually wasn’t antisocial. He directly brought all his people over to party.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had so many points that they bought all the best wine and food. In the Xuantian Dao Sect, as long as you had points, you could get anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tens of thousands of men and women drank and ate, laughed and talked. It was exceptionally lively. They were no longer as foreign or cold as when they had first joined the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen, I…” Hua Shiyu was profoundly grateful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I like to be straightforward, so you don’t need to keep thanking me.” Long Chen knew what she was about to say. “The Dragonblood Legion’s warriors do what they want. Even if the same thing happened again, even if they knew the results, they would make the same choice. So you don’t need to feel bad. Their choice was right, and even if they fell, they’ve passed their aspirations and dreams to their living brothers. We’ll bring their dreams forward for them.” Long Chen offered a bowl of wine to Hua Shiyu while raising one of his own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hua Shiyu nodded. But she hesitated for a long while when she looked at that wine. In the end, she took a sip, and as a result, her face immediately turned red. She clearly had no alcohol tolerance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Long, let me offer you a bowl as well. I, Wang Zhen, have never admired anyone, but when it comes to you, I can’t not admire you.” Wang Zhen also raised his cup.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Drink, drink!” Long Chen touched his bowl to Wang Zhen’s. This wine contained great medicinal energy. It was a kind of medicinal wine, and the best kind at that. It was greatly beneficial to cultivators, and it cost a hundred points just for one bottle. If they weren’t rich, no one could afford to drink it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Wang Zhen, you’re too modest. If you went all-out, then perhaps there would be no one amongst all the disciples capable of beating you,” said Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Zhen was startled. “Brother Long, what are you talking about?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen smiled. “Although I’m not an insect cultivator, I know the small insects you’ve summoned are just the troops. Your true trump card should be the mother insect you’re raising. We’ve all exposed our trump cards, but you’ve never revealed yours. That means you’re the strongest amongst us. Due to this, let me offer you another drink!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hua Shiyu was startled. She hadn’t even thought of that. But as soon as Long Chen said it, she looked from Wang Zhen in shock, to Long Chen with admiration. Wang Zhen had truly hidden himself well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Long, you must not know this. While I do have a mother insect, I cannot use it until the point of no return. The mother insect is something I raised from the moment it was born, and it is connected to my soul. Although it is powerful, once injured, I will also have to pay a great price. Most importantly, if it dies, I would die with it. Although I have this trump card, I can’t use it, so it’s no different from not having a trump card.” Wang Zhen bitterly smiled.</span></p>

After this night of drinking, the three factions’ experts had formed much better relationships.</span></p>
