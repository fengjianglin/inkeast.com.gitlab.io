 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen stood in the air, looking into the distance while extending his divine sense slowly. In a place his eyesight was unable to reach, he saw a huge black hole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was tens of thousands of miles wide. Around it, the sky had spiderweb cracks extending out, like a frozen lake that had been smashed with a stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spatial cracks continuously formed around it, radiating outward. There were also orderly divine runes constantly working to repair those cracks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the hole possessed some kind of mysterious energy that was resisting, and the void was constantly being ripped apart and healed, and then ripped apart and healed. There were two energies fighting, both of which transcended human comprehension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless devil beasts were wildly charging out of the huge hole. Long Chen noticed that the weaker devil beasts found it easier to pass through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, the stronger devil beasts looked like they were being trapped. Ninth rank devil beasts looked as if they were being suppressed by some kind of energy from the world when they passed through the channel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During the process of crossing over, their bodies would emit white smoke, and they let out pained howls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So that’s what it was. These devil beasts are creatures from outside this world. When they come to the Martial Heaven Continent, they are suppressed by the world’s laws. Their power is greatly reduced. No wonder I felt like they weren’t as strong as the ninth rank sea demons I fought in the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen came to a sudden realization. This had been a source of confusement for him. If they were called ninth rank devil beasts, they should have been on the same level as ninth rank Magical Beasts and sea demons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen shook his head and retracted his divine sense. Doing such a distant probing made him feel a wave of exhaustion in his soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That channel was hundreds of thousands of miles from here. That was the absolute limit of his divine sense, and just maintaining it for a few breaths exhausted a significant amount of his soul energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Xuan Master said that the devil beasts come from hell, but not the hell that people know. Instead, this hell is the crevice between the Netherworld and the Martial Heaven Continent. Ugh, the higher my cultivation base, the less I understand the world. I just feel more and more miniscule,” sighed Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He took a deep breath and continued examining the depths of the battlefield. A cold smile quickly appeared on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Up ahead, somewhere they couldn’t see, there were huge earthen walls that slanted toward them. The devil beasts charging through the spatial channel would naturally detour along the earthen walls once they encountered them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The earthen walls led them over in this direction, and looking on the other side, he saw another defensive wall. Seeing Hu Guishan and the others on it, Long Chen was infuriated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He directly took out a photographic jade and recorded everything he saw. Gao Xianyang was too despicable. Not only had he arranged for Long Chen to defend a place with more devil beasts, but he was also guiding the majority of the devil beasts that should have been going to Hu Guishan’s side toward him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, Long Chen was able to activate photographic jades inside the primal chaos space. That meant that it recorded whatever he saw. Otherwise, he would only be able to accept this. That was because otherwise, once the battle was over, they would erase all the evidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you want to play with me, I’ll play you to death,” swore Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As time passed, more devil beasts appeared. The Dragonblood Legion had completely gotten used to killing ninth rank devil beasts. The devil beasts were killed one by one, multiplying their confidence and increasing their cooperation skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most importantly, with the healing disciples present, they weren’t the slightest bit worried about being injured. They could go all-out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the healing disciples, they quickly adapted to the battlefield. Any time one of the Dragonblood Legion’s disciples was injured, they would wave the wooden staff in their hands. Through the wooden staff, their wood spiritual energy was able to heal others at a long distance. It was quick and effective. The Dragonblood warriors, who had never experienced such treatment, were absolutely delighted. The protection of these healers was definitely a blessing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This ability was only possible due to how much money Long Chen had spent on them. Now that they were on the battlefield, it showed just how good it was to be rich and have the best equipment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other faction’s healing disciples needed to run to the front and heal people personally, and the efficiency of their healing could not be compared to the Dragonblood Legion’s healers with their equipment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Currently, the Dragonblood Legion’s warriors were in groups of nine. They were able to easily kill low rank devil beasts, and when ninth rank devil beasts appeared, the nine of them would work together, and in just a few breaths, they would be able to kill it. As long as nothing unexpected happened, none of them would even be injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, because they knew they had the protection of the healing disciples, they began to feel even more at ease and their attacks became more precise. Their power was used completely on offense. Their killing efficiency rose just from that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heaven Female Alliance and Ten Thousand Insect Guild also tried this. Hua Shiyu and Wang Zhen would occasionally allow a ninth rank devil beast to pass so that their disciples could try killing them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to the Dragonblood Legion, for them to kill ninth rank devil beasts was more difficult. In fact, two disciples were killed in the panic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But after trying it several times, they managed to bring the first one down. After killing one, their confidence rose. However, the people capable of killing ninth rank devil beasts were not very high in number.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Later, the two factions changed their formations, with their stronger disciples in charge of the ninth rank devil beasts and the weaker disciples in charge of the seventh and eighth rank devil beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the support disciples, they were to prioritize the disciples fighting the ninth rank devil beasts. It was more effective that way, with the strong against the strong and the weak against the weak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not all factions could be like the Dragonblood Legion and have a relatively balanced overall combat strength. The Dragonblood Legion’s battle style didn’t suit them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BOOM!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The earth shook. Long Chen hastily looked into the distance and saw that the sky had suddenly darkened. The dusky sky had become the black of night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That huge black hole in the distance suddenly expanded, and it was possible to see it with the naked eye from their current position now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Everyone, prepare yourself. A huge sum of points is about to arrive!” shouted Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within that huge channel, countless devil beasts were pouring out like a flood. Their numbers had multiplied, and the number of ninth rank devil beasts had also increased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In half an incense stick’s worth of time, that flood of devil beasts arrived in front of the Dragonblood Legion. Hua Shiyu and Wang Zhen’s expressions changed slightly. There were too many devil beasts now, especially ninth rank ones. They were unable to kill them all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Li Qi, Mingyuan, provide assistance for our allies. Zifeng, why don’t you go forward and make a name for yourself,” said Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing Long Chen’s orders, Li Qi and Song Mingyuan, who had long since been thirsty to get started, split up, going toward the Heaven Female Alliance and the Ten Thousand Insect Guild. They formed hand seals and then clapped their hands on the ground, shouting at the same time, “Exploding Rock Spears!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ground trembled, and countless sharp spears shot out of the ground, stabbing through the devil beasts. Then the yellow runes covering the rock spears exploded, blowing apart the devil beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In one attack, they swept away all the enemies within dozens of miles. Even ninth rank devil beasts were killed with this move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Earthen Thorn Formation!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them once more shouted, and something similar to brambles grew out of the ground, protecting the outer edges of the two factions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The devil beasts would be mangled and lacerated when they crashed onto the brambles. However, they seemed to have no sense of pain, and even when turned into such a bloody state, they continued to crash forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the brambles were tough, slowing their speed. By the time they reached the first line of disciples, much of their flesh stayed behind on the brambles. Even ordinary disciples could easily kill them with an attack. In fact, many of them died within the brambles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even a ninth rank devil beast would be badly mangled after charging through the brambles, and several disciples working together could kill it very easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the brambles were covered by corpses, the two of them would circulate their earth energy, blowing the corpses apart. They then once more summoned a new wave of brambles. With the two of them helping, the two factions instantly had it much easier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time as Li Qi and Song Mingyuan took action, Yue Zifeng also attacked. His attack allowed everyone to see the terror of sword cultivators. His attack was proof of why sword cultivators were called the number one attackers amongst cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a slash of his sword and a flash of Sword Qi, any devil beasts, even ninth rank devil beasts, were killed in waves. All of them split apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Yue Zifeng sent an attack at a ninth rank devil beast, his Sword Qi was so powerful that at the same time as it killed the ninth rank devil beast, all the devil beasts in a line dozens of miles long were killed as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once, a single wave of his sword instantly killed four ninth rank devil beasts in a line.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It almost looked like someone was in a rice paddy, brandishing his blade. But instead of rice, he was harvesting devil beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yue Zifeng is getting stronger and stronger,” praised Long Chen. Yue Zifeng was walking even further on the Sword Dao. Right now, he was just using ordinary attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hua Shiyu and Wang Zhen were filled with shock, but they were also grateful to Long Chen. Gu Yang, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan were all intentionally allowing ninth rank devil beasts to get by in an injured state. The three of them were essentially giving those points to their disciples. That magnanimity was truly convincing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen hadn’t even ordered them to do that. This was simply the style of the Dragonblood Legion. They never took advantage of others, and when they helped people, they helped them fully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More and more devil beasts appeared, but it only made the disciples more excited. The kill points on their bracelets were constantly climbing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those fortunate enough to kill a ninth rank devil beast would instantly get a million points. Although in the end they would have to distribute those evenly, it still made them incredibly excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time trickled by in their nervous and excited states. One hour, two hours, three hours…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A whole day and night passed, but the devil beasts didn’t slow down. Their numbers continued to increase, until finally, Yue Zifeng’s attack landed on a certain ninth rank devil beast’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A large cut appeared in the devil beast’s body, but it wasn’t fatal, startling Yue Zifeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It roared, and opening its mouth, a black light suddenly shot toward the Dragonblood Legion. Yue Zifeng’s expression drastically changed.</span></p>
