<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sorry, but our Huayun auction houses have a responsibility to keep the identities of our sellers confidential for their own safety. Please forgive me for not being able to answer you!” said Yao Niming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On one hand, they truly did have a responsibility to keep it confidential. But on the other hand, Yao Niming really did not know just who had sold this divine soil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zheng Wenlong had merely handed it to him and said it was from a mysterious client. Since it was given to him by Zheng Wenlong, then it meant Zheng Wenlong was sure it came from a clean origin. He hadn’t asked any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Keep it confidential for their safety? That person definitely has to be an enemy of my Yin family and was intentionally trying to harm us! If you refuse to answer-”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then you’ll raze down my auction house? Alright, please go ahead. I welcome you to raze it down at any time,” sneered Yao Niming. He directly ignored them, pulling Yao Niqian back into the auction house.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spectators also sneered inside. This elder from the Yin family was definitely used to using his status to suppress others. But he should first be aware of who his target was. The Huayun Sect was an enormous existence that even dared to challenge the Pill Tower. For them to open their mouths to say they would raze down their auction house, they really had to want to die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They weren’t polite because they were afraid of you. They were polite because they had professional integrity. Now the Yin family had truly done it. With the Huayun Sect ignoring them, it was like they had just slapped themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brave warriors from the Yin family, don’t be afraid. Raze down their auction house. I’m very optimistic for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right, that’s right. Look at how many people you have? If you just left things like this, wouldn’t you have just turned into a bunch of little turtles? What would happen to the face of the Yin family?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go on. Hot-blooded heroes, use your fists to smash their entrance. Let us see just how amazing an ancient family is. I’m cheering for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people cried out, trying to incite the Yin family’s people to attack. Of course, they didn’t dare reveal themselves and simply shouted from the shadows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a typical case of bystanders not being afraid of seeing a big mess. Furthermore, they had long since grown tired of the Yin family’s arrogant manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elder’s expression was cold, and he had an urge to kill, but he also didn’t dare to do so. In the end, he brought his people away with a gloomy expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Damn, no way? He’s this cowardly?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He came so ferociously, but now he’s leaving so hurriedly. What a weakling.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spectators were disappointed. The good show they had anticipated had ended like this. Most disappointing of all, they weren’t going towards Mo Gate but outside the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait, isn’t that direction where that mysterious power is located?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? Is the Yin family about to join hands with that power to target the Mo family? Then that really would be dangerous for the Mo family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That really is possible. Long Chen killed Yin Wushang’s clone. I heard that completely ruined his plan of advancing to a rank two Celestial. Their enmity is now set in stone. Now that Long Chen is hiding in Mo Gate, the Yin family has to break through Mo Gate to kill him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Mo family is probably doomed this time around. But it really is curious. From the start, they’ve ignored everything happening, minding their own business as if they’re not nervous at all. It’s impossible to tell what they’re thinking.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The power targeting the Mo family had finally revealed its face in the battle at Hidden Dragon Abode. But that middle-aged man and his group of experts were truly mysterious, and they hadn’t fought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, there were people who guessed they were definitely on the level of an ancient family, or they wouldn’t have been able to work with Yin Wushang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If that guess was correct, then in the face of two ancient families, the Mo family would definitely be destroyed. There was no suspense at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the calmness that Mo Gate was displaying was truly unfathomable. Most importantly, the Mo family still had yet to go out and ask for help from anyone. They were completely silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Prefecture had already begun to become chaotic. Following the destruction of the three great powers, Mo Gate had become the sole ruler.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But now Mo Gate was being threatened by two other powers. Quite a few outer powers saw the opportunity to stretch their hands toward Qing Prefecture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were even some powers that slowly began annexing the businesses left behind by the three great powers. That was clearly a provocation to Mo Gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Mo Gate still didn’t react. In fact, some powers forcibly seized some small parts of their territory, and Mo Gate still didn’t make a sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a result, the things the three great powers left behind became a complete mess, as many smaller powers tried to absorb them. In fact, some even looked like they might reach the same power level as those three great powers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were all just waiting for their chance. Once Mo Gate was destroyed, they would instantly enlarge their territories. They weren’t thinking of becoming the ruler of Qing Prefecture. They were just hoping to get as many benefits as possible before the new ruler was established.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once the Yin family’s experts left, the others also scattered. Qingzhou City became deathly silent. It was filled with the feeling of the calm before the storm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Today, Long Chen’s mood was very good. As soon as he left his seclusion, he heard a piece of news that raised his spirits. The Yin family’s fruit trees had begun to wither.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything was going as expected. The Yin family’s people were truly too greedy. Did they not understand the concept of not putting all your eggs in one basket?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That divine soil might have allowed them to produce a great deal of Meridian Opening Spirit Cliff Fruits, but that was no different from killing the chicken to get the eggs. Now the Yin family had truly been given a grievous blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With their lifeline severed, with no further income, the Yin family was definitely acting like ants in a hot pot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, what excited him even more was that after eating a ridiculous number of pills, the Life Fate Star had finally reached perfection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That meant he could finally summon the Three Star Battle Armor. Then the effect of the Heavenly Dao Suppression would reduce even further. With the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, Celestials were unable to suppress Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young master Long Chen, the Immortal Intoxication Pavilion’s Zi Yan sent you a gift.” One of Mo Gate’s guards respectfully handed Long Chen an embroidered case along with a letter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zi Yan?” Long Chen was startled. Why would she send anything to him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Opening the case, he saw a photographic jade. There was nothing else. Opening the letter, he saw a single line of graceful words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Our meeting in the mortal world was like a dream. I played my first song to listen to your heart. Now that I’m returning to my world, I leave this song to calm your soul," read Mo Nian. "Damn, is this a love letter?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you a ghost? When did you get here?” Long Chen saw that at some unknown point, Mo Nian had appeared behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, Long Chen, how skillful. That Zi Yan actually wrote you a love letter. Hurry, let’s see what’s inside that photographic jade!” said Mo Nian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Well, she left this just for me. I don’t think you- fuck, how are you so fast!” Long Chen had only gotten half his words out before Mo Nian activated the photographic jade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An image appeared in front of them. Within that image was a white-robed woman sitting beside a zither. She appeared extremely noble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Willowy eyebrows, eyes like autumn water, and skin like jade. She was like a sacred goddess, noble and grand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This… this is Zi Yan? How beautiful!” exclaimed Mo Nian with wide eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen’s heart also shook. This woman had to be Zi Yan. That kind of mannerism was something only she possessed. But this time, she had taken off her veil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, her lithe fingers gently plucked the zither’s strings. A sound like immortal music floated out, one that penetrated deeply into the heart and cleansed the soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following the music, Long Chen felt as if he had forgotten all his fury. His heart became calm and peaceful, no joy or worries, no fear or anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was like a pair of soft hands were gently comforting his heart. It made him forget all his vexations, allowing his soul to reach a state of true calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After an unknown amount of time, the image faded. The two of them were still standing there, lost in some mysterious realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah, this Zi Yan really is a goddess-like woman. After listening to this song, I feel like my mental realm has advanced a great deal! Long Chen, you really have some good luck,” said Mo Nian enviously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What good luck? Don’t you understand what she’s saying? She’s already left Qing Prefecture. From now on, we’ll truly be people in two different worlds,” said Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, don’t put this away so fast. Good things should be shared. Let me copy it. Wait, damnit, it’s not possible to copy it!” Mo Nian had taken out a photographic jade and wanted to copy it. But he found that the photographic jade Zi Yan had left was something he had never seen before, and he couldn’t copy it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That made him incredibly vexed. This song was extremely beneficial to a person’s soul. Occasionally listening to it could allow a person’s realm to rapidly advance. It was practically a divine song.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But no matter how thick Mo Nian’s face was, of course he wouldn’t fight with Long Chen over it. That was a gift someone else had given him. He could only watch as Long Chen put it away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen felt a trace of gratitude toward Zi Yan. This photographic jade wasn’t very useful to him, as he walked a different path from other people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and the members of the Dragonblood Legion could all use this song. By listening to this song, their mental realms would surpass their cultivation bases.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seven days later, a piece of news rocked the Qing Prefecture: Yin Wushang’s true body had arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Obviously, Yin Wushang was planning on having a battle with Long Chen. He wanted to kill him as revenge for his clone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Prefecture was in an incredibly tense state. That heavy atmosphere made it hard for people to breathe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Yi sent orders for Mo Nian and Long Chen to not go outside. At the same time, the Mo family’s secluded experts also came out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first time the Mo family entered a true battle state. All their experts were gathered, waiting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What startled Long Chen was that the Mo family actually had over four hundred Xiantian experts. That was an extremely powerful lineup. The curtains to an immense battle were about to be raised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen could sense just how warlike the members of the Mo family were. Even their blood was beginning to heat up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Old ghost Mo Yi, let’s have a decisive battle in front of Scorched Earth Forest! Get the fuck out there!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a shout resounded throughout all of Qingzhou City.</span></p>
