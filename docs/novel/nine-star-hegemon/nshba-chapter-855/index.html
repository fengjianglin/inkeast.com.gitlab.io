 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Long Chen’s solemn expression, Yue Xiaoqian stopped smiling. Suddenly she felt embarrassed and turned away, facing Long Chen with her back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xiaoqian, do you trust me?” Long Chen asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course, otherwise…” Yue Xiaoqian cut herself off, blushing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen’s heart pounded. Her charm was too strong. He took a deep breath and calmed himself. “Then let’s talk seriously about what we can do for each other. I know a bit about your original devil race. Everything I’ve heard about you is negative, but I’m a rather stubborn person and I don’t trust what other people say. I only trust my own senses and intuition. And my intuition says you’re a good person, and Xiao Die was also a good person. Then I am also willing to believe that your original devil race is also full of good people. That is my intuition!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, Long Chen.” Yue Xiaoqian was extremely moved. This was her first time hearing that there was someone in this world willing to trust her original devil race.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“On the other hand, I am full of suspicions of my world. So I want to know everything about the original devil race. Can you tell me?” asked Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yue Xiaoqian looked into Long Chen’s eyes. They seemed full of warmth and sincerity, as if looking into his eyes could allow a person to see into the core of his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since you trust me this much, I’ll tell you a few secrets about my original devil race,” said Yue Xiaoqian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From her story, Long Chen learned that the original devil race was an enormous existence numbering in the tens of millions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The place they lived in was called the Skyscraping World. That was a minor world that one of the original devil race’s supreme ancestors had created.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That minor world was the only place the original devil race could call home. When they entered the Martial Heaven Continent, they would immediately be sensed by the Heavenly Daos, which caused a special phenomenon to manifest around them. They would be hunted down by the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts with their full power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Skyscraping World was not a complete world, and it did not possess a complete set of laws. When they wanted to advance through receiving the baptism of heavenly lightning, they had to go to the Martial Heaven Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To conceal their auras from the Heavenly Daos, they had to gather devil cores. But they were too difficult to find.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Yue Xiaoqian had gathered such a huge amount of devil cores with Long Chen in the Jiuli secret realm, the entire original devil race was excited for a long time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those experts stuck at the peak of their realm could finally stop bitterly waiting for their turn to use the limited devil cores.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That had made the entire original devil race feel profound gratitude to Long Chen. That was why his picture had circulated throughout their race, and if any of their disciples roaming the outer world ran into him when he was in trouble, they were to fight to the death to help him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those devil cores were constructed into special Enchanted items that could conceal their aura. As long as they didn’t release their full power, they wouldn’t be recognized by others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So they had begun stealthily entering the Martial Heaven Continent, gathering the resources they needed. This was the original devil race’s first time in countless years having their disciples roam the Martial Heaven Continent in such numbers. It brought them immense benefits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Previously, they had been in a secluded state. Everything was to be done by themselves, which harshly impacted their ability to grow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, they were finally able to gather more resources from the Martial Heaven Continent, allowing them to rapidly develop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for why the original devil race was the world’s enemy, in truth, Yue Xiaoqian also didn’t know. All she knew was that her mother had told her that once she learned that secret, she would no longer be allowed to leave the Skyscraping World.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Everything really has changed. The original devil race has become the public enemy of the world? Those damn fuckers.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, you…” Long Chen was startled. The silent Eastern Wasteland Bell had suddenly released such a curse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can keep chatting,” said the Eastern Wasteland Bell before becoming silent again. But its voice contained an unconcealable fury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is it, Long Chen?” asked Yue Xiaoqian upon seeing the change in his expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, nothing. Xiaoqian, let’s talk. I want to cooperate with your original devil race,” said Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cooperate?” Yue Xiaoqian didn’t understand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. I will supply you with the resources you need, allowing you to grow stronger,” said Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yue Xiaoqian was startled. This idea of Long Chen’s was too crazy. If the world learned about this, his life would be over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You don’t need to be startled. Helping you is also helping myself. My prediction is that this world will sooner or later flip on its tail. I need a powerful ally that can help me when I don’t have enough power,” said Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You really trust us that much?” Yue Xiaoqian was about to cry again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, since I’ve chosen to trust you, I’ll trust you completely. I trust that you’ll never betray me!” Long Chen gently brushed back Yue Xiaoqian’s soft hair, completely sincere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, Long Chen, really thank you…” Yue Xiaoqian was extremely moved by his trust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once she had calmed down a bit, Long Chen continued, “When you return, think of a way to send me a list of what you most need at that time. For example, medicinal pills, weapons, armors, etc. I’ll think of a way to set up a secret channel to send them back to you. Hopefully, you’ll be able to quickly get stronger. That way, I’ll also have a powerful backer for myself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wasn’t afraid of the struggles on the cultivation path. But as his cultivation base increased, he was coming into contact with more and more secrets, and he was feeling less and less safe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He felt that if he was alone, if he ended up fighting against an enormous existence, he would definitely be mercilessly exterminated. He had long since been thinking of creating an alliance. But small alliances were useless, and as for supreme powers, they wouldn’t care about a weakling like him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for devoting himself to the Xuantian Dao Sect, that was impossible. His experiences in the Xuantian Dao Set had always been full of turmoil and troubles. Long Chen had no hopes for the Xuantian Dao Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although there were people like Shui Wuhen and Ouyang Qiuyu whom he had good relationships with in the Xuantian Dao Sect, what about later? Ouyang Qiuyu might be able to help him now, but what about once he entered the head sect? Who would back him then?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So he needed to establish a trustworthy alliance. And he hadn’t been lying. He didn’t believe what he saw or heard. He just trusted the intuition the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art gave him. That intuition had never tricked him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only could he get a dependable ally, but he could also make a flawlessly beautiful woman feel thankful. Long Chen felt that his luck really wasn’t that bad</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He told Yue Xiaoqian to summon all the disciples roaming in the outside world back. There was no need for them to take that risk. If they were exposed, it would raise the guard of the Martial Heaven Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He told her about his plan. Yue Xiaoqian was surprised that he had such powerful communication channels. He actually had a relationship with the Huayun Sect and the Pill Tower. She practically worshiped him for that, causing Long Chen’s vanity to be completely satisfied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The general plan was for her to have a list in her mind when she went to ask her clan leader for approval. That way her leader would be able to get an idea of what the plan was about. After all, Yue Xiaoqian had to discuss this with the higher-ups, as this matter was too important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he was startled to learn that Yue Xiaoqian’s mother was the clan leader. Only then did he recall that Xiao Die had called Yue Xiaoqian the sacred daughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xiaoqian, how did you come here?” asked Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Our original devil race has an ancient transportation inheritance. As long as we know the coordinates, we can transport ourselves in. When the Immemorial Path opens, we can transport in with the assistance of the outside world’s transportation formation,” said Yue Xiaoqian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did you find anything here? Or do you have some target?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. Up ahead, I can sense some kind of summoning. There should be something my original devil race needs there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen hastily took out his map and asked Yue Xiaoqian the general location. He was startled to find that the place she was talking about was marked as the Netherworld Devil Palace on the Xiao tribe’s map</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, that place had been concealed by the aboriginals, so outsiders didn’t know that location. Their maps didn’t say there was a trial in that region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them went directly over there. Long Chen intentionally put away the map, having Yue Xiaoqian lead through her senses. He didn’t want the map to mislead her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But, a few days later, the place she found was exactly the same place marked on the map. Now it was confirmed that she wanted something in this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After half a day, Long Chen finally found a mark on the bottom of an unremarkable stone. It was also a transportation formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them stood together as Long Chen activated the formation. Their vision suddenly darkened as they appeared in a huge underground space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as they arrived, Long Chen’s heart shook. This was a huge plaza, and at the center was a giant stone statue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The statue depicted a man holding a sword with both hands. His eyes looked right at the entrance of the plaza, exactly where Long Chen and Yue Xiaoqian were standing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An indescribable pressure fell on the two of them. It was like that statue was alive, making people feel an urge to bow down in worship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them walked in and saw eight stone gates. Each gate was three hundred meters tall, and each one of them had immortal characters written on them. Long Chen didn’t recognize those characters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The reward for this stone gate is actually the peak grade Heavenly Source Extract. That’s the heaven and earth spirit spring that my original devil race needs the most right now!” Yue Xiaoqian excitedly held Long Chen’s hand, almost jumping with cheer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he didn’t know what that was, he guessed that it was about the same as the peak grade Divine Mortal Molting Elixir. But from her cheering, it seemed much more important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then let’s go into this trial.” Long Chen went up to push the button next to the gate. That should be the mechanism to start the trial.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yue Xiaoqian suddenly shouted, but Long Chen’s hand had already touched the button.</span></p>
