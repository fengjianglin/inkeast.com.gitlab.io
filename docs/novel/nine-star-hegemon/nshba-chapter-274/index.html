From that immortal cave, it was possible to overlook the entire monastery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This immortal cave was the highest construction within the entire monastery. It was the Xuantian Monastery’s sect leader’s immortal cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the immortal cave, Long Chen was curiously examining the surroundings. He was surprised that the sect leader’s immortal cave was extremely simple. It was the complete opposite of what he had imagined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were no decorations on the walls. It looked like Ling Yun-zi had simply left it the same as when it had been first carved open. In fact, it looked quite similar to the caves of beasts Long Chen had run into.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, Long Chen didn’t dare speak those thoughts aloud. Ling Yun-zi and Tu Fang were standing right in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In terms of furniture, there was only a large prayer mat that had a single wooden table. There were some cups and a teapot on the table.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sit.” Ling Yun-zi smiled slightly when he saw Long Chen enter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“With two seniors present, how could disciple possibly sit?” Although that was what came out of Long Chen’s mouth, he had already sat down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha, ah, Long Chen. You really are strange. Do you not have a time when you are restrained?” Ling Yun-zi couldn’t hold back a laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen really was an easy-going person, someone who didn’t fear heaven or earth. Panic and terror were expressions that almost never appeared on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even when Long Chen had been facing that terrifying hand from that expert of the Corrupt path, he hadn’t shown any despair. That was what Ling Yun-zi especially admired about Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was always filled with self-confidence no matter what happened. Such a person was one of two things: a madman, or an idiot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However,&nbsp;Long Chen didn’t act like a crazy person or an idiot. But then again, it wasn’t exactly correct to say he acted like an ordinary person either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even when Elders saw Ling Yun-zi, they would all be trembling with trepidation and reverence, unable to handle the pressure. But Long Chen didn’t seem to feel any pressure at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe, my strongest point is my mental fortitude which lets me be myself at any time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen laughed and poured cups of tea for both of them, respectfully handing them over to the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Please have a drink. Thank you both for your care.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Yun-zi and Tu Fang laughed and received the teacups Long Chen offered them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen was easy-going, preferring to be free and open, not caring so much about trifles. But his attention to detail was actually extremely high.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Otherwise he wouldn’t have been able to control the flow of the battle last time so perfectly. The Corrupt disciples had clearly greatly outnumbered the Righteous disciples, and yet they were all led by the nose by Long Chen, and he had pulled off a perfect reversal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, the way Long Chen had offered them tea had also been extremely detailed and well done. His right hand had held the cup, his forefinger curving ever so slightly without touching the side. That was a sign of respect for seniors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, Long Chen’s left hand looked like it had just been randomly holding the cup up at the bottom, but in reality, only his middle finger and ring finger had been holding it from the bottom. That was special mark of respect for martial artists.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those kinds of respectful gestures were all common within the secular world, but there were few cultivators who knew about them. However, both Ling Yun-zi and Tu Fang knew about them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Child, if you put it like that, it’ll make me blush with shame. Both of us have only treated you in accordance to the monastery’s rules without giving you the slightest special treatment.” Tu Fang shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After handing them their tea, Long Chen added in more water and also poured himself a cup. Then he smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Although we haven’t interacted much, I can tell that you two truly cherish this little one, so that’s enough.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the two of them were two high and grand existences in comparison to him, with Ling Yun-zi even being a sect leader, Long Chen could see that neither of them were those arrogant types that were so unlikable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most importantly, although the two of them said they had only treated him in accordance to the rules, Long Chen had been able to sense that the two of them really were looking out for him from a few small clues.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Yun-zi laughed. “What an interesting little fellow. It’s no wonder all those disciples would follow you so unswervingly. But for you to say it like that, I really am embarrassed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What happened?” Long Chen was surprised to see Ling Yun-zi sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tu Fang, you explain it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Yun-zi gently drank a sip of tea. Although his expression was calm, Long Chen’s sharp senses noticed that a single vein on his hand had suddenly pulsed ever so slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That kind of minor reaction could mean nothing. But Ling Yun-zi was a Xiantian expert. He had a connection to heaven and earth’s energy. He had a fine control over every cell of his body. So such a minor reaction was actually very alarming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For such a reaction to occur, that meant Ling Yun-zi, who was normally extremely calm, must really be feeling some sort of intense emotion. Furthermore, from this kind of reaction, it seemed that emotion was fury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When his sword had slashed down on that Corrupt path’s expert’s huge hand, when his sword had broken that spatial door, his expression had always been calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But such a top expert now seemed infuriated. Long Chen really was at a loss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tu Fang nodded. He said to Long Chen, “This time you managed to kill a Corrupt Elder. With your strength, we applied for a Chosen disciple position for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chosen?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, a Chosen. For most people, to gain a Chosen disciple position requires you to also be a Favored,” explained Tu Fang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But I’m not a Favored.” Long Chen bitterly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t even have a Spirit Root, so how would he become a Favored? Just thinking about that angered Long Chen. Inside, he cursed whatever person had stolen his Spirit Root.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tu Fang continued, “You aren’t a Favored, but your strength would not be inferior to any Chosen.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was what he said out loud, but inside, he said, What are Favored when compared to you? If you don’t die, those Favored won’t even be fit to polish your shoes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The fact remains that you managed to kill a Favored, kill an eight-temper Bone Forging Elder, and in the end even cut off the leg of another Chosen. That proves you have enough strength.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That Yin Mule- ah, I mean Yin Luo, is also a Chosen?” asked Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Correct. Back when Yin Luo was just born, he already had a Dao-mark supporting him. When he was five, his Dao-mark covered his entire body and incited a special manifestation of heaven and earth. That’s why he was raised with a Chosen’s treatment.” Tu Fang sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Luo was extremely famous. In truth, when they had first found out that the Corrupt path had instigated that battle, they had immediately gone to ask the supermonastery for aid in order to handle Yin Luo. They had been hoping for the monastery to send down another Chosen to face Yin Luo.</span></p>

This monastery was unable to compare to the other monasteries.</span></p>

But those fellows wouldn’t go out fighting for others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The supermonastery knew that if they didn’t sent a Chosen to help, then the 108th monastery would be completely routed. And so they had dispatched one of the first monastery’s disciples to go provide assistance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first monastery was the strongest monastery, and it possessed three Chosen. Sending one down was extremely simple for them.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By that time, the battle had already ended. Completely infuriated, Ling Yun-zi had directly reported this to the higher levels of the supermonastery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the first monastery had a very deep relationship with the supermonastery. They had actually managed to suppress this matter from becoming bigger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That had truly infuriated Tu Fang and Ling Yun-zi. That was intolerable bullying! The fact that the Chosen had arrived late could have caused countless of their disciples to die. How could this matter be settled just like that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The heavens really had been protecting them during this battle. Mo Nian had appeared out of nowhere, Chu Yao had displayed a shocking battle ability, and Wilde had been incredibly powerful as well. Furthermore, Tang Wan-er and them had also fought exceptionally outstandingly. With Long Chen leading them, they had completely reversed this battle which should have resulted in a massacre for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was just the fact that they had suppressed this information from becoming widespread, that would have been one thing. After all, the first monastery was extremely powerful and was not an existence they could provoke. They could only endure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when Tu Fang had brought over a huge number of Corrupt disciple heads to them to exchange for points, he had also reported the matter of Long Chen killing an eight-temper Bone Forging Elder in hopes of getting Long Chen a Chosen disciple position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chosen were all existences unrivalled within their realm. Even the supermonastery valued them, and would provide a great deal of resources to raise them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Tu Fang had only just sent in the request when an Elder from the supermonastery rejected him, his reasoning that this was clearly fake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tu Fang had really been infuriated then. He had gone straight back to the monastery and received a photographic jade from Ling Yun-zi that had the events of the battle recorded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he ran back to the supermonastery and handed over that photographic jade, that Elder had been silent for a long while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had then told Tu Fang that this matter was too peculiar, and he had to report it to the higher ups first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tu Fang had felt that it was odd for him to have to wait. Normally, this kind of matter would be handled extremely quickly, especially since he had handed over that photographic jade as proof.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But then again, this situation really was peculiar. After all, Long Chen was only at the peak of Blood Condensation, and he was also not a Favored. The fact that others found it inconceivable and had to discuss it first was reasonable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the next day, that Elder had sent Tu Fang a message saying that he was extremely sorry, but that all the Chosen spots for this generation had already been taken, and there were not enough resources to distribute anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tu Fang had been about to burst with rage. This was clearly purposely making it hard on them. The supermonastery’s inheritance stretched back for tens of thousands of years. Would they really be lacking resources for a single genius?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Tu Fang also had no way around this. There was no way he could get in touch with the true higher ups. He could only swallow this stomach of fire and simply receive the ordinary resources and rewards for the monastery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But just as he was about to leave, he had heard a single bit of news: the first monastery had just given birth to another Chosen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Didn’t they say that there were no more Chosen spots to hand out?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time Tu Fang was far too suspicious. He hadn’t gone to find that Elder, and had instead secretly asked around. He had learned that the Elder who had refused to give them that Chosen disciple position was someone extremely close to the first monastery’s sect leader.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tu Fang had then come to a sudden realization. It was no wonder Long Chen’s Chosen application had not gone through. They had just angered the first monastery by reporting the fact that their Chosen had failed to accomplish his task.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once he realized this, Tu Fang realized there really was no hope. He had had no choice but to dejectedly return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing Tu Fang’s explanation, Long Chen smiled, stood up, and bowed to Ling Yun-zi and Tu Fang.</span></p>
