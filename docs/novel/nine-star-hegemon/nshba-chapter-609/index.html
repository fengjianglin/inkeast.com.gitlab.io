<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qingzhou City’s Mo family had disappeared, leaving behind only a huge hole. This ruler, which had dominated Qing Prefecture for countless years, had vanished into thin air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, there was a deep abyss in front of the Scorched Earth Forest. The souls of countless experts were buried within that abyss. Even two Sea Expansion experts had died there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of this caused huge waves in Qing Prefecture. No one knew what they should do now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally, everyone had been waiting for news. But even after three days, the Mo family still hadn’t returned. After seven days, a shocking piece of news arrived: the Yin family’s ancestral land had been completely razed, and all their people had been killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That news didn’t just shake Qing Prefecture. Even the surrounding prefectures became chaotic. An enormous existence with an inheritance stretching back countless years had been exterminated just like that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as people were debating the veracity of this news, an enormous carriage appeared in the air above Qingzhou City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This carriage was pulled by four Celestial Horses. Celestial Horses were legendary Magical Beasts that reached the Xiantian realm when they matured. Their flying speed was incredibly fast, and this was the first time the people of Qingzhou City had seen such Magical Beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These four three-hundred-meter horses released a terrifying pressure, and when their wings flapped, all of heaven and earth rumbled. The cultivators in the city were all pale, not daring to move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A group of people came down from the carriage. They examined the Scorched Earth Desert as well as the Mo family’s old territory and then returned to the carriage, flying in the direction of the Yin family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once they left, people had only just had a chance to sigh with relief when the void trembled, and a huge eagle appeared. Its wingspan was over a mile long, and it was truly capable of shrouding the sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It circled around Qingzhou City once and then just left. No one even got a chance to see who was standing on the eagle’s back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More and more experts came to Qingzhou City one after another. It was unknown what cultivation base those people had, but they all had flying Xiantian Magical Beasts that shocked the city’s cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, these people had no interest in Qing Prefecture. After looking over the battlefield, they directly left in the direction of the Yin family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen was riding on Little Snow’s back. They were galloping as fast as lightning across the land. Sitting in transportation formations would have saved them two days of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Little Snow had stayed in the spiritual space for too long. This time, Little Snow was incomparably excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Little Snow had never complained, Long Chen felt deeply ashamed. Little Snow was his companion, not his tool. He needed his own freedom. Long Chen had been too selfish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So this time, Long Chen was willing to sacrifice these two days for Little Snow to race around as much as he pleased and release some of his emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Snow was currently at the late fifth rank. His speed was truly shocking. The sound of space being ripped apart rang out wherever he went. Even Long Chen felt pleasure in this high speed run, and his mood improved a great deal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They ran into two powerful Xiantian Magical Beasts on their way, but Long Chen didn’t even need to raise a finger. Little Snow spat out a single wind blade to kill each one of those mid Xiantian Magical Beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those instant kills filled Long Chen with pride. Little Snow’s strength had already surpassed the scope of the Magical Beast world. He had originally just been a third rank Magical Beast but had broken through to the fifth rank and was even able to instantly kill across his realm. This was the terror of mutated Magical Beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Long Chen was also extremely worried. Meng Qi had told him that mutated Magical Beasts were not allowed by the Heavenly Daos. Little Snow would find it more and more difficult as he advanced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Little Snow’s cultivation base simply stopped at the fifth rank, there would be no danger. But Little Snow’s cultivation speed didn’t show the slightest sign of slowing down even after reaching the fifth rank. In fact, it seemed to be quickening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sixth rank was equivalent to the human Xiantian realm. That was one of the large barriers. It was also one of the major barriers that existed after every three realms within the martial path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qi Condensation, Blood Condensation, and then Tendon Transformation were the first three. Tendon Transformation was a large barrier and very difficult to reach. But once you reached it, your strength would explosively grow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was also why Long Chen had been able to dominate Blood Condensation experts back in Phoenix Cry, but when he had fought the Tendon Transformation Marquis Yin for the first time, he had been forced to miserably flee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the same way—of Bone Forging, Meridian Opening, and Xiantian—the Xiantian realm was a major barrier and extremely so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the most important process for transforming from Houtian to Xiantian. There was a qualitative difference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most importantly, no matter who it was, no matter how untalented they were, they would have to undergo the baptism of heavenly tribulation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a mutated Magical Beast, the heavens had sent down tribulation for Little Snow even when he had only advanced to the fifth rank. Although that heavenly tribulation hadn’t been as terrifying as Long Chen’s, the destructive aura had clearly been trying to kill him. It was no baptism.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once Little Snow reached the sixth rank, his heavenly tribulation would definitely be incredibly terrifying. Little Snow’s strength lay in his offense, not his defense. If it hadn’t been for Long Chen, Little Snow would have already died to his last heavenly tribulation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, Long Chen had no confidence in being able to block Little Snow’s tribulation. That was why he had Little Snow suppress his cultivation base.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, that hadn’t been the slightest bit effective. No matter how they tried, Little Snow’s cultivation base refused to be suppressed. In just a few months, Little Snow would reach the Xiantian realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No matter what, I will be there to help you block it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Riding on Little Snow’s back, looking at the scenery flying by them, Long Chen was suddenly filled with a grand feeling. Wasn’t it just heavenly tribulation? If the two of them were both expelled by the Heavenly Daos, then they would properly play with these damn heavens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Along with Mo Nian, Mu Xue and the others had also gone. They were forcibly taken away by Mo Yi. One reason was for their benefit, and the other reason was for Long Chen’s benefit. He didn’t want to see them being used against him again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Yi promised that he would release Mu Xue and the others after three years. Mo Gate would groom them with its full strength. That was definitely thousands of times better than being mercenaries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he expressed his good intentions, Mo Yi had also expressed that Mu Xue had no choice. Whether or not she agreed, she had to do this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a good thing Mu Xue was also an extremely reasonable person. She empathized with Mo Yi and Long Chen’s plights, and she expressed that she was extremely excited to receive such a great opportunity. But Long Chen knew she didn’t care about this grooming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Otherwise, with Mu Xue’s talent, she could join any sect and receive much better grooming than as a mercenary. The Muxue Mercenary Unit cared more about their freedom than anything else. Mu Xue’s happy and excited act was just to comfort Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen had no choice but to sigh. People were really unable to act as they pleased. Sometimes having emotions caused more pain than being emotionless. Sometimes, being emotionless allowed a person to be much more carefree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, Long Chen saw distant mountains with mist surrounding them. He had arrived at the Xuantian Supermonastery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who’s there? Stop! This place is- Elder Long Chen!” The dozen disciples guarding the entrance had just been about to interrogate Long Chen when they recognized him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Greetings, Elder Long Chen!” The disciples all hastily bowed, filled with reverence and worship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three days ago, the monastery head had gathered everyone and shown them a certain scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were two parts. The first part was the battle where Long Chen had killed Yin Wushang’s clone, and the second part was where Long Chen had defeated Yin Wushang’s true body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing how powerful Long Chen was, all the disciples and Elders had felt their blood boiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, they also felt a great deal of glory. Being a member of the Xuantian Supermonastery just like Long Chen made them feel extremely proud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For an ordinary cultivator to defeat a Celestial of the same realm, just how shocking was that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Long Chen, you’re still alive! Great!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back when Long Chen had been forcibly teleported by the Yin family’s expert, there were only a few people who thought Long Chen would be able to escape alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Later, when news that the Yin family had been destroyed spread, many guessed that Long Chen had already died, which was why Mo Gate had released their fury on the Yin family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now seeing Long Chen alive in front of them, these disciples were incredibly moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of the disciples hastily raised a hammer and smashed it into the bell by his side. The sound of the bell rang throughout the entire supermonastery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you crazy?! That’s the alarm bell! I’m not an attacker!” Long Chen jumped in fright. Had he somehow become an enemy of the supermonastery?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fuck, I hit the wrong one!” That disciple was filled with regret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were two bells. Their sounds were completely different. One was used for receiving important guests, alerting the supermonastery’s experts to come out and greet them for courtesy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the other was the alarm bell. That bell was already slightly rusted, because it seemed this bell had never been rung up until now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Long Chen had returned, that disciple had been incredibly excited, and this huge of a matter was something he had to alert the whole supermonastery about. That would lift the entire mood of the supermonastery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a result though, he had mixed up the positions of the two bells, directly ringing the alarm bell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, the entire supermonastery was thrown into chaos. The void trembled, and countless runes appeared in the sky. A translucent barrier appeared over the entire supermonastery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen also heard countless startled cries, as experts surged out in a huge army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who dares barge into my Xuantian Supermonastery?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A cold cry rang out. Long Chen helplessly sighed as he recognized that to be Shui Wuhen’s voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m doomed, absolutely doomed. I’m going to be expelled from the supermonastery.” The disciple that had rung the bell almost cried. He had truly caused a huge disaster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the grand formation had been activated. That cost an ocean’s worth of spirit stones. Thinking of that, he had an urge to just directly kill himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the other disciples, they were also ashen. Considering this gross error, it would not be odd for them to be expelled as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen… you’re still alive!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Wuhen appeared in the sky with her wings. When she saw Long Chen, even with her calm nature, her voice quivered slightly.</span></p>
