As long as you didn’t enter deeply into that mist, the danger level wasn’t necessarily high.</span></p>

It looked like just an ordinary forest, but there were countless vicious beasts and poisonous insects hidden within it. Perhaps a single ant would be able to easily kill a Tendon Transformation expert.</span></p>

There were also stories of spirit medicines that were capable of roving around the forest. There were even legends that people had obtained immortal grass. Just a single whiff of it was supposed to allow someone to shed their mortal body.</span></p>

Long Chen didn’t recognize their robes, and so they were probably from some unremarkable small sect.</span></p>

You’re a powerful Chosen, but you’re making it hard on us two ordinary disciples. Are you not afraid of ruining your reputation?”</span></p>

A palm smashed towards the two of them.</span></p>

In front of Jiang Yifan, they were unable to do anything. Just that single palm made them unable to move. They could only watch in horror as Jiang Yifan’s palm approached.</span></p>

One of them used his full strength just to be able to open his mouth and curse Jiang Yifan.</span></p>

Furthermore, it seemed even ordinary core disciples had been quite lucky here. Their spatial rings had contained quite a few nice surprises for him. So this was already a habit of his.</span></p>

Furthermore, the brick had come silently from his blind spot. There was no chance for him to block it.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Yifan had already been spinning through the air from the first blow. Now his spin was completely reversed, and he once more vomited a mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this time, because of his high-speed revolving, it was like red fireworks were shooting out of his mouth. It was a bizarre kind of beauty.</span></p>

He might be the absolute weakest level of Chosen, but he was still far stronger than regular Favored, and he managed to recognize Long Chen even through the spinning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you think you can say my name?”</span></p>

The first thing Long Chen did was break his elbows and knees so that he couldn’t run.</span></p>

Long Chen could use it just as nimbly as his own fists, and when it was used in close-range combat, it was practically unblockable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack…</span></p>

Even back when Long Chen had been in the Blood Condensation realm, he had still been able completely suppress Jiang Yifan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that he was at the Tendon Transformation, killing Jiang Yifan didn’t require any effort. However, killing him like this would be letting him off far too lightly. First Long Chen broke all his limbs, and then he pondered how he should handle this scum.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Long Chen attacked Jiang Yifan- no, it should be as Long Chen played with Jiang Yifan, those two disciples who had escaped death didn’t even dare to move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the very first attack, Jiang Yifan’s body had still been floating in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only change was whether he spun clockwise or counterclockwise. Long Chen continuously swung out his brick, almost like he was hitting a spinning top. They were completely stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, what are you two still doing here? The scene will get a bit bloody in a bit, and it wouldn’t be good for you to see it.” Only when Long Chen finally said something did they react.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them took a deep breath and bowed deeply to Long Chen. “We’ll remember this favor of saving our lives.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What favor? Hurry up and leave,” prompted Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them glanced at each other. Once more bowing to Long Chen, they turned and rushed away. They were filled with appreciation, and Long Chen’s name was deeply carved in their hearts.</span></p>

His heart was filled with terror.</span></p>

He had no idea what method Long Chen was using, but he had severed all the meridians in his limbs. The only thing he could feel was pain.</span></p>

If he died to an expert, then fine. But if he died to an idiot like this, then that would really be too vexing.</span></p>

Nor was it that Jiang Yifan had gotten tired of screaming. Instead, it was because he had fainted. Jiang Yifan no longer looked human.</span></p>

More accurately, it should be called a well. It was a stone well that was around three meters wide and three hundred meters deep.</span></p>

He took all the spatial rings Jiang Yifan had. A thought popped into his head to take his clothes as well, however the clothes he had been wearing had been torn to pieces already, so he didn’t bother with those rags. He left him essentially clad in some torn threads and a pair of boots. Feeding him another healing pill, he threw him into the well.</span></p>

He then examined the well. He confirmed there were a couple cracks that would make it so Jiang Yifan wouldn’t suffocate. Only then was he ready to leave him here. In the future, he could come slowly to put him in order if he had the time. If he didn’t have time, then Jiang Yifan could just die in there.</span></p>
