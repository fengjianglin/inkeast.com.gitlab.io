 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is it?” Ouyang Qiuyu was a bit surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just how did you dispatch those three old ghosts?” asked Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen knew that those three Kings hadn’t left kindly after not getting anything from him. He wanted to know what Ouyang Qiuyu had given them to have them leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The matter’s already passed, so don’t bring it up again. As long as you’re safe, it’s fine. Money is well-spent if it’s used to avert a disaster.” Ouyang Qiuyu couldn’t look Long Chen in the eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, I knew that they would give you a vicious blow. Just how much did they take?” Long Chen was speechless as he stared at Ouyang Qiuyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Um… about… everything…” Ouyang Qiuyu’s expression was extremely unnatural.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Every… thing? What does that mean?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Everything in the storehouses, all the yuan spirit stones used to strengthen the formation…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What the fuck?” Long Chen’s eyes almost popped out of his head. That was too vicious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen, money can be earned if it’s lost. Do you know what a calamity you provoked this time? Being able to spend this money to buy your life is amazing!” said Ouyang Qiuyu. In her opinion, as long as this money was spent to protect Long Chen, losing a fortune was fine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, it wasn’t as if she had control over this matter. It was all negotiated by Li Changfeng. In her opinion, this result was extremely satisfactory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If I had known this earlier, I would have had Guo Ran completely cripple those disciples,” said Long Chen hatefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In order to enrich the Xuantian Dao Sect, he had given all the two great battle spoils to Ouyang Qiuyu. But as a result, they had all been taken by those three.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen’s heart was about to drip blood. Although he wasn’t stingy, his battle spoils couldn’t be given to just anyone, especially not his enemies. That was what made him furious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, so your pocket is completely empty now. No wonder you’re not busy reconstructing the building despite it being turned into this state.” Long Chen was speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You rotten brat, I have no money, and you destroyed the palace! Are you trying to make me so poor I have to live outside?!” raged Ouyang Qiuyu. Even the representative mark of the Xuantian Dao Sect had been destroyed, and she had no money to repair it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry, I’ll just build you another. One that’s even bigger and grander! It’ll make the Xuantian Dao Sect ten times more amazing than before.” Long Chen smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had absolute confidence in these words. He had a mountain of Treasure items, and there were quite a few weapons, medicinal pills, armor, and secret tomes that were useless to him. He was in the midst of figuring out how to handle those things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big words. Reconstructing the Xuantian Dao sect requires an ocean’s worth of material and people. I’ve sent an application for more money, but I don’t know how long it will take for the first wave of money to arrive. The Xuantian Dao Sect will probably be a pile of ruins for several years,” sighed Ouyang Qiuyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having stayed in the Xuantian Dao Sect for so long, this place was her home. Anyone would feel the same if their home was ruined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big sister, your Spirit Blood has been made up for, and you were originally a rank three Celestial. You should be able to become a King soon, then you can join the head sect. Why stay here?” asked Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ouyang Qiuyu shook her head. “You don’t understand. I’ve been here for too long. My heart is here. Furthermore, I… I’m too old now. I don’t have that vigor of youth, nor do I have the will to continuously advance. I’d rather stay here until I’m dead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? Big sister, you look so young and beautiful. Do you still remember how I treated you like a little sister at first and almost seduced you?” laughed Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What, you even have interest in an old fossil like me?” laughed Ouyang Qiuyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big sister isn’t old. Cultivators live for countless years. Whether a person is old depends on their heart,” said Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You want to have me and Wuhen go with you to the head sect? You should give up on that thought. We don’t want to have to worry about you any longer. We’ve both discussed it, and we’re going to peacefully stay here. With two of us, we’ll have company. As for going with you? Hmph, we want to live for a few more years. Spare us.” Ouyang Qiuyu shook her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In truth-”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ouyang Qiuyu cut him off, saying, “Long Chen, we both understand you. We know you want what’s best for us. But you have a fatal flaw, and we don’t want to become your burdens. We’ll be very safe here, and so that’s basically helping you. Once you reach the peak of the martial path, if you still remember the two of us, you can come back. Then we’ll profit from your prestige and enjoy what it feels like. But that’s not now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking into Ouyang Qiuyu’s eyes, Long Chen could understand that Ouyang Qiuyu and Shui Wuhen’s decision was the smartest one. But he also didn’t want to part with them. However, he could accept this proposal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While they were talking, a person came over to report that someone wanted to talk with Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Wenlong, haha, it’s been a long time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his own private room, Long Chen fiercely hugged Zheng Wenlong, who he hadn’t seen in a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, Long Chen, ah, Long Chen. I thought that you would start to suspect me since it took me so long to get here. It looks like I was worried for nothing,” laughed Zheng Wenlong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as Long Chen had returned to the Xuantian Dao Sect, he had sent someone to notify Zheng Wenlong that he had some business to discuss. But Zheng Wenlong had only appeared now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Trusted people shouldn’t be doubted, and suspicious people shouldn’t be trusted. Since I’ve chosen to trust you, I’ll trust you to the end. Sit, let’s drink some tea. I have some big business to discuss with you.” Long Chen smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them sat. Zheng Wenlong opened his mouth first, excitedly saying, “Long Chen, do you want to guess where I was these past few days?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen was surprised. “Where you were…? Could it be… you were promoted?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, yes, I was in the Central Plains. In just a few years, with my hard work, I’ve managed to defeat the disciples from the other regions and become an assistant guild leader within the Huayun Sect. Although there are a total of eight assistant guild leaders, I’m the youngest one in all of history.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zheng Wenlong was full of excitement and pride. This position had to be extremely important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So brother Wenlong managed to reach the Central Plains first! Here, let your brother celebrate for you. I have some wine here.” Long Chen took out a jar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, my Huayun Sect’s disciples aren’t allowed to drink wine. We have to maintain clear heads,” said Zheng Wenlong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen didn’t force him. Using tea as wine, they toasted. Long Chen said, “Your promotion is great news to me. It just so happens that the business I have for you is big.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zheng Wenlong laughed, “Hehe, I know. When I returned, someone told me what happened. I know about everything, and I have to say, you really are vicious, Long Chen! You’re even more vicious than last time in the Jiuli secret realm! Speak, what is it that you need? Do you need my help getting rid of some corrupt weapons? Are you looking for short-term profit, long-term profit?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His last question was in regards to how urgently he needed the money. If it was urgent, he could immediately start selling them, lowering the profit in exchange for speed. But if it wasn’t urgent, he could sell them over several months, or even several years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t have time to care about those things. If you’re interested, just give me an all-inclusive deal, and then you can slowly sell them off for more personal profit,” said Long Chen. He tossed Zheng Wenlong a ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he had long since been prepared, when he saw the items inside the spatial ring, he was still shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were hundreds of Treasure items inside, and all of them were above average. Various medicinal pills, secret tomes, and spiritual items packed inside it. Just estimating their value would take several days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Long Chen, you really are my lucky star. I only just got promoted, and you’re sending me such huge business!” exclaimed Zheng Wenlong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is just part of it. I want enough money to reconstruct the Xuantian Dao Sect, and I also have some other treasures I want you to appraise and give me an estimate. I’m not prepared to take out these treasures right now, but I need to know if there’s a marketplace for them. Also, help me stay on the lookout for some rare and strange treasures.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen took out one drop of Divine Mortal Molting Elixir, one drop of Ten thousand Spirit Blood, and one yuan spirit stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zheng Wenlong’s eyes almost popped out. Those three were priceless treasures. Each one of them was enough to cause a huge disturbance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you.” Zheng Wenlong gratefully looked at Long Chen. The fact that he had brought out these three things for him to see meant he had absolute trust in him. If news of these three things spread, it would bring countless killers to him. But Long Chen hadn’t hesitated to show him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These three are peak treasures that people can’t buy no matter how much money they have. So I can’t give you real value for them. But since you aren’t in a hurry, I’ll investigate once I go back and try to get an accurate estimate. I’ll also go through the recent auction news and see if there’s anything you’re interested in. As long as you say the word, I’ll find people to get it for you. As for the money you urgently need, I have the authority to lend you plenty of spirit stones. Even if you wanted to expand the Xuantian Dao Sect by ten times, it should be enough.” Zheng Wenlong patted his chest confidently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">People always said that rich people sounded assertive. Now, Zheng Wenlong’s imposing attitude was becoming more and more amazing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them had been cooperating for a long time, so they figured things out in just a few sentences. Zheng Wenlong left full of excitement, and Long Chen also felt a weight lift off his shoulders.</span></p>
