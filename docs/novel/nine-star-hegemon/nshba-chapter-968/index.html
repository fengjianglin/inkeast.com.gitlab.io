 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The person demanding Long Chen come out was a Foundation Forging expert. Long Chen had known since before getting on the flying boat that these people were disciples from the Xuantian Dao Sect’s previous generation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ten years a generation, and they were already Foundation Forging experts. It was truly amazing for them to be Foundation Forging experts in their early thirties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, he saw that they were all at least rank two Celestials. Some were even rank three Celestials. Such geniuses were much stronger than the ordinary Foundation Forging experts he had encountered before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the Eastern Wasteland, with their cultivation bases, they could establish their own sects. But in the Central Plains, they were no more than ordinary disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The one shouting at Long Chen was a man with long hair that scattered naturally around him. He seemed to possess a certain amount of status, as the others listened to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he appeared indifferent and didn’t look directly at them, Long Chen clearly saw him eyeing Meng Qi and Tang Wan-er with his peripheral vision. Looking at his arrogant manner, Long Chen knew exactly what kind of fart he was about to release.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t have time for you,” said Long Chen icily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His voice caused the head sect’s disciples’ expressions to change, especially the man at the front. His expression sank, and his aura began to rise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen, you don’t want to join the head sect?” he shouted coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you the patriarch of the sect?” sneered Long Chen. “It seems you aren’t. Since you aren’t, it seems you’re bragging a bit too much. If you really had any position in the Xuantian Dao Sect, you wouldn’t have run over here to handle such a matter. A poser routine that lacks any technique or skill like this is something we’ve all long since stopped playing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen, I, Wang Mang, challenge you to a battle!” shouted that person. He took out a badge that was made of an unknown material. It was like metal but not metal, like wood but not wood. The Xuan character was carved into it, and the back had Wang Mang’s name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m busy.” Long Chen shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, it’s not up to you. According to the Xuantian Dao Sect’s rules, disciples are permitted to exchange pointers. You either accept or scram from the Xuantian Dao Sect!” said a different senior disciple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh? There’s such a thing?” Long Chen frowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, are you afraid now? Coward!” sneered another disciple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Guo Ran, who had been sitting there silently up until now, finally couldn’t endure it anymore and stood up. He sneered, “Idiot, if it weren’t for your robes, you’d already be dead. You want to provoke my boss? Thank your lucky stars he doesn’t care about the shouting of ants!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s all this fuss?” A stern shout rang out. It was the voice of the middle-aged man, but he didn’t reveal himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Reporting to Elder Sha, disciple is acting entirely within the rules. I haven’t overstepped any of them,” said Wang Mang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Sha’s emotionless voice rang out, “The Xuantian Dao Sect does have a rule permitting disciples to exchange pointers. But it is restricted to the same realm. If you suppress your cultivation bases to Sea Expansion, you can do what you want. Disciples of the Eastern Wasteland, the Xuantian Dao Sect has its own rules, and everyone must respect them. Although some rules are a bit annoying, you only have two paths to follow. Either leave the Xuantian Dao Sect, or endure. If you don’t want to leave and you also don’t want to be restricted by the rules, then it’s very simple. All you have to do is become strong enough to resist the entire Xuantian Dao Sect. But if any of you had that power, I’d guess that you’d have long since established your own sect instead of joining the Xuantian Dao Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These outer sect disciples were suppressed harshly back then as well, so their resentment is now falling on you. This is an annoying tradition, but it can’t be changed, at least not by you. To put it nicely, the point is to blunt the sharpness of the newcomers, making them easier to manage. It’s to avoid you not knowing how high the heavens are and being tyrannical. That’s not good for your cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But in truth, talking about that is useless. Rules are rules, and it doesn’t matter whether you like it or not. And don’t act like children. After cultivating for so long, you should know this is a world of the strong. If you don’t step over others, others will step over you. If you don’t kill your enemies, your enemies will kill you. I don’t want to hear any complaints about how this is unfair. If anyone dares to say anything like that, I’ll immediately toss them out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Sha’s words caused everyone’s hearts to shake. It seemed the Xuantian Dao Sect’s rules were even harsher than they had thought.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They suddenly realized that this group of people had definitely also been bullied by the disciples of the generation above them. Now the roles were reversed, and they were ready to vent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just what was this supposed to be? A show of power to make them less arrogant? Before giving them the candy, they first beat them a bit? Those disciples that had just joined the Xuantian Dao Sect were startled and enraged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The majority of them were rank two Celestials. Feng Geyin and those like him hadn’t come as he had chosen to stay within his sect. He had wanted to come, but his sect leader’s longevity was running out. A disciple owed a heavy debt to his master and sect, and as a result, he sacrificed this chance and stayed behind to become his sect’s leader.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These ordinary disciples were enraged, but they saw that the expressions of all the Dragonblood Legion were completely flat. Even the ordinary Dragonblood warriors didn’t reveal the slightest emotion, as if this was nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did you hear Elder Sha clearly? You can’t refuse, so are you going to obediently come over to be beaten, or do we need to pick our targets? But don’t worry, we’re very gentle to female disciples, especially the beautiful ones, hahaha…” laughed a senior disciple while he looked at Meng Qi, Tang Wan-er, and the other beautiful women, a wretched smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Sha, is it permitted to kill people while exchanging pointers?” asked Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No.” Elder Sha’s voice once more rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What if someone accidentally kills someone?” Long Chen continued asking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The reason doesn’t matter. That person will be expelled from the Xuantian Dao Sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What if someone heavily injures or even cripples someone else? What happens then?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As long as they’re not dead, it’s fine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, disciple understands.” Long Chen nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen’s expression was flat, but those familiar with him all knew that he was getting angry. These people might end up very unlucky today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, cowards. Don’t worry, no one will take your little lives. Your senior apprentice-brothers will teach you how to behave and what respect is. It’s very beneficial to you, as it helps you avoid running into walls over and over once you enter the sect. So you should thank us,” laughed a senior disciple, gazing at them as if they were lambs for the slaughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But they quickly realized that while a few did look at them with the unease and terror they had expected, the majority of them were looking at them like they were idiots.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That infuriated them. Wang Mang glanced at one of the people by his side, and that person immediately jumped out. Pointing at Long Chen and the others, he sneered, “Who dares to come out and fight?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That person released his powerful aura, but his realm was suppressed to the peak of Sea Expansion. As he released his aura, the flying boat quivered and its space suddenly rapidly expanded. A huge martial stage appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That person flew onto the martial stage, icily staring at Long Chen and the others with a derisive sneer on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Long, let me go.” Wilde was infuriated at looking at this fellow and wanted to go up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, it’s not permitted to kill people. He won’t be able to receive a single blow from you before dying.” Long Chen shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let me,” said Yue Zifeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, your Sword Dao has just formed. Once you use it, you should only use it for killing blows. If you don’t have any intent to kill, it will blind your Dao-heart.” Long Chen shook his head once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Yue Zifeng’s Heavenly Dao runes had been wiped away by Ling Yunzi. He was focused completely on comprehending the Sword Dao. With the help of the Immemorial Altar Lamp, he had seen the path he needed to walk. He had formed an embryonic form of his own personal Sword Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this kind of situation, he couldn’t just randomly attack. On the off-chance that it had a negative impact on him, then it would be completely not worth it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone heard Long Chen refuse for the two of them to go up. The senior disciple on the martial stage was infuriated. This was a naked insult. “Bastard, get the hell up here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Looks like I’m the most suitable one.” Gu Yang smiled, and rubbing his shiny head, he walked out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay, be careful. Safety first.” Long Chen nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahaha, safety first? Today, I’ll turn your bald head into a broken head!” shouted the senior disciple. He suddenly shot forward, unleashing a fist at Gu Yang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Powerful winds whirled around his fists. Within this sealed boat, it caused a loud roaring sound that made people’s hair stand on end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The expressions of the disciples that had just joined the Xuantian Dao Sect were all ashen. Such power was something they didn’t have the power to resist. Even if their opponents were suppressing their cultivation bases to Sea Expansion, they weren’t on the same level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But what startled them was that this fierce fist was suddenly caught by a large hand, and the owner of that hand was Gu Yang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Idiot, you didn’t even understand what boss was saying. Safety first means making sure I don’t accidentally kill you.” After saying that, Gu Yang’s arm suddenly bulged and an explosive power came from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In front of everyone’s shocked gazes, the senior disciple was still powerless to resist even as he fought all-out. He was thrown to the ground, and the sound of bones breaking caused people to wince.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Gu Yang raised that person from the ground again, they saw that this senior disciple had been turned into a lump. All his bones had been shattered, and he was unconscious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Other than the Dragonblood Legion, everyone else was struck dumb.</span></p>
