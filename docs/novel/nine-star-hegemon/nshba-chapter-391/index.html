During those four months, countless disciples from both the Righteous and Corrupt paths had rushed throughout the various marked regions on the map.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Four months was both a long and a short time. Many experts had already decided on a strategy before coming to the Jiuli secret realm, and they had long since set their goals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were few people like Long Chen who just aimlessly wandered around. That was because Ling Yun-zi had told them that everything would be up to their fates. They couldn’t force it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In truth, Ling Yun-zi also felt extremely bitter inside. Compared to the other monasteries, Long Chen and his other disciples had weak foundations in the sense that they didn’t have many life-saving measures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The majority of the dangerous regions all had countless opportunities within them, but there were also too many people fighting over them. Ling Yun-zi didn’t have any extravagant hopes of them obtaining some heaven-defying opportunities. All he hoped for was for them to be able to come out alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And Ling Yun-zi’s worries had not been unfounded. Only after entering the Jiuli secret realm did Long Chen realize he had looked down on the other geniuses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this world, Han Tianyu and Yin Luo weren’t the only peak experts. Huo Wufang’s appearance allowed Long Chen to realize that in the vast cultivation world, there were countless experts hidden everywhere. He was not the only dark horse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who knew just how many experts like Huo Wufang were still unknown? Even peak experts could run into failure, perhaps even lose their lives, in this place where danger and rivals were everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Long Chen’s mood was still extremely relaxed. Although the Jiuli secret realm was in a constant state of dusk, he felt a delight as if basking in a clear and boundless sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had finally condensed the Alioth Star. Although it was just an embryonic form and he hadn’t finished the nine star transformations, Long Chen already felt as if his body had undergone a complete transformation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That filled Long Chen with confidence. Right now, he didn’t fear any opponent. So it could be said that Long Chen had the ability to go on a rampage at this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the only thing that he regretted slightly was that for some unknown reason, there seemed to always be something calling to him within the Jiuli secret realm. That feeling had only grown stronger after condensing the Alioth Star. However, from the start, Long Chen was unable to determine what direction that calling was coming from, and so he was unable to seek it out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before coming to the Jiuli secret realm, he had already felt an indistinct summoning. That feeling had only grown clearer after entering the secret realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the beginning, Long Chen had thought that whatever was summoning had to do with the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, and so he had thought it was the Qilin Fruit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was because without the Qilin Fruit, there was no way to condense the Alioth Star. But now even after he had obtained the Qilin Fruit, that feeling of being summoned hadn’t changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he hadn’t gone to find Yin Luo, then he wouldn’t have even been able to obtain the Qilin Fruit Tree, so the summoning had nothing to do with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was nothing he could do about that. Long Chen could only continue moving forward. Whatever that thing was, if it was meant to be his, it would reveal itself to him eventually. But if it wasn’t meant to be, then he shouldn’t be feeling that beckoning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for why it refused to reveal what it was, Long Chen could only conclude that their karmic destiny hadn’t arrived yet. He could only walk forward step by step. Now that there were only eight more months to the closing of the Jiuli secret realm, time wasn’t so plentiful anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since he couldn’t find where that opportunity was, Long Chen could only move on. His new target was the only place marked with a blood-colored human skull.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This place was the Abyss of Fiends. No one knew just how deep this abyss was, but it emitted a fiendish air that caused people’s hair to stand on end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was known as a land of definite death. That was because that fiendish air was something ordinary people were unable to block. Sometimes just by getting close to the abyss, people would be corroded by the fiendish air, causing their mental state to collapse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless shockingly powerful experts had tried to explore the Abyss of Fiends’ secrets. As a result, countless experts had thrown their lives away there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One peak expert had said that after advancing to Bone Forging, he had barely gotten three hundred meters into the abyss before a terrifying pressure tore through his body, almost making his body explode.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three hundred meters was nothing, not even enough for him to reach the bottom of the abyss. From then on, no one else tried entering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was how that place had ended up being called a land of absolute death. Over countless years, there had never been anyone to obtain the slightest benefit from that place, but instead, countless people’s lives had been thrown in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And those people whose lives had been lost were all experts amongst experts, as those were the ones who dared try to probe its secrets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those who dared to come to the Abyss of Fiends were all extremely conceited people. They all had powerful cultivation bases or live-saving measures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But it was because of that conceit that they had lost their lives. They had used their fearlessness to tell other people a certain principle: being a show-off had its price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen had chosen to go to the Abyss of Fiends for two reasons. The first reason was curiosity. He was like those previous experts, extremely confident in his own strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other reason was that now that it had been four months since the Jiuli secret realm had opened, people had long since gone through all the marked places on the map.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many opportunities had already been taken away by other people. If he wanted to find more opportunities, he would have to search in areas not marked by the map.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the Jiuli secret realm was practically boundless. No one knew how large it was. Without the markings on the map, it was all too easy to get lost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, even if you didn’t get lost, if you weren’t able to get back in time for the closing of the secret realm, you wouldn’t even be able to leave alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only after considering it for a long time that Long Chen had decided to set his sights on the Abyss of Fiends. Furthermore, he wasn’t one hundred percent set on entering. He simply wanted to experience what the infamous Abyss of Fiends was like.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it really was too dangerous, he wouldn’t force it. So at most he would just leave after arriving, and all that would happen was that he would waste some time. Long Chen was quite confident in his fleeing skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen was just advancing forward when he heard a bang in the distance. He felt a strong gale surge over him. There were people fighting ahead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was a bit surprised to encounter a fight, but within the Jiuli secret realm, fights erupted everywhere and all the time. No one knew just how many died each day in here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Jiuli secret realm was dangerous, but the greatest danger still came from your fellow humans. Ninety-nine percent of the people that died within the secret realm died to fighting other disciples. It was quite the irony.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Long Chen was still very curious about this and so he quickened his footsteps. It was in a human’s nature to like to watch the action. Even if he didn’t interfere, it was good just to see what was going on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dozens of miles were crossed in a flash by Long Chen. He saw four people fighting in the distance. He was slightly surprised to see one of them was a woman, and that she was fighting one against three. Those four were all Favored, and she was repeatedly forced to retreat, fighting as she fled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But with their advantage in numbers, those three refused to give up. As for the woman, all alone, she was outmatched. She was already covered in quite a few injuries, blood flowing down her robes. However, she still clenched her teeth and fought a bloody battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Three against one? Boring.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen shook his head. This kind of slaughter was practically a constant show within the Jiuli secret realm. Long Chen had never considered himself to be some warrior of justice, some chivalrous hero. He just watched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the Jiuli secret realm, you couldn’t trust any other person. You could only trust yourself. That was something Long Chen had already instilled in the other monastery disciples before entering. He naturally wouldn’t make such a low level mistake himself.</span></p>

He had no desire to fight the strong to help the weak. All he wanted was to protect the people close to him.</span></p>

Women were always the most troublesome, and if he could avoid trouble, he should.</span></p>

Putting on airs? Was he praising them or cursing them? The three of them were infuriated, and the one whose sword was being grabbed by Long Chen’s hand cursed, “You little wretch, just die!”</span></p>
