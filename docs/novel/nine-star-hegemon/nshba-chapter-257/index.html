He roared and crazily charged at that Corrupt Favored. Runes lit up all over his body, shining so intensely, they made him look like a blazing sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lei Qianshang’s death caused everyone’s blood to boil. He was the first monastery disciple who had sacrificed their life from the start of the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one would have thought that the first of them to die would be a powerful core disciple. Everything had happened too suddenly. No one had expected that Favored who had been struck by two heavy blows would suddenly bore through the earth to launch a sneak attack on Lei Qianshang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“KILL!”</span></p>

They didn’t even wait for the rest of the Corrupt disciples to charge forward before going out to face them.</span></p>

Although they had once been enemies with him, those small offenses were nothing compared to the Corrupt disciples they were facing. Everyone had long since forgotten about any of their old enmities and become true comrades.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lei Qianshang’s death also caused Long Chen’s blood to boil. Killing intent surged out of his heart. But he still needed to stay cool-headed for the moment.</span></p>

What he wanted was victory. For him, victory meant bringing back more of his companions alive.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lei Qianshang and Gu Yang’s previous blows had been extremely heavy. That Favored was already dealing with some internal injuries.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Tang Wan-er and them were just too powerful. That was especially true of Tang Wan-er. He had to be extremely careful when blocking her attacks.</span></p>

Their attacks surpassed those of an ordinary core disciple. He, a Favored, was actually helpless against the five of their attacks. He was completely tied down by them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stay cool-headed! Maintain your formations!” Long Chen saw that many disciples were no longer thinking due to their fury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You should be more concerned about yourself!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why don’t you just kill yourself. I’m too lazy to do it personally.” That red-robed man’s eyes were completely icy. He looked at Long Chen like an emperor looked at a beggar. “You should cherish this moment and hurry up. If you wait for me to change ideas, death will become something extremely luxurious for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen nodded. Taking out a golden saber, he viciously slashed it at that person’s head. “Go fuck yourself!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen had long since been holding back a stomach of anger. After his orders, everyone had gotten back on the right track. There was no longer a need for him to be a commander of anything, and so he no longer had any misgivings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This idiot here had actually told him to go kill himself, as if personally killing him would be an insult to himself. How could he possibly still restrain himself?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah, you really don’t know how to appreciate kindness-” That person was enraged that Long Chen would actually dare attack him, a Favored. His sword slashed out to meet Long Chen’s saber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he had only just spoken when a terrifying force sent him flying. He had only casually swung out a blow, while Long Chen had used his full strength. The difference between the two was simply too great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Continuous bangs rang out as a figure shot back, crashing through countless Corrupt disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Corrupt disciples who were hit by that figure exploded into bloody mist. He was like a cannonball going straight through their ranks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Corrupt Elders who were watching from a distance had seen that four Favored had been held up by others. They had just been about to give an order to the remaining Favored to quickly kill Long Chen and then the Scarlet Flame Snow Wolf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Snow was simply too terrifying. He was constantly releasing wind blades, causing huge casualties amongst the Corrupt disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But before they could give that order, Long Chen had sent that Favored flying with a single saber. That person had simply been too overconfident, thinking that with his strength, killing someone at the weak Blood Condensation realm was a complete insult to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The result was that he wasn’t insulted, but that he was completely humiliated. That Favored flew back for almost a mile before stabilizing himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He felt his arms were about to break, and a huge nick had been cut into the weapon that had been bestowed to him by one of his elders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But before he could feel any pain about his weapon, Long Chen had already arrived in front of him, once more slashing down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You cuckold</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;idiot, you want me to kill myself? If you want to keep acting pompous, then just keep acting, I’ll let you act…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen’s Devil Decapitator consecutively slashed out, each time causing heaven and earth to tremble. Terrifying qi waves sent the surrounding Corrupt disciples flying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others were clashing intensely on the frontlines. Only Long Chen had charged into the Corrupt ranks alone to crazily attack that Favored.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Each time Long Chen attacked, the morale of the Righteous disciples would rise. No matter at what time, whenever they saw Long Chen attacking, it felt as if their blood was boiling with passion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boss Long Chen has taken action! Let us kill them all!” shouted Guo Ran. His crossbow was continuously shooting out, focusing on wherever the Corrupt disciples were most packed. That way he wouldn’t have to worry about accidentally injuring Righteous disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beside Guo Ran were a dozen disciples in charge of defending him. Guo Ran was currently specialized in attacking from a distance; if any enemies approached him, he would be done for.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following Long Chen’s actions, the monastery’s disciples were all filled with an inexhaustible strength, crazily cutting down those Corrupt disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monastery’s disciples were extremely well coordinated and were unafraid of death. They were practically even more vicious than the Corrupt disciples, and the sight of them cutting through their ranks caused a chill to run through their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other Righteous disciples were also impassioned when they saw how glorious the monastery’s disciples were. They coordinated with them, focusing on defending their backs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind the monastery’s fighting disciples were the disciples from the Healing Hall. They were weaker in terms of strength and were only capable of healing everyone’s wounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But there were a dozen people amongst them who were exceptions to that. They were the experts from Skywood Palace. Skywood Palace had only sent these dozen disciples to this battle as support.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, although their numbers were few, they were all on the core disciple level. They were capable of both offense and defense. They might not be as strong as Chu Yao, but to compare them to members of the Healing Hall was laughable. They were more than capable enough of protecting themselves on this battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They directly rushed across the frontlines, healing everyone as quickly as they were injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their healing method was not the same as the monastery’s. They didn’t even need to touch a person’s body. They could simply form a hand seal and a vine would grow out of the earth, wrapping around the injured person. Powerful life energy would immediately flow into that person’s body.</span></p>
