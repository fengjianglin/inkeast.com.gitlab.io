No, it’s a bit dark, and there’s some sort of powerful energy inside it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen couldn’t help being a bit curious towards this thing in his hand. Its outer shape was similar to a spirit stone, but it wasn’t translucent. Instead, it was pitch-black.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was around the size of a baby’s fist. There were powerful spiritual qi fluctuations coming from within, but those fluctuations were completely different from ordinary spirit stones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, it’s a wind spirit stone!” Long Chen was startled. Wind spirit stones were extremely rare. They contained powerful wind attribute energy. More importantly, they contained the mysteries and profundities of wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A wind attribute expert would be able to absorb the energy from within, and while doing so, would be connected to the true mysteries of wind. That would be a huge assistance to their cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, this a wind spirit stone. I managed to accidentally obtain it from an extremely windy area. Once I recognized it, I immediately ran, but as a result…” Xu Yang hatefully glared at the Favored’s corpse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite being so careful, someone had still noticed some clues and chased after him. This Favored hadn’t even known what he had obtained. Just because of a gut feeling, he had chased him in order to kill him and steal his treasures. That was truly hateful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he hadn’t run into Long Chen, Xu Yang would have already become a rotting corpse in this wilderness. But now he had not only managed to keep his life, he had also profited by becoming a Favored. His gratefulness to Long Chen could no longer be expressed through words, and so the only thing he could do was offer up this treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Long, you have to take it, or I really won’t be able to return your favor,” said Xu Yang completely sincerely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although this wind spirit stone was precious, it was not more precious than his life. Then adding on that he had also become a Favored, he really owed Long Chen far too much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This thing’s not bad, but I don’t want it.” Seeing Xu Yang’s expression change, Long Chen waved his hand and continued, “This thing isn’t useful to me, and I can also tell you have wind attribute energy, which is the only reason you were able to run for so long.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Long… I…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen cut him off. “It’s fine. I was just doing what I wanted. I’m not actually so kindhearted and virtuous. I just didn’t like that little fellow’s pretentious mouth. In any case, I pretty much understand what’s going on inside there. You keep this and do your best to increase your strength. Otherwise, you might die at any moment in this place.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After saying that, Long Chen pressed the wind spirit stone back into Xu Yang’s hand and left. In just a short time, he disappeared from Xu Yang’s gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tightly clenching the wind spirit stone, Xu Yang’s gaze was filled with worship. Long Chen’s magnanimity and imposingness had completely won him over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t dare tarry any longer, and left to find a hidden place. He needed to stabilize his Dao-mark and refine this wind spirit stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Long Chen, this was the first time he felt a trace of warmth for Righteous disciples since entering the Jiuli secret realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t the entire Righteous path that was broken. However, the majority that Long Chen encountered were all a bunch of idiots filled with evil tricks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, these idiots were the ‘outstanding elites’ of the larger sects. Could it be that larger sects were just concentration camps for idiots?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen couldn’t help sighing. Those lofty and aloof fellows all used their noses to look down on people while also harboring all kinds of wicked intentions inside. Instead, it was those who came from more impoverished origins that were more magnanimous and virtuous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen believed that if he had saved a disciple from a large sect, that disciple might not even consider it a big deal. In fact, he might even believe he was entitled to being saved due to his status. People saving him was simply as it should be. All he would do is perhaps toss out a little reward and leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, if you saved him once, you would have to continue saving him in the future. Otherwise, if you didn’t help him the second time, he would consider you a bad person and hate you.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s you, Long Chen?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen had advanced almost a hundred miles when the number of people ahead of him had suddenly increased. There were many people here who were slowly advancing, and as soon as he arrived, several monastery disciples recognized him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s Long Chen?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The one the first monastery sent out an arrest warrant for?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He looks like someone who puts on airs, but who would have thought he was actually a sex fiend?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Quite a few people were cautiously watching and whispering from a distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ones to stop him were two powerful Favored. The two of them were wearing monastery robes, one from the eighty-seventh monastery, and one from the ninety-second monastery.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Long Chen, you perverted traitor, how dare you swagger around here? Hurry up kneel in repentance,” roared one of the Favored.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them hadn’t been purposely sent to target him by the first monastery. But as members from the top one hundred monasteries, they naturally felt incomparably powerful in comparison to those from the last place monastery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had also seen that photographic jade of Long Chen killing that woman. But that image was only of him killing her, and contained nothing before or after. They had no idea about Long Chen’s true strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So as soon as the two of them saw him, they immediately put on a chivalrous act, taking the place of the heavens to punish Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die you perverted traitor!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Favored that was shouting was directly sent flying by a slap from Long Chen. His body rapidly spun in the air in a beautiful arc, and with his teeth flying through the air, it somehow managed to be extremely aesthetic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Chen’s face-slapping technique had already reached the level where he would be able to start up his own sect around it. Even if the Favored had been on guard, he still wouldn’t have been able to dodge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the distant disciples who were cautiously watching were stunned now. A powerful Favored had been slapped flying the instant he walked up?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other Favored only reacted a moment later. He quickly unsheathed his sword, but he only got it out halfway before the handle was kicked by Long Chen, causing it to return to his sheath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That person was startled, and before he even realized what was going on, a large hand slapped across his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a muffled groan, he also flew through the air, following the exact same arc as the previous Favored. In fact, even the speed at which he revolved through the air was the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, everyone was truly flabbergasted. Two powerful Favored were like naughty children in front of Long Chen. This was not even a fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the two Favored were dumbfounded. They hadn’t even realized what was going on before they had been slapped. Crawling up from the ground, their heads were a complete mess, and they felt like they might faint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their heads only became clear after a couple breaths. Looking from the stunned Righteous disciples to the smiling Long Chen, their fury immediately erupted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll kill you Long Chen!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them roared at the same time and charged at Long Chen. Sword Qi surged out of their swords and completely enveloped him.</span></p>
