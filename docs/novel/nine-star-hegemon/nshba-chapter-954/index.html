 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Corrupt path’s two Kings didn’t even think before turning to flee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">RUMBLE! A huge broadsword crashed down toward them. This was Feng Xinglie’s attack, and it felt like the world was filled with this sword. Whether you went into the heavens or dove into the earth, you couldn’t possibly dodge it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the Kings were startled by Feng Xinglie’s power, especially the Kings from Pill Valley, the ancient races, and the ancient family alliance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although their cultivation bases had all reached the King realm, in terms of actual combat power, practically no one could challenge the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s fighters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Split the Heavens 3!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both the Corrupt Kings were drawn into his attack. The two of them hastily activated their King items to block.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Space exploded. Everyone was shocked to see their King items both shatter from just this one attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ancient race’s King gulped. He thanked his luck that he hadn’t provoked Feng Xinglie, or he would definitely have died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two Corrupt Kings coughed up blood. One of them suddenly took out a yellow talisman and crushed it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not good, it’s a Heaven Fleeing Talisman!” Li Changfeng instantly recognized the rune. That was a treasure that had circulated down from ancient times. Such talismans were things that practically no one could make in the current era.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he wasn’t full of despair, that King also wouldn’t have had the heart to waste such a treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xinglie refused to believe it and once more attacked. But inconceivably, his attack went right through the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was like they were just a shadow. His attack was unable to reach them. One of the Corrupt Kings sneered, “Xuantian Dao Sect, just wait! We’ll return!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After crushing the Heaven Fleeing Talisman, they were surrounded by strange runes. Space began to twist, and it was possible to see that they were about to be teleported away. Suddenly, the sound of a sword coming out its sheath rang out like the roar of a dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A blinding light pierced through the void. Those two Corrupt Kings were both blown apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soft snick of a sword returning to its sheath sounded in everyone’s ears. They all looked in shock at Ling Yunzi. That attack had come from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They didn’t dare to believe it. His attack was able to ignore spatial fluctuations and break the Heaven Fleeing Talisman?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although sword cultivators were supposed to be the number one attackers, Ling Yunzi’s sword seemed to have already reached a higher realm. That kind of realm was something none of the other Kings here could touch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Everyone, there’s no need to be so surprised. Junior’s Sword Dao is a bit special and has a special effect against that kind of spatial energy,” explained Ling Yunzi calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he was calm, the other Kings’ hearts clenched. That sword attack of his was absolutely horrifying. It was full of destructive will that no one could block.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Feng Xinglie’s attack had also been amazing, its power was within the scope of their understanding. But Ling Yunzi’s attack made them see something from a higher realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you really think you can escape now? Xue You, do you think I’m not here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The deaths of their two Kings caused panic amongst the Corrupt experts. They fled in every direction, but by this point, that was not possible. Long Chen ignored everyone else and arrived right in front of Xue You, blocking his escape route.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Corrupt path’s half-step Kings were killed by a random blow from Lu Minghan. But after killing the half-step Kings, he stopped. He didn’t kill the Foundation Forging experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Guo Ran and the others charged forward. Their surging morale that was supposed to have been used against the Remote Heaven Gang now ended up on the Corrupt path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen…” Xue You stared at Long Chen with terror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Double Dragon Destruction.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen didn’t waste any words. He directly unleashed his strongest attack, and Xue You immediately vomited blood. A scale-covered hand than slammed onto Xue You’s body, directly blowing him apart. His soul was also extinguished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen was all too familiar with Xue You’s techniques. Originally, even if he had wanted to kill him, it would have taken a few exchanges to do so. But Xue You had been too terrified of him to even fight back. As a result, he was killed in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen found it a bit unexpected that he had killed him in one blow. He also found it a bit hard to accept. Standing in the air, he sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He should be happy to have killed Xue You. Little Snow’s death was now fully avenged, and he could put down the burden in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But in reality, he had already put down that burden after Meng Qi’s plea. So he didn’t know what he was feeling now that he had killed Xue You.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The chief offenders had been killed, but Little Snow hadn’t been revived. Meng Qi’s words were right. The only reason he had wanted to kill so many people was to vent. He wanted to numb the pain and guilt he felt for Little Snow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Little Snow had died, there was a chance for his revival. The body wouldn’t be his, but the soul and memories would remain. Then Little Snow would be the same Little Snow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen suddenly felt as if he was incredibly weary. He needed to change his tempo, or with this kind of mental state, there was no way for him to deal with future challenges. He had to find his hopeful and energetic self.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kill!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a furious roar brought him back to reality. He saw Wilde summon the Barbarian Blood Bronze Body and kill a Foundation Forging expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meng Qi, Tang Wan-er, Gu Yang, Guo Ran, Yue Zifeng, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan were also going all-out. Even the Dragonblood warriors were in the fray.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing all these incredibly powerful disciples battling across realms as if it were easy made Li Changfeng feel like flowers were blooming in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He hadn’t expected that this Eastern Wasteland branch of the Xuantian Dao Sect would give birth to such a terrifying batch of disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was especially true of Meng Qi, Gu Yang, and the others. They were killing Foundation Forging experts easily. In fact, these disciples might even be a match for the head sect’s elites.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ling Yunzi stood there with his hands clasped behind him. From the start, he only had eyes for Yue Zifeng. At this point, Yue Zifeng had killed over ten Foundation Forging experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Other than Wilde, he was the one who had killed the most experts. That clearly showed the terrifying attack power of sword cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over two hundred Foundation Forging experts from the Corrupt path didn’t even last a couple of hours before being exterminated to the last. Not one of the Dragonblood warriors had died. That kind of combat power was shocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since everyone has come so far, why not have a chat inside the Xuantian Dao Sect?” said Li Changfeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then we’ll disturb you.” The Pill Valley’s King immediately agreed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xinglie and Ling Yunzi also agreed. Seeing that their sect master had returned with this group of unfamiliar people, the disciples that had remained in the Xuantian Dao Sect were all confused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big sister, it’s been hard on you.” Long Chen smiled at Shui Wuhen after she dissipated the barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wuhen, let me introduce you. These two are seniors from the head Xuantian Dao Sect,” said Ouyang Qiuyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Disciple greets seniors!” Shui Wuhen quickly bowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s fine, go back and rest. Qiuyu, you and Long Chen come over. Let’s talk,” said Li Changfeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a result, the three Kings from Pill Valley, the ancient races, and the ancient family alliance, as well as Ling Yunzi and Feng Xinglie, were invited inside the palace within the Xuantian Dao Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They all sat down. In this kind of situation, let alone Long Chen, not even Ouyang Qiuyu would normally be allowed to participate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Li Changfeng had grasped Long Chen’s temperament. He didn’t dare to make him stand, or he didn’t know what would happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to Long Chen, Ouyang Qiuyu was trembling in fear. But Long Chen didn’t stand on courtesy, sitting in a chair without a care. He knew a good show was about to start.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Changfeng started things off, saying, “Due to Long Chen’s matter, everyone has rushed over here from so far away. I, Li Changfeng, will represent the Xuantian Dao Sect in thanking you all for your care!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three Kings from Pill Valley, the ancient races, and the ancient family alliance said a few courteous words. But Feng Xinglie refused to play along with this, impatiently saying, “We’re all busy, so if you have something to say, hurry up and say it. After I say a few final words to Long Chen, I have to be on my way.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words were coarse, but Li Changfeng didn’t get angry because of them. He knew that the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s people were simply like this. Even when speaking to their elders, they spoke like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright then. To save everyone’s time, I’ll get to the point. Do the brothers from Pill Valley, the ancient races, and the ancient family alliance, have anything to suggest on how Long Chen’s matter was handled?” asked Li Changfeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three Kings exchanged a glance. It was the ancient races’ King who said, “The ancient races always developed peacefully without interfering with the Righteous path. We’ve been harmonious for many years. But this time, Long Chen went too far. Even if he had conflicts with the ancient races’ disciples, he could have simply said them out loud and everyone could have properly resolved their grievances without killing. Furthermore, he killed far too many-”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A snickering sound from Long Chen caused him to come to a sudden stop.</span></p>
