 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Feng Xiao-zi, you dare?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone looked up to see that at some unknown point, a huge crow had appeared in the sky, flying straight for Chu Yao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the back of the crow was Feng Xiao-zi smiling sinisterly. Forming hand seals, a spiritual arrow shot out at Chu Yao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, Chu Yao was completely focused on her Wood Spirit Union. All her Spiritual Strength was with Long Chen, so it was impossible for her to defend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as that spiritual arrow was about to reach Chu Yao, a huge spiritual shield appeared in front of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the arrow struck the shield, they both exploded. A ripple of Spiritual Strength erupted in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That ripple rapidly spread, and due to how close she was, it also enveloped Chu Yao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Violet Phoenix Sparrow let out a pained cry. Magical Beasts feared spiritual attacks, and now it almost dropped straight out of the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Chu Yao, she turned pale and coughed up blood, turning her robes a scarlet red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her defensive strength was essentially zero right now. Just this spiritual ripple caused her to suffer an injury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, the three leaves on Long Chen’s back also trembled intensely, and his aura fluctuated. That was immediately sensed by Huo Wufang and the others, and they immediately launched a flurry of attacks, causing Long Chen to repeatedly retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Wufang cried out with delight, “Excellent work, Feng Xiao-zi! If you kill that woman, I will give your Wind Spirit Pavilion a twenty percent discount on all medicinal pills!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These words might sound a bit unscrupulous, but they made Feng Xiao-zi’s heart pound wildly. Medicinal pills were a must-have for a sect’s growth. It was their greatest guarantee, and each year, over sixty percent of a sect’s expenses would be for medicinal pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Huo Wufang followed up on his promise, then the Wind Spirit Pavilion would save a huge amount of money in the future, making Feng Xiao-zi ecstatic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Many thanks, brother Huo. Leave this slut to me!” Feng Xiao-zi shouted, his voice quivering slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Previously, he had almost died to a single attack from Long Chen. If it hadn’t been for his teleportation talisman, he would have already died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, with a flying Magical Beast, Feng Xiao-zi had arrived a while ago. He had just stealthily watched, not daring to approach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was because he was out of teleportation talismans. If Long Chen once more attacked him, he would definitely die. Most hateful of all, with a spiritual expert like Meng Qi present, there was no way for him to use any spiritual attacks to kill him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So he had been hiding in the distance this entire time. Now when he finally saw a chance to have Long Chen killed, he pounced, sneak attacking Chu Yao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Meng Qi hadn’t discovered him so soon, Chu Yao would have already died. And once Chu Yao died, her Wood Spirit Union would disappear, and Long Chen would instantly lose his spiritual qi and any ability to fight back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Feng Xiao-zi, you really want to do this?!” Meng Qi flew her Violet Phoenix Sparrow to block Feng Xiao-zi’s path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Listening to Meng Qi’s orders, Chu Yao’s Violet Phoenix Sparrow flew into the distance. However, it couldn’t get too far, or that would exceed the scope of the Wood Spirit Union.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You traitor, if you were smart, you’d immediately leave and not interfere. Hmph, we’ll settle our debts once we leave the secret realm!” Feng Xiao-zi was filled with rancor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meng Qi was the woman he had selected. She was an immortal fairy-like beauty. But she had shown favor for a brat like Long Chen who didn’t have any background, and because of that, had ended up cutting ties with him. That had sparked his jealousy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If that’s so, then come. As long as I, Meng Qi, still draw breath, don’t even think about harming a single hair on Chu Yao’s head!” Meng Qi slowly formed hand seals in front of her, her Spiritual Strength completely activating, causing the void to quiver.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">People were shocked to see another woman appear behind Meng Qi, one who looked the exact same as her but was many times larger. That figure had to be thirty meters tall. She was like a floating immortal, grand and solemn, giving people a desire to kneel down in worship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, using my Wind Spirit Pavilion’s secret technique against me, you really are a disgraceful traitor! Today, I will clean up my sect!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a furious roar, an illusory figure appeared behind Feng Xiao-zi, the exact same technique as Meng Qi. The two of them both formed hand seals and closed their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dreamsoul Battle Armor!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them shouted the same thing at the same time. Those illusory figures behind them both seemed to come to life and charge at the other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those two huge illusions carried swords as they crazily clashed up in the sky. A terrifying pressure surged out from them, one that made everyone feel heavy, almost as if they were stuck in a chaotic stream of water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heavens, this is how powerful soul cultivators are?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although they were fighting up in the sky, the people below all felt sharp pains in their soul, almost as if their souls were about to be torn apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soul cultivators were one of the most unusual types of cultivators, and they were also one of the most terrifying. They could kill people without a sound, seemingly without even doing anything. That was practically unblockable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If your soul wasn’t strong enough, you would instantly die to a spiritual attack. So the entire battlefield was affected by their fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Spiritual Protection!” Lu Fang-er stopped attacking and had her Violet Phoenix Sparrow fly down. She joined everyone else and quickly formed a translucent barrier around them all. That allowed the people on her side to fight without being affected by those spiritual ripples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Currently, Chu Yao was far away enough that she wouldn’t be impacted. However, without her present, their entire group’s defensive strength dropped. Ye Zhiqiu could only do her best to take Chu Yao’s place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her ice energy wasn’t that much weaker defensively compared to Chu Yao’s wood energy, but it was lacking in flexibility. She was only able to look after a portion of her group and not the entire battlefield. However, there was no better option.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Those two women have both been pinned down. There won’t be any more spiritual attacks! Everyone, charge!” A top expert from the Corrupt path suddenly shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The thing they had been the most afraid of previously was the spiritual attacks from Meng Qi and Lu Fang-er. But now Meng Qi was tied down by Feng Xiao-zi, and Lu Fang-er was busy defending everyone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the aftershocks of Meng Qi’s fierce battle with Feng Xiao-zi caused them to feel an intense pain in their souls, they couldn’t miss this chance. They all charged forward in unprecedented numbers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the Righteous disciples that had fallen back now raised their weapons and charged in. A huge tide of enemies flooded over Long Chen’s group, and they immediately landed in a crisis.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Reduce the defensive area! Mo Gate disciples on the inside, Huayun Sect disciples on the outside. Brothers from the 108th monastery, split up and start a massacre! Sister Zhiqiu, don’t focus on defense anymore. Use offense as defense!” Guo Ran hastily shouted when he saw this tide-like mass of attacks coming for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, he clenched his teeth, and countless little holes opened on his chestplate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“DIE!” Countless black lights shot out from Guo Ran’s chestplate. The closest experts were all turned into pulp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most terrifying of all was that this time, Guo Ran’s attack wasn’t just a single wave. Instead, it was a continuous onslaught of needles. At the same time, he also activated the mechanisms on his arms and legs. Guo Ran had truly become ruthless this time. He was undergoing a clearance sale, and not a single item could be left behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those needles Guo Ran had forged had become the most deadly weapons now. The enemies in front of him practically exploded, their flesh flying everywhere. This scene was incredibly bloody.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, their entire group had fallen into its most dangerous moment. Each one of them was fighting all-out. Each one of them killed so many that even their eyes turned scarlet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But even so, there were still too many enemies. Guo Ran’s assault only continued for a few breaths’ time before all his inventory was emptied. He could only rely on the two sabers in his hands to attack now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was tightly surrounded by Righteous and Corrupt experts. Occasionally, one of them would fall to an enemy’s blade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Zhiqiu’s ice energy was activated to its peak. She killed enemies rapidly, but those Corrupt disciples were completely unafraid, and there was simply no end to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, the Corrupt disciples were like hyenas that had seen blood. Their eyes shone with a cruel light as they continued charging forward, unafraid of death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, Zheng Wenlong, Mo Nian, and Hua Biluo were completely surrounded and isolated on their own. The ones attacking them were all experts amongst experts, and they were unable to help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wilde was currently fighting Xue Wuya and two other peak experts. They were filled with grievance as they were suppressed by him, but there was no way Wilde could kill them in a short time. To be able to entangle three peak experts, Wilde’s strength was truly shocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wan-er was also fighting a peak expert on her own. That was already her limit. On the other side, Yue Zifeng and Yin Wushuang were still completely equal. It could be said that all their strongest experts had been tied down. They were truly in a crisis.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their top fighters had all been tied down and were relatively even. But in terms of ordinary fighters, the difference was just too great. After all, there were just too many of the Righteous and Corrupt experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was truly fortunate that Long Chen had made plans for this worst-case scenario and had spent the last few months focusing on raising everyone’s collective strength. Everyone had now tempered four bones and reached at least the mid Bone Forging realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Otherwise, such an intense battle would have been impossible for them to endure for so long. And even so, their battle was extremely desperate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, everyone’s hopes were on Long Chen. Although he was being attacked by four of the strongest experts here, Guo Ran and the others had faith in him. In their eyes, Long Chen was always undefeatable. In the end, whether this situation could reverse would all depend on Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, Long Chen was repeatedly retreating in the face of their ferocious attacks. Due to Chu Yao being injured, the Wood Spirit Union had been affected, and his spiritual qi was fluctuating intensely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four of them were taking advantage of this time. Long Chen could only defend and wait for Chu Yao to adjust it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he had expected, after several breaths’ time, his spiritual qi once more became steady. Long Chen took a deep breath.</span></p>
