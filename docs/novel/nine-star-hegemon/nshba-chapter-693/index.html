 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A large battle will erupt in a bit. This battle isn’t suitable for you. To put it frankly, you’ll only hold me back if you stay here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll stall them, and you run as far away as possible. Don’t say anything about wanting to stay with me even unto death. That kind of sappy line is too irritating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Once you run, hide yourself. Once I handle this matter, I will return to my identity as Long Chen. At that time, you can openly return to Biluo Mountain and say that after undergoing a life and death battle, you finally awakened as a Celestial.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“At that time, you’ll have my favor, as well as a relationship with the Fang family. Then you can openly fight with Hua Jinrong for the position of the future family head.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After saying that, Long Chen threw Hua Biluo into the distance. But while he threw Hua Biluo forward, he borrowed that force to fly back. The closest one behind him was the Corrupt Celestial who was also using the Netherworld Ghost Steps. His speed was the greatest, and he had thrown off all the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For Long Chen to suddenly shoot backward, he hadn’t even understood what was happening when Long Chen’s fist ruthlessly smashed into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blood filled the air as if two bloody stars had collided. That Corrupt Celestial directly exploded from the impact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The benefit of being faster was not just that you could chase faster, but also that you could reincarnate faster. Now he would definitely get a head start on the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Die!” Suddenly, a black light shot straight at Long Chen. Long Chen snorted and shot a blazing flame spear at the black light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But what surprised him was that the black light wasn’t affected at all. It went straight through the flame spear without weakening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this close distance, Long Chen felt an incredibly resentful will coming from the black light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s actually a spiritual attack.” Long Chen immediately understood why his flame spear had been useless. This attack was fundamentally not solid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black-white-eyed Celestial had an Enchanted item called the Nine Yin Soul Locking Mirror. This attack had come from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This mirror had a formation carved into it that would absorb dead people’s Spiritual Strength. Then through another formation, that Spiritual Strength became an extremely sinister spiritual poison, becoming a special spiritual attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This kind of spiritual poison was extremely terrifying. Anyone whose soul was weak would instantly die, their soul dissipating. Even people with strong souls would only be able to last for an incense stick’s worth of time. That was also why that Righteous Celestial had been instantly killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, a heretical skill is all it is.” Long Chen sneered and he slammed his palm into the black light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Long Chen dared to touch the black light, the Corrupt Celestial sneered with ridicule. That black light was something even he didn’t dare to touch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BANG!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was appalled to see that the black light was directly blown apart by Long Chen. Then seeing thin thunderbolts surging over Long Chen’s palm, his expression immediately changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can control thunderforce?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen sneered and didn’t reply. He shot forward at him, the thunderforce on his hand growing brighter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Evil Spirit Shield!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen was too fast, and he didn’t give him any time to dodge. The Celestial didn’t even have time to summon his Cry of the Heavenly Daos. Forming a hand seal, a black shield appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That shield was something he had formed from the energy of evil spirits. It wasn’t just extremely strong defensively, it was also very tough and flexible. It could be used to fight for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But what stunned him was that this Evil Spirit Shield that he was completely confident in was as weak as glass in front of Long Chen’s fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BANG!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen’s fist smashed through the shield and landed on the Celestial’s chest. The sound of bones breaking rang out, and he vomited blood as he shot back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen was just about to chase and take that person’s life when another Celestial shot forward, slashing his sword at Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Celestial was much smarter, and he had already summoned his Cry of the Heavenly Daos. His attack caused space to tremble. He was clearly extremely powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But a thunderforce-covered hand tightly caught this sword. His body went numb, and he had a bad feeling. He was just about to retreat when Long Chen’s other fist smashed onto his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blood mist erupted. Long Chen’s strength simply wasn’t something this person’s physical body could endure. Even having summoned the Cry of the Heavenly Daos, the Celestial’s body still blew up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the Enlightenment Palace Star was still in the cyclone-condensing period, Long Chen’s current strength had already risen to a point where it terrified himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been a long time since he had had such a refreshing battle. He didn’t need any weapons, nor did he need any techniques. With just his bare fists, he dominated these Celestials. His energy surged out of him endlessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Celestials were all horrified by his strength. At this time, the black-white-eyed Celestial finally had a breather and ordered, “Everyone, work together! Don’t let him take us on one by one!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The remaining thirteen Celestials all surrounded and attacked Long Chen. Long Chen was submerged within the domain of their manifestations. Being suppressed by these many Heavenly Dao manifestations, he felt his strength falling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen activated the Nirvana Scripture, and endless flames appeared around him. The Nirvana Scripture caused endless flame runes to appear around him, and a beautiful chanting resounded throughout the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The manifestations of the Cry of the Heavenly Daos were no longer able to suppress him. Long Chen felt the pressure lighten a great deal, and his fists danced as he fought a crazy battle with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Explosions rocked the sky. Long Chen’s fists were like heavy mountains crashing onto their weapons. Each attack caused a rumbling explosive sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen had trained in the Lightning Rushing Hand. That was originally just a Heaven class Battle Skill. It was no magical art. But with the power of his tribulation thunderforce, he was still able to face off against their weapons barehanded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Long Chen’s fists danced, he seemed like a god of war, appearing incomparably valiant. Even surrounded by thirteen Celestials, he wasn’t at a disadvantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen no longer had to care about first rank Celestials. He just had to be careful about any strange Enchanted weapons they had, for example, that strange mirror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But that mirror did not have limitless energy. Once its energy was used up, it was just trash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">True Enchanted weapons were not things these ordinary Celestials could use. A Celestial’s most powerful point was their Cry of the Heavenly Daos, which could reduce their enemies’ strength while increasing their own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But to use an Enchanted weapon required an ocean’s worth of spiritual yuan. Most people’s Dantians, also known as their qi seas, all contained a similar amount of energy at each cultivation realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only when a person entered Sea Expansion would their qi sea grow dozens of times larger, sometimes even over a hundred times larger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only once a person possessed that kind of enormous energy could they truly use an Enchanted weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was also why Meridian Opening Celestials could dominate Xiantian experts, but Xiantian Celestials were unable to do the same to the Sea Expansion experts. It was because the Sea Expansion experts possessed enough energy to bury the Celestial.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Xiantian Celestial’s energy could be likened to a huge tree, while a Sea Expansion expert’s energy was grass. When there was too much grass, it could still easily crush a tree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So although some of these people carried Enchanted weapons, they were at best quasi Enchanted items. They were merely used to shock and intimidate others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Long Chen fought, he was familiarizing himself with his new strength as well as trying to figure out his opponents’ relationship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were eleven people here from the Corrupt path. That was something easy to tell from their auras, weapons, and techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The remaining two were from the Righteous path. He hadn’t expected that the idiots from the Corrupt path actually didn’t know how to adjust themselves to the circumstances. They had been duped by the Huo family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was no wonder the Corrupt path never worked together with the Righteous path. If they did, then this world would probably be united by the Righteous path in just a few years. They really had no idea how to scheme.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But thinking about it, Long Chen thought it made sense. The Corrupt path rarely had dealings with other people. If the Fang family ended up in control of the Pill Tower, then all their hard work currying favor with the Huo family would be ruined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that time, they would have to create a new relationship with the Fang family. That was extremely irritating to them, and they would rather support the Huo family. Then it would be simpler.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BANG!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not good! Get back!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, one of the Celestials made a careless mistake, and Long Chen caught his saber with his hand. The other Celestials hastily attacked Long Chen with their full strength, wanting to save that person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regretfully, Long Chen didn’t give them that chance. Holding the blade, just like that, he pushed, slamming the hilt toward its owner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That person tried to abandon his saber and flee, but the hilt still struck him in the stomach. A terrifying force directly blew apart his body. He didn’t even have a chance to recover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Borrowing this momentum, Long Chen charged into their midst.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One Celestial’s weapon was directly smashed apart by Long Chen’s fist. That weapon wasn’t an Enchanted weapon, making it much weaker than the others. This was one of the moments where Long Chen could show off his brute strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following the destruction of his weapon, he shot back, vomiting blood. If another Celestial hadn’t slashed a sword at Long Chen’s back, he would have already died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen dodged the sword and then suddenly formed three extremely complicated hand seals. A one-foot sphere appeared in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as that sphere appeared, the Celestials’ expressions changed. That sphere was composed of over ten differently colored flames. Those flames were raging against each other, and the pressure they emitted caused them to feel a chill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Blaze Explosion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen simply tossed the flame sphere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BOOM!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Endless flames exploded, instantly devouring all of them. These Celestials were horrified, never having expected Long Chen to have such a terrifying flame magical art.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Celestials resisted with their full strength, but the flame sphere contained all the beast flame energy Long Chen had. He hadn’t held back at all because he had the Earth Flame to protect himself. Thus, he could practically ignore these flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But while Long Chen had an Earth Flame to protect himself, the others didn’t. These people were too close. Some didn’t even have time to raise defenses before being incinerated into nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen hadn’t expected the Blaze Explosion skill to have so much power when used in conjunction with the Nirvana Scripture. It seemed the Nirvana Scripture was much stronger than he had expected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Celestials who managed to raise their defenses bitterly endured for a moment. But the terrifying heat still turned them into black masses of ash. A cold light shot through them, directly severing any chances of those ashes coming back to life.</span></p>
