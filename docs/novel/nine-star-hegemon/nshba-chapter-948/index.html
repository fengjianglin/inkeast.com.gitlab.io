 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His aura had completely transformed, but his outer appearance was still the same. His sword was sheathed on his back, and he wore snow-white robes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sect leader!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were delighted. This was the one hundred and eighth monastery’s sect leader from back then, Ling Yunzi! He had actually appeared here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With one slash of his sword, he cut a King in two. However, that King used some unknown technique to reconnect the two parts of his body. He looked in shock at Ling Yunzi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Other than Ling Yunzi, there was a middle-aged man in the air as well. Just now, a slash of his sword had blown back the ancient family alliance’s King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was extremely tall and muscular. It was like snakes were wriggling beneath his skin. He was bursting out with energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had a broadsword almost just as tall as him on his back. He was like an immovable mountain as he stood there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re from the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect?” demanded the ancient family alliance’s King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing that he came from the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, Long Chen didn’t find it odd at all. As soon as he had attacked, he had sensed the aura of Split the Heavens. Although the move he had used wasn’t Split the Heavens, he couldn’t have mistaken that aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That large man didn’t even glance at the King. He turned to Long Chen. “Not bad little fellow. Due to this mettle, you won’t be beaten too badly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His voice wasn’t loud, but it was like thunder in everyone’s ears. They all knew this person had to be a King and wouldn’t bother trying to flaunt his power in front of them. His voice was probably just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even from this distance, his voice shook their eardrums. If they were closer, wouldn’t they go deaf?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen didn’t know what was happening, but he knew he was helping him. There was no need for him to throw away his life anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Many thanks for helping, senior.” Long Chen hastily bowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The large man waved his hand. “Don’t do so many useless things. The reason I’ve come here is because I was ordered to come support you. Today, if you want to kill someone, then go ahead and kill them. If someone dares to interfere, I’ll cut off their heads. Ah, speaking of which, who are you? How have I never heard of you in Central Plains? It seems you are very powerful.” He turned to look at Ling Yunzi, battle intent soaring in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior brother is Ling Yunzi. Greetings, senior.” Ling Yunzi smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ling Yunzi? Why does that sound so familiar? Ah, didn’t the Heavenly Sword Sect obtain a peerless genius with that name who has already comprehended the Annihilation Sword Dao? Is that you?” said the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I am simply indebted to the Heavenly Sword Sect’s master and cultivating there. Senior brother overpraises me,” said Ling Yunzi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although his words were very calm, just hearing the name of the Heavenly Sword Sect was enough to shake everyone. The Heavenly Sword Sect was extremely famous on the Martial Heaven Continent. They only had a few hundred members, but they only accepted sword cultivators, and only sword cultivators that had comprehended sword intent at that. They were different from other sects and rarely interfered with mundane matters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were like a group of hermits that had isolated themselves from the world to cultivate. They rarely had any interactions with the rest of the world, but they were exceedingly terrifying experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Anyone could try to join the Heavenly Sword Sect. As long as they passed the test regarding the Sword Dao, they could join. After that, they would enjoy all the Heavenly Sword Sect’s resources given to sword cultivators.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the test was extremely strict, and focused on the Sword Dao. The probability of passing was less than one in ten thousand, and the price for failure was death. It was a cruel trial.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But every person who managed to pass would have their name carved onto the Heavenly Sword Sect’s Heavenly Sword Tablet at the front of the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been many years since someone had managed to pass the trial and join the Heavenly Sword Sect. But over a year ago, Ling Yunzi had managed to pass, and when his name had been carved onto the Heavenly Sword Tablet, it had caused his fame to explosively grow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why this Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s King would feel that his name was very familiar. He asked, “Don’t the Heavenly Sword Sect’s experts only cultivate the Sword Dao and not interfere in mundane matters? Why have you run over here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In truth, the Heavenly Sword Sect doesn’t require its members to act in any way, nor does it restrict our freedom. It just requires us to act according to our heart. There are some seniors who already have no ties to the rest of the world, so they don’t even leave the sect. There are also some who are completely engrossed in the Sword Dao and don’t care about anything else. However, I was never able to let my heart rest, and so the sect let me come out to settle my affairs. And now you see the result…” Ling Yunzi smiled at Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You have a relationship with Long Chen?” The large man was startled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not just any relationship. The reason I could attain my current height is all because of Long Chen. So whoever tries to make things hard on Long Chen today will meet their death.” Ling Yunzi looked at the three Kings, his voice was flat but full of unquestionable resolve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing that Ling Yunzi was this powerful because of Long Chen, everyone was startled. Even Long Chen was startled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen didn’t know that Ling Yunzi’s Annihilation Sword Dao was something he had comprehended after helping him erase the lightning tribulation energy within his body. He had comprehended the essence of annihilation, opening a completely new path for himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen, as you get stronger, your ability to cause trouble also grows.” Ling Yunzi looked from Long Chen to the mass of experts below.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, many thanks sect leader for your praise,” laughed Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that Ling Yunzi and this large man from the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect had arrived, the crisis had been resolved. Long Chen’s mood was no longer so heavy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wanted to ask Ling Yunzi what he had done during the past few years for his cultivation base to grow to such a shocking level, but now wasn’t the time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Only a man who dares to cause trouble is a real man. If you flinch and cower when you do everything, what’s the point of living. Originally, I was in seclusion, but I was ordered to take a trip here. Tch, that was irritating, so I was going to give you a beating to vent. However, your display is very satisfactory, so I won’t. I’ll leave this beating for later,” laughed the large man from the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect. He patted Long Chen on the shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Booming sounds rang out when his palm struck Long Chen’s shoulder. He felt like his bones were about to break.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, although you’re a bit small, this courage is not bad. Haha, truly not bad!” That large man examined Long Chen from head to toe like he was a treasure, causing Long Chen’s hair to stand on end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior…” said Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t call me senior. What an irritating word. I am Feng Xinglie and ranked third. You aren’t one of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s disciples yet, so you can call me third uncle. If you aren’t satisfied to be suppressed by me in terms of seniority, then hurry and raise your cultivation base. When you become a King, you can call me third brother,” said Feng Xinglie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was startled. How was it that Long Chen had such a close relationship with a King from the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Remote Heaven Gang’s patriarch’s expression became extremely ugly. The matter had developed out of his control. They could only watch. They didn’t even have the qualifications to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing two Kings stand by Long Chen’s side caused the other Kings to be startled and infuriated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The King from Pill Valley icily said, “Are you really going to harbor a criminal like Long Chen?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ling Yunzi was about to reply when Feng Xinglie took the initiative. ”There’s no need for so much bullshit. Although you’re from Pill Valley, you can’t represent Pill Valley’s higher-ups. You still aren't at that level. Furthermore, when did the Righteous path’s matters become something you can stick your nose into? Meddlesome dog.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You!” The Pill Valley’s King was infuriated. Feng Xinglie’s words were too ugly and didn’t give him face in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You? What you? I am here to support Long Chen, and if you refuse to accept that, let’s fight. If you don’t want to fight, then fuck off. What’s the point of all these useless words?” Feng Xinglie frowned irritably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s people all liked to be direct. They would rather fight with their fists than their tongues.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bastard, my Pill Valley received an invitation to come here to get justice! As for you-” raged the Pill Valley’s King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Old bastard, do you want to try cursing me again?” Feng Xinglie’s expression sank. His hand reached toward the broadsword on his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The instant he grabbed the hilt, the world turned still. A powerful aura locked onto the Pill Valley’s King. If he dared to move, he would meet a thunderous attack from Feng Xinglie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lock of a King was incomparably terrifying as heaven and earth seemed to be suppressed. Each person felt like their heart was about to leap out of their chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You!” The Pill Valley’s King was startled and infuriated. Although he knew that the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s people were all blockheads who didn’t talk reason, this was far too domineering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pill Valley’s position was extremely high. Each sect had to be respectful and deferential to them. After all, they all relied on Pill Valley’s medicinal pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So Pill Valley’s people were all arrogant and looked down on others. But Feng Xinglie didn’t accept that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other Pill Valley’s disciples all tottered on the verge of collapse just from being near Feng Xinglie’s lock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other two Kings didn’t know what to do. The Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s people were all madmen. No one wanted to provoke them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I didn’t think this place would be so lively. For all of you to come here for my Xuantian Dao Sect’s matters truly make me endlessly grateful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An elderly voice rang out. Two figures appeared far away, crossing the distance in an instant.</span></p>
