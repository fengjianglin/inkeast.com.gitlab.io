 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following Long Chen’s shout, a divine ring appeared behind his back. A terrifying pressure descended and an intense rumbling raged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The divine ring was incredibly imposing and brilliant. But it still consisted of three colors. There was no sign of the fourth color at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was within Long Chen’s expectations. After all, he had only just condensed the cyclone of the Enlightenment Palace Star. There was no way to bring out the fourth color. But even so, with the divine ring, Long Chen felt endless energy crazily pouring into him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen was in the air. The Flamecloud Wings kept him afloat with the three-hundred-meter divine ring right behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You… you…” Huo Wufang was shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is this technique very familiar to you?” Long Chen wiped his hand over his face, revealing his original appearance. There was no need for him to disguise himself any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Chen!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Wufang finally called out this name. His expression became twisted in fury, but Long Chen surprisingly saw some confusion in his eyes, as if he was trying to remember something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So that’s what it was. No wonder it was so easy to fool you. All the proof I prepared ended up being useless.” Seeing Huo Wufang’s expression, Long Chen immediately understood something that had confused him. Huo Wufang’s memories regarding him had definitely been erased.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This purge had to have been similar to hypnosis. It was an extremely profound and difficult to use spiritual art.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they had completely erased Huo Wufang’s memories regarding a person, then that would have been extremely harmful to his soul. The Huo family’s experts hadn’t done that. They had only erased a portion of his memories pertaining to how Long Chen had tormented him. Those memories were gone, but they hadn’t been able to erase his hatred for Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So seeing Long Chen, Huo Wufang’s hatred soared and he knew Long Chen was definitely his mortal enemy, but he couldn’t remember how Long Chen had made him hate him so much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t understand what was going on, but Long Chen did. The Huo family had erased Huo Wufang’s heart-devil. Otherwise, it would have been very possible that he would have never advanced again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No matter what’s going on, you have to die today!” Huo Wufang roared furiously and he shot towards Long Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen also punched out. Their fists collided and space almost exploded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Wufang was the one to suffer this time. He was sent flying, almost vomiting blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He felt like he had just tried to punch an immovable mountain which resulted in a burst of pain from his wrist. It had almost broken from the impact just now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Nine Star Hegemon Body Art really is the most dependable.” Long Chen looked at his fist. Sensing endless energy surging within him, he was filled with excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had only just condensed the Enlightenment Palace Star’s cyclone. But with the divine ring, his power had leaped to this level. If he fully condensed the star, what would happen when he summoned the four-color divine ring? What would happen when he summoned the Four Star Battle Armor?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huo Wufang, hand over your life!” Long Chen suddenly took the initiative. He had recalled Ye Zhiqiu and Lu Fang-er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because of Huo Wufang that the two of them had fallen. Later, Ye Zhiqiu had been taken away by a peerless expert. It was unknown whether or not she had been revived. But Lu Fang-er was completely dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Each time he thought of his time with Lu Fang-er, Long Chen would feel a burst of pain. Seeing the person who had caused this pain in front of him, his killing intent soared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen’s fist fell upon Huo Wufang. Huo Wufang’s hasty block ended up wasted, as he was shocked to realize this attack was a fake. He suddenly felt a burst of pain from his side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sound of bones breaking rang out. Long Chen’s kick landed on his ribs and sent him flying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Wufang was horrified. Although he had acquired some of his new bones’ memories, that only referred to the Battle Skills. He hadn’t dared to completely absorb that expert’s soul, as it was all too easy for his mind to split.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So right now, he truly did have eighty percent of a rank two Celestial’s combat strength, but his close-range fighting experience was still at his old level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As an alchemist, Huo Wufang had trained in using Pill Flame to fight. He wasn’t used to this kind of fighting. As a result, under continuous attacks from Long Chen, he began to suffer injury after injury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen’s attack power had risen to a new level. Each one of his attacks was as heavy as a mountain, and Huo Wufang was horrified to see his bones begin to break. They were actually unable to bear Long Chen’s force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These bones had come from a powerful body cultivator and a rank two Celestial, but they were still unable to bear Long Chen’s force. If this continued, Huo Wufang would definitely die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bastard! I’ll kill you no matter what! Dao runes, return to my bones!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BOOM!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Dao runes behind Huo Wufang disappeared. Huo Wufang’s entire body began to shine as light could be seen coming out from his bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that instant, Huo Wufang’s aura grew explosively, as if a volcano had erupted and was releasing a constant stream of power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Wufang charged at Long Chen. His aura was incredibly shocking, and space was constantly twisting around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen’s eyes brightened. At this time, Huo Wufang’s strength had erupted to an unprecedented level, but Long Chen felt no fear. Just like that, he unleashed a flurry of punches, fighting against Huo Wufang without the slightest fanciness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BOOM, BOOM, BOOM…! Continuous explosive sounds rang out. Huo Wufang’s body was surrounded by his runic light, and his energy came in an unending stream.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Long Chen, his divine ring began to slowly revolve. Divine rumbling sounds came from it, and he didn’t appear lacking compared to Huo Wufang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BOOM!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once more, the two of them collided and separated. Huo Wufang’s long hair danced as he suddenly raised his head and roared. His eyes were filled with a crazy light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll take your life with this move!” Huo Wufang shot forward. In that instant, the light surrounding him faded. All of it focused on his right fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His fist seemed like a blazing sun, lighting up the entire sky with its endless runes. This fist contained endless killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, his fist exploded. Even his right arm disappeared all the way to his shoulder. Huo Wufang had an expression of disbelief. He felt like the world had suddenly lost all its sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In front of Huo Wufang, Long Chen stood calmly. Three stars had appeared in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In terms of alchemy, you’re trash. Even after obtaining a new skeleton and becoming a fake rank two Celestial, you still aren’t able to change the fact that you’re trash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The reason experts are experts isn’t because they have so much power, but because they have a powerful heart. Other people’s strength will never be yours. Even if you can borrow it, it won’t have any use. Die in peace!” Long Chen pointed his finger at Huo Wufang’s forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just now, he had summoned the Three Star Battle Armor. With a single attack, he had broken Huo Wufang’s arm, as well as shattering all his internal organs and even his muscles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Huo Wufang was like porcelain that had been wrapped up in skin. The porcelain was already broken. If he didn’t have this layer of skin, he’d have already fallen apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Wufang was horrified, but he was powerless to resist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A ray of thunderforce pierced through Huo Wufang’s forehead, coming out through the back of his head. Huo Wufang’s soul was directly destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His corpse collapsed. His eyes had lost any life, but they still seemed to contain endless unwillingness and confusion, as if he still couldn’t believe that he would die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Huo family had spent endless wealth to give him a new skeleton, making him a rank two Celestial. Moreover, they had even obtained the first rank beast flame for him. His future prospects were supposed to be unlimited. How could he have died here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You really are unlucky. If we had fought before I condensed the Enlightenment Palace Star’s cyclone, you would have at least had a thirty percent chance of beating me. But then again, before I condensed that cyclone, you had yet to perfectly merge with your skeleton. So this is just your fate.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once his enemy was dead and his soul dispersed, the hate in Long Chen’s heart also disappeared. Suddenly, countless runes flew out of Huo Wufang’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A lightning blade directly shattered all these runes. The primal chaos space trembled and those destroyed Heavenly Dao runes merged into the Heavenly Dao Tree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A new Heavenly Dao Fruit was born. Long Chen couldn’t help being delighted. This wasn’t the same as his other Heavenly Dao Fruits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those other ones had only had one Dao mark on them. But this one had two different Dao marks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Rank two Heavenly Dao Fruit!” Long Chen was delighted. Assuming he wasn’t wrong, this could raise a rank two Celestial!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A rank two Celestial was a terrifying existence. Huo Wufang had merely obtained a new skeleton, but he already possessed such power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fact that Long Chen could defeat Huo Wufang wasn’t because Huo Wufang was weak. It was just that he was comparatively unlucky. Long Chen’s strongest point was his close-range combat, and he had incomparable experience in that regard. For an alchemist to fight in close quarters with him was simply asking to die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, he hadn’t originally been a Celestial. Just through refining a skeleton, his power was definitely limited. If Long Chen had met a true rank two Celestial instead, he really would have no assurance in defeating one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since you’ve died, I’ll help you protect your things.” Long Chen took off Huo Wufang’s spatial ring. That was the silver spatial ring he had obtained from the Tower Ancestor. “Damn, it’s actually a life ring, and a huge three-hundred-mile one!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was Long Chen’s first time seeing such a vast life ring. Its value was inestimable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s too much stuff in here. Just looking at it gives me a headache. When I get back, I’ll have Meng Qi help me tidy up this space. She’s the best at this.” Long Chen had originally been thinking of categorizing the things inside, but it was too chaotic. He gave up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen placed his palm over Huo Wufang’s Dantian, and a golden flame answered his call. That was the Earth Dragon Golden Blaze. Long Chen directly sucked it out for Huo Long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Chen then released a mass of flames that incinerated Huo Wufang’s body. Even a rank two Celestial’s bones weren’t able to resist the Earth Flame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After tidying up, Long Chen began rushing back to Pill Yang City. He wanted to know what had happened with the Fang family. He had to go over and help.</span></p>
