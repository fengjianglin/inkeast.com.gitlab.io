 <p><span style>Tears welled in Wu Zhangkong’s eyes as he recalled the years he spent under this strict teacher. </span><i><span style>A teacher is a father, yet I… </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Follow me.” Zhuo Shi furrowed his brow then turned around and entered the inner court. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Wu Zhangkong call out, Zhuo Shi stopped moving. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was wrong.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuo Shi’s large body went stiff for a moment before he continued walking, this time moving even faster. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong stumbled as he stood up, his legs numb. Tang Wulin hastened to support him and help him into the inner court. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Welcoming green grass covered the ground of the inner court, and various trees and shrubs encompassed the area. A set of majestic sculptures stood a bit farther in. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin instantly recognized them as depictions of the first generation of the Shrek Seven Monsters, legendary figures who were also spoken of in the annals of the Tang Sect. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The likenesses of three middle-aged people stood in front of those seven legendary figures, two men and one woman. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Already familiar with the story of Shrek Academy, it only took Tang Wulin a moment to guess their identities. These three were the true founders of Shrek Academy. In the center stood Flander, the first president of Shrek Academy. The man to his left was the one known as Grandmaster, the teacher of Tang San, Yu Xiaogang! On the right was Liu Erlong. Together, they were known as the Golden Iron Triangle. They were the ones who founded Shrek Academy with the help of the first generation of Shrek Seven Monsters. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuo Shi stopped in front of the sculptures and bowed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong and Shen Yi did the same. Following their lead, Tang Wulin and his teammates bowed as well. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After everyone paid their respects, Zhuo Shi turned left onto a small path. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As he walked, Tang Wulin discovered that an azure lake lay beyond the towering trees. The lake was clear as crystal. Night had already fallen by now, and the lakewater glistened under the moonlight as mist hung around the surrounding plants to create a scene of pure tranquility. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin instantly liked this place.</span><i><span style> It’s so peaceful here!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuo Shi waved a hand, sending out a wave of red light that enveloped everyone. One moment Tang Wulin’s feet were placed firmly on the ground. In the next, he found himself in a completely different place. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was now on a small island in the middle of the lake. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>An island? Could this be the legendary Sea God’s Island? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Countless rumors about Shrek Academy circulated throughout the continent. They included whisperings about the most important part of Shrek Academy, as well as its core, Sea God’s Island. It was said that Sea God’s Island sat in the center of Sea God’s Lake. In addition to that, one other place in Shrek Academy was called Sea God’s Pavilion. All of Shrek Academy’s most important decisions were made in Sea God’s Pavilion. In other words, whatever was decided there would send waves throughout the continent. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin had never even dared to imagine he would be able to visit Sea God’s Island so soon. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Viridian trees and shrubs sprouted everywhere on the island, as if it were a miniature forest. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuo Shi led them further into the island. After climbing two hills, they arrived at a two-story wooden house. He opened the door, and warm light flooded from within.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This… this is his home! </span></i><span style>Wu Zhangkong stopped at the doorway, a conflicted look in his eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come in already,” Zhuo Shi called out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong sucked in a deep breath, bowed his head, and entered. His four students followed closely behind. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The house was decorated in a simple manner. Everything was crafted from wood, including the worn chair that Zhuo Shi sat down in. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shen Yi, tomorrow, take these kids to get registered. Tang Wulin gets a full score. Calculate the points for the other three as usual.” Zhuo Shi shifted his gaze to the four students. “From this moment onward, you are working students of the outer court.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” Shen Yi responded quickly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you going to leave now that you’ve brought them here?” Zhuo Shi glanced at Wu Zhangkong. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was then that Wu Zhangkong dropped to his knees.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t run anymore, Teacher,” he said. “Even if I have to work part-time, I want to stay. I won’t run. My only request is that you allow me take care of you. I’ve come to understand that a person can’t live for themselves alone. I made a mistake back then, and now I wish to spend the rest of my life making up for it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He lowered his head to the floor, kowtowing. “Please allow me to stay, Teacher.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before returning to Shrek Academy, Wu Zhangkong had stubbornly held onto his past grudges. After arriving in this familiar place, however, his those grudges washed away when he saw how much his teacher had aged. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuo Shi was dumbstruck. Never had he expected Wu Zhangkong to say such words. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was exactly as Elder Cai had said. Like teacher, like student. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuo Shi understood just how stubborn Wu Zhangkong was. He had just picked up Wu Zhangkong, an orphan, while out on a stroll one day. Since Zhuo Shi had always pursued the pinnacle of strength, he had very few disciples, all of whom he considered his own children. But of them all, Wu Zhangkong was undoubtedly his favorite. Only he could match Zhuo Shi’s stubbornness. He even aimed for the pinnacle of strength as well. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet despite his stubborn nature, Wu Zhangkong sincerely acknowledged his mistake. Never in his wildest dreams would Zhuo Shi have imagined this. The &nbsp;Wu Zhangkong he knew would choose death rather than lower his head. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher…” Shen Yi tugged at Zhuo Shi’s sleeve, pleading with her eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, you can stay,” Zhuo Shi said indifferently. “I need someone to make tea and keep the house tidy anyway.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Teacher!” Wu Zhangkong rejoiced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The four students quietly exchanged knowing looks. Although they were still children and weren’t exactly sure what happened between their teacher and their grandteacher, they were smart enough to see that Zhuo Shi was firm in speech but soft in heart. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin secretly signalled to his companions and the four of them hurriedly said, “Thank you, Grandteacher!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong stood up and walked over to stand at Zhuo Shi’s side. His icy eyes had thawed and were now full of vigor. It was the first time Tang Wulin had ever seen his teacher so passionate. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuo Shi nodded, then looked at Tang Wulin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You will visit me once a week so I can examine you. Your body is very strange. Despite the fact that your martial soul is just Bluesilver Grass, your blood essence is extremely robust. I paid careful attention to the changes in your body while you were forging and I’m certain you don’t have a second martial soul. That golden soul ring’s power seems to be a special soul ring that came from your blood. I think you’re somewhat similar to me. After you’ve settled in, come visit me next week when you have a day off, and I will... inspect your body.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. Thank you, Grandteacher,” Tang Wulin said, barely able to contain his joy. He could clearly tell that this grandteacher of his was a major figure in Shrek Academy! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuo Shi swept his gaze over Xu Xiaoyan, Xie Xie, and Gu Yue. “All of you will need to work hard. Just as Elder Cai said, you will be working students since you were late to the exam. In order to enter the inner court, you have to become one-word battle armor masters by the time you turn twenty. You have a long way to go and six years left to do it. Rest here tonight and Shen Yi will take you to complete the registration process in the morning.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. Thank you, Grandteacher.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Of the four students, Zhuo Shi clearly considered Tang Wulin the most important, a fact that made even Xie Xie green with envy. But in any case, they had succeeded. They were now Shrek Academy students. They could hold their heads high and proclaim themselves as part of Shrek Academy. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As for becoming a one-word battle armor master before they turned twenty… that was a daunting task. Becoming a one-word battle armor master meant having at least five soul rings. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuo Shi turned around and began climbing the stairs. Shen Yi gave Wu Zhangkong a meaningful look. Only then did he go and help Zhuo Shi up the stairs. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Instead of struggling free from Wu Zhangkong’s arms, Zhuo Shi simply accepted the help. After many years apart, the troubles between master and disciple seemed to have been resolved. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that her grandteacher and teacher had left, Xu Xiaoyan slid over to Shen Yi’s side and asked, “What’s going on between Teacher and Grandteacher? Did something happen in the past?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Yi glanced at her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was just a difference in beliefs,” she answered. “In a sense, your teacher was not in the wrong. However, neither was your grandteacher. The troubles between them arose from a combination of many different factors, but they’ve resolved the issue now, so everything is well. Come, I’ll bring you kids to somewhere you can rest. I’ll have you know, not even inner court disciples have the privilege to come to Sea God’s Island. You should consider yourselves lucky to have this opportunity.” </span></p>
