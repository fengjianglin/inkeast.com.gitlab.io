Behind her followed Leng Yaozhu. “Yueyue, your cultivation is coming along nicely and your design skills are improving quickly. Shall I help you start a one-word battle armor? I can get it done for you within half a year. Considering your design skills, a three-metal alloy would work out well. You’ll be able to upgrade it easily in the future.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, I’m fine. But thank you, Teacher. Please allow me to handle my own battle armor.” Not batting an eye, Gu Yue refused an offer ordinary soul masters would only dream of, and with that matter settled, the master and disciple pair stepped through the door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">☀&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wulin returned to his dormitory late in the evening, his muscles as heavy as lead. He flopped onto his bed. After struggling to sit and bend his legs into a pretzel, he let himself drift into meditation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His efforts these past few days paid off. He helped two of his friends obtain a new spirit soul, gained valuable combat experience in the process, and settled his path toward creating a one-word battle armor. Gu Yue’s support lit the embers of confidence in his soul. He was convinced that as long as he kept persevering, he would one day become a mighty battle armor master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It didn’t matter if it took him a little longer than others. There was still plenty of time before the outer court graduation deadline. The path he chose would cause him to endure some difficulties and be pressed for time, but the reward would be worth it in the end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Gu Yue handed him a staggering amount of star iron and essence gold, he was curious over her method of obtaining it. However, he didn’t press the issue. Everyone was entitled to their secrets.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the materials gathered and their daring plan ready for execution, gone were Tang Wulin and Gu Yue’s free time. Tang Wulin attended classes in the morning and forged in the afternoon. Under Feng Wuyu’s personal guidance, he made much progress with alloy forging and added spirit gold and star silver to his repertoire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although his success rate was low, it was steady. As his perception and experience increased, his success rate would naturally follow. Now was the time to forge like his life depended on it, no matter how tedious it was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Wuyu still criticized him as harshly as before, nitpicking every mistake, small or otherwise. Compared with Mu Chen’s, their teaching styles were as different as night and day. Initially, Tang Wulin had been shocked by the difference, but he adapted to his situation and soaked up Feng Wuyu’s knowledge and experience. He harbored no resentment toward Feng Wuyu for he knew that the crazy old man had his best interests at heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">☀&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s been a month since the beginning of the school year and I’m sure you’ve all grown quite a bit. We will be holding a competition between the first and second grades in the four main professions and combat,” Shen Yi announced from behind the lectern, sweeping her gaze through her students. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In order to decide on the participants fairly and put forth the best combatants, you will be tasked to form your own teams. Then each team will sign up for a competition where the winners will represent our class. Each team may have no more than seven people and no less than three. The class council will be representing us for the profession competitions. When forming your teams, keep in mind that for the sake of fairness, the second grade’s team will have one less person than ours. So if our representative team has three people, then the second grade’s team can only have two. Now, let’s begin the process for selecting the representative team. Tang Wulin.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” Tang Wulin stood up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Once class is over, record all the teams and submit a report to me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Understood.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After class, the entire classroom erupted into chatter. Everyone was tantalized by the possibility of representing their class in a battle against the second grade. It was an opportunity for them to earn extra credit, boosting their chances of entering the inner court in the future. There wasn’t a single person willing to let this chance slip through their hands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Yue nudged Tang Wulin. “Who’s going to be in our group?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wulin glanced at Wu Siduo and Luo Guixing. He knew that their best chance was to gather all of the class’s greatest talents into one team.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In their class, apart from himself and Gu Yue, the five most powerful people were Wu Siduo, Luo Guixing, Yang Nianxia, Zheng Yiran, and Xu Yucheng. Each of the five were on the Genius Youths Ranking, so if they formed a seven-man team with him and Gu Yue, their chances of winning over the second grade were high.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the second grade, Tang Wulin knew of Yuanen Yehui and Yue Zhengyu. Just thinking about those two was enough to make him sweat. The strength Yue Zhengyu revealed during the tower attack sent him into a state of awe, and he didn’t even want to think about Yuanen Yehui with her new Diamond Baboon spirit soul. Coupled with four soul rings, her power undoubtedly reached a frightening new level. Holding back against such opponents meant certain defeat!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they didn’t fill the first grade’s team with the cream of the crop, then even with a one-man advantage, they’d have to fight tooth and nail for victory.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wulin glanced at his classmates. Wu Siduo, Luo Guixing, and Yang Nianxia stood beside each other, huddling together as they exchanged some hushed words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It doesn’t look like they plan on grouping with us.” Gu Yue sneered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lately, Tang Wulin and Gu Yue felt ostracized by their classmates under the lead of the five rankers. This change started after Tang Wulin and Gu Yue chose to make their battle armor from alloys. Since then, they became estranged with Wu SIduo and Luo Guixing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ll just make our own group,” Tang Wulin said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Turning to face him, Gu Yue was astonished to see the confidence burning within his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She liked this look on him best. That determined expression that appeared in the face of challenge. He never backed down, always sweating tears and blood to strive for victory, never cowering from tribulations, even when all hope seemed lost. He always advanced with sheer willpower, guiding his teammates like a shining beacon. Being shunned by the five rankers was but a trifling matter to him. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wulin cast his attention to his other friends. “Xie Xie, Xiaoyan, let’s form a group.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their individual power wasn’t particularly remarkable. However, a team’s strength didn’t necessarily stem from the sum of its members. Teamwork was just as important. Tang Wulin’s team made up for its lack of power with its extraordinary teamwork. As comrades for so many years, they held a deep understanding of each other’s strengths and weaknesses. Together they had been through thick and thin. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say they had forged unbreakable bonds. In comparison, the team of rankers were practically strangers with one another. A team in name only. Since that was the case, Tang Wulin was bent on showing everyone their might. He only had eyes for the goal: to become the class representative team!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Tang Wulin’s heart burned with resolution, Shen Yi returned to the classroom with two people in tow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as he recognized them, Tang Wulin was shocked. A moment later, a smile tugged at the corner of his mouth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone, quiet down,” Shen Yi said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire class went silent, everyone’s attention focusing on Shen Yi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Two new students will be joining our class today. This here is Ye Xinglan, an assault-type soul master. The other one is Xu Lizhi, a food-type soul master. Give them a warm round of welcome.”&nbsp;</span></p>
