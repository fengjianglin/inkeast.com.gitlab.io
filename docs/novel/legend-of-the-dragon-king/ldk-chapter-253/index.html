 <p><span style>“You can go now. Continue working hard.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The world before Tang Wulin melted away, fading into nothing.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Cold.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>His eyes shot open, surprised to find that the bathwater had cooled significantly. Still, it was refreshing for him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin looked down to inspect his body but didn’t see any drastic transformations. Then, a visceral clawing need within the pits of his stomach had his mind elsewhere. </span><i><span style>I’m starving! How many days has it been? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Climbing out of the bathtub, he dried himself and quickly dressed, in a hurry to stave off his hunger with food. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But when he opened the washroom door, he nearly jumped with fright. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Instead of Wu Zhangkong, four people sat in the room, one of which was an unfamiliar white-haired woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He hadn’t seen her during his trip to Skysea City years ago. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re finally awake!” Xie Xie leapt toward him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“So I woke up in time?” Seeing them, his hopes rose. There should still be time before the exam, otherwise, his teammates wouldn’t be here. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie grumbled, “What do you mean ‘in time’? We’re already late.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?” Tang Wulin was so shocked, he even forgot his hunger. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go.” Shen Yi stood up, giving Tang Wulin a meaningful look before walking out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Xiaoyan and Gu Yue also got up, the former beaming at him while the latter had an apathetic expression. Only, her eyes were far more expressive, concern lingering in their depths. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin nodded to them, then turned to Xie Xie. “Who is that?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie replied, “She’s a friend of Teacher Wu’s from Shrek. We’re already three hours late; Teacher Wu is helping us out at the academy right now, so we need to hurry over, otherwise, we might miss our chance.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry. This is all my fault.” Tang Wulin slumped with shame and hung his head. His stinginess had started a domino-effect, from delaying the evolution of his bloodline to holding his teammates back and possibly missing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! And all this, just for the sake of saving money ! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie chuckled. “What’s the point in talking about it now? When you protected us at the forefront all those times, have we ever said thanks? How’s your body? How did your deep meditation go?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Unable to tell Xie Xie about his seals, Tang Wulin could only smile bitterly and say, “I don’t know either, but I feel great.” He had realized that, apart from hunger, he was in good condition. Strength surged through his body, his soul power having grown. He estimated that it was around rank 27 or rank 28 now. Just like the first time, his soul power had not increased by much. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Though hunger still clouded his mind, he sensed that his body had strengthened by a third and, when considering his already immense physical power, it was a tremendous improvement. </span></p>
 <p><span style>What he truly looked forward to, however, was how his bloodline power had evolved, as well as the surprise Old Tang spoke of. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But now was not the time to test it out. In fact, he didn’t even have time to eat. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have anything to eat?” Tang Wulin asked Xie Xie. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie shook his head. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But at that moment, Gu Yue held out a bag to Tang Wulin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He accepted the bag, immediately knowing what it was just by the weight and feel of it. It was steamed buns and meat! They weren’t spectacular, but they were better than nothing! </span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t thank Gu Yue. Although they had grown estranged in the past three years, experiencing life-or-death situations together was a bond that would never break. Thanks was not needed for such a trivial matter. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was three steamed buns and a portion of meat. They didn’t smell particularly appetizing, but desperate times called for desperate measures. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin devoured the food with such shocking speed that no one in the entire continent would dare say they were number one at speed eating in his presence. Not a single crumb was left by the time they reached the first floor. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Yi had driven here. Her sleek, dark-green soul car was parked in the front. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get in,” Shen Yi said as she got into the driver’s seat. Xie Xie sat in the back but was promptly dragged out and forced to the front by Gu Yue. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Xiaoyan, sitting next to the window in the back seat, covered her laugh with a hand. Tang Wulin sat by the opposite window, Gu Yue sandwiched between them. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie silently cursed. </span><i><span style>Gu Yue is too controlling, hogging Wulin all to herself! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue remained expressionless despite her actions, but Tang Wulin had long since become accustomed to it. He could see how much she cared just by the fact that the food she had given him, though meager, was enough to temporarily alleviate his hunger. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gue Yue nudged him. He turned to see that she was offering him a juice box. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s heart warmed at the gesture. He smiled at her, before quickly drinking the juice. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Happiness flashed in Gu Yue’s eyes before she closed them to rest. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The two sat shoulder-to-shoulder, a cozy and peaceful atmosphere between them as Gu Yue’s cool arm pressed against Tang Wulin’s warm one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Yi drove fast but smooth, her reactions precise. She handled her car with skill, lacking any unnecessary movement so that it could display its full speed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The scenery flitted by outside the window. It was class zero’s first time seeing the rest of Shrek City. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The city was just too lively and gigantic. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Wulin first left Glorybound City, he had thought Eastsea City was too much to behold, an entire world itself. </span></p>
 <p><span style>And now, he felt the same about Shrek City; only, this time, he was comparing to Eastsea City. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This really is the continent’s number one city! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>With Shen Yi’s speeding, they arrived at the legendary Shrek Academy within an hour. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ancient city walls extending beyond their vision towered over them like an enormous dragon coiled around the academy, plain and undecorated without even a signboard to mark the location. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A large crowd was currently assembled outside the gate. It was a sea of people rowdy with noise and excitement. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Instead of entering through the front gate, Shen Yie drove off to the side. After seven or eight turns, they found themselves before the wall again and in front of a small gate. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Yi pressed a button and the gate opened, revealing a new road and the soul car turned into the street. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The gate closed behind them. Their new surroundings were peaceful and tranquil as if by passing through that door they had cut their connections to the outside world and entered an era long gone. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are we in Shrek Academy now?” Xie Xie asked Shen Yi. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Yi nodded. “This is Shrek Academy, or as some call it, Shrek Inner City. It was the original Shrek City, but after the city expanded, it became part of the academy. The entire city was built for the sake of the academy, so this is the core of the city as well as where students study. Only those recognized by the academy are permitted to enter Shrek Inner City.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The car did not slow one bit as she explained, continuing to speed toward the academy’s core. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because you were late, your exam will be harder than normal. You’ll be tested on the same things, but will have less time to finish and might not even have a chance to rest throughout the entire process. Furthermore, if you do pass, you’ll only be working students.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Working students? What’s that?” Tang Wulin asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Yi said, “It means you’ll have to pay for the costs to attend Shrek by yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?” Dread gripped Tang Wulin at the mere mention of spending money. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie laughed and said proudly, “That’s fine. Our captain is great at making money. I’m sure he’ll help us out.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin was helpless to retort. He was the one who put them in this predicament after all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Yi said, “You’re not paying the school money, but working for the school to pay for your tuition. Do you think Shrek Academy is short on money? Normal students all attend for free.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Work?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s mood uplifted the moment he heard this. He had never been one to back down from hardship. Xie Xie, on the other hand, made a sour expression as words tumbled out of his mouth. “What work?” </span></p>
