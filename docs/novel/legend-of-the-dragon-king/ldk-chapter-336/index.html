 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;336 - Three-ringed Soul Elder</strong></span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The sole way to cultivate a spirit soul involved the absorption of spirit energy from the spirit ascension platform. That said, it was possible for the spirit soul’s owner to strengthen it by advancing their soul rank. This type of growth, however, rarely surpassed ten percent, if it grew at all. Yet before Feng Wuyu’s eyes, Tang Wulin’s spirit soul had increased by fifty percent and that didn’t seem to be the end!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Goldlight’s taut body relaxed one vertebra at a time, coiling around Tang Wulin like a protective vest. A flash, and golden veins sprang up over Tang Wulin’s skin, his blood essence roaring with strength as they popped into existence. His figure let off a faint layer of gold light. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Eyebrows arching toward the sky, Feng Wuyu muttered, “He really fits our school’s motto. What a little monster.” Before he knew it, he was shaking his head. “I’ve never seen anything like this before.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Unknown to Feng Wuyu was Tang Wulin’s current state of being, calm as a still lake. Unlike his new teacher, he understood what was happening to his body. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The third soul ring was a major bottleneck for soul masters, but he had succeeded. Along with Goldlight’s growth, it offered a third soul ring to Tang Wulin. Besides gaining another ring, Tang Wulin’s body and meridians strengthened and his blood essence richened. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he had yet to absorb to its entirety the reservoir of cold energy spiraling within him. There was still more to improve his soul power rank with, still more to be done. </span></p>
 <p><span style>His body pulsed with energy in a sudden jolt. Following that, his third soul ring condensed into existence. He immediately fused with it, diving straight into breaking through rank 31, but even then there seemed to be enough energy left to tread deeper.. </span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Tang Wulin heard a voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take this opportunity to break a seal.” Old Tang’s voice resounded in his head. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“C-can I really?” Tang Wulin asked in astonishment. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Normally, you wouldn’t be able to since you just broke the second seal, but your blood essence has been improving rapidly these days. And that warm energy helped strengthen your meridians. But most important of all, what you ingested earlier was a ten-thousand-year spirit item of extremely high purity. It’s more than enough to substitute for the spirit items I previously told you to get. Moreover, now that you have three rings, you’re strong enough to break the third seal. Don’t waste this opportunity. I’ll help you convert that spirit item’s energy into blood essence. Right now, increasing your soul power isn’t as important as breaking the next seal. The earlier you break the seal, the stronger your blood will become, especially if you break the third seal right now. That’ll give you plenty of time to prepare for the fourth seal.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay!” There was no hesitation in Tang Wulin’s answer. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With that said, Tang Wulin’s blood essence took on a full boil, vapors rising from his body in angry hisses, feasting upon the cold energy within his meridians. He continued to circulate his soul power whirlpool, carefully containing it within his dantian. </span></p>
 <p><span style>To the spectating Feng Wuyu, this was an utterly baffling scene. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The golden veins webbing all over Tang Wulin’s body periodically pulsed with light as if they were alive. His blood essence surged out while a golden mist enveloped his body. A few moments later, his blood essence finished devouring the last bits of the cold energy, rushing into his dantian, merging with his soul power. Together, the two energies whirled in his dantian like a turbulent tornado. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Of the eighteen seals, he had sixteen left to break including this one. Soon, a familiar bone-scraping pain clawed its way to every inch of his body. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin had just broken the second seal not too long ago, and now by coincidence, he was breaking the third. He was nowhere near as prepared as the previous time. This time, the pain was comparable to that of the first seal breaking, and before long his body felt as though it were on the verge of exploding. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Wuyu knitted his brows, eyes glued to the spectacle before him. The fluctuations of Tang Wulin’s blood essence grew more and more pronounced, and it wasn’t long before he began to tremble. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I can’t figure out what’s going on with him. Just what is happening to his body? This isn’t as simple as just breaking through to rank 30. </span></i><span style>Although Feng Wuyu came to this conclusion immediately, he knew that he shouldn’t interfere without knowing everything. He sat himself behind Tang Wulin, ready to intervene at a moment’s notice if things went south. </span></p>
 <p><span style>To his surprise, a golden soul ring emerged from Tang Wulin’s body. It quivered and released a dragon’s roar. The ring prowled around Tang Wulin like a golden dragon, haughty yet curious, and with each revolution his golden veins turned more distinct, bulging from his skin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Scales rippled into existence across Tang Wulin’s right arm, shoulder, and chest, his hand morphing into a claw. His shirt was ripped to shreds by the transformation. His entire body shined with a radiant golden light. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Now his body no longer trembled, and Tang Wulin reabsorbed his free flowing blood essence into his body. Save for his golden aura, he reverted back to his normal state. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this the power of blood essence condensing?” Feng Wuyu stared at Tang Wulin in shock. Such an aura was unheard of! </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A blood essence ring? And a blood essence soul ring at that? This kid’s body is too strange! He really benefited from what I made him ingest. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A while after, Tang Wulin’s skeleton began to crackle, bones vibrating with the immense energy flowing through his body. He trembled once more. The golden scales spread from the right half of his chest to the left, sneaking up his left shoulder. His blood essence was more powerful than previous, and the golden aura around him shrunk back to a golden soul ring, glowing brighter than before. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A watchful hawk from the beginning, Feng Wuyu made out a few differences in Tang Wulin. He was taller for one, and his skin was the type maidens dreamed of, glossy and sparkling. His blood essence coursed through his body like a raging river, so loud that if he strained his ears, Feng Wuyu could hear it roaring. Tang Wulin’s body was so full of vitality that his blood essence fluctuations saturated the room. Never had the golden scales upon his flesh glistened more brilliantly, seeming to reflect light with a regal magnificence. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Interesting… How interesting.” Feng Wuyu observed with narrowed eyes, his mouth parting into a slight smile. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It looks like I’ve picked up quite a treasure! This kid’s strength clearly comes from his bloodline and not his martial soul! His bloodline is influencing every part of him.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Goldlight slithered out of Tang Wulin’s hair. Its scales deepened in its golden splendor, sharpening like blades. Two small protrusions appeared on its head. Goldlight’s length extended again, now about two feet long. It scrutinized the area with sparkling eyes. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is his spirit soul evolving again? It’s still not done? </span></i><span style>Feng Wuyu finally understood </span><i><span style>His strange bloodline is causing it to evolve a second time! It’s making his spirit soul’s growth beyond normal! His future is limitless! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Wulin peeled his eyes open, he felt about on the verge of collapse, exhaustion tempting every bit of his body. Pain sizzled through his nerves like electricity at the mere drawing of breath. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He barely managed to endure the pain. It was even worse than that of the first seal breaking. Fortunately, his Golden Dragon Body helped him bridge the crisis. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Wulin completed the process, he was too far gone from fatigue to sense the effects of gaining his third soul ring and breaking the third seal. He went down like a bag of bricks without another word. </span></p>
