 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;342 - Team Battle Against Wu Zhangkong</strong></span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Frost Scars flew through the air, threatening to tear into the tide of bluesilver grass. The instant they collided, however, the grass released a dazzling azure light. Instead of slicing the it apart, the Frost Scar only managed to coat it in a layer of frost, freezing it in place. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This scene made Wu Zhangkong narrow his eyes, and he nodded to himself in understanding. </span><i><span style>I may not have used my full strength, but I focused all of my Frost Scars on a single spot. Wulin’s bluesilver grass really has grown stronger. It’s at least twice as strong as before. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a silver light blossomed at Wu Zhangkong’s feet. Luo Guixing used Spatial Lock, timing it so that it activated immediately after Wu Zhangkong used Frost Scar, the exact moment he was about to send out another soul skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The enormous difference in their cultivation meant that Luo Guixing couldn’t completely restrain Wu Zhangkong. However, he did barely manage to interrupt Wu Zhangkong and keep him from chaining soul skills. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Siduo swooped in at that moment. From the very beginning of the battle, she made sure to stay just one step behind Tang Wulin, ready to pounce at any opening. The instant Luo Guixing tripped up Wu Zhangkong, she dove in with her first soul skill, Hell Rush. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She arrived in front of Wu Zhangkong in a shadowy blur, clawing at his ribs. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although it was their first time fighting together, the four of them synced up perfectly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong’s white robes fluttered as he twisted his body to meet the claw strike. His sword blocked it with a resounding metallic ringing, his perfect defense stunning Wu Siduo. She looked as if she had been struck by lightning. Before Wu Zhangkong could punish her for her mistake, Luo Guixing teleported her away. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin took advantage of Wu Siduo’s attack to close the distance between him and Wu Zhangkong. Now in front of Wu Zhangkong, he slashed out with his dragon claw, tearing through the air with an audible hiss. Five dark-gold lights streaked out of his claw.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong’s icy mask finally cracked, revealing a hint of astonishment. His sword shot up to to meet this attack with a white sword beam of its own. This beam was much larger than the previous Frost Scar, but it was far simpler in construction, merely resembling a long blade. However, Tang Wulin saw through its plain appearance. In reality, it was an attack composed of thousands of Frost Scars fused together. Although it was Wu Zhangkong’s first soul skill, his masterful use of it transformed it into a terrifying beast to be reckoned with! </span></p>
 <p><span style>The white sword beam and the golden lights collided in an explosion of particles. Tang Wulin came out of the exchange covered in a layer of frost, but Wu Zhangkong had also been forced back.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He blocked it! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin unleashed a primal roar and his three purple soul rings faded away. A radiant golden soul ring appeared in their place. Blood essence bubbled within him, madly coursing through his body as he activated Golden Dragon Body! &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Goldlight slithered out and coiled around Tang Wulin’s body. The roar of a dragon thundered throughout the stadium, and Tang Wulin’s entire body took on a golden hue. His right sleeve exploded, revealing his golden-scaled right arm bursting with power. Every single scale was erect, and his claw seemed to have grown a bit larger. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The power of his surging blood essence instantly dispelled the frost on his body. He slashed with his claw once more, sending another five dark-gold beams that were each over two meters long. The moment they appeared, the space between Tang Wulin and Wu Zhangkong seemed to distort, the dragon roar becoming louder than ever. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Moments before this, Luo Guixing teleported Wu Siduo behind Wu Zhangkong. Taking advantage of the time that Tang Wulin bought with his explosive clash against Wu Zhangkong, she summoned her second martial soul. Black and white light swirled around her, her body grew larger and transforming into the Hell White Tiger! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Their opponent was a seven-ringed Soul Sage and a teacher at Shrek Academy. There was no point in holding back or stalling. All they could do was go all out from the beginning. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Guixing’s plan entailed playing to each of their strengths and having them release their greatest attacks on Wu Zhangkong at the same time. As long as they did that, they would at least be able to properly display their strength. </span></p>
 <p><span style>While Tang Wulin attacked Wu Zhangkong from the front with Golden Dragon Dreadclaw, Wu Siduo attacked him from behind in her Hell White Tiger form. At the same time, quad-colored spears materialized in the air and shot toward Wu Zhangkong’s head following a precisely plotted arc.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The jaws of basically every spectating student had already dropped. The combined attack of their class council was too ferocious, especially Tang Wulin’s Golden Dragon Dreadclaw and Wu Siduo’s Hell White Tiger! Everyone could feel the tempestuous might of the two attacks. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Facing attacks from three separate directions, Wu Zhangkong’s fourth soul ring lit up as he simply thrust his Skyfrost Sword toward the sky. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin and Wu Siduo immediately felt as if they were no longer fighting a human. Instead, they were opposing a towering mountain! They knew they wouldn’t be able to shake this mountain no matter what they tried. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A hurricane of energy burst forth from Wu Zhangkong. It swept across his opponents, routing Wu Siduo, overwhelming Tang Wulin’s Golden Dragon Dreadclaw, and finally dispersing the incoming hail of quad-colored spears. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A thundering boom shook the arena, the barriers that surrounded it trembling before the shockwave. Tense silence descended upon the spectators as they watched the dust filled stage with narrowed eyes, impatiently waiting for the dust to settle and reveal the results of the clash. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, a buzzing cut through the quiet, and a blue light pierced the sky. It stretched seven meters into the air, then revealed itself as a gigantic azure greatsword. A wave of cold erupted from it, knocking Tang Wulin and the Hell White Tiger off their feet. The giant sword then split into nine separate swords and shot toward Tang Wulin and Wu Siduo. Even the spectating students off-stage found it hard to breath in the face of the sword’s might. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Silver light enveloped Wu Siduo, teleporting her out of harm’s way once again. With one of their targets gone, the nine swords changed direction, focusing all of their frigid power on Tang Wulin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if he had nine lives, Tang Wulin wouldn’t survive this onslaught!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong had used both his fourth and fifth soul skills, Frost Song and Frost Song Moon. He hadn’t held anything back, immediately using two of his strongest soul skills. </span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no way for Tang Wulin to avoid these nine swords. However, inches before they sliced him to pieces, he disappeared in a flash of silver light. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Amazing! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of the spectators turned to gaze at Luo Guixing in awe. This was the second time he teleported his teammates out of harm’s way in the nick of time! Furthermore, the second teleport occurred just a split-second before Frost Song cleaved Tang Wulin to bits! Even Tang Wulin had been bracing himself to take the attack with his dragon claw! &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the students soon realized that something was wrong. Like them, Luo Guixing wore an expression of shock! He slowly turned his head to look behind him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Earlier, he had teleported Wu Siduo in front of him to protect him from the wave of cold. Tang Wulin, however, had been teleported to the rear, right next to Gu Yue! </span></p>
