 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter 52 – Victory Streak</strong></span></p>
 <p>Li Chushui was, nonetheless, only a nine-year-old child, and her fighting experience wasn’t abundant. As Tang Wulin had expected, the continuously quick and ever-changing movements that Li Chushui used to seek her opponent’s weak points had eventually tired out her rank 11 spirit power.</p>
 <p>She couldn’t wait any longer; she didn’t have the strength to sustain her soul skill for much longer.</p>
 <p>Li Chushui gritted her teeth and seemed to have suddenly vanished as she maneuvered herself behind Tang Wulin with a sudden spurt of speed. At the same time, the white soul ring on her body lit up. With a wave of her claws, two blades emitting white light shot in front of her, followed by her body.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin obviously wasn’t as fast as her. However, his action of merely changing direction was much simpler. His Bluesilver Grass moved quicker and congealed together.</p>
 <p>The two white blades slashed quickly at the Bluesilver Grass, a so-called trash martial soul. However, the envisioned image of Bluesilver Grass being torn to bits didn’t happen. The white blades flickered gently with light as they both disappeared, and Li Chushui crashed into the web of Bluesilver Grass.</p>
 <p>Long blades of blue, narrow vines twirled upwards and bound her petite body. Tang Wulin pulled his right hand into a fist and punched toward Li Chushui’s bound figure before him. However, he abruptly stopped his fist a mere few centimeters in front of her.</p>
 <p>Xie Xie unknowingly felt his cheeks warm up as he watched. <i>‘This jerk! Why didn’t he stop when he was competing with me?’</i></p>
 <p>There was a flash of light in Wu Zhangkong’s eyes. <i>‘That’s no ordinary Bluesilver Grass! His character is free from arrogance and his control is pretty good too.’</i></p>
 <p>“Tang Wulin wins.”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin loosened his Bluesilver Grass and helped Li Chushui steady herself. Li Chushui blushed as she exchanged glances with Tang Wulin’s large eyes that were in close proximity to her. She said to him shyly, “Thank you.”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin simply smiled in response, stunning her. She felt as though his smile radiated like the sun.</p>
 <p>Round two proceeded onward and Xie Xie successfully defeated his opponent. There were 5 remaining students after that round concluded.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin originally thought that he would be placed against Xie Xie in his second round, but Wu Zhangkong purposely placed him away from Xie Xie. The same happened during his third round.</p>
 <p>“Tang Wulin, Tao Liufan, both of you can start first,” Wu Zhangkong said, monotonously.</p>
 <p>Tao Liufan wasn’t tall, but he looked quite sturdy. He had a head of messy, short, brown hair.</p>
 <p>Both stood ground facing each other as they released their martial souls.</p>
 <p>Tao Liufan’s martial soul was a Willow Tree. His soul power rose, and as he raised both his hands as if to support the sky, strips of willow twigs flowed out and up from both his limbs. They swayed as though they were a part of the willow tree. At first glance, it seemed similar to Tang Wulin’s Bluesilver Grass.</p>
 <p>Blades of Bluesilver Grass reappeared. Control type versus control type, what would happen?</p>
 <p>This was what Wu Zhangkong was waiting for. In the match before them, Tao Liufan seemed to be abiding with the rules. With their current strength levels and under normal circumstances, a ControlSystem Battle Soul Master would’ve been advantageous in the match since none of them had a powerful soul skill.</p>
 <p>Out of the whole class, Xie Xie was the only one with a hundred year spirit soul, while the rest only had ten year spirit souls. Therefore, Tao Liufan’s soul ring was also a white one. What was more interesting was that he shared the same soul skill as Tang Wulin – Bind.</p>
 <p>His spirit soul was of the snake family as well, but Tao Liufan’s spirit soul was a little green snake. His green snake looked significantly stronger than Tang Wulin’s Goldlight, both in mass and vigour.</p>
 <p>“Start!”</p>
 <p>Willow branches and Bluesilver Grass struck at the other at almost the same time. It looked as if the quantity of the willow’s branches held a visible advantage; Tang Wulin’s Bluesilver Grass only sprouted out from his right palm and there was none from his left hand.</p>
 <p>Both had almost the same amount of control, but everyone had guessed the results by sheer comparison of quantity.</p>
 <p>Of course, the willow branches flew in the direction of the blades of Bluesilver Grass as they intertwined in the air. Tao Liufan, having the advantage of numbers, directed the remaining branches towards Tang Wulin in an attempt to bind him.</p>
 <p>Tao Liufan’s gaze revealed a hint of exciteness. Though his martial soul wasn’t very strong, he felt that his willow branches were stronger than Bluesilver Grass and the current situation only served to back up his thoughts. Trees would be stronger than grass, wouldn’t they?</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin wasn’t frantic at all when the willow’s branches arrived in front of him. Faced with its branches, he abruptly pulled on the Bluesilver Grass in his right hand, twisting their two martial soul’s together and transmitted his physical strength through their intertwined martial souls.</p>
 <p>Tao Liufan only felt a sudden wave of strength coming towards him before his body was pulled in Tang Wulin’s direction. At this very moment, his willow branches had been strongly bound by Tang Wulin.</p>
 <p>Tao Liufan’s response was pretty quick. As his body was yanked into the air, he was still able to raise both his knees. <i>‘You wanted to pull me over right? I’ll come by and knock you out.’</i></p>
 <p>However, he caught view of Tang Wulin’s expressionless face, followed by a sudden movement of his arms as he shattered all the willow branches that had bound him. He caught Tao Liufan’s lower thigh with a quick raise of his hand, and pressed him against the ground.</p>
 <p>The tender willow branches swung profusely in an attempt to bind or push away Tang Wulin. However, struggling was useless against the strength of their opponent.</p>
 <p>Neither of them had a powerful martial soul, and it was only through his absolute strength that Tang Wulin was able to achieve victory in the third round.</p>
 <p>“You truly are worthy of being called a Rice Bucket; it seems all that food didn’t go to waste.” Tao Liufan threw his comments ferociously towards Tang Wulin before escaping out of the circle.</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong frowned. This was not the battle he’d been expecting.</p>
 <p>Without much doubt, Xie Xie had won another round. There was only one student who hadn’t competed at all. As the matches progressed, only three competitors remained.</p>
 <p>The only student who hadn’t competed was a female student. This was a chubby girl who looked a little dumb.</p>
 <p>All of the students’ gazes were directed towards Wu Zhangkong. There were three remaining students, so how would the competition proceed?</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong drew a slight breath and decided, “Tang Wulin, Han Lan, both of you may compete first. The winner will compete against Xie Xie.”</p>
 <p>Xie Xie’s face revealed a glint of triumph and he looked towards Tang Wulin with arrogance. He was trying to show that the teacher’s opinion of him was higher.</p>
 <p>However, he didn’t realise that through his arrogance, he forgot that he was continuously competing against an opponent with the trash martial soul, Bluesilver Grass.</p>
 <p>However, Tang Wulin didn’t even bother a look towards Xie Xie’s direction as he returned to the competition grounds.</p>
 <p>Although Han Lan had only experienced two rounds of matches, she had left Tang Wulin with a deep impression. It wasn’t only for her size, but also for her martial soul.</p>
 <p>Han Lan’s martial soul was the Earth Element, a fine martial soul. Her soul power was at rank 13, and one wouldn’t have considered placing her in Class Five by the look of her capabilities.</p>
 <p>“Start!” The the fourth round of match started with Wu Zhangkong’s command.</p>
