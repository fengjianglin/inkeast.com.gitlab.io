 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter 87 – I Have a Dragon in My Body?</strong></span></p>
 <p>When Wu Zhangkong lifted his blade and pointed it to the ground, it was done in a gentle and free motion, without a trace of forcefulness behind it.. In that situation, Tang Wulin hadn’t been able to clearly see what happened next.</p>
 <p>Yet, when Wu Zhangkong’s Skyfrost Sword touched Guang Biao’s fist, he could clearly hear a sorrowful dragon’s roar echo within his mind. Moreover, this dragon’s roar reverberated continuously. As one scale flew off that fist, one after another, that pained dragon’s roar caused his mind to tremble. He felt as though Wu Zhangkong’s attack had actually been targeting himself. In fact, after the scales flew off, he could even feel the chilling sword qi that had entered Guang Biao’s body, and the suffering it caused to his martial soul.</p>
 <p>In that moment, Tang Wulin’s heart trembled, and another voice appeared within the depths of his mind. That voice had been in extreme rage and the burning, hot sensation he’d felt when he was stabbed by the Light Dragon Dagger appeared once more. Although it was only for a brief moment, and it hadn’t caused his body to transform, it still made him greatly shocked.</p>
 <p>From the moment the power first appeared to now, it seems to have been appearing more and more frequently. Tang Wulin realized that his body seemed to be hiding some sort of secret deep within it. Moreover, this secret likely had something to do with the mutation of his Bluesilver Grass.</p>
 <p>With this thought in mind, Tang Wulin’s heart couldn’t help but stir restlessly. Normally, it would be very easy for him to enter a state of meditation, yet today, he couldn’t keep a tranquil state of mind for a long time.</p>
 <p>Yun Xiao and Zhou Zhangxi had already returned to the dorm. Despite being normally calm, Yun Xiao was in high spirits as he discussed with Zhou Zhangxi and Xie Xie about Wu Zhangkong’s two sword attacks and his charm.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin could hear their discussion. As he attempted to enter a meditative state, his mind was gradually filled with more and more distracting thoughts. That continuous dragon’s roar had excited his body. It seemed that something special was growing within his body.</p>
 <p>Gradually, his consciousness became hazy, and the dragon’s constant roaring died down. It seemed that he was finally entering a meditative state.</p>
 <p>He gently circulated his soul power. The others were already meditating at this time, so they didn’t see the golden vein pattern appear on Tang Wulin’s tailbone.</p>
 <p>A scorching heat suddenly enveloped his body, causing his entire being to start trembling. His brows were knitted, as if he were in extreme pain.</p>
 <p>Darkness. It was pitch-black darkness. Nothing could be seen through this darkness. Tang Wulin discovered that he had arrived in a pitch-black world.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a golden light appeared off in the distance.The golden light was simply too dazzling, and he couldn’t help but give it all of his attention.</p>
 <p>The golden light drew closer and closer, causing its enormous size to become more apparent the closer it came. When Tang Wulin could finally and clearly see what it was, he was shocked to discover that it was actually a gigantic golden dragon.</p>
 <p>The golden dragon had five claws, and its entire body was covered in large golden scales. A pair of horns sprouted from its head, and its form serpentine.</p>
 <p>Ah, why did he know it was a dragon? It was clearly different from the dragons on the continent! It didn’t have any wings and it had five claws under its belly. Yet, how did he know it was a dragon?</p>
 <p>The golden light suddenly blossomed, giving Tang Wulin the feeling of one looking down upon the land. When he lowered his own head, he could see his body. At this moment, his body seemed somewhat illusory.</p>
 <p>He was standing atop an azure tiled floor and it seemed that he was in an enormous hall. Floating up in the air within this hall was that gigantic golden dragon.</p>
 <p>Compared to before, he could see much more clearly now. Tang Wulin was amazed to discover that the dragon was over a hundred meters long and had eighteen rings of light around it.</p>
 <p>Every single ring of light emitted a limpid blue radiance. He didn’t know why, but when Tang Wulin saw this blue light, the first thing he thought of was actually his own Bluesilver Grass.</p>
 <p>“You’ve arrived at last.” At that moment, a pure, cold voice resounded throughout the hall. In an instant, the entire hall was lit up by a golden radiance which then condensed in the center into a human form.</p>
 <p>The form’s body was very transparent, and it was impossible to make out his exact appearance. It was almost as if his body was made purely of light and shadows.</p>
 <p>“Who are you? What is this place? Am I dreaming?” Tang Wulin asked.</p>
 <p>“Maybe you are. I don’t know who I am either….” That golden silhouettes voice seemed to be at a loss. “I am just a thread of divine consciousness. I am a thread of divine consciousness dedicated to guiding you. You could say that this is a dream of yours, but you could also say that it’s a part of your body.”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin was only nine years old after all, so his curiosity was much greater than his fear. He curiously asked, “So you’re saying I have a dragon in my body?”</p>
 <p>The golden figure said, “It isn’t just a dragon, but a dragon king. To be more precise, it is the soul<span style="font-size: 13.3333px"><span><a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>&nbsp;</span></span>of the Golden Dragon King.”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin asked in awe, “Is it my martial soul?”</p>
 <p>“No,” the golden figure answered. “In a certain sense, it is a disaster for you. This is because the Golden Dragon King’s energy is too strong, so your weak body cannot bear it. If its energy should ever break loose, you will die.”</p>
 <p><i>Die? &nbsp;</i>Tang Wulin was dumbfounded. He was still young and had never expected to face the concept of death so soon.</p>
 <p>If he died, then what would happen to his mother and father? He wouldn’t be able to go search for Na’er either.</p>
 <p>“Will, will I definitely die?” Tang Wulin foolishly asked.</p>
 <p>“If it was certain, then I wouldn’t appear here. If you follow my instructions, you will have a chance at life. It will, however, be very difficult for you.” The golden figure’s voice was soothing.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin bit his lip. “Then what do I need to do?”</p>
 <p>The golden figure solemnly said, “Since you have come here, it is proof that you can already sense the soul’s power and are beginning to be influenced by it. The Golden Dragon King possesses the greatest physical strength, so its energy will also affect your body. Doesn’t your strength surpass that of ordinary people?”</p>
 <p>Before this, Tang Wulin had still thought it was a dream. Yet, when he heard the golden figure’s words, he gradually came to realize that perhaps it wasn’t a dream after all. At the very least, this wasn’t as simple as a dream.</p>
 <p>“Yes. My strength is much greater than ordinary people,” Tang Wulin said honestly.</p>
 <p>The golden figure said, “That is because you’re already being influenced by the Golden Dragon King. The Golden Dragon King’s energy is like a ticking time bomb within your body. It is only because of those eighteen seals on its almighty body that you are still able to live. In order to solve this issue, you can only rely on yourself. The Golden Dragon King’s power is immense, but those eighteen seals restrict its strength sequentially. In order to live, you must undo those seals one by one in order to gradually assimilate the Golden Dragon King’s energy. The day you are able to completely assimilate all of its energy is the day when you are truly safe.”</p>
 <p>“Assimilate? How do I assimilate its energy?” Tang Wulin urgently asked.</p>
