 <p><span style> The pre-federation Sun Moon Empire later annexed the Heaven Dou Empire and turned Heaven Dou City into an ordinary city. Tang Wulin clearly remembered, however, that the city was founded on a splendid location. It was right beside the legendary Great Star Dou Forest—which teemed with soul beasts—and was fairly close to the great Shrek City, said to be the very core of the Douluo Continent. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I wonder when I’ll be able to visit Shrek City and Great Star Dou Forest. What will it be like? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Heaven Dou City was completely different from Eastsea City. Tang Wulin had thought Heaven Dou City would have taller and more developed buildings, but only when he saw Heaven Dou City did he realise that it was his own imagination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His initial impression of the city was that it was simple and plain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was right, simple and plain! </span></p>
 <p><span style>The city was filled with old era-styled buildings, but what was most surprising was that not a single skyscraper could be seen. The tallest thing in his line of sight were actually some towering ancient trees.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher Wu, why aren’t there any skyscrapers here?” Tang Wulin quietly inquired. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong explained, “Heaven Dou City is a historical city; in order to preserve its historical value, the city imposed regulations that buildings were not to surpass fifty meters in height and were, at most, ten stories high. These regulations are the reason why you will see plenty of ancient trees taller than fifty meters rather than skyscrapers.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“A lot of history fanatics love this city and come here as tourists. This city is filled with culture and was actually where the Tang Sect was first founded. Even now, there is an important branch of the Tang Sect situated here.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s curiosity was piqued. “Then what about the Tang Sect’s headquarters? Where is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong gave him a sharp glance. “The headquarters? It’s in Shrek City of course.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh.” It suddenly struck Tang Wulin. </span><i><span style>That’s right! The Tang Sect is powerful, so its headquarters has to be in a super city like Shrek City! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher Wu, what are we doing in Heaven Dou City then?” Tang Wulin’s interest had only grown with this newfound knowledge. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong answered with indifference, “I’m here to see a friend. After that, I’ll bring you to a few places. Let’s get going.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The duo didn’t board another vehicle, opting to roam the historical streets of Heaven Dou City. The weather in Heaven Dou City was pleasantly warm and slightly humid. Coupled with the abundance of plant life, the air was exceptionally refreshing. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It only took a few minutes for Tang Wulin to develop a liking for the city. Walking along these streets was a type of enjoyment. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow! Teacher Wu, what’s that over there? It smells so nice!” Tang Wulin bounced with excitement as he pointed toward a fragrant shop. </span></p>
 <p><span style>At a loss, Wu Zhangkong could only doubtfully ask, “You can still eat?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin nodded without a thought. “Teacher Wu, let me treat you to a meal! I have money too.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shaking his head, Wu Zhangkong responded, “Let’s go. I’ll pay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two entered the shop. It’s signboard said “Yuhao’s Roasted Fish”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the name of the shop, Wu Zhangkong’s eyes instantly lit up. “No wonder it smells so good, it’s actually this shop.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin asked, “You’ve been here before?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong answered, “Yuhao’s Roasted Fish is famous in the central part of the continent, especially in Heaven Dou City, Shrek City, and Star Luo City. It was said that the recipe for their roasted fish was passed down from the founder of the Spirit Pagoda, Huo Yuhao. That’s where the shop got its name from. It was also said that he used his roasted fish to woo the Dragon Butterfly Douluo. Speaking of which, your name is rather similar to the Dragon Butterfly Douluo’s; her name is Tang Wutong.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>A hint of yearning colored Tang Wulin’s eyes. “So those legendary figures loved to eat too!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong’s face twitched. “That’s what you got out of what I said?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh…” Tang Wulin awkwardly scratched his head as he tried to suppress his impatience to eat. “Teacher Wu, let’s go in then.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuhao’s Roasted Fish bustled with noise. Even though it couldn’t be considered a proper restaurant, the shop was filled to the brim with customers savoring the delicious fragrance of the roasted fish. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The two seated themselves in a corner. Wu Zhangkong had clearly been here numerous times so he ordered several dishes quickly, but with Tang Wulin’s input, he just ended up ordering ten of every single dish. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Roasted fish tasted the best right after it had finished roasting. The skin would be crispy yet have tender and succulent meat. The light fragrance and delicate fish stock combined to create one of the world’s delicacies. </span></p>
 <p><span style>For once, Tang Wulin was able to eat until he was satisfied. Although he could eat a lot in the academy’s dining hall, there was just one problem with its food: their taste was only decent! Every meal he had had at the dining hall was only for the purpose of filling his stomach and nothing more. Yet, every bite of roasted fish was pure bliss! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s face was flushed from the delicious roasted fish. A brave light twinkled in his eyes, as if he was prepared to eat his own tongue together with the fish.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After gracefully eating two roasted fish, Wu Zhangkong shifted his attention to Tang Wulin’s eating performance. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s ninety-one fish in total… The price…” Wu Zhangkong had gotten the bill. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Teacher Wu.” Tang Wulin was so invigorated after eating so much that he actually wanted to eat some more. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong merely looked at him. “It must have been hard for your family to raise you.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Only after staring blankly at Wu Zhangkong for a moment did Tang Wulin realize that Wu Zhangkong meant his ability to eat. </span><i><span style>Teacher Wu actually knows how to tell a joke? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher, what are we going to do now?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll find a place to stay first. You were in a deep meditation for seven days after all. After washing up and changing into a fresh set of clothes, we’ll go out again.” Wu Zhangkong said. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The inn Wu Zhangkong chose was by no means luxurious; in fact, it was very plain. Its only merit was that it was clean. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong only rented out a single room with two beds. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The first thing Tang Wulin did was wash up and take a relaxing bath. He changed into a clean set of clothes and felt completely refreshed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong took a little longer than Tang Wulin to wash up before changing into a set of almost identical white robes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>His white robes fluttered about while his long hair draped behind him. He had already used his soul power to evaporate the water in his hair. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re going!” A trace of melancholy swept past his eyes as he peered out the window. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin had a feeling that the moment he entered Heaven Dou City, there was a change in Wu Zhangkong. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Leaving the inn, Wu Zhangkong chose to continue their journey on foot. It was clear though that their pace had sped up. Wu Zhangkong lead Tang Wulin with familiarity along the winding streets that gradually changed from bustling crowds to quiet cheerlessness. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just where are we headed?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Turning onto a small, narrow road, there were even less people to be found. Only two soul cars could fit side-by-side on this street. </span></p>
 <p><span style>On one side of the small road was a tall wall. A dense thicket of vegetation could be seen over it. On the other side of the road was a forest. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin felt a clear change in Wu Zhangkong’s mood as they walked this road. Both Wu Zhangkong’s breathing and pace clearly sped up, but what was even more obvious was the disappearance of the usual coldness in his eyes, replaced by complicated feelings. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Depression, longing and melancholy could all be seen in his eyes. If he was usually described as ‘white robes and blue swords, sky ice and snow cold’, then now he could only be called a melancholic man. He had completely shed off his shell of coldness to reveal his original warmth, but this change was still overshadowed by the complex emotions within his heart. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They followed the road for another five hundred meters before a gate appeared in the large wall. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heaven Dou Public Cemetery”</span><i><span style>.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s heart trembled at these four words. </span><i><span style>This… is actually a cemetery? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A chill crawled down his spine. </span><i><span style>Teacher Wu brought me to a cemetery? Who is he paying his respects to? </span></i></p>
