 <p><span style>“The next time an Azure-veined Vine will be auctioned is in three days, with the bids starting at eight in the evening. I believe there are three sets available.” Ruo Ling said, a smile so sweet it could cause diabetes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong frowned. “If I want to buy a high-grade vine immediately, how would I do so?” It had been years since he last visited this auction and rarely did he visit any auction in general.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ruo Ling hesitated for a moment, biting back her words as she organized her thoughts. “According to our rules, we’re not allowed to sell items directly. But I can make an exception for someone as honorable as you. An instant purchase will cost twenty-percent more than the estimated sales price. We can offer an accurate quote once you’ve considered it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong turned to face Tang Wulin. “How about it?” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>An extra twenty percent? That’s a lot of money! </span></i><span style>Tang Wulin’s heart hurt at the mere thought of it. The listed price for a high-grade vine was five million federal coins. With twenty percent added on, he’d be shelling out six million! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, he saved up a small fortune over the years, but that had been earned with his sweat and blood! </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher Wu, isn’t the auction in just three days?” Tang Wulin answered finally, though not without some hesitation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Their eyes met, teacher and student communicating in silence before the former nodded. “Fine. Give us two auction tickets. We’ll come bid for the vine in three days.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright. Please wait a moment. I will go handle this.” Ruo Ling agreed with a smile before leaving. In the brief period she had been in contact with Wu Zhangkong, she understood that he was not one to offend. She was less than a speck in his eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After obtaining tickets to the auction, Wu Zhangkong left for the inn with Tang Wulin in tow. Everything had been left to Tang Wulin to decide without Wu Zhangkong making a single remark or suggestion. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In truth, Tang Wulin had been nervous. Not only was the Shrek exam in a week, but he had to wait three days before he could lay hands on the Azure-veined Vine. That left him with four days to break the seal. Luckily, his body was stronger than it had been during the first unsealing. As such, he should just make it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>His nerves settled at this epiphany, relief swallowing him whole. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin cultivated in his room until the day of the auction. Xie Xie followed suit, his friend’s diligence rubbing off on him, even though he knew deep down that sharpening the spear at the last minute was pointless. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three days later, Tang Wulin and Wu Zhangkong returned to the auction house. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They were led immediately to the VIP seats. Only two types of people could be found here: those with money and those with strength. Wu Zhangkong belonged to the latter. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The auction beat Eastsea City’s in grandness by a longshot. Every single item auctioned was a rarity and the mood was soon set. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“The eleventh item to be auctioned is a high-grade thousand-year Azure-veined Vine. The starting price is three million. The minimum bid increase is one hundred thousand. Let the bidding begin.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was finally time. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin clenched his fists without realizing. He stared at the item like a desert-bound man would look at water. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Nonchalantly, Wu Zhangkong slipped the number plate into Tang Wulin’s hands, as if the bidding had nothing to do with him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He was generous when advising Tang Wulin on everything related to cultivation, but was a mute when it came to money matters. This spurred Tang Wulin to learn and adapt fast, to become independent, lest he be taken advantage of.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Three million,” Tang Wulin said as he raised his number plate. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Three million one hundred thousand.” A person followed quickly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Because of the lack of side effects and its ability to increase one’s constitution while strengthening the physique, the Azure-veined Vine was expensive. Tremendously so, in fact. For large clans, it was seen as a necessity, used in rearing the younger generation. Thus, the demand for it was always high. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Three million five hundred thousand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Three million eight hundred thousand” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The price kept increasing. The hand in which Tang Wulin held the number plate grew sticky with sweat. At the current bidding rate, the price would soon exceed five million! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Regret crept into his heart. If he had known this would be the outcome, he would have paid six million up front! </span></p>
 <p><span style>For every item on the program, the sales price listed was the minimum amount of money the auction house needed in order to break even. Tang Wulin had seldom attended auctions in his life. Therefore, he didn’t know this important fact. </span></p>
 <p><span style>If the treasure wasn’t popular, then the final price would usually hover around the estimated sales price. Items in high demand, however, often exceeded the estimated value by far. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In reality, the price Ruo Ling had given Wu Zhangkong was heavily discounted in consideration of his status. There was rarely enough thousand-year Azure-veined Vines to go around, and this fact was reflected in its price. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Tang Wulin’s ignorance that bit him in the back. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong had known, yet chose not to warn his student. In his mind, Tang Wulin had to experience this bitterness himself so that the lesson would be carved into his heart. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Five million four hundred thousand!” Tang Wulin was on the verge of tears, almost crumpling into himself as he raised his number plate. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Five million seven hundred thousand!” Another person shouted out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin didn’t have a single moment to spare in regret. Although he was stingy, breaking the seal was more important. The chances of success were the highest with a high-grade vine. There was only one being auctioned today. Even if he threw out the six million right now, he wouldn’t be able to buy a second one. </span></p>
 <p><span style>His sole option was to fight tooth and nail for it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Six million two hundred thousand!” Tang Wulin’s face was morphed into an unsightly expression as the price breached the six million mark. </span><i><span style>I was stupid. Why didn’t I just buy it back then? I could have broken through three days earlier and saved some money! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Six million three hundred thousand.” He had no choice but to continue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Six million five hundred thousand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Six million eight hundred thousand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seven million three hundred thousand!” Tang Wulin gnashed his teeth as his number plate shot up once more. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, the audience was quiet. A pin drop could be heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seven million three hundred thousand going once!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seven million three hundred thousand going twice!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seven million three hundred thousand going three times!</span><span style>“And sold!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s entire body went limp in his seat the moment gavel sounded. </span><i><span style>One million three hundred thousand… I paid an extra one million three hundred thousand! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong looked him in the eye and said, “I showed them my identification as a battle armor master that day. Popular items usually exceed the estimated sales price. The price you won it for today is about normal. Do you understand now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin forced out a smile. “I understand, but the price is still painful.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go.” Wu Zhangkong didn’t comfort Tang Wulin. This had been Tang Wulin’s own choice; thus, he must live with it himself. It was useless to blame others. He didn’t tell Tang Wulin this explicitly, and instead chose to teach him this lesson through his actions. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin trembled with remorse as he paid the bill. He had earned about fourteen million federal coins after three years of hard work. The vine costed half of his entire savings!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t for his high chance to succeed at Spirit Refinement which would save him some material costs, he would have coughed up blood on the spot. His remaining amount of savings was a pitiful shadow of its former self. </span></p>
