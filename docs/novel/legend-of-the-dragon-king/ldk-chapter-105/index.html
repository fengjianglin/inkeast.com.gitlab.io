 <p><span style><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;105 -&nbsp;Golden Dragon Claw</strong></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>A faintly discernible golden ray of light appeared from his body for a split second, causing Wang Jinxi’s Bone Dragon Claw to immediately slow down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Golden Dragon Claw smacked down at his head. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop!” Long Henxu and Ye Yingluo shouted out simultaneously. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But at the moment, Tang Wulin’s mind was only filled with rage over the sight of Xie Xie’s injuries. With his Golden Dragon Claw attacking at full strength, it was impossible to stop now. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Right at that moment, a slender arm noiselessly appeared and touched Tang Wulin’s right arm, softly pushing it aside. The Golden Dragon Claw that was originally heading towards Wang Jinxi’s head was deflected and smacked his right claw instead. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang! </span></i><span style>Despite being several times bigger than Tang Wulin at this moment, Wang Jinxi was smashed into the ground, while Tang Wulin landed softly on the other side due to the counterforce. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enough!” A cold voice rang out. Just like the morning bell and the evening drum, it caused Tang Wulin to wake from his rage. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong stood beside him, holding the injured Xie Xie. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Jinxi’s Bone Dragon Claw was snapped at an angle as it lay on the ground, while his tail clearly had a fracture where Tang Wulin had struck it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a black light separated from Wang Jinxi’s transformed body. When the two kids returned to normal, they released miserable shrieks of pain. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Yangzi lay on the ground, both of his legs broken, while Wang Jinxi’s right arm had fractured, bent at an impossible angle. The two of them couldn’t help but utter screams of intolerable agony. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This match had developed into something so tragic that none had expected it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher Wu, how can you allow your students to be so violent?” Ye Yingluo flew onto the stage, finger pointed at Wu Zhangkong as she snarled the accusation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong said to Tang Wulin, “Go.” From beginning to end, he didn’t spare a glance for Ye Yingluo. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Yingluo wanted to chase after him, but Wu Zhangkong suddenly released a sharp ice-cold aura which caused her whole body to freeze up as she felt the sensation of death. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After Tang Wulin’s arm returned to normal, a wave of weakness came over him. Even though he had puffed out a mouthful of the black gas earlier, some still remained of that ice-cold feeling within the pit of his stomach. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Following behind Wu Zhangkong was Gu Yue, who was looking at Xie Xie in Wu Zhangkong’s arms. Together, the three of them got off the stage. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Hengxu remained onstage with a gloomy expression&nbsp;as if his face was dripping with water. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This time we have a major situation. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In this Class Promotion Tournament, three students had been seriously injured and as the referee, he had to take responsibility! This was a major situation that hadn’t happened for many years. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong brought Xie Xie directly to the infirmary to have a teacher with a recovery-type martial soul inspect his body. Fortunately, it was only a fracture. Although his two arms had suffered some minor fractures and these injuries couldn’t be considered light, his body was fine for the most part. His internal organs had only been shaken up a little, so he only needed some time to rest and recover. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The dark energy within Tang Wulin was also dispersed by the teacher. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher Wu, I…” Tang Wulin looked at the silent and ice-cold Wu Zhangkong, wanting to explain himself. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t need to say anymore as you didn’t do anything wrong. You two just hurry up and go back and rest,” Wu Zhangkong indifferently said. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh. Then Xie Xie…?” Tang Wulin hesitantly asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will be here.” Wu Zhangkong gave him a look. </span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Tang Wulin suddenly felt that this ice-cold teacher wasn’t so cold after all. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin and Gu Yue left the sick bay with complicated expressions. Xie Xie had broken both of his arms; this was definitely a serious injury. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin was full of guilt. If he had been fast enough to pull Xie Xie back with his Bluesilver Grass at that moment, then Xie Xie wouldn’t have suffered such serious injuries. He had been too careless as the team captain. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t think about it too much.” Gu Yue turned and said to Tang Wulin, “None of us had expected a situation like that. If my guess is correct, Zhang Yangzi and Wang Jinxi had used a soul fusion skill. Supposedly, soul fusion skills are nearly impossible to see nowadays in the world of Soul Masters. It can only appear if two martial souls are exceptionally compatible with each other.” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Soul fusion skill? </span></i><span style>Tang Wulin had heard a bit about them in class. If two Soul Masters had martial souls that were compatible enough, then they had the possibility of using a soul fusion skill, one of the strongest types of techniques. Soul fusion skill effects didn’t add the strengths of both sides, but rather, it multiplied the strength of the two Soul Masters! </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What I am curious about is how you are able to defeat them, even if their soul fusion isn’t perfect! Your right hand…” Gu Yue looked inquisitively at Tang Wulin’s right arm. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin went silent for a moment before he gently shook his head. “Gu Yue, we’re friends, so I don’t want to lie to you. But I really can’t tell you about it. So, please don’t ask, okay?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue pondered over it for a moment before giving him her reply, “Fine then. I won’t ask, but you must learn to control your power. It seems to be very formidable, but such great power also requires great control. It seems that during the week of the hurricane, a change occurred in your martial soul.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>That was right! A change had indeed appeared. Moreover, it was an extremely powerful change. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin thought back to when he had taken those spirit medicines and attacked the seal afterward. </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">☀</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Intense pain. Pain so intense that Tang Wulin couldn’t even be bothered to take in the changes around him anymore. Chill, heat, itchiness. These three sensations replaced each other frequently in what seemed like an endless cycle. And when he thought it was over, he began to feel all three at the same time. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The only reason he had been able to succeed was by clinging onto his sense of existence. Regardless of how intense the pain was, he never gave up in his heart. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the reason he had been able to surpass his limits. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After some time, he grew muddle-headed. At that moment, he could vaguely see that his body as well as his surroundings had turned golden. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The golden veins within his skin came alive, slowly creeping up his body. With a clanging sound, it seemed that something within his body had been torn to shreds. At that time, he still didn’t understand the meaning of pain. Suddenly, an indescribably powerful and fantastic energy drilled into every single corner of his body. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Cold, heat, itchiness. All disappeared. In its place was a feeling of being bloated. </span></p>
 <p><span style>His bones, meridians, viscera, and skin all felt as though they had inflated and would pop at any moment. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This, this is the seal’s energy?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In that instant, Tang Wulin no longer doubted Old Tang’s words. The energy that was sealed from the Golden Dragon King’s soul could definitely cause his body to explode if his body wasn’t strong enough. Faced with the assault of such tyrannical energy, he was afraid that his entire being would shatter. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The pain from that feeling of bloatedness gradually reached a peak before receding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had survived and hadn’t blown up. In that moment, Tang Wulin was sure that he was fine.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is the seal breaking done? </span></i><span style>His mind gradually relaxed as the pain receded, until finally, he lost consciousness. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The golden veins along Tang Wulin’s body broke apart, becoming tiny specks of light that moved away from his body while the golden veins on his vertebra became even clearer. Gradually, the golden veins reappeared on his body, but this time they were much more prominent and deeper in color. The golden specks of light slowly merged with his right arm, while the rest of his body underwent an imperceptible transformation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After surviving the onslaught of the seal’s energy, he now had to assimilate it and undergo a transformation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The little Grass Snake, Goldlight, slithered onto Tang Wulin’s body. It lazily curled up atop his body, the golden lines on its skin now closely resembling those on Tang Wulin’s. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Goldlight trembled slightly, as if it was experiencing tremendous agony. Its trembling, earthen yellow body gradually turned golden as it grew longer and larger. It no longer looked as weak and frail as before. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A strand of Bluesilver Grass quietly appeared within the palm of Tang Wulin’s right hand. The golden veins along its body no longer seemed as illusory as before, but rather, a golden light could clearly be seen within. This vine-like grass was now taller and straighter, no longer seeming as delicate as it had been. </span></p>
