 <p><span style><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;210 - Stargod Sword</strong></span></span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Purple? A thousand-year soul ring? </span></i><span style>This realization shocked Ye Xinglan. She hadn’t seen any of Tang Wulin’s previous battles; her only impression of him was his weak soul power fluctuations. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had expected that he had one ring, but never did she imagine that it would be a purple ring. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Xinglan instantly reassessed the situation with this new piece of information. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>To be able to support a thousand-year soul ring, both his body and spirit must be powerful! There’s no other explanation for it. Looks like he’s more talented than I gave him credit for! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>But Ye Xinglan wasn’t worried despite this shocking revelation. Her confidence as a student of Shrek Academy couldn’t be shaken by something as minor as this. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Two yellow soul rings rose from her feet as she reached out and grasped her coalescing martial soul. Although her ring configuration was identical to Tang Wulin’s opponent from the day before, Ye Xinglan’s martial soul gave him a completely different feeling. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A long sword materialized in her hand. Sparks of light twinkled along the slender brilliance of its yellow blade like the stars in the night sky, showcasing a splendor that was attention-grabbing even in daylight. Ye Xinglan’s presence faded with the appearance of the sword, her essence fusing with it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>One with the sword! </span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>A ten-year-old girl has reached such a realm? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Every powerful, perceptive observer in the stands was astonished. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As the two approached each other, Tang Wulin forwent his Bluesilver Grass; instead, he reached out to grab her shoulder. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Xinglan made her move at the very last moment; she took a step to the right. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>This seemingly simple action had Tang Wulin’s gut twisting in alarm. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Xinglan’s one step put her in the perfect position to strike his most vulnerable weak point. However, momentum propelled him forward and he passed through the spot that Ye Xinglan had just moved from. It was too late for him to turn around. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Xinglan slashed at Tang Wulin’s ribs. Her sword stroke was casual and smooth, slow and steady. Unavoidable. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was in that moment of crisis that Tang Wulin displayed his body’s flexibility. He twisted his body and his back arched like a bow—while he was still within striking distance, it bought him enough time for golden scales to ripple across his arm and block the blade.. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A metallic tink rang out. Ye Xinglan spun around, dispersing the excess energy of the clash. To her surprise, she found herself two meters from where she originally stood. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Anxiety gripped Tang Wulin. A strange chill had penetrated his scales during their clash and had violently rushed into his body. He summoned his bloodline power and soul power into action, sealing the foreign energy off. Only with the combined power of the two could he keep it at bay. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Even then, light exploded from his right arm, sending him reeling back two steps. </span></p>
 <p><span style>From just this brief clash, Tang Wulin was clearly the one at a disadvantage. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, astonishment flashed in Ye Xinglan’s eyes. </span><i><span style>My </span></i><i><span style>Stargod Sword’s</span></i><i><span style> stargod energy couldn’t invade his body? Usually even three-ringed soul masters can’t defend against it! This guy’s body is weird. His arm has scales on it… </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Despite her mind whirling with shock, Ye Xinglan did not pause. Her first soul ring lit up the moment she stopped spinning, imbuing starlight into the blade as she aimed at Tang Wulin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin trembled in the face of this attack. Her first move had already displayed the terrifying strength of her sword; he had already been hard-pressed to defend against her sword when she wasn’t using a soul skill, so he could only imagine how powerful it would be when it was combined with one. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin could no longer afford to hold back. Strand after strand of Bluesilver Grass sprang out and wove together into a large net in front of him, intent on enveloping the stellar attack. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>His martial soul has nothing to do with the scales on his arm? Does he have twin souls? </span></i><span style>Ye Xinglan’s mind quickly processed this new knowledge. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The starlight and Bluesilver Grass collided. Nothing exploded. Instead, &nbsp;golden light dyed each and every strand of grass it touched, wrestling control of the grass out of Tang Wulin’s hands. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What is that? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s shock deepened as Ye Xinglan pointed her sword at the sky, directing the gold-touched Bluesilver Grass into the air. Now, nothing stood between the two. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What a strange soul skill. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Even though he was startled, Tang Wulin quickly retreated. Violet light flickered in his eyes as he activated Purple Demon Eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Faced with such a powerful opponent, he couldn’t afford not to use every trick up his sleeve. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment she saw the purple glint in Tang Wulin’s eyes, Ye Xinglan closed her own. She activated her second soul skill, shrouding herself in starlight. The defense was airtight, without a single gap for Tang Wulin’s Purple Demon Eyes to attack. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That shield can defend against spiritual attacks?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Xinglan cut through the net of Bluesilver Grass she had seized control of and thrust her Stargod Sword at Tang Wulin; flickering duplicates charged at Tang Wulin as her footwork changed into mysterious erratic steps.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Not good! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin had a wealth of combat experience, but even the cleverest housewife couldn’t cook without rice! With the control of his martial soul stolen by his opponent, what else could he do? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin made a surprising choice: he closed his eyes. Since he couldn’t clearly ascertain the situation, he would use his other senses. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s spiritual power exceeded two hundred points, meaning he was in the intermediate Spirit Connection realm. Taking his constant forging into consideration, his perception could not be compared with that of an ordinary person. With his gaze still shuttered, he willed his right hand to transform into the golden dragon claw. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ding! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin brandished his claws, blocking the strike to his shoulder. </span></p>
 <p><span style>His claw blocked the stargod energy. Even when the Stargod Sword released more energy, it couldn’t move a single inch forward. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin held the sword in place, but Ye Xinglan’s responded swiftly. She freed her sword with a flick of her wrist and commanded the surrounding starlight to gather around her sword. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Stargod Sword grew with a brighter radiance. At the same time, Tang Wulin regained control over his Bluesilver Grass. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin clawed at her, but Ye Xinglan simply swatted his attack down. His ability to sense Ye Xinglan’s location, on the other hand, was increasingly accurate. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve got some good tricks. It looks like I’ll need to take this seriously.” Ye Xinglan nimbly retreated. Her eyes brightened, then shone as if they were two stars. Specks of starlight converged around her and without any warning, she charged forward again, twice as fast a before. Her Stargod Sword seemed to become the manifestation of the myriad stars in the skies as it advanced upon Tang Wulin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin recalled his Bluesilver Grass to fortify his defense. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Xinglan’s sword danced as she struck the thicket of grass. With each stroke of her blade, a strand of Bluesilver Grass would explode in a burst of light. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The tip of her sword fluttered about like a butterfly. Bluesilver Grass would scatter wherever it touched, until dozens of swords stabbed at Tang Wulin simultaneously, completely surrounding him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This wasn’t a soul skill—it was pure technique! </span></p>
