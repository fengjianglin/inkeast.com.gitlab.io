 <p><span style><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;222 - Suppressed and Restrained</strong></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>A strange energy emanated from their bodies. Zhou Tian’er’s first soul ring lit up as she raised her hand. Vines appeared from beneath the two sisters, wrapping around their legs and waist before rapidly dragging them backwards, instantly opening a wide gap between them and Tang Wulin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin reacted without thinking; Bluesilver Grass shot out as he activated Bind and charged ahead whilst he himself followed behind. </span></p>
 <p><span style>To one side Xie Xie had reached Wang Dongqi. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Rather than retreating, Wang Dongqi stepped forward to welcome him with a newly manifested sword in hand. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Silver lightning ran in jagged lines along the length of the sword’s violet blade, enshrouding it with an aura of magnificence. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A simple slash of her sword sent a bolt of silver lightning at Xie Xie. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie gathered strength within his legs and forcefully leapt off the ground and into the air, evading the lightning bolt while simultaneously closing the distance between them</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike Wu Zhangkong’s Skyfrost Sword and Ye Xinglan’s Stargod Sword, Wang Dongqi’s Thunderflash Sword used soul power to enhance its lightning-attribute soul skills rather than the sword itself. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She raised her Thunderflash Sword high into the air, calling down a storm of lightning snakes around her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This was her second soul skill, </span><span style>Chaotic Dance of the Silver Snakes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Dongqi looked down upon Xie Xie. Although he had two rings at the young age of ten, she felt he couldn’t possibly compare with her. Three rings was a major milestone for soul masters; it meant that one had reached the middle level of a soul master and often the third soul skill brought a huge power boost. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She had decided to use Chaotic Dance of the Silver Snakes the moment Xie Xie had moved against her since this soul skill specialized in restraining agility-type soul masters.. As an assault-type soul master and with her Thunderflash Sword’s characteristics, she was most effective at restraining agility-type soul masters. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only did lightning have explosive power, its paralysis effect could cripple the speed of an agility-type soul master. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The lightning blossomed into a flower of silver light that instantly swallowed Xie Xie. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite not having much firepower, if Chaotic Dance of the Silver Snakes struck and paralyzed its opponent, it wouldn’t take much effort for Wang Dongqi to finish them off. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She had yet to be defeated by an agility-type soul master of the same rank as her. Their defeat was guaranteed the moment she was their opponent. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A smile had already settled on her lips. Her team’s victory would be assured once she defeated her opponent; she wasn’t worried for the Zhou sisters at all. After all, the two were the core strength of the team. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But at that instant, her smile stiffened. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as the lightning snakes were about to strike him Xie Xie’s figure wobbled, then duplicated into a multitude of ghostly shadow reflections that flickered forward. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite the large range of Chaotic Dance of the Silver Snakes, it was not without gaps. The erratic bolts of lightning constantly changed positions, creating gaps that Xie Xie took advantage of and, with the sway of his body, he evaded the onslaught of lightning snakes and continued to advance on Wang Dongqi. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How can this be? That isn’t a soul skill! </span></i><span style>She hadn’t seen Xie Xie’s soul ring light up; she was utterly flabbergasted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She could understand if he had used a soul skill to protect himself, but she couldn’t comprehend this situation. </span><i><span style>Why did his body suddenly become so illusionary? Isn’t his martial soul a dagger?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>How could she have known that what Xie Xie was using right now was the Tang Sect’s Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as they had researched the Eastsea team, the Eastsea team had researched them. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Familiarity with one’s opponent could mean the difference between victory and defeat in battle. Tang Wulin had only let Xie Xie take on Wang Dongqi after thoroughly understanding her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>While Wang Dongqi’s lightning certainly was highly effective against agility-type soul masters, that was still dependent on how fast her opponent was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie had displayed spectacular combat skill the first time Tang Wulin had met him, so one could only imagine how strong he was after a year of Wu Zhangkong’s guidance and learning the Tang Sect’s Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie’s movements was like the drifting clouds and flowing water when using Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track. Wang Dongqi couldn’t keep track of him, but neither did he keep track of her. In his eyes, she was just a sitting duck. Chaotic Dance of the Silver Snakes had a large range, but was rife with holes. It was worthless in the face of true speed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Dongqi’s eyes rolled with panic. When Xie Xie arrived before her in the blink of an eye, she immediately stabbed her Thunderflash Sword into the ground and activated her third soul ring. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Silver light erupted from her body. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie instinctively backflipped, retreating from her and delaying his assault. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he had expected, lightning snakes exploded from her sword an instant after he backed away. She had used Chaotic Dance of the Silver Snakes once more. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was impossible to dodge in the air—well, at least at their level. If Xie Xie hadn’t called off his attack, he would have been paralyzed by those snakes. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Golden light gathered around Xie Xie and a second later, he unleashed his Light Dragon Storm, spurring his body to fly backwards! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Streaks of silver lightning chased after him but instantly dissipated upon contact with his Light Dragon Storm. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie twirled the Light Dragon Dagger in his hand after landing a distance away, taunting Wang Dongqi. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Her expression turned unsightly. In order to protect herself just now, she had been forced to use Chaotic Dance of the Silver Snakes twice and Thunderflash Ring once. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The consumption of those three soul skills was incomparably larger than Xie Xie’s single soul skill use and even though her soul power surpassed Xie Xie’s by far, the amount used was nothing to laugh at. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie gripped his Light Dragon Dagger and slowly circled Wang Dongqi. Not a single trace of anxiety could be found in his demeanour. Tang Wulin had only given him one mission—to keep Wang Dongqi busy,, and if he had an opportunity, defeat her. If he didn’t, then keeping her isolated was enough. </span></p>
 <p><span style>While he kept her busy here, Tang Wulin found out that his Bind was useless. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Tian’er pointed at the strands of Bluesilver Grass aiming for her, shooting a group of green lights at it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A strange sensation suddenly washed over Tang Wulin, as if his Bluesilver Grass had been enveloped in a warm embrace that gently stole his control away from him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>His sea of Bluesilver Grass went limp in the air and fell onto the ground, too lifeless to attack any more. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This...</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is attribute suppression! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin understood what he faced in an instant. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It had always been his Golden Dragon King suppressing other soul master’s and soul beasts before now. He hadn’t expected that a day would come when he would be suppressed instead. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though his Golden Dragon King bloodline had transformed his Bluesilver Grass, in the end, it was still a wood-attributed existence. His bloodline had certainly elevated it to much greater heights, but against the Zhou Tian’er who had the Wood Spirit martial soul and a higher soul power than him, being suppressed was inevitable. Even his thousand-year soul ring could do nothing to overturn this suppression. </span></p>
