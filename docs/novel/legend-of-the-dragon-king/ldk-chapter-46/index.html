 <p>Wu Zhangkong’s ice-cold and powerful voice caused the whole class to quiet down in fear.</p>
 <p>“Proceed.”</p>
 <p>“I, I am Zhou Zhangxi. My martial soul is the Titan Ape; soul power at rank 11. My goal is to become a Strength System Battle Soul Master.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Xie Xie. Martial soul is Light Dragon Dagger; soul power at rank 18. Agility System Battle Soul Master.”</p>
 <p>When the words ‘rank 18’ came out, the whole class was instantly shocked. A nine-year-old child with rank 18 soul power. This was truly a genius! Moreover, he was actually a Battle Soul Master. After another two soul power ranks, he would become a Soul Grandmaster. Anyone capable of becoming a Soul Grandmaster before twelve years old was qualified to be called a genius.</p>
 <p>In the end, the highlight of the class was Xie Xie’s soul power rank. In fact, Yun Xiao’s rank 12 soul power was considered quite high as the majority of students entered with rank 11 soul power. As for their martial souls, there were all sorts of fantastic oddities, but none of them were particularly powerful.</p>
 <p>Of course, Tang Wulin’s Bluesilver Grass was still the worst of them all. This fact was practically set in stone.</p>
 <p>“Starting tomorrow, classes will officially begin. My teaching style is a bit different from other teachers so if you’re afraid of pain, fatigue, or aches, quickly change schools or think of a way to change classes. Those who remain should mentally prepare themselves. That is all, class dismissed.”</p>
 <p>After Wu Zhangkong’s tall figure strode out from the classroom on his pair of long legs, the classroom exploded with chatter. Nearly all of them were discussing this cold, yet handsome teacher.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go then. You still need to fulfill your promise.” Xie Xie looked towards Tang Wulin as he spoke. Although it was still morning, their classes had already ended. Classes wouldn’t officially start for them until the next day.</p>
 <p>“Alright.” Tang Wulin stood up and led the way out.</p>
 <p>As soon as Tang Wulin walked through the doorway, he found that the entire floor was filled with noisy upperclassmen.</p>
 <p><i>‘What are they doing?’</i></p>
 <p>“Huh? Tang Wulin?” Right at that moment, a familiar voice called out.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin turned towards the voice, but its elegant owner had already arrived in front of him. It was the senior sister from the advanced academy who had greeted him yesterday, Liu Yuxin.</p>
 <p>“Senior sister.” Tang Wulin revealed a smile. He had a highly favorable impression of her.</p>
 <p>“Wulin. You’re in class five?”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin nodded. “My martial soul is Bluesilver Grass. It’s a trash martial soul after all. Naturally I can only enter class five.”</p>
 <p>Liu Yuxin hastily said, “No, no. That’s not what I meant. I meant to say, Teacher Wu Zhangkong is your class’s teacher right?”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin answered, “That’s right!”</p>
 <p>Liu Yuxin’s beautiful eyes instantly brightened up. “Wulin, senior sister has a matter I need to trouble you with.”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin was stunned but still said. “Alright!”</p>
 <p>Liu Yuxin placed an item in his hands and quietly said, “When you have class in the future, help me take a few pictures of the Icily Arrogant Prince Charming. Oh, that’s your teacher, Wu Zhangkong.”</p>
 <p>“Icily Arrogant Prince Charming?” Tang Wulin asked her, puzzled.</p>
 <p>Liu Yuxin’s pretty face blushed red. “You guys wouldn’t know this, but Wu Zhangkong is the number one lady-killer in our academy. With that coldness of his, regardless of whether it’s the young female teachers or the female students, we all find him charming. He was a teacher at the advanced academy previously, but for some reason he was sent to the intermediate academy. Moreover, he was actually assigned to your class. We all feel that this is an injustice against him. However, the academy has already decided on it, so there isn’t anything to be done about it, even if we all miss him. Help us take some pictures of him and this senior sister definitely won’t treat you unfairly.”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin stood there foolishly. He hadn’t expected Liu Yuxin would ask him to do this kind of thing. “Senior Sister, isn’t this no good?”</p>
 <p>Liu Yuxin giggled. “Don’t worry about it. It’s totally fine. If senior sister leaks some intel regarding Teacher Wu to you, it’ll definitely be of benefit.”</p>
 <p>Xie Xie was right behind Tang Wulin and was actually a bit impatient when he saw Tang Wulin talking with Liu Yuxin. When he heard what she said however, any desire to drag Tang Wulin away was dispelled. After hearing these circumstances, he gained an important understanding of the exotic flower that was their class’s teacher.</p>
 <p>Liu Yuxin said, “Teacher Wu is our academy’s most formidable teacher. Not only is he handsome and has an excellent build, but he’s also knowledgeable and multi-talented. He’s an excellent teacher as well. He has even cultivated to such a high level. Some say that he’s the number one expert in our academy. I think I once saw him with at least six soul rings. That means he’s at least a Soul Emperor!”</p>
 <p>Soul Emperor? This was simply too far off for Tang Wulin to imagine. With his current soul rank, it was practically impossible for him to cultivate to six soul rings as he didn’t have the ability to purchase a powerful spirit soul.</p>
 <p>The number of spirit souls a human could absorb was limited to the what their spiritual power could bear. White spirit souls could only offer up one soul ring and currently, Soul Masters could only absorb up to three spirit souls. If they absorbed three white spirit souls, then three rings would be their limit.</p>
 <p>Yellow spirit souls could produce two soul skills at most, which was basically two soul rings. This was also the reason hundred year spirit souls were worth so much more. As for the higher level purple coloured thousand year spirit souls and black coloured ten-thousand year spirit souls, Tang Wulin didn’t even dare to imagine obtaining one of them.</p>
 <p>Teacher Wu Zhangkong actually had six rings. He was actually such a powerful person! Eastsea City only had a few six ring Soul Emperors, but more than that, he was actually so young!</p>
 <p>“Alright then. I’m going to head off first. Don’t forget to take a few pictures for me!” The item she had slipped into Tang Wulin’s hands was actually a soul camera!</p>
 <p>“Senior sister!” Tang Wulin called out, but Liu Yuxin had already run away. She was really fast and was actually chasing after Teacher Wu Zhangkong.</p>
 <p>“You should give that camera to someone else for safekeeping first. You don’t want to break it after all,” Xie Xie coldly said.</p>
 <p>“It’s fine. Let’s go,” Tang Wulin said as he shot a glance towards Xie Xie.</p>
 <p>The benefits he obtained from meditation this previous day wasn’t small. Unexpectedly, the area he improved the most wasn’t forging, but combat. That was the first time he had used his martial soul in a battle. In addition to the pressure Xie Xie exerted on him, he felt that the understanding he had for his martial soul had increased. This was the reason why he hadn’t rejected today’s battle.</p>
 <p>His master had said that his Bluesilver Grass was a variant martial soul, so it wasn’t purely trash anymore.</p>
 <p>After exiting the school, Tang Wulin asked Xie Xie, “Where are we going?”</p>
 <p>Xie Xie answered, “We’re going to Eastsea Park. There aren’t many people there, so you can be at ease; I’ll find someone to treat your injuries.”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin simply said, “The facts will prove themselves.”</p>
