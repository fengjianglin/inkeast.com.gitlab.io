 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter 53 – Hammering Through the Stone Prison</strong></span></p>
 <p>As he watched Han Lan, Tang Wulin’s expression grew serene. Having observed Han Lan’s previous two battles, he had already come up with a plan for her.</p>
 <p>A white ring twinkled beneath Han Lan’s feet before a spirit soul that looked like a lump of dirt appeared. She didn’t hesitate at all as she held up both her palms in Tang Wulin’s direction.</p>
 <p>In response, a yellow ring of earth appeared under Tang Wulin’s feet. Stone pillars arose from the yellow ring in a flash, entrapping Tang Wulin inside a stone prison.</p>
 <p>If it had been Xie Xie in this situation, he would have likely rushed out of the stone prison’s range as soon as Han Lan had raised her hands. However, Tang Wulin clearly didn’t possess such speed, so he hadn’t bothered moving at all.</p>
 <p>At the peak, the stone pillars curved inwards, completely sealing off all avenues of escape.</p>
 <p>Han Lan had won her previous two matches by controlling the earth in order to contain her opponents. Although her first soul skill was only a ten year one, it was unusually powerful as it was able to directly restrain her opponents. However, it was still a ten year soul skill and its restrictions were not small. For example, after using this soul skill, there was a cooldown period of 20 seconds before she could use it again.</p>
 <p>If this were a true battlefield, she would’ve likely only had one chance to use this skill.</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong began counting down the seconds that Tang Wulin was trapped. If he reached ten seconds, then it would count as Tang Wulin’s loss.</p>
 <p>Han Lan had won her first match with the same method. In the second match, however, she’d won even sooner. Her opponent had tried to rush out of the stone prison’s range as soon as the match started, but the creation of the stone prison was simply too fast. Just as he had approached the outer range of the stone prison, he’d been directly sent soaring by the top of a stone pillar. If Wu Zhangkong hadn’t caught him, he might’ve been crippled by the fall.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin didn’t want to challenge the prison at the risk of being thrown to such a height, so he decided to remain stationary and let it entrap him.</p>
 <p>“Ten…” Wu Zhangkong began to expressionlessly count down the seconds. After the first match had ended, Wu Zhangkong had said that being trapped by a Control System Battle Soul Master for more than ten seconds was no different than death. Thus, he gave them a ten second time limit. If he was able to break out of Han Lan’s trap within ten seconds, then it would count as Han Lan’s loss. If he wasn’t able to break out, then Han Lan would win. It was just this simple and rough.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin wasn’t the least bit anxious as he unhurriedly raised his arms. Two gray lights flashed, then a pair of forging hammers appeared in his hands.</p>
 <p>“Nine…”</p>
 <p><i>Bang!</i></p>
 <p>He swung the Thousand Refined Tungsten Hammers in his hands and brazenly smashed the two stone pillars in front of him. Dust flew out as the stone pillars were smashed to pieces!</p>
 <p>The count of “eight” didn’t even leave Wu Zhangkong’s lips as Tang Wulin lifted his hammers out from the rubble.</p>
 <p>“This…” The whole class simply stared at him and they couldn’t help but suck in a breath of air. Even Xie Xie, whom had battled with Tang Wulin before, didn’t expect Tang Wulin to use such a method to break out of the stone prison.</p>
 <p>The eyes of Wu Zhangkong shone as he revealed an unusual expression. He nodded. “Tang Wulin is the victor.” With his eyesight, he had been able to clearly examine the two hammers in Tang Wulin’s hands. The hammers hadn’t been reinforced by any soul power at all, thus indicating that they weren’t soul tools. Even if they had been soul tools, what level of efficacy could Tang Wulin even reach with his current soul power? ‘<i>This brat’s strength is truly prodigal!’</i></p>
 <p>Xie Xie’s eyes widened in shock. ‘<i>This guy was actually holding back when he fought me?’</i></p>
 <p>In reality, Tang Wulin hadn’t held back at all. He simply hadn’t thought of using his forging hammers to do battle before. He had only taken out his Thousand Refined Tungsten Hammers today due to his need for destructive power. He hadn’t thought that a single attack of his would have such remarkable results.</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong turned towards Xie Xie. “Xie Xie, it’s your turn.”</p>
 <p>Xie Xie leapt onto the stage. He was feeling a bit gloomy at the moment as he recalled the amount of food that Tang Wulin had eaten this morning. If he’d known earlier that he would face him in class today, then he wouldn’t have bothered to treat Tang Wulin to a meal!</p>
 <p>Hammers in hand, Tang Wulin changed his stance to face Xie Xie. He wasn’t confident in his victory at all. Although he had won the last time, it was simply due to a miracle. But now, with these hammers in hand, he suddenly felt wonderful. It seemed that these Thousand Refined Tungsten Hammers had already integrated with his body. When he held them, his confidence surged.</p>
 <p>Right as Xie Xie was mulling over his thoughts of how to deal with Tang Wulin, a cold voice suddenly cut in from the side.</p>
 <p>“The fourth round, second match. Xie Xie versus Wu Zhangkong.”</p>
 <p>“What?” Xie Xie nearly lost his voice as he cried out in alarm. He turned to look at the Icily Arrogant Prince Charming.</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong coldly glanced at him. “Did you really think that an unfair situation would occur in my class? You will receive one of my attacks. Then you will face Tang Wulin.”</p>
 <p>Xie Xie stared at him, dumbstruck. “Teacher Wu, are you playing a joke on me? You’re a teacher.”</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong had already strolled over to Tang Wulin’s side. With a simple wave of his hand, Tang Wulin was carried over to the sidelines, hammers still in hand. Wu Zhangkong patted his waist with his right hand, undoing his belt.</p>
 <p>“Teacher, what are you doing?” Xie Xie vigilantly retreated two steps back. However, he soon discovered that Wu Zhangkong’s pants were very form fitting. Even after untying his belt, his pants hadn’t budged at all.</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong shook his wrist, causing the belt to become completely taut and perfectly straight. With an indifferent voice, he said, “I won’t release my martial soul. You only need to receive one of my attacks.” As he spoke, Wu Zhangkong took a step forward with his left foot as his belt-sword had already thrust towards Xie Xie.</p>
 <p>Xie Xie’s combat experience could be considered the richest amongst his classmates. The moment he released his martial soul, he retreated like lightning.</p>
 <p>What a joke. Was Wu Zhangkong powerless only because he didn’t release his martial soul? With the support of just his soul power, there was no difference between his belt and a sharp sword. Running away was Xie Xie’s best option at that moment.</p>
 <p>Xie Xie was extremely confident in his speed. As he retreated, he held his Light Dragon Dagger in front of himself protectively.</p>
 <p>However, a horrifying scene happened before his eyes. Although he was rapidly retreating, Wu Zhangkong’s belt-sword stayed in front of him from beginning to end. This attack seemed to be a simple thrust, but no matter what Xie Xie did, he was unable to dodge it.</p>
 <p><i>Bang!</i></p>
 <p>“Aiyou!”</p>
 <p>The belt softened just a moment before it pierced into Xie Xie’s shoulder. However, it simply smacked Xie Xie’s shoulder and sent him flying. After rolling over the floor twice, Xie Xie was finally able to get up. He clutched his shoulder and grimaced in pain.</p>
 <p>Xie Xie’s forehead dripped with sweat. The most terrifying thing was that in the moment before Wu Zhangkong struck him, Xie Xie actually felt as if his life were about to end. This kind of powerful and oppressive strength would cause anyone’s spirit to tense up. After he was sent flying, Xie Xie was able to loosen up a bit, but he was still left with this appearance.</p>
 <p><i>‘Too scary. In the end, how deep is Teacher Wu’s strength?’</i></p>
 <p>“You have one minute to rest. After that, the finals will begin.” Wu Zhangkong shook his wrist once again, wrapping the belt around his waist before walking off to the side.</p>
