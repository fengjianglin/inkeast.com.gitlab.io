 <p><span style>“What do you mean?” Xie Xie eyed her with suspicion. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue said, “I guess you can be considered a male.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>His voice held a flurry of annoyance. “Are you saying you treated me like I was a girl before?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue giggled, a glint to her eyes. “You can take it however you want.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Xu Xiaoyan approached Xie Xie and latched on to his arm. “So we’re actually a group of sisters! I wouldn’t have known if big sis Gu Yue didn’t tell me.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>He rolled his eyes in exasperation, lips pinched as he wrested his arm free. “You girls are always bullying me! I bet you don’t have what it takes to mess with Wulin. Oh, whatever. I’m hungry now. You two guard him while I get some breakfast. Do you want me to bring anything back?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue nodded. “I want meat, steamed buns, juice, and yogurt. Oh right, some vegetables too.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Xiaoyan counted on her fingers as she said, “I want some bread, jam, yogurt, and a fried egg. Actually, make that two. Yeah, I’m still growing after all.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie said, “Yeah, growing as round as a fried egg!” He knew enough to run off after his snarky comment, escaping before Xu Xiaoyan had the chance to erupt. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long after his getaway, there was a knock on the door. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s back so quickly?” Xu Xiaoyan mumbled as she walked to the door. However, when she opened the door, the person outside was the white-haired lady from yesterday rather than her teammate. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, it’s you. Auntie, where’s Teacher Wu?” Xu Xiaoyan asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Yi entered the room. “Your teacher is fine. He’s just taking care of some matters for you all at the academy right now. Has your captain awakened yet?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Xiaoyan shook her head. “Not yet.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>A sigh escaped Shen Yi’s lips. “Then all we can do is wait. When he’s conscious, I’ll bring you all over.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Confused, Xu Xiaoyan asked, “You’re bringing us over? But it’s already too late!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Yi wore a faint smile as she tousled Xu Xiaoyan’s hair, the same way Wu Zhangkong had done with hers the day before. “Don’t worry about it. Your teacher has already settled things. Your tests might be a bit harder, but you still have one last chance. We’ll depart once your captain is awake.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really? That’s awesome! Teacher Wu is the best!” Xu Xiaoyan bounced with joy. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although they had sacrificed the test for Tang Wulin, having both was still the best! Missing this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity would have been a tragedy! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue stared at Shen Yi in surprise. She hadn’t expected a second chance and it was as if a heavy mountain had been lifted off of her. </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">☀</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>In the washroom. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin remained soaking in the bathtub. The water had lost some of its heat, but was still lukewarm. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Golden mist gathered in the air, shrouding his body in a radiant haze. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have I succeeded?” Inside of his spiritual world, Tang Wulin found himself in the mystical hall once more. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to the first seal, the second one was much easier to break. After the initial sensation of being boiled alive, he grew accustomed to the pain, feeling his blood rampage through his body as the latter transformed. From then on, the process was painless. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Later, a mysterious sensation filled him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like the first time, his senses had dulled to the point where comprehending the situation was fruitless. The only thing he could make out was the shattering of something within his body, the jaws of danger closing in on him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>During the breaking of the first seal, he had endured unspeakable pain, as if his entire body was on the brink of explosion, so much so that death would have been a sweet release. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, however, things were different. While he had felt something fill his body, he did not feel like bursting at the seams. Any semblance of pain had been a hollow image of itself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right, you’ve succeeded.” Old Tang said, chock-full of satisfaction. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Tang appeared near him in a flash of light, his body clearer and more human-like than before. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Tang smiled. “How do you feel?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin said, “Good. It wasn’t as painful as the first time.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Tang said, “That’s because you’re more prepared this time. Both your body and soul power have made remarkable progress in the last three years, especially since your soul power is compressed by your new cultivation method. It has refined your meridians and increased the load that they can bear. You also found high-quality spirit items this time. All of these factors eased the process.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin rejoiced, “That’s great! I didn’t waste my time then. Old Tang, what changed with my body this time? I remember back then you said there would be a nice surprise for me!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right, there’s a surprise,” Old Tang said. “But you need to go experience it for yourself. I suggest you don’t worry about it for now and instead focus on breaking the third seal in the near future.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin laughed. “Isn’t the deadline when I’m twenty? I still have six years until then. That’s plenty of time to prepare.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Tang seemed to arch a brow. “Who said the deadline is twenty years old for the third seal?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin stared back deadpan. “But isn’t it? The deadline should be five years apart, and I’ve broken the second seal one year early! Five plus fifteen is twenty years old!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Tang shook his head. “No, that’s not how it’s calculated. Your next seal needs to be broken by the time you turn sixteen. In other words, you have three years left. Fifteen years old was the absolute latest for the second seal, and the earlier your break a seal, the easier the later seals are. The countdown for the next seal to be broken starts immediately after you’ve breaking the previous one. So, you have three years to prepare.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin stood dumbfounded. “Are you telling me the time between seals is going to continue shrinking?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Tang said, “That’s right. It shortens each time. You’ll be under a lot of pressure from now on.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>This shocking revelation wiped the smile right off of Tang Wulin’s face. </span><i><span style>If the time shortens after each seal and there are eighteen seals… then just how much time will I have for the later ones? And if I fail to destroy a seal, I’ll probably die! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What is the minimum amount of time I will have to break a seal in the future?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Tang said, “Your preparation time will shorten by three months each time. After the ninth seal, you will only have one year to prepare for each.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin let out a long sigh. </span><i><span style>One year per seal after the ninth seal? Can… can I manage that? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He may have broken two seals already, but only now did he realize how menacing they were. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll tell you what you need for your next seal. But before that, let me remind you that the more your body and soul power progress in the next three years, the easier the unsealing. You will face a tribulation if you’re not prepared, and you might even…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin nodded in silence. He understood what Old Tang implied. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Several spirit items popped into his mind. He first checked their prefixes, and was relieved to discover that they were thousand-year spirit items. If they were ten-thousand-year items, he would have just given up right then and there. </span></p>
