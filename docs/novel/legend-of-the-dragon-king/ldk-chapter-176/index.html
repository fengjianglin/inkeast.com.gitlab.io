 <p><span style><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;176 - Three-Eyed Demon Ape</strong></span></span></p>
 <p><i><span style>When Teacher Wu battled the Soul Emperor Guang Biao, he didn’t use a single soul skill! He completely destroyed Guang Biao with only his comprehension of his martial soul! So in the end, it wasn’t a disparity of soul power, but one of insight! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was as though a door unlocked within his heart, revealing a new path to him. While Soul Masters were divided into systems such as Assault, Agility, Control and so on, in reality, these classifications were not mutually exclusive but instead interconnected. This meant that the crux of the matter was in how a Soul Master utilized their martial soul and abilities. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Why was Gu Yue so powerful? Her miraculous six-element martial soul alone couldn’t make her strong; rather, it was her nimble control over the six elements. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher Wu, spiritual power isn’t as simple as a container for spirit souls, right?” Tang Wulin suddenly asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong looked back at him with pleased eyes and nodded. “The fact that you’ve understood this proves that you have felt it for yourself.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Thrilled to have his hypothesis confirmed, Tang Wulin vigorously nodded. </span><i><span style>I need to improve on a lot more than just my soul power! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps it was due to the sparsity of soul beasts, but the intermediate spirit ascension platform was lush with foliage, undisturbed by wandering creatures. As the two penetrated deeper into the forest, the dense trees towered into the heavens and blotted out the sun, creating a world of evergreen gloom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their advance slowed a bit when four soul beasts appeared before them, but it gave Wu Zhangkong another opportunity to gift spirit power to Tang Wulin. While one was at the thousand-year level, the others were at the hundred-year level, yielding very little spirit energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Follow closely. Now that we’ve entered the middle region, we could run into a ten-thousand-year soul beast at any time. At this level, soul beasts have undergone a qualitative change. Their intelligence far surpasses that of beasts at the thousand-year level, with some even on par with humans.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Intelligence? It wasn’t something humans particularly cared for having grown to take it for granted over the ages. Soul beasts, however, depended on it to display their full might, especially when faced with humans. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A truly terrifying soul beast possessed high intelligence. If Tang Wulin and his friends had encountered a shrewder hundred-year Duskgold Dreadclaw Bear in the spirit ascension platform, he would have had no chance of survival—Xie Xie would have died the moment he attempted a sneak attack. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A ten-thousand-year Duskgold Dreadclaw Bear could single-handedly destroy a town armed with both foresight and strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin calmly released his Bluesilver Grass in preparation for any sudden attacks. He understood his vulnerability in this forest that forced him to rely on Wu Zhangkong’s strength. Since he’d be useless in battle, all he could do was act prudently and prepare to defend himself against any soul beasts they encountered. </span><i><span style>I still have a long ways to go… </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop!” Wu Zhangkong halted in his tracks forcing Tang Wulin to do the same, nearly bumping into his teacher’s back. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Something’s off.” Wu Zhangkong’s expression became solemn. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on, Teacher Wu?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong answered, “It’s too quiet. Even if soul beasts are sparse in the intermediate level, there should still be some insects around. Don’t you feel that it’s getting dimmer and dimmer? And it’s not just because of the trees blocking the light either. No, this is something else. We may have encountered a powerful soul beast, and if my guess is correct, we’re in for a lot of trouble.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong’s vigilance alarmed Tang Wulin, but even so, he could only continue relying on him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin disliked this feeling of powerlessness as if he had no control over his own fate. Unfortunately, he knew it all too well. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong stood in place, poised with his Skyfrost Sword. Waves of frost rolled off of it as he surveyed their surroundings with icy yet calm eyes that occasionally glowed with a purple sheen. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin felt it now; it was eerily quiet, devoid of even the sound of the wind through the trees. </span><i><span style>This definitely isn’t normal. I wasn’t paying enough attention. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Around them, shadowy figures suddenly appeared and glided towards the duo, faintly discernable among the trees. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What are they? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong remained still, aware of the encroaching figures. Though the Skyfrost Sword swayed in his hands, pointing from one direction to another, the movements were calm and unhurried. The last of the light snuffed out, and an absolute darkness descended on the forest. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Even as the shadowy figures grew near, Tang Wulin couldn’t sense anything. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, fast as lightning, a black figure suddenly shot toward them. With the Purple Demon Eyes activated, Tang Wulin could just barely discern its true appearance. Shockingly, that black figure was himself! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Without a doubt, it was an exact copy of Tang Wulin! The only difference was that it was shrouded in darkness and exuded a chilling, bloodthirsty aura. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong slashed out, releasing a Frost Scar from its tip that sliced toward and through the shadow Tang Wulin. Completely unaffected, the shadow suddenly sped up and pounced on Tang Wulin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph!” Wu Zhangkong let out a cold derisive snort. Purple light flashed in his eyes, and the shadowy figure shrieked as it dispersed in a puff of smoke. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong swung his head around, glaring at a mirror figure of himself that was dashing toward him. The shadow Wu Zhangkong shrieked and turned into smoke. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is possible? The Purple Demon Eyes can do this? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin contemplated the wonders of the Purple Demon Eyes as the purple shimmer faded from Wu Zhangkong’s eyes. </span><i><span style>Teacher Wu is so awesome! What can’t he do? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong’s face still carried a grave expression. “A darkness and spiritual dual-attributed soul beast. How powerful.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The remaining shadows no longer dared to approach, intimidated by the frightening power of the Purple Demon Eyes. They quietly turned around and retreated, but in their place, a black fog appeared. The moment he laid eyes on the billowing smog, fear gripped Tang Wulin’s heart. </span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Wu Zhangkong’s second soul ring lit up, and a chilling mist spread out to envelop the two of them, eventually clashing against the black fog.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the two met, the black fog condensed to become drops of black liquid that released a bizarre smell into the air. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a collision between elements of ice and darkness. </span><i><span style>Could this darkness-attribute soul beast possess the rumored domain ability? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He heard that within the domain, the ability user had absolute control. Despite some exaggerated elements, it was certainly true that their strength would be greatly amplified in the domain. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The trouble now wasn’t resisting the opponent’s ability but locating their opponent! If they couldn’t find their enemy, then they couldn’t defeat it! </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Domain? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin had a revelation. He immediately crouched down and touched the Bluesilver Grass on the ground, closing his eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As he grew to understand his martial soul, he became more intimate with all plant life, especially wild Bluesilver Grass. Sometimes, he could even sense their emotions. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Through the network of Bluesilver Grass, he attempted to extend his sensory range. Considering the forest’s lush environment, it would have been an amazing place for him to cultivate had it not been the spirit ascension platform. </span></p>
 <p><span style>During the previous battle, Wu Zhangkong had reminded him of the importance of spiritual power and creative uses of abilities, and now he was putting that advice to use. He silently concentrated on the gentle spiritual fluctuations of the surrounding Bluesilver Grass. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s true! </span></i><span style>The corner of Tang Wulin’s mouth lifted; he knew how to find their opponent now. Its ability to strike fear into the hearts of both him and the Bluesilver Grass ultimately allowed him to locate their foe. </span></p>
