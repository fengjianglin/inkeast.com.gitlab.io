 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;327 - Consequences</strong></span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The red-haired girl was nowhere to be seen. A five-meter tall titan now stood in her place. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl had taken on a new, clearly stronger form, yet blood trickled from the five long gashes that ran from her right shoulder and down her arm. It was impossible to come out of a clash with Tang Wulin’s Golden Dragon Dreadclaw unharmed. It was a skill derived from the Duskgold Dreadclaw Bear after all! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin did not come out unscathed either. The shockwave of their clash sent him flying backward. Fortunately, Gu Yue conjured a wall of air to cushion his impact. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But when the dust settled and the form of the titan grew clear, everyone’s jaws dropped. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The titan’s majestic body exuded pure strength, seeming to constrict the atmosphere itself. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I-isn’t this the Titan Giant Ape? This is Yuanen’s Titan Giant Ape! What’s going on? Why did it appear here? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The titan glared at Xie Xie with eyes full of crimson fury. It was as if they were on the verge of exploding. Next to Tang Wulin, Gu Yue frowned, wind and rain swirling around her, birthing a storm. Off to the side, Yue Zhengyu flapped his wings with an aura of majesty and ascended to the air where he eyed her warily.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She took my Light of Judgement and Tang Wulin’s claw attack head-on, but there isn’t a single scratch on her! She’s no simple evil soul master! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As doubt crept into his heart, Tang Wulin’s rage dissipated. “A-are you Yuanen?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, a wave of pressure swept through the surrounding space, suppressing all everyone present. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The first to suffer was Yue Zhengyu, who was knocked from the air. He slammed face first into the ground, a human-shaped crater beneath him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Next to fall were Xie Xie and Xu Xiaoyan. With Xie Xie’s injuries and Xu Xiaoyan’s weak body, neither could put up much of a fight. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, Tang Wulin had pulled Gu Yue into his arms the moment of the pressure wave’s inception. His golden soul ring flashed into existence and he activated Golden Dragon Body. Blood essence, thick and powerful, flooded out of him in an effort to quell the mysterious pressure. Even so, he lasted no more than a second before also falling to his knees. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to the others, Yuanen resisted the longest. She let out a rebellious roar before dropping down to all fours. That said, she towered above the rest, an unyielding flame burning within her eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style> But that was all the resistance she could muster. In the eyes of this force, they were nothing but ants. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two figures in their thirties descended from the sky. One wielded seven glittering soul rings and the other six. Perhaps most shocking of all was their shining armor. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Battle armor! That has to be battle armor! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The difference in strength between them and a six or seven-ringed soul master, while large, would not have suppressed the youths so thoroughly. Such dominance was possible due to the amplification effect of battle armor! </span></p>
 <p><span style>With battle armor equipped, the user’s strength would increase by two soul ring levels. From the armors’ complex designs, they had to be at the two-word level! Now this was true battle armor! </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on here? Why are you working students fighting?” The seven-ringed battle armor master’s chilling voice was like a bucket of cold water over their heads. Catching sight of the injured Xie Xie, he raised a finger, shooting a beam of light into his body. A moment later, Xie Xie’s chest stopped bleeding. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Zhengyu struggled to get up from the ground, his face still dusty and red from impact. “R-reporting!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>With a wave of his hand, the seven-ringed battle armor master dispelled the pressure weighing down the students. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Zhengyu pointed at Yuanen without so much as missing a beat. “It’s her! She’s an evil soul master! Her second martial soul is a Fallen Angel. She infiltrated our working student dormitory and attacked Xie Xie at night. She even said she was going to kill him! When we discovered Xie Xie in his tattered state, we rushed to subdue her and ended up engaging in battle. Esteemed enforcer, please arrest her. I’m sure you’ll find truth in my words after some investigation!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The seven-ringed enforcer cast a doubtful look at Yuanen. “Are you the second grade’s Yuanen?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuanen’s body rapidly shrunk until she was once more a delicate looking red-haired girl. Since her transformation wrecked her uniform, bursting it to pieces, all she had on now was a skintight black suit. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She threw on a jacket before returning the enforcer’s icy gaze. “I am.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on?” The enforcer looked at her doubtfully. “You’re the president of the second grade’s class. Why would you attack another student?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just ask him!” Yuanen’s face flushed crimson as she jabbed a finger toward Xie Xie. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie’s face contorted with pain as he struggled to get up. While the bleeding might have stopped, the dark energies of Yuanen’s sword had still invaded and corroded his meridians. If not for his Light Dragon Daggers light attribute, his condition would have been far worse. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I-I…” He stared at Yuanen, tongue limp and as heavy as lead. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s hear their explanation after we return,” said the six-ringed enforcer to the seven-ringed one. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.” </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>☀</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Half an hour later, everyone involved in the incident assembled in the teacher’s office of the outer court school building.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Along with them were Shen Yi, Wu Zhangkong, and the teacher in charge of the second grade, all whom had been summoned directly. However, none sat down. The only person seated was the headmaster of the outer court and an elder of Sea God’s Pavilion, Elder Cai. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin, Gu Yue, and Xu Xiaoyan stood with strange looks painted on their faces. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Because a teacher had treated Xie Xie’s wounds, he was able to stand alongside his classmates. Perhaps feeling regretful, he hung his head low. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuanen, sporting a fresh change of the school uniform, stood on the other side of the room and glared daggers at him the entire time. She looked like the incarnation of a demon bent on destroying him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Zhengyu wore the oddest expression of all. He was next to Tang Wulin, his face twitching as he fought to restrain himself. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Cai, the situation has been explained to us already. The battle this time was all due to a misunderstanding.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Misunderstanding? A misunderstanding that all of the working students participated in? One where someone got injured? Tell me then, what was this misunderstanding?” Elder Cai’s words dripped with danger. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“From our investigations, we have concluded that the working student in the first grade, Xie Xie, went out for an evening stroll. Because he wasn’t aware Yuanen changed rooms, he mistakenly believed that a thief had broken into their dormitory and went to investigate. However, Yuanen Yehui happened to be taking a bath at that time…” The enforcer’s mask of seriousness cracked, revealing an awkward expression. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s eyes darted to Yuanen. </span><i><span style>So her full name is actually Yuanen Yehui. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Afterward, Yuanen Yehui discovered that Xie Xie had peeped on her maiden body. In her fury, she attacked Xie Xie. Yue Zhengyu knew of Yuanen Yehui’s Fallen Angel soul, so he misunderstood the situation. Later, Tang Wulin, Xu Xiaoyan, and Gu Yue also arrived on the scene and misunderstood as well. This is what led to their battle.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Cai was speechless after listening to the enforcer’s explanation. After a few seconds of gathering herself, she spoke, the temperature in the room dropping with each successive word. “So you’re telling me this was all because that brat Xie Xie peeped on a girl?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The whole night had been one surprise after the next. And now that Elder Cai summarized the entire incident in this way, the situation was even more unexpected. Clearly, she stood on Yuanen’s side. Poor Xie Xie would be penalized heavily. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin took a step forward, grabbing the room’s attention. “Elder Cai, it’s not quite like that. The only reason Xie Xie was outside of Yuanen’s room was because he thought someone had broken into our dormitory. He didn’t know Yuanen lived there at all. It really was just a misunderstanding.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Normally, Elder Cai would not normally appear to oversee such trivial matters. But in this specific case, she was also the teacher in charge of the first grade. Therefore, it was her responsibility to figure out what happened. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Cai directed a calm gaze at Tang Wulin. “So you’re saying Yuanen Yehui should let others see her body for free?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s…” Tang Wulin was at a loss. There was no one in the right or wrong in this situation! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Cai snorted. “The matter is clear already. All six of you working students are such a handful. You’ve only been here how long? Yet you’ve already caused such a ruckus. If I don’t punish you, then the heavens wouldn’t be fair. Xie Xie, as the main instigator, you will be fined five thousand contribution points. I don’t care if this was a misunderstanding on your part and I don’t care if you had good intentions. Three months is all you’re getting. If you don’t pay the fine before then, you’ll be expelled. In addition, you’ll pay Yuanen Yehui ten thousand contribution points as mental trauma compensation. You have one year to pay her.” </span></p>
