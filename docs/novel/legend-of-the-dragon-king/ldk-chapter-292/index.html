 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;292 - The Holy Angel and the Fallen Angel</strong></span></p>
 <p><span style>The golden radiance of this young man that had been harassing the waitress stunned Tang Wulin. His entire being emitted an aura of holiness. A pair of pure white wings unfolded from the man’s back, and his holy aura skyrocketed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This… </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Three soul rings rose from beneath the golden-haired young man. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The truly shocking thing, however, was that all three were purple! </span></p>
 <p><span style>The red-haired girl not far from the man turned around, her expression glacial and grave. She eyed him coldly then spread her arms. Darkness began swirling around her, twisting and shifting as a pair of jet-black wings extended from her back, a dark aura now surrounding her. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s...</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Those white wings… </span></i><span style>Tang Wulin thought to himself.</span><i><span style> They should belong to the legendary martial soul, the Holy Angel! But then... what are those black wings? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like I was right.” The man in white smiled. He flapped his wings, golden light radiating from his body. “Just as I thought. How interesting. So very… interesting…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl stared at him with an icy expression. She flapped her wings, lifting herself from the ground as two purple soul rings appeared beneath her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Two rings versus three rings,” the man in white said. “You don’t stand a chance. Just surrender and let me take you to be judged.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl pursed her lips. Her eyes flashed and darkness enveloped her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Trying to run?” The golden-haired man snorted, his first soul ring shining as golden light erupted from his body. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The man’s holy radiance dispelled the encroaching darkness and spread toward the girl. He thrust a hand forward as his second soul ring lit up, commanding the holy light to surge toward the girl enveloped in a violet-black aura. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With a flap of his wings, he flew at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I already told you,” he said. “You have two rings and I have three. You don’t stand a chance against me, so stop resisting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the man rushing at her, a sneer surfaced on the girl’s face. She furled her wings again and withdrew her martial soul. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is Shrek, you dumbass.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>A sharp wave of force split the clouds and obliterated the light and the darkness. The force pressed down on the golden-haired man, suppressing him and forcing him to the ground. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A tall man appeared in the sky. His figure was indistinct, but his imposing voice reverberated throughout the street. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who dares break the laws of Shrek City?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The golden-haired man answered first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Honorable enforcer, I am the Angel Clan’s Yue Zhengyu, a student from the second grade’s class one. I discovered a Fallen Angel on campus, and as everyone knows, Fallen Angels always become evil soul masters. In light of that, I chose to take action and capture her to take her to my clan for judgement.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>His words had no effect on the girl. She simply took a card out of her pocket and presented it to the enforcer. “Respected enforcer, I am a working student here at Shrek Academy. The Academy has already verified my identity and determined that I am not an evil soul master.” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She’s a working student? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This revelation stunned Tang Wulin and the others. They never expected that this Fallen Angel girl with two rings would be a working student like them. Unlike Yue Zhengyu, however, she didn’t bother to reveal her name. </span></p>
 <p><span style>An attractive force pulled the card from her hand and to the enforcer. After inspecting the card, he turned to Yue Zhengyu. “I have confirmed her identity as a working student. It’s impossible for her to be an evil soul master. I won’t punish you since you thought you were apprehending an evil soul master, but next time you’ll be punished two-fold. Now break it up.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The enforcer sent the card back to the girl then disappeared in a blur. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin and the others trembled in awe.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Now this is Shrek City! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In Shrek City, they couldn’t do whatever they wanted or harass others. Doing so would they provoke the wrath of the enforcers. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl put her card away then turned to Yue Zhengyu. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She punched a fist out, stuck her thumb up, and slowly turned it to point down at the ground. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You...!” Yue Zhengyu’s eyes went red with fury. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl snorted and left, her figure quickly disappearing into the dark of night. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Zhengyu moved to pursue her, but his butler grabbed his arm. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You mustn’t offend the dignity of Shrek, young master,” the butler said, shaking his head. “Since Shrek Academy has confirmed her identity, there is no point in pursuing this matter any further.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Zhengyu snorted in response. “So they’re saying a Fallen Angel isn’t an evil soul master? It seems like Shrek is…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young master!” the butler exclaimed, hastily silencing him with a ripple of power. “Watch what you say!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Zhengyu stormed off in a huff. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Though this farce finally came to an end, Tang Wulin and the others wanted to see it play out a little longer. They were beginning to understand how abnormal Shrek Academy was. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Not a single one of them felt tired when they returned to the shabby dormitory for working students. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Captain, don’t you think there’s some strange secret about working students?” Xie Xie whispered to Tang Wulin. “Everyone in the dining hall became respectful the moment they heard you were a working student. They even seemed to fear you a bit. The guy who defeated me during the exam, and even that red-haired girl from earlier… both were working students. Maybe we should investigate this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin shook his head. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re new here,” he answered. “Our number one priority at the moment is to get used to Shrek Academy and understand its customs. We’re still insignificant here, so it’d be best for us to not look for trouble. We can investigate once we’ve settled in, but we currently don’t have the energy to spare for it. Put your curiosity aside for now.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay,” Xie Xie replied glumly then turned around to look at Xu Xiaoyan. They had yet to rest because the curtain for separating the room still hadn’t been set up. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“How come you're such a gossiper?” Xu Xiaoyan rolled her eyes at him. “And you call yourself a man…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue stood up and hung the curtain, splitting the room into two halves, and the four of them began to meditate. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he had stopped Xie Xie from sticking his nose into the matter, Tang Wulin felt restless. He had heard of the Angel and Fallen Angel martial souls in legends before. For the red-haired girl to face off against the golden-haired man on even ground, her martial soul must’ve been just as powerful as his. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Then there was the matter of evil soul masters. He didn’t know what they were, but judging by their name, they clearly weren’t good news. The young man wouldn’t have persecuted the girl if they were. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The soul master world is even more amazing than I thought! I wonder if Teacher Wu will continue to instruct us when we start classes tomorrow? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The night passed in silence. When morning came, Tang Wulin and Xu Xiaoyan woke up early to cultivate their Purple Demon Eyes together. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After washing up, they faced their first problem of the day—breakfast. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As working students, their first order of business in the morning was to go to the administration building to receive their jobs for the day. Fortunately for Tang Wulin, he still had black steamed buns and was able to eat enough to tide him over until lunch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they arrived at the administration building, they ran into a student number two. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Being a working student himself, it was natural for him to come here in the morning as well. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They then went to the administrator who said, “You four, continue cleaning Spirit Ice Plaza today. You did well yesterday. Continue working hard today.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus Tang Wulin and the others had their jobs for the day. </span></p>
