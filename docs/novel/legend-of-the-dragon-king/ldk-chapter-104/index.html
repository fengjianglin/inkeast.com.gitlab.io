 <p><span style><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;104 - Gu Yue Erupts</strong></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you okay, Wulin?” Gu Yue gently pressed a hand onto Tang Wulin’s back, causing light attribute soul power to enter him. A wave of warmth suffused through his body, lessening the discomfort. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m fine.” Tang Wulin sucked in a deep breath. Although there was still some chilliness and pain within his body, it was nothing compared to what he had experienced these past few days. If that previous pain had made him want to die, then the current pain was just like having an upset stomach. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When Zhang Yangzi saw the condition Tang Wulin was in, he was startled. Despite being hit by his Shadow Clone and being weakest of his group members, Tang Wulin was still able to stand tall. Just what kind of situation was this? </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can go die!” Gu Yue suddenly shouted. Before Tang Wulin even had a chance to grab her, she’d already rushed forward. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue suddenly accelerated, a green light flickering around her body. As she sped towards them, she motioned with both her hands, shooting a fireball and an icicle towards her three opponents. </span></p>
 <p><span style>While her attack shot towards the opposing trio, the green light covering her body shone brighter and brighter, her eyes growing clearer. After the fireball exploded, her hands had already taken on an icy-blue color. Then, when the icicle shattered, that icy-blue light began to blend with the green light. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A chaotic gale screamed through the air, and the spectating students and teachers were reminded of the turbulent hurricane that had swept past just recently. In a short period of time, the wind and ice had already grown into a tornado five meters in height and one meter in diameter and quickly advanced towards Zhang Yangzi and his teammates. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The temperature onstage plummeted as the ice shards within the swirling gale became sharp blades that cut through the air, releasing waves of ear-piercing screeches. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The opposing trio’s expressions soured. Wang Jinxi was the first to take the initiative and act as the vanguard, while the other two used their soul power to protect their bodies. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Evade? The entire stage seemed to be under the control of this miniature tornado as it drew them into its center. Their speed had also been cut in half, making it basically impossible for them to escape its range. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Hengxu looked upon the stage with a dumbstruck expression once again. </span><i><span style>This, this is the soul skill of a one ring Soul Master? Can a Soul Elder with a thousand year soul ring even achieve this? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Blizzard! This was a combination of ice and wind. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Among the trio from class five, the strongest one wasn’t Xie Xie, who possessed both twin martial souls as well as the greatest soul power among them; rather, it was Gu Yue. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue had never used her true strength until this match. Today, however, Tang Wulin had been injured by their opponents, incurring her wrath. Thus, she’d cast her strongest elemental attack. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After creating her blizzard, however, her face became deathly pale, her body tottering on the verge of collapse. Fortunately, Tang Wulin gently held and supported her, preventing her fall. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Constant collisions were heard from within the blizzard as it tore through the trio from class one. A twinkling light could vaguely be seen within the blizzard, indicating that they still had enough soul power to defend themselves. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie grasped his Light Dragon Dagger tightly as a light gleamed within his eyes. He had faced the blizzard’s might long ago and clearly understood just how formidable Gu Yue was. As an Agility System Soul Master, he was afraid that even after obtaining a second ring and with the advantage of his twin martial souls, he wouldn’t be able to withstand the power of Gu Yue’s blizzard. If he were forced to face it, then he would have to prepare in advance and run far away. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he frequently quarreled with Gu Yue, he still respected her for her strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blizzard persisted for a full ten seconds before it began to disperse. In the end, the temperature of the stage and its surroundings had dropped drastically. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The figures of Zhang Yangzi’s trio gradually appeared from within the dispersing blizzard. Standing at the front was Wang Jinxi, his clothes in tatters and his body covered with bruises. Fortunately for him, he had blocked his face with his arms, saving him from having his face disfigured. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Yangzi and Wei Xiaofeng’s situations were somewhat better, but their faces were still pale. Their soul power was depleted after enduring that blizzard. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The spectating students perception of Gu Yue had changed. They all wondered, </span><i><span style>Is she really a new student? Just how powerful will she become in the future? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Light Dragon Dagger in hand, Xie Xie walked over to their opponents and said, “Concede defeat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone could see that the opposing trio had used up at least half of their soul power and had been injured to varying degrees. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Hengxu also approached, prepared to stop the match at any moment. Even though he didn’t want to admit it, Gu Yue’s strength was simply too terrifying. He finally understood why that arrogant Wu Zhangkong had wanted to accept her into his class. Long Hengxu had been the pig-brained one! </span></p>
 <p><span style>“We still haven’t lost.” Zhang Yangzi’s gaze was just as sharp as before, but these words were barely audible from behind his gritted teeth. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Xiaofeng gave him a look, before saying hesitantly, “Do you really want to...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Yangzi resolutely looked at him, “We can’t lose. Jinxi, come!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Jinxi suddenly straightened his back, releasing a roar towards the sky as a powerful black aura overcame his body once again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A light of ridicule flashed through Xie Xie’s eyes. </span><i><span style>They still want to overturn the heavens in their current situation? </span></i><span style>In a flash, he began advancing on Zhang Yangzi. After all, Zhang Yangzi was the core of their team. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But right at that moment, a dark figure appeared. With black light spraying from its mouth, it obstructed Xie Xie’s attack and slowing him down. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Afterward, Xie Xie was shocked to see that Zhang Yangzi had flown behind Wang Jinxi and was now holding him by the waist. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A deep dragon’s roar and the cry of an eagle resounded throughout the stage. At that moment, Zhang Yangzi and Wang Jinxi’s bodies became a pitch-black color, like ink. Then, they began to undergo a sort of bizarre fusion. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Yangzi turned into a black light, quietly merging into Wang Jinxi and becoming a pair of wings for him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Jinxi’s body began to grow. &nbsp;A large tail emerged from his tailbone, while his two arms became Bone Dragon Claws, his aura soaring. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Screw off!” Wang Jinxi bellowed with a deep voice, slashing out with one of his Bone Dragon Claws. Xie Xie attempted to dodge, but a black light appeared around him and made him feel like he was trying to struggle free from a swamp. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This black light had appeared too suddenly for Tang Wulin to rescue Xie Xie with his Bluesilver Grass. The only thing Xie Xie could do was defend himself with his Light Dragon Dagger and Shadow Dragon Dagger as he was sent flying through the air. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In the air, a spray of blood escaped Xie Xie’s mouth, and Tang Wulin could hear fractures come from Xie Xie’s arms. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xie Xie!” Tang Wulin dashed over and caught him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie’s eyes were shut tightly, having already lost consciousness. His Light Dragon Dagger and Shadow Dragon Dagger began to fade away with his weak aura. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You bastard! This is only a match!” Tang Wulin snarled as he recklessly charged towards that Bone Dragon. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As he charged forward, a layer of golden scales began to cover his right arm starting from his fingertips. His arm seemed to grow thicker by a whole circle. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s pupils had already turned golden, and when he suddenly stomped with his left foot, it unexpectedly caused a boom. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He exploded forward like an artillery shell, shooting straight towards that transformed Wang Jinxi. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Jinxi’s body was far different than before. With a flap of his wings, his over two meter tall body ascended into the air. Then, with a simple twist of his body, he whipped his tail at Tang Wulin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin opened his mouth, releasing a puff of black gas. His right hand suddenly grew larger and his fingers grew longer, taking on the form of a dragon’s claw. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But it was different from Wang Jinxi’s Bone Dragon Claw; Tang Wulin’s dragon claw had five claws. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang!</span></i><span style> Tang Wulin’s Golden Dragon Claw violently clashed against that air-twisting Bone Dragon tail. A golden light flashed on the tail before Tang Wulin was flung into the air from the force of the collision. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In midair, Tang Wulin curled his body, then used the Bluesilver Grass he had wrapped around the Bone Dragon to pull himself back towards it. The Golden Dragon Claw descended once again, but this time, towards Wang Jinxi’s head. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Jinxi brought his two claws together, swatting at Tang Wulin. But at that moment, Tang Wulin released an ear-piercing dragon’s roar. </span></p>
