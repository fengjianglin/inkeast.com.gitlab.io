 <p>Wu Zhangkong brought the first grade’s class five over, Tang Wulin, Xie Xie and Gu Yue following right at his heels. The rest of the students in class five had expressions filled with excitement. After the results of the previous match, they had suddenly gained much more confidence in Tang Wulin’s trio.</p>
 <p>Ye Yingrong walked over with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Hello Teacher Wu.” She smiled and nodded towards Wu Zhangkong.</p>
 <p>Ye Yingrong truly was a beauty. Her height exceeded 170 centimeters, her figure was superb, and her eyes were bright and full of spirit. Her rarely seen long, light green hair was tied in a ponytail and, with the addition of her fair skin, oval face, and cherry mouth, many would find it believable if they were told she was just an advanced academy student!</p>
 <p>She had joined Eastsea Academy as a teacher at the age of 23 and was already a four ring Soul Ancestor. To Wu Zhangkong, he considered this excellent for her age.</p>
 <p>“Hello.” Wu Zhangkong nodded in acknowledgement.</p>
 <p>“I’m the teacher in charge of class three, Ye Yingrong,” she said, stressing her name in particular. This was because she was certain that this Icily Arrogant Prince Charming had no idea who she was. This was the legended Prince Charming who lived in his own world after all. In the entire academy, it was unclear how many of the females’ names he could actually remember!</p>
 <p>“En.” Wu Zhangkong answered with a single grunt before his gaze drifted back towards the stage.</p>
 <p>Xie Xie stood on the side with eyes full of admiration. The thing Xie Xie envied the most was this icy arrogance Wu Zhangkong had about him. This sort of icy arrogance wasn’t a facade, but rather, it was innate! If he compared himself with Wu Zhangkong, he would be found to be truly too lacking!</p>
 <p>Ye Yingrong didn’t mind this response in the least. Instead, she turned her attention to class three and waved them over. The students of class three hurriedly ran over, forming a neat line in front of her.</p>
 <p>Ye Yingrong said to her class, “Friendship is number one, and the competition is secondary. Gu Tianri, Gu Tianyue, Gu Tianming, do you understand?</p>
 <p>“Yes, Teacher Ye!” The triplets spoke in unison, making it seem as if only one person had spoken.</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong swung a glance at them. Upon seeing their three identical appearances, he clearly became much more interested in Ye Yingrong and these triplets.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Teaching Director Long Hengxu arrived on stage.</p>
 <p>“The second match of the Class Promotion Tournament has arrived. First grade’s class five, is it still the same three people as before?”</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong nodded. Tang Wulin, Xie Xie, and Gu Yue stepped onto the stage together and walked over to the center.</p>
 <p>Ye Yingrong said with a humble smile, “You guys should go now too.”</p>
 <p>The identical triplets got onto the stage.</p>
 <p>These three brothers shared similar traits, such as a slender figure and exceptionally sharp eyes. Due to their deep understanding of one another, their movements were completely synchronized as they walked on stage.</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong didn’t give any pointers to his disciples. They would meet all sorts of opponents in the future, and the Class Promotion Tournament was meant to temper them. If they needed his pointers, then they wouldn’t be able to grow.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin’s trio stood in a triangular formation, with Tang Wulin as the vanguard once again. They stood tall and steady like a mountain.</p>
 <p>The three Gu brothers stood in a line, side by side. Gu Tianri was in the center, with Gu Tianyue to the left and Gu Tiang Ming on the right.</p>
 <p>“Are you all ready?” Long Hengxu inquired as per usual. After receiving answers from both parties, he waved his hand, declaring the start of the match.</p>
 <p>The Gu brothers simultaneously released their martial souls. When Tang Wulin’s trio saw what their martial souls were, they were utterly flabbergasted.</p>
 <p>These three brothers’ martial souls were exactly the same, but that wasn’t the baffling part. After all, they were triplets. What was baffling, however, was that wings appeared on their backs simultaneously, creating a very powerful scene.</p>
 <p>The three pairs of wings opened up simultaneously while a white soul ring appeared underneath each of them. The three Gu brothers flew up into the air together, quickly ascending to great heights.</p>
 <p>Faced with such a scene, Long Hengxu was stunned.</p>
 <p>Flying martial soul? It had to be said that flying martial souls were quite rare. With the additional fact of them being triplets, even if there soul power was weak, or they had a less than optimal spirit soul, they definitely should have been sent to a class of elites. It seems that there was a mistake during their enrollment.</p>
 <p>In reality, it really was a mistake on the academy’s part. The Gu brothers hadn’t signed up together. Gu Tianri had signed up first, as Gu Tianming had a stomach ache and Gu Tianming had other things to attend to. Moreover, there were numerous students signing up at all times, so the teachers were bustling with work and had overlooked the triplets.</p>
 <p>Moreover, these three brothers had also encountered a problem similar to Tang Wulin. Their family’s financial situation was exceedingly ordinary. How could their parents possibly afford to buy them three spirit souls at the same time? Thus, they had delayed it and scraped together the money bit by bit until right before their registration date. Then all three of them bought ten year spirit souls, thus fulfilling the requirements needed of the three to sign up for the academy. Their soul power was only at rank 11, and even though their martial soul wasn’t weak, their soul rings were simply too lacking! Due to this, they had been placed in class three.</p>
 <p>The Gu brothers’ martial soul was called Skyscraping Battle Eagle. It was a type of high speed bird type martial soul.</p>
 <p>Skyscraping Battle Eagle was a type of powerful eagle that would overwhelm its opponents with its speed. As a soul beast, Skyscraping Battle Eagles were able to fly up to altitudes of three kilometers. Moreover, it could maintain high speeds for extended durations. From this, it could be inferred that the three brothers were all Agility System Battle Soul Masters.</p>
 <p>Their first spirit souls were identical, a type of falcon called Gust Falcon. Its speed was exceptionally fast, but its attack power was lacking in comparison. It was only about the size of the palm of one’s hand.</p>
 <p>This was a poor excuse for a spirit soul. If they had been able to pick a slightly more powerful spirit soul, their fighting strength would have been several times higher.</p>
 <p>The moment they had released their martial soul, a pair of gray eagle wings sprouted from their backs and they ascended into the air.</p>
 <p>“They can fly? How are we going to deal with this?” Xie Xie looked towards Tang Wulin as he spoke.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin gave him a slight smile. “We just need to beat them down. Gu Yue, aid me with your wind element.” Tang Wulin said this to Gu Yue as a blue light bloomed in his hand. Bluesilver Grass shot towards Xie Xie and wrapping around his waist.</p>
 <p>Xie Xie screamed, “I’m afraid of heights! What are you doing?”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin unhappily said, “I’m afraid of pain, but didn’t you still stab me yesterday?” Without waiting for Xie Xie’s retort, he immediately pulled Xie Xie close, wrapping a hand around his waist.</p>
 <p>A green light flashed over, causing Xie Xie’s body to lighten. It seemed as though his body weight had been lightened by quite a bit. In that instant, he was sent flying like soaring clouds through mist.</p>
 <p>Offstage, Ye Yingrong saw Tang Wulin holding onto Xie Xie. He then twirled a few times before launching Xie Xie into the air. He was tossed directly at the trio!</p>
 <p>The green light lingered on Xie Xie’s body, causing him to unexpectedly rocket straight towards Gu Tianri.</p>
 <p>‘<i>How is he able to throw someone so high up?’</i> Ye Ying rong was given a fright, but she quickly collected herself.</p>
 <p>The Gu brothers had flying martial souls and were triplets. Ever since they had entered the academy, she had been placing special attention to training these three brothers. She had drilled them in the art of aerial combat and cooperation. If they only sent one person into the air, then wasn’t this just giving the three brothers an opportunity to gang up on him?</p>
