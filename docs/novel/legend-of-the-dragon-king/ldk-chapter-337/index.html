 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;337 - Gorging</strong></span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Wuyu held Tang Wulin up anxiously, his right hand pressed onto his student’s chest as he poured soul power into him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A scorching energy purified Tang Wulin’s meridians, setting his body at ease. However, the fatigue remained. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You overdrafted your energy and might have injured your core. Just what is going on with you? People are usually as lively as a dragon when they break through, but you.” Feng Wuyu eyed Tang Wulin, his gaze peppered with doubt. “You look like you’re about to die.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin forced out a bitter smile. “Teacher, I’m hungry. Can you get me some food? I’ll be fine once I’ve got something in my stomach.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Food? Okay, let’s go to the dining hall then.” Feng Wuyu helped Tang Wulin up. “Do you have some spare clothes? Or do you plan on going to the dining hall butt naked?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>He whipped out a new set of clothes from his storage ring and put them on in response. Absorbing his teacher’s soul power had made him feel significantly better. But that didn’t mean he wasn’t tired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, he didn’t struggle at all when Feng Wuyu dashed off with him in tow, lacking the strength to do so. The dining hall had yet to close this evening. Feng Wuyu deposited Tang Wulin at a table and returned with food a moment later. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s eyes lit up at the sight of food. Unable to hold himself back any longer, he began stuffing his mouth. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This was all for a good cause though. The third seal’s tenacious nature exceeded the previous two’s, forcing Tang Wulin to go through a long battle &nbsp;before breaking it and absorbing the essence of the Golden Dragon King within. That same essence fused with his own blood essence, spreading to every corner of his body. Moreover, by the time he finished absorbing the power, his blood essence was depleted. As a result, he felt as if he had been starved for a month. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Wuyu had happily brought Tang Wulin food. He took joy in the simple sight of Tang Wulin devouring everything he had brought and even wanted to praise his disciple’s eating prowess. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Twenty minutes later, however, his bright expression melted away into unadulterated shock. It was his first time witnessing Tang Wulin eat, his first time realizing what it meant for one to be a King of Gluttony! Despite the hill of empty plates littering the table, Tang Wulin showed no sign of slowing down. This was no stomach, but a bottomless pit! It didn’t bulge regardless of all the food he kept shovelling in. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, the change in his vigor was almost jarring. Upon arriving at the dining hall, Tang Wulin had struggled to sit upright. But with each bite, he grew more spirited, and in turn, his eating pace quickened. Table manners were nowhere to be seen. The table was a battlefield, and Tang Wulin was winning. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Wuyu finally understood why Tang Wulin had accepted him as his teacher once he agreed to pay his food expenses. Tang Wulin hadn’t lied. Since working students needed to pay for their own meals, it would cost Tang Wulin an astronomical sum to feed himself. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Can I really handle a disciple like him? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>By the time Tang Wulin’s gorging reached the forty-minute mark, Feng Wuyu began to tremble. Tang Wulin had not slowed at all. </span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Tang Wulin was having a blast. The highly nourishing food replenished his spent blood essence, leaving behind excess nutrition for his body to absorb, to use to stabilize itself after the arduous third seal breaking. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Shrek Academy is great! If this was Eastsea Academy, it would be impossible for me to eat such good food! </span></i><span style>Tang Wulin he stuffed himself to the beat of his musing. </span></p>
 <p><span style>His feasting finally ended an hour later. The aftermath of his battle was clear for all to see. A mountain of plates lay before him so tall that he couldn’t see Feng Wuyu on the other side. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you always eat this much?” Feng Wuyu asked, voice trembling as much as his heart. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin choked back a cough. “Today’s special. Teacher, did I scare you?” He rose from his seat and walked over to Feng Wuyu’s side. On his face was the mask of a child who was afraid he had done wrong, and he peered up at Feng Wuyu with large watery eyes. “You won’t refuse to take me as your disciple just because I eat a lot, right?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…” Feng Wuyu felt like he had a fish bone stuck in his throat. No matter what he said, he would be trapped. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher, you can be relieved. I don’t normally eat this much,” Tang Wulin said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Wuyu let out a small sigh of relief. “So this was all because of your breakthrough?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mn!”. His next words, however, caused Feng Wuyu’s expression freeze. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I usually only eat about half as much. Of course, I’ll eat more if I can.” Tang Wulin beamed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Wuyu’s face began to twitch. “Can you really digest all this food? Does this have something to do with your strange blood essence?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin nodded. “That’s right. For me, eating food is another way to cultivate. You should be able to sense it, right? My blood essence is far stronger than other people’s. I’m not sure why though. What I do know is that it can offer me a lot of strength and power similar to a soul ring’s. My bloodline possesses the power of a dragon.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>At Tang Wulin’s last words, Feng Wuyu’s eyes narrowed. He gave a slight nod. Just as Tang Wulin had said, he could sense the abnormal strength of his student’s blood essence. And he had clearly felt the golden soul ring’s might when it had materialized, comparable to that of a peak existence.. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It also helped that Feng Wuyu’s martial soul was the Blazing Fire Dragon, with his title, Blazing Dragon, taking a bite out of that. He and another powerhouse in Shrek Academy with a dragon martial soul were famed as the Holy Twin Dragons. The Blazing Fire Dragon was of the true dragon bloodline and stood at the peak of fire-attribute martial souls. As such, he could feel the draconic might emanating from Tang Wulin’s bloodline, calling out to his own, even though they were nothing alike. Yet if not for the gap in their soul power ranks, Feng Wuyu was certain that he would experience some martial soul suppression from Tang Wulin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Simply put, Tang Wulin’s bloodline came from a terrifying soul beast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eat, eat. If you think you can, then eat all my money away.” Feng Wuyu snorted. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher, how long have I been cultivating? Judging from the color of the sky, could I have missed a day of class?” Tang Wulin asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“One day? That’s funny. You’ve already missed three days of school! But don’t worry, I requested a leave of absence for you. You can go explain yourself tomorrow. Now get going. Find me tomorrow afternoon so I can teach you forging.” After saying this, Feng Wuyu could no longer bear the sight of the mountain of plates and ran out. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>T-Three days? </span></i><span style>Tang Wulin sat back down, mouth gaping. </span><i><span style>I haven’t even attended classes for three days yet… But I’ve already missed three classes? </span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is just...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It wouldn’t be so bad if he wasn’t the class president, and he had skipped plenty of classes back at Eastsea Academy. But he was the class president now, and everyone had their eyes on him. Just imagining how much he had missed in three days’ worth of lectures drove him nervous. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh no. I can’t go back to rest right now. I need to find Teacher Wu first! I need to catch up on what I missed! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin burst through the doors of the dining hall at lightning speed, but out in the cold evening air, he realized there was an error in his plan. </span><i><span style>Doesn’t Teacher Wu live on Sea God’s Island? I can’t get there without someone taking me! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, &nbsp;soul communicators existed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin whipped out his communicator and dialed Wu Zhangkong’s number. The call connected and he heard Wu Zhangkong’s icy voice on the line. “You’re done cultivating?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mn. Teacher Wu, please let me explain myself. I was caught up in an extraordinary situation, so I—” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t need an explanation right now. Come to the inner court. I’ll be waiting at the gate. Tell me when you get here.” Wu Zhangkong hung up the call. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin couldn’t tell from Wu Zhangkong’s voice what sort of mood he was in. </span><i><span style>Oh whatever. If I get scolded, then I get scolded. Teacher Wu will probably empathize with me anyway. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Not daring to keep Wu Zhangkong waiting any longer, Tang Wulin dashed toward the inner court, feet in a blur. Although he had been there once, the path was burned into his mind. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As he zipped past buildings and the like, he could feel his body absorbing the nourishment he had consumed. His blood essence was more vigorous than when he had awakened; it was now like blood coursing through his veins instead of energy. It had a clear rhythm to its flow, bringing warmth to his body wherever it went. </span><i></i></p>
