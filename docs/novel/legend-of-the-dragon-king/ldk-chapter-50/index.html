 <p>“Let’s battle again!” Xie Xie repeated for the umpteenth time as he rushed to catch up with Tang Wulin.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin ignored Xie Xie’s calls and headed straight for the dining hall.</p>
 <p>“I wasn’t at my best yesterday! If you don’t fight with me, don’t think that I won’t &nbsp;reveal your secrets! ” Xie Xie threatened.</p>
 <p>“You can say whatever you want,” Tang Wulin replied to his threat nonchalantly. What was he to be afraid of, if he himself knew nothing about the golden scales?</p>
 <p>“You……”</p>
 <p>“Don’t disturb my meal time,” Tang Wulin told Xie Xie as if he were shooing a fly, and easily moved him aside as he headed for the third window.</p>
 <p>“Hey! Come fight me! I’ll treat you to a meal from the first window!” An idea took form in Xie Xie’s mind as he shouted towards Tang Wulin’s back.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin, who was originally headed towards the third window, suddenly returned to Xie Xie’s side, as if his back was attached to a rope and it had been yanked backwards.</p>
 <p>“Are you serious?” He still had cravings for the meals from the first window. &nbsp;After having tasted the food from the second window the day before, he could feel the significant difference the nutritious food had made for his body. He had felt distinctly more comfortable when he woke up this morning. He had been able to feel it throughout his whole body, as if each and every inch of his muscles had been revitalised.</p>
 <p>“Of course!” Xie Xie answered back proudly.</p>
 <p>“Until I’ve had enough?” Tang Wulin’s pair of large eyes brightened up.</p>
 <p>“As much as you can eat. Didn’t they say that you have a huge appetite? Show me your ability. I’ll let you eat until you can’t take any more food!” Xie Xie’s lips curled into a smile as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Deal!”</p>
 <p>Half an hour later, Xie Xie was already beginning to regret his promise.</p>
 <p>“Are you even human? You’ve already eaten 30 phoenix turtle eggs, and you still have room for more?”</p>
 <p>A meal from the second window cost 300 federation coins, and a meal from the first window could cost up to 1,000 federation coins. Tang Wulin wasn’t aware of these costs, and had already finished at least fifteen meals, but it seemed that he hadn’t filled up just yet.</p>
 <p>“Let’s just forget about this, then. I’ll stop eating.” Tang Wulin felt a little ashamed. He had no idea how much one meal course would cost, but with the quantity that he had consumed, it was definitely not cheap.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Tang Wulin was moving towards the third window, Xie Xie rushed forward to grab him and answered fiercely, “Eat. Why did you stop? You’ve already insulted my body, I am not going to let you insult my character as well. I’ll keep my word.”</p>
 <p>A meal from the first window gave Tang Wulin an astoundingly different feeling. &nbsp;He had never tasted anything as delicious as this. The meal from the second window, though nutritious, was bland. However, this meal from the first window was utterly different, even when putting its incredible taste aside. As Tang Wulin consumed the food, it warmed up his whole stomach and filled him with an inexpressibly comfortable feeling. The warmth from the food flowed into all his limbs and bones, heat radiating off Tang Wulin’s body. It felt as though there was a wave of energy gently vibrating within him.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin finally stopped at his twenty-second meal, satiated.</p>
 <p>“Thank you.”</p>
 <p>Xie Xie rolled his eyes, “What? Are you full?”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin smiled, “I’ve forgotten that your name’s Xie Xie<span style="font-size: 13.3333px"><span><a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></span></span>. I was thanking you.”</p>
 <p>After understanding what Tang Wulin meant, Xie Xie cooly replied, “Remember your promise to me.” Though he was wealthy, Xie Xie only had so much pocket money, and the total &nbsp;price of Tang Wulin’s servings made him cringe a little. The sum for the repairs of the previous day amounted to around 20,000 coins, on top of the 20,000 today, totalled to approximately 40,000 coins. Worst of all, he wasn’t sure if he buying another beating or not…</p>
 <p>Today, Wu Zhangkong was wearing a pair of pants colored in grey, black and white, along with a white shirt. His attire’s style was simple, but it accentuated his tall and slim figure.</p>
 <p>By simply standing, his body emitted blasts of cold air, silencing the class effectively.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin wore the most satisfied expression, actually looking relaxed. With his tummy full of goodness from the first window, how could he not be? The gushes of warmth were slowly stirring up the soul power inside him. It was true, then, that good and nutritious food could promote a body’s quality and could shorten one’s cultivation speed.</p>
 <p>“Today officially marks the start of your classes. Most of your lessons will be taught by me. Stand up,” Wu Zhangkong spoke with a cold attitude.</p>
 <p>The whole class quickly jumped to their feet.</p>
 <p>“Come with me!” Wu Zhangkong shoved both his hands into his pockets and walked out of the classroom, followed closely by the students. Being new at this, they lacked the concept of queuing up, which made it looked like a mess. However, nobody dared to speak aloud in front of this icily arrogant god and his powerful aura.</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong brought the group of students to the field. “Line up in pairs, and stand properly.”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin was the tallest in class, after Zhou Zhangxi. The four roommates were &nbsp;once again standing together. Both Tang Wulin and Zhou Zhangxi formed a single file, with Yun Xiao and Xie Xie beside them.</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong spoke deeply, “For the first lesson today, you will be showing me your abilities. Thereafter, you will proceed into actual combat. I’ll be the judge. Elimination will occur after a single loss. Show me your true colours!”</p>
 <p>A girl raised her hand, “Teacher Wu, I am a Tool Soul Master, do I need to join in the actual combat?”</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong answered the student icily, “In the battlefield, would your enemy spare you if you told them you were a Tool Soul Master? First group, prepare yourselves, we shall start from this end.” He pointed towards Tang Wulin and Zhou Zhangxi’s end.</p>
 <p>Contrary to experiencing the anxiety that most students felt, Zhou Zhangxi became excited almost instantaneously. He couldn’t accept having been punched out the window by Tang Wulin, but after witnessing Tang Wulin defeat Xie Xie after only two strikes, his urge to fight had been quelled when the Director gave the order to stop fighting.</p>
 <p>“That’s good. Let’s compete with our strength! I don’t believe your strength will be greater than mine.” Zhou Zhangxi’s eyes lit up as he directed his words at Tang Wulin.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin remained silent.</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong commanded the students to form a circle around the competing duo.</p>
 <p>“You may begin. No rules as to how you may defeat your opponent,” Wu Zhangkong pointed out plainly, but his words were directed towards the entire student body as well.</p>
 <p>Zhou Zhangxi roared loudly, wide-eyed. His soul ring appeared as a white circle beneath his feet, the ray of light instantly flowing upwards, following the contour of his body. In the same moment, his massive build grew in size, particularly the muscles in both his arms, which were visibly swelling up beneath his school uniform.</p>
 <p>A little brown monkey appeared on his shoulder. It seemed to be his spirit soul, a ten year spirit soul.</p>
 <p>First soul skill, Power Amplification!</p>
 <p>Zhou Zhangxi took big strides in Tang Wulin’s direction, producing a thundering ‘<i>dongdong’</i> sound when he stopped on both of his feet. As a match to his massive build, there was his aggressive vigour.</p>
 <p>A few long strides took him to Tang Wulin’s side. With both his hands stretched in Tang Wulin’s direction, he aimed at both Tang Wulin’s shoulders at once.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin shot out both his fists at the same time, aiming towards both Zhou Zhangxi’s hands.</p>
 <p><i>Peng!</i></p>
 <p><i>Deng, deng, deng! </i>The massively-built Zhou Zhangxi was forced backwards three steps before he managed to regain his balance.</p>
 <p>With a big step forward, Tang Wulin threw a punch in Zhou Zhangxi’s direction.</p>
 <p>To counter Tang Wulin’s punch, Zhou Zhangxi gritted his teeth and forced out all the strength within his body into the punch directed at Tang Wulin.</p>
