 <p>Tang Ziran and Lang Yue hadn’t eaten their fill yet as all the food on the table had been sucked into their son’s belly like a tornado. Yet, Tang Wulin still wasn’t full.</p>
 <p>“Son, are you the indignant food devourer of legend?” said Tang Ziran helplessly. In the end, all of the food on the table was inhaled by Tang Wulin’s belly, and Lang Yue had to &nbsp;forbid him from eating anymore.</p>
 <p>Puzzled, Tang Wulin looked at his father. “Dad, why am I indignant?”</p>
 <p>Tang Ziran replied, “Dad really wants to ask you son, do you plan on entering the Soul Master class, or do you want dad to help you enter the ordinary class?”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin answered. “Of course it’s the Soul Master class! I want to become a famous Soul Master!”</p>
 <p>Tang ZI Ran firmly said, “Your martial soul is the Bluesilver Grass. Even in the legends about the Tang Sect’s ancestor, the Bluesilver Grass was an extremely average martial soul. Cultivating it will definitely be difficult, and you will encounter many challenges. Do you really wish to walk down this path?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah! I want to become a Soul Master. After I become a Soul Master, I can make lots of money and buy mom and dad lots of delicious food.” Tang Wulin was full to the brim with childish dreams. To the side Lang Yue watched him with red eyes and thought about how he had always been well-behaved and thoughtful since he was little.</p>
 <p>“Good,” Tang Ziran nodded. “Since you’re set on this, then mom and dad will support you. But if you regret this choice in the future, just tell dad, and I’ll help you transfer classes. Just remember that mom and dad have never wanted you to become a dragon or a phoenix. We only want you to be happy. We’ll be content as long as you’re happy. There’s nothing else more important in our hearts than your happiness. Do you understand?”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin beamed a bright smile in reply. “I’m already really happy right now!”</p>
 <p>Aside from being hungrier than before, Tang Wulin also seemed much thirstier and sleepier as well resulting in him going to bed early.</p>
 <p>The next day, just as the sky revealed the first glimmers of light, Tang Wulin was woken up by his father. Today was the day he would begin attending the academy. He had officially entered the Red Mountain Academy’s Soul Master class. This would be the first day of his nine years of learning.</p>
 <p>According to the regulations set by the Sun Moon Federation, elementary and intermediate academies had free tuition and were compulsory. Elementary academy was three years while the intermediate academy was six years long. There were several ways to enter an advanced academy: outstanding achievements, paying an exceedingly expensive tuition, or entering an academy of science and specializing in a field of study.</p>
 <p>Tang Ziran accompanied Tang Wulin to the academy gates before leaving as the academy was very close to their home. Before leaving to go work, Tang Ziran repeatedly urged Tang Wulin to directly return home after school.</p>
 <p>The Soul Master class specially had a teacher at the front doors to welcome the new students. Clearly, they were treated much better than the ordinary students.</p>
 <p>The ordinary class would receive a normal cultural education while the Soul Master class would also learn how use their innate soul power to become Soul Masters. They would also be taught knowledge essential to Soul Masters and prepare to enter an intermediate academy.</p>
 <p>This year’s Soul Master class only had 15 students, the number of children who had awakened soul power were simply too low. It was even more apparent in a small city like Glorybound City. This year’s arrivals could actually be considered a lot.</p>
 <p>“Hey, what’s your martial soul?” A chubby boy who wasn’t too tall asked, happening to be beside Tang Wulin.</p>
 <p>They were all the same age, all brimming with curiosity and anticipation for the Soul Master class.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin proudly answered, “It’s the same as the Tang Sect’s founding ancestor’s, the Bluesilver Grass.” As he said this, his flipped his hand, and a blue light flickered in his palm. A single strand of Bluesilver Grass danced in his palm. However, he didn’t notice that this Bluesilver Grass was different than yesterday’s, near its roots the grass had changed to a faint golden color. It was so indistinct that if no one would be able to discover it unless they meticulously examined it.</p>
 <p>“<i>Pff.” </i>The little fatty said disdainfully, “Ah, Bluesilver Grass! That’s a trash martial soul.” After insulting Tang Wulin, he ignored him and coldly walked away.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin couldn’t accept this. “Then what about you? What’s your martial soul?”</p>
 <p>With a snort, the little fatty waved his right hand, causing a cold light to glow and a small knife to materialized in his hands. “Have you had a good look? My martial soul is a knife. If I’m able to cultivate to the rank of Title Douluo, then I’ll be the Knife God Douluo. I have rank 5 innate soul power. I can casually chop your Bluesilver Grass into tatters.”</p>
 <p>Looking at the difference between the fatty’s short knife and his own Bluesilver Grass, Tang Wulin suddenly recalled the words his father had said the evening before.</p>
 <p>Will cultivating Bluesilver Grass as a Soul Master really be that difficult?</p>
 <p>All of the other students had already displayed their martial soul and boasted about its characteristics. Regardless of which martial soul it was, they were all far better than his Bluesilver Grass. Due to this, none of the other students paid any attention to him as they began forming their groups.</p>
 <p>‘<i>I’ll definitely become a Soul Master!’ </i>Tang Wulin resolved to himself with clenched fists.</p>
 <p>“Hello everyone. I’m your homeroom teacher, Lin Ximeng. I’ll be teaching you the basic knowledge required for Soul Masters over the next three years. How about you all introduce yourselves now? Tell us your name, martial soul and innate soul power rank.”</p>
 <p>There were only 15 students, so the introductions went by quickly. When Li Ximeng heard that Tang Wulin’s martial soul was Bluesilver Grass, he couldn’t help but be startled while the other students roared with laughter.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin’s little face blushed a deep red. It felt as if he was restraining a ball of fire within his heart. ‘<i>Were these the challenges that you spoke of dad?’</i></p>
 <p>Lin Ximeng quickly regained his composure and smiled. “Today is your first day of class, so I’ll be explaining the different classifications for martial souls first. In the afternoon, I’ll teach you how to meditate. Meditation is the only way to temper and improve your soul power. If you want to become a true Soul Master, then you all must strive your hardest.”</p>
 <p>“As you all know, everyone in our world has a martial soul. One’s martial soul awakens at the age of six, and it can be anything. If one also awakens soul power, then they can cultivate to become a Soul Master. Now a question for all of you, what classifications are there for martial souls?”</p>
 <p>“First of all, the two main classes are tool souls and beast souls. Among them, all of the martial souls that appear on the body are beast souls. If they appear separately from the body, then they’re tool souls. By cultivating your soul power, you’re able to upgrade your martial soul. After your soul power reaches rank 10, then you’re able to become a Soul Master.”</p>
 <p>“There are also two main classes of Soul Masters. The Battle Soul Masters and Utility Soul Masters. Those who cultivate with the goal of fighting are Battle Soul Masters. Regardless of what someone’s martial soul is, they are still a Soul Master. There are also many minor classifications…”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin’s depression gradually faded away as he listened to Lin Ximeng explain the classifications of martial souls and Soul Masters. He had been filled with a curiosity towards Soul Masters since he was small. To him, this knowledge was like a door, opening up a brand new magnificent world.</p>
