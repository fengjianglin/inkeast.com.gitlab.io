 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;370 - Don't Judge a Bun by its Folds</strong></span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie and Gu Yue, being the most familiar with Tang Wulin, instantly understood his intentions. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Holding her three-colored ice spear in one hand, Gu Yue shot orbs of green light at her teammates from her other hand. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Lizhi chanted, creating more buns. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin tugged on the bluesilver grass connected to Yue Zhengyu, who shot into the air, lifting Tang Wulin up with him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The hall was about fifty meters high. Yue Zhengyu flew high up with Tang Wulin in an instant. Tang Wulin then pulled Xie Xie and Gu Yue up. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Zhengyu finally understood why Tang Wulin had told him to conserve his soul power. Taking three passengers into the air would drain his soul power immensely. To help lighten Yue Zhengyu’s load, Tang Wulin sent Goldsong into a strand of bluesilver grass and shot it into the ground as support. He proceeded to pull Xu Lizhi up as well. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With all five of them in the air now, Yuanen Yehui also understood what the plan was too. She turned around, gathered strength within her legs, and leaped. Her body rapidly shrunk as she soared upward, narrowly avoiding the Diamond Baboon’s sweeping palm. Strong gusts of wind buffeted her progress mid-air, but she switched to her Fallen Angel martial soul. A pair of black wings sprouted from her back and she flew herself higher into the air. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Unwilling to let its enemy get away, the Diamond Baboon continued to chase. It ran towards the wall, clambered up several tens of meters, then leaped off the wall toward Yuanen Yehui. </span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the ice spear left Gu Yue’s palm. Fire exploded from the tail of the ice spear and, in the blink of an eye, it reached the Diamond Baboon. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The collision disintegrated the ice spear into an icy mist. Despite the baboon’s formidable defense, the impact sent it really backward and it fell from the air. Frost coated the baboon’s fur as the icy mist burrowed into its body. Furious, the Diamond Baboon and roared, its blood essence surging forth to dispel the mist. But now Yuanen Yehui was out of its reach.. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuanen Yehui gave Gu Yue a thumbs up as she flew over. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin threw the Goldsong-infused bluesilver grass down and used the resulting rebound force to thrust Gu Yue, Xie Xie, Xu Lizhi, and himself a dozen meters higher into the air. They were now over twenty meters above the ground. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Zhengyu continued to flap his wings, straining himself to ascend higher. Carrying four people in the air with a cultivation level of only three soul rings was not an easy task, especially when one of those four was Xu Lizhi. Yue Zhengu barely managed to ascend another couple of dozen meters pushing himself to his limits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yuanen!” Tang Wulin threw a strand of bluesilver grass toward her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuanen Yehui’s Fallen Angel was inferior to Yue Zhengyu’s Holy Angel in terms of divine power, but with her Titan Giant Ape martial soul, it enhanced her strength beyond Yue Zhengyu. This applied to her wing strength as well. Yuanen grabbed onto the strand of bluesilver grass connected to her teammates and beat her wings harder, relieving the pressure onYue Zhengyu as she ascended. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The berserk Diamond Baboon leaped back into the air, swinging its arms straight at Xu Lizhi. The fist missed, hitting air a few meters away. Despite this, Xu Lizhi could feel its deadly wind pressure. Fortunately, most of it dissipated and only knocked the team back a few meters from their height forty meters above the ground. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After becoming enraged, the Diamond Baboon had grown to twelve meters tall. With its strength boosted, it could jump over thirty meters high, nearly forty. This was astonishing for a soul beast with no ranged attacks!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bring us to the top!” shouted Tang Wulin. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuanen Yehui and Yue Zhengyu exerted themselves to bring them higher, straight to the ceiling. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin stabbed his claw into the ceiling. It was abnormally sturdy for stone. His claw only penetrated halfway, but that was enough. With Tang Wulin using his own strength to stay up high, it lightened Yue Zhengyu’s burden and he could now stably fly in the air with just three people attached to him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s plan had been simple, but they were shocked nonetheless. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The enraged Diamond Baboon’s strength far exceeded their expectations, its power seemingly great enough to crush anything that stood in its way. None of them dared take one of its attacks. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Yuanen Yehui’s words earlier had reminded Tang Wulin. Since Enrage produced a similar effect to the red bean buns and the power boost was even greater, then the effective time had to be shorter. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“We don’t have too much time. How long do you think you can hold out for?” Yuanen Yehui asked Tang Wulin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin nodded. “I’m fine, I have plenty of strength left. Even if I didn’t, it still wouldn’t be a problem for me to carry you guys.” His strength had long since surpassed five thousand kilograms worth of force. All together, the six of them weighed no more than five hundred kilograms. This burden was nothing to him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Zhengyu flew over to Tang Wulin and wrapped a strand of bluesilver grass around his waist and shoulders. “Let me know if you can’t hold on. I’ll use the red bean bun and we’ll be able to last another three minutes.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t carry them all as he was now, but it wouldn’t be a problem under the bloodthirsty effort. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have a mini soup bun, I have a mini soup bun, I have a mini soup bun…” chanted Xu Lizhi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Small buns appeared in his hand one after another. He handed one over to Tang Wulin. “This is my second soul skill, Agility Soup Buns. They reduce someone’s weight, which gives them greater agility. They’re useful for me in this situation.” He popped one into his mouth right after speaking. </span></p>
 <p><span style>His Agility Soup Buns were just perfect for their current predicament. Everyone became lighter after eating one. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Zhengyu eyes lit up after feeling the effects. “Fatty, your buns are great!” He was awed by the effects of Xu Lizhi’s Recovery Pork Bun, Agility Mini Soup Bun, and Bloodthirsty Red Bean Bun. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the effects of their food didn’t manifest immediately, the greatest advantage of food-type soul masters was the length of the effects. Having a food-type soul master in a team could mean the difference between victory and defeat in a prolonged battle. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Lizhi grinned. “Don’t judge a bun by its folds!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Zhengyu chuckled. “You’re so fat you’re panting, but I’ll admit that your support is very effective.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuanen Yehui flew over to join them. After facing the Diamond Baboon together, something had changed in their relationships. They had shared joys and sorrows, trials and tribulations, and they all grew closer as a result. Yuanen Yehui no longer regarded them coldly. Well, except for Xie Xie. </span></p>
