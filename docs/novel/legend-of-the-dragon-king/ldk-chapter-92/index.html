 <p>Tang Wulin said, “I wish to practice the Thousand Refinements more and earn a better income. After saving enough money, I’ll be able to buy a spirit soul and eat better food at the academy. My eating ability is too great and nutritious food is too expensive.”</p>
 <p>Mang Tian looked at his growing disciple, who seemed to have become even taller during the last three months, and his expression began to soften.</p>
 <p>He sighed gently, then said, “Maybe I was wrong. Actually, you already had qualifications of a third rank blacksmith when you succeeded at the Thousand Refinements. Your soul power may not be strong enough, but your innate divine strength makes up for that. Especially considering the fact that you are able to enter the mental state and completely devote your being to forging and sense the life within the metal. At your age, that’s simply remarkable.</p>
 <p>“One of the reasons I wasn’t rushing you to become a third rank blacksmith was because I was afraid of showing you more of the world of blacksmithing, and that you would grow arrogant of your talent. This would bring ruin to your future. Yet, I overlooked the fact that regardless of whether one were a Soul Master or a blacksmith, they all require an enormous amount of resources to cultivate to higher levels. The only person you can rely on is yourself. I really was too selfish.”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin looked at his rueful teacher as if in a daydream. “Teacher, so you’re allowing me to take the third rank blacksmith test?”</p>
 <p>Mang Tian nodded. “Take it. Since my disciple is such an exceptional genius in the realm of blacksmithing, what kind of reason could I have to not let him blossom and shine?”</p>
 <p>Having received his teacher’s approval, Tang Wulin joyfully said, “Thank you, teacher. Thank you, teacher.”</p>
 <p>Mang Tian’s expression returned to normal as he seriously said, “You don’t have any reason to be so happy right now. I must remind you that after becoming a third rank blacksmith, you’ll have reached a higher status within the blacksmithing world. I’ll ask the association to keep quiet about you for a while, so you’ll need to keep a low-profile too.</p>
 <p>“Yes, teacher!” Tang Wulin promised respectfully with haste.</p>
 <p>“Wulin, I’ve been stuck at the level of sixth rank blacksmith and have been unable to enter the realm of Saint Craftsman for a long time. This isn’t because my efforts have been lacking or that I wasn’t gifted enough. Rather, it’s because I don’t have the soul power necessary to become a Saint Craftsman.</p>
 <p>“In the last ten thousand years of our Douluo Continent, soul devices have developed at high speed and become modernized. The superiority of Soul Masters has gradually faded away. Even an ordinary person is capable of using most of the available soul devices now. Moreover, soul devices possess formidable attack power, which has allowed them to completely change the entire continent.</p>
 <p>“Regardless, I must tell you that our Douluo Continent is still founded upon Soul Masters. Thus, no matter the occupation, soul power and Soul Master ranks are crucial in order to reach the highest levels!</p>
 <p>“For example, a divine rank Mecha Master must possess at least eight soul rings! One must be at least a Soul Douluo to reach such a level. For us blacksmiths, it’s exactly the same. Without seven soul rings, a martial soul’s true body, and a thorough understanding of one’s martial soul, it would be impossible to become a Saint Craftsman.</p>
 <p>“After encountering this problem, I knew it was impossible for me to become a Saint Craftsman in this lifetime. This is the reason why I told you to focus on soul power cultivation when you got here. With your innate divine strength, when you become a fifth rank Craftsman, you’ll need tremendous spiritual power and soul power to support you. Thus, you must put forth your greatest effort towards cultivation and you cannot be stingy with your money. Eat lots of nutritious food at the academy too.”</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>Mang Tian was usually a man of few words, so when Tang Wulin saw him so rueful, his heart tensed up. Although he was still young, his soul power was still inferior to his peers. Becoming a powerful Soul Master? That was easier said than done. All he could do was redouble his efforts and stubbornly cultivate.</p>
 <p>Mang Tian hand searched his pocket, fishing out an envelope that he handed to Tang Wulin. “There’s another matter I came to settle this time. Read this letter. It’s from your father.”</p>
 <p>“Ah? Why didn’t dad just call me on the soul communicator?” He was busy cultivating everyday in order to improve himself so it had been a week since the last time he’d called home.</p>
 <p>“Read it and you’ll know.” Mang Tian looked at him with eyes full of meaning as he nodded his head.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin had a bad premonition as he hastily opened up the envelope.</p>
 <p>Inside of the envelope were two cards and a letter.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin looked at the letter first. His father’s familiar handwriting was scribbled all over it.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px"><i>Tang Wulin, my son. By the time you receive this letter, your mother and father will already be some place far.</i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px"><i>Father has always been selfish. I’ve let you suffer so many hardships just so I could live a peaceful life. Even when it came time for your spirit soul, I couldn’t do anything and you had to settle for a trash spirit soul.</i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px"><i>That night, your father cried. It was because I didn’t have the ability to help you that you were forced to learn how to forge at such a young age. Although I don’t regret it, I still made you go through so many hardships. Father is sorry. &nbsp;</i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px"><i>In fact, father is a mecha designer. In those early years, I had drawn the attention of some powerful figures due to one of my designs. They wanted to completely control me, but I chose to escape with your mom to Glorybound City. From then on, we’d lived in seclusion as ordinary people. But it seems that an ordinary person’s life isn’t suitable for me. For your sake, I will resume my old trade.</i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px"><i>As for the two cards that came with this letter, one of them is your identity card, while the other is a bank card that can be used throughout the continent. The bank card contains the money I accepted from signing the contract to be that powerful figure’s mecha designer. There’s one million federal coins in there, enough for you to buy a hundred year spirit soul.</i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px"><i>This is all that I can do for you right now. Wait for your father to earn even more money; I’ll send it to that card’s account. Son, you are gifted and must walk towards the apex. Don’t look back and only continue walking forwards. Remember the words father told you. In this world, the only person you can rely on is yourself. I believe that with your strength and ability, you will definitely be able to reach the pinnacle.</i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px"><i>You don’t need to look for us. We’re in a place that is impossible for others to find. We won’t be contacting you anymore, but I know your soul communicator number. Just wait until our situation has settled down, then I will come to find you.</i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px"><i>Your father and mother loves you.</i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px"><i>We will love you forever.</i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Tang Wulin stared at the first line of the letter, his entire body and heart seizing up as he did so. His father’s words had been extremely ordinary, but they were filled with his love for Tang Wulin!</p>
 <p>“Dad, mom!” Tang Wulin suddenly screamed before turning around, trying to run out.</p>
 <p>In the next moment, however, he ran straight into Mang Tian whose body was like a copper wall or an iron bastion.</p>
 <p>Mang Tian grabbed onto his shoulders with both hands. “They’re fine. They’ll just be far away from you for a while. Wulin, you must stand strong.”</p>
 <p>Tears streamed uncontrollably from Tang Wulin’s eyes. <i>It’s for my sake, all for my sake. All to earn money for my sake. Mom and dad have gone far away for my sake.</i></p>
 <p>At that moment, three months of yearning for his family attacked his heart all at once. He tightly gripped the letter and broke down crying.</p>
