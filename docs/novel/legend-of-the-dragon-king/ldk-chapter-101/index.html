 <p><span style>Tang Wulin noticed that the Light Dragon Dagger in Xie Xie’s hand had reduced in size by one circle and its light had become dimmer, yet it seemed to have grown more solid. The lines on the dagger were even clearer to see and now carried a terrifying aura to it. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Two rings? There’s actually a student in class five with two rings? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Despite having just arrived at the sidelines, Long Hengxu’s mouth was already agape. In comparison to class one with its three Soul Grandmasters, the fact that a Soul Grandmaster appeared in class five was even more shocking. It was an unprecedented event in all of Eastsea Academy’s history!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Henxu felt his face heat in pain as though he’d been smacked in the face. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh Wu Zhangkong, Wu Zhangkong. You truly are capable! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The whole of class five began to cheer when they saw that there were actually two rings beneath Xie Xie’s feet. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In a flash of light and shadow, the two of them rushing towards the other. With a grave expression, Xie Xie sped up, turning into a golden light, spiraling in an arc towards Wei Xiaofeng and pressing him back. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Before they even clashed, Xie Xie’s oppressive aura made Wei Xiaofeng feel as if he was being chopped up. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What powerful soul power! He must have just broken through, while I’m already at rank 22! How can his soul power still be so oppressive? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Naturally, Wei Xiaofeng didn’t know that with his twin souls, Xie Xie’s soul power was far mightier than others at the same rank. </span></p>
 <p><span style>None of the other four remained idle while these two clashed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin didn’t immediately release his martial soul, but rather he rushed forward madly, making a beeline for the opponent’s commander, Zhang Yangzi. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue’s figure flickered for a moment before quickly reappearing behind Tang Wulin, as if she were his shadow. Although Tang Wulin only relied on his tyrannical strength and was nowhere near as fast as Xie Xie, he was certainly not slow either. Gu Yue was light as a feather, as if she were a ghost. From beginning to end, she stuck herself to Tang Wulin’s back. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Yangzi stood there without budging a single inch, as if he paid no mind to Tang Wulin’s charge at all. Rather, it was Wang Jinxi who moved from his side. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Similar to his teammates, Wang Jinxi also had two soul rings. His slim figure seemed to swell a bit, but what had grown in size weren’t his muscles, but rather, his skeleton. He looked like a bony rack as he raised his arms to let forth a stream of black gas. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This… He actually has martial soul with the darkness attribute? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Jinxi took large strides forward to meet Tang Wulin, his arms extended in front of him the whole time. Two black flames seemed to ignite within his eyes as he advanced. His spirit soul was nowhere to be found and no one knew what it was. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite this, Tang Wulin’s expression remained unchanged. A white soul ring appeared underfoot as he raised his arms forward and the little Goldlight slithered out from his shirt collar to expose its tiny head. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Of those present, it was only Wu Zhangkong in the audience who noticed that Goldlight’s head had grown much larger than before. But with its body hidden within Tang Wulin’s clothing, he couldn’t get a clear look at it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A layer of earthen yellow light enshrouded Tang Wulin, causing his figure to appear even thicker than before. His speed, however, slowed down a bit. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A red ball of light flew by his shoulder from behind, just barely missing. Surprisingly, it was a fireball! </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pow! </span></i><span style>It struck Wang Jinxi’s right hand, but in a flash of black radiance, the fireball was extinguished. In the moment following, he began his exchange of blows with Tang Wulin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A face to face battle was the domain of an Assault System Soul Master. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang! </span></i><span style>A muffled bang was heard. Tang Wulin came to a stop with a trembling body while Wang Jinxi retreated three steps after receiving Tang Wulin’s punch. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The unmoving Zhang Yangzi’s face colored with astonishment. He understood how much strength Wang Jinxi possessed, as he had a first class close combat martial soul that made him an excellent Assault System Soul Master. In fact, even he himself could not compare in physical strength with Wang Jinxi. He had been absolutely convinced beforehand that within Eastsea Academy’s intermediate division and for those with less than three rings, there were few who could compete in strength. After all, Wang Jinxi’s martial soul was just that powerful! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, an unbelievable scene played out before him. A mere one ring Soul Master with a ten year soul ring actually possessed strength that surpassed Wang Jinxi’s? This was simply inconceivable! </span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t just Zhang Yangzi who thought this way; Wang Jinxi was equally as shocked at Tang Wulin’s strength. In the moment when they had exchanged blows, he felt as if he was a lone man facing an unshakable mountain. That tremendous strength of Tang Wulin’s was something he was completely unable to contend with. He couldn’t help but retreat. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue didn’t follow up with another attack, but instead continued to hide behind Tang Wulin’s back. They still had one opponent who had yet to make their move, so she wanted to conserve her strength. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In the moment Tang Wulin’s fist struck Wang Jinxi, the peculiar feeling within Gu Yue’s heart grew even further. </span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other side, Xie Xie and Wei Xiaofeng were still engaged in an intense clash. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Faced with the threat of Xie Xie’s assault, Wei Xiaofeng’s first soul ring lit up as he used his first soul skill. His body suddenly became illusory as a series of phantoms appeared behind him. These phantoms appeared unreal as they revolved around him and he blended in among them, making it hard for others to identify the real one. </span></p>
 <p><span style>For his Green Shadow Snake martial soul, Wei Xiaofeng’s first soul skill was Green Shadow Clones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Xiaofeng’s spirit soul and martial soul backed up his arrogance. With their extreme compatibility with each other, the soul skills he obtained had been a level higher than what other Soul Masters could get. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although these Green Shadow Clones were simply clones, they were nearly identical to the real thing and possessed an illusory air to them. Wei Xiaofeng’s foot quietly reach out, winding about Xie Xie’s leg. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could Xie Xie distinguish between the phantoms and the true body? Naturally, the current him couldn’t. But he still had means. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong had taught him that if he ever encountered an opponent with abilities he could not analyze, the best method to deal with them was to fully display one’s own abilities. With the use of his strongest abilities, Xie Xie would forcefully break through. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Xie Xie activated his first soul ring, lighting up the Green Shadow Clones for a moment. A radiant golden blade slashed out. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why do I care how many phantoms you have? One attack and I’ll know which one is real and which are fake. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After reaching rank 20, Xie Xie’s soul power had reached another realm, causing the might of his Light Dragon Blade to grow substantially. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The blade of golden light was just like a crescent moon slashing out. A series of shrill sounds could be heard as the edge of the blade sliced through the wind. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Xiaofeng was startled. He hastily pulled back his foot and jumped in an attempt to evade Xie Xie’s attack. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But destroyed phantoms were still destroyed phantoms. When he leapt up in retreat, the phantoms followed right behind him. In that moment, he was revealed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie exploded off the balls of his feet, raising his Light Dragon Blade as his body spun, heading straight for Wei Xiaofeng. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Xiaofeng’s Green Shadow Clones were assembled together in a desperate attempt to ward off Xie Xie, but these clones only had ten percent of Wei Xiaofeng’s strength. Whenever Xie Xie’s Light Dragon Blade passed by, one clone after another would be crushed. He had broken through Wei Xiaofeng’s soul skill. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The spectators from the first grade’s class one were dumbstruck. Wei Xiaofeng was actually being caught in this wind? His clones had actually been annihilated with such a brute force method? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Only Ye Yingluo was able to identify the problem. Xie Xie’s martial soul was unusual. At first glance, it would appear to be merely a dagger, but it was far sharper than a dagger and possessed its own innate aura which exerted a level of pressure on Wei Xiaofeng. Wei Xiaofeng’s usual confidence had been stifled and his full strength couldn’t be displayed at all. </span></p>
 <p><span style>One blue vine after another shot from the ground to bind Wang Jinxi. At some point in time, a pair of metal hammers had also appeared in Tang Wulin’s hands. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to face such a powerful opponent, he couldn’t hold back this time. The hammers he brought out were his Thousand Refined Heavy Silver Hammers. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He could already tell from their previous clash that Wang Jinxi’s martial soul had something to do with his bones. </span><i><span style>I don’t care what kind of martial soul you have. If I can forge uncommon metals, then why can’t I smash your bones? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hou!” Wang Jinxi was enraged by the loss he had just suffered in their exchange. Beneath his feet, his first soul ring began to shine and a strange transformation overcame his body. </span></p>
 <p><span style>His entire right arm rapidly expanded, especially his hand as his five fingers fused into four extremely thick ones, his fingernails turning pitch-black. This enormous arm of his now gave off a tyrannical feeling. His transformation complete, he threw himself straight at Tang Wulin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Jinxi didn’t bother to concern himself with Tang Wulin’s Bluesilver Grass. </span></p>
