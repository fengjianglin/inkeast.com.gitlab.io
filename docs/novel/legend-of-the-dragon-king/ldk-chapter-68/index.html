 <p>He turned towards Gu Yue and said, “In the future, I hope that you will continue to experiment with fusing different elements. I’ve been carefully reviewing your martial soul all day, and I’ve concluded that the Elementalist martial soul is compatible with every element, but because none of these elements can be upgraded with a soul ring, they will never become powerful. You seem to have complete control of the different elements, which is a huge advantage in the beginning. However, as you cultivate to a higher level in the future, you will discover that you won’t have any powerful soul skills as a foundation. The soul rings that you obtain in the future will only be able to increase your control over the elements and the strength of your soul power.</p>
 <p>“Under these circumstances, there is only one path to power for you. You need to be able to control more elements. This is an unprecedented path, however, when I saw you combine the earth and ice elements to trap Xie Xie today, I realized that if you were able to combine different elements and control their strength, you’ll definitely be able to stand at the peak of the world in the future.”</p>
 <p>This evaluation of Wu Zhangkong’s wasn’t spoken lightly. Clearly, he valued Gu Yue highly.</p>
 <p>“Yes. Thank you teacher.” Gu Yue nodded.</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong finally turned to Tang Wulin. “As for you, the first thing you need to do is to gain more control over your martial soul. I’m going to be honest with you, even though your Bluesilver Grass is a variant martial soul, it’s still Bluesilver Grass. It’s tenacity is both a blessing and a curse for you. Unless you can control it perfectly, then it can’t be called control at all. Therefore, you should develop yourself as a Control System Battle Soul Master.</p>
 <p>“There’s also that pair of hammers you used before. Your strength is a gift, and it’s still very useful at this level. In the future, you can try to attack by combining your hammers with your Bluesilver Grass.”</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin responded with only one word.</p>
 <p>“With that being said, we’ll begin the special training now,” Wu Zhangkong said indifferently.</p>
 <p>When Xie Xie heard that it wasn’t physical training, but rather combat training, he immediately became much more spirited. He said eagerly, “Teacher Wu, how are we being matched up?”</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong answered, “You guys won’t be going one after another. Instead, all three of you will battle together. Your opponent is me!”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin, Xie Xie, and Gu Yue’s expressions immediately stiffened.</p>
 <p>A light flashed in Wu Zhangkong’s empty hands as a wooden sword appeared. “I’m not going to use my soul power or any soul skills, but even so, you three must give me your all. Begin!”</p>
 <p>As he said this, he had already shot forward with his wooden sword, quickly approaching Xie Xie.</p>
 <p>Xie Xie reacted with lightning speed and rapidly fell back. However, the sword was like a leech that was difficult to shake off. Even though his retreating speed was very quick, the wooden sword was quicker.</p>
 <p><i>Wuwu!</i> A deep muffled noise broke through the air. Tang Wulin had made his move.</p>
 <p>He had taken Wu Zhangkong’s words to heart and immediately implemented his suggestion. The Thousand Refined Tungsten Hammer was flown out, smashing straight towards Wu Zhangkong. At the end of the handle, however, was a strand of Bluesilver Grass that connected it to Tang Wulin.</p>
 <p>He knew that it would be a futile attempt to bind Wu Zhangkong directly with his Bluesilver Grass. At Wu Zhangkong’s level of soul power, it would only take a moment for him to break free. When that happened, Tang Wulin’s soul power would be consumed to near exhaustion too, and he would no longer be able to use his Bluesilver Grass.</p>
 <p>As for the Thousand Refined Tungsten Hammer that he had sent flying, Wu Zhangkong didn’t even put them in his eyes, and continued forward with his sword. The tungsten hammers simply flew behind him.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin made a 囧 face when his strike missed…</p>
 <p>A cool breeze brushed up from beside him, pushing Xie Xie out of the way and causing Wu Zhangkong’s sword to meet nothing but air.</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong pursued, but the ground beneath his feet quickly grew soft and an icicle flew towards the ground. Gu Yue was using the same elemental combination technique as before.</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong revealed a calm smile. With a flick of his wrist, the wooden sword gracefully met the icicle, easily shattering it.</p>
 <p>At the same time, he jumped out of the mud.</p>
 <p><i>Wuwu! </i>Tang Wulin’s Thousand Refined Tungsten Hammers arrived once again. This time however, it wasn’t just a single hammer, but rather, both of them were present. With both hammers in use, their attack range was even greater.</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong’s wooden sword moved exactly to his will and met with the tungsten hammers, causing them to both stop in mid air and immediately drop to the ground.</p>
 <p>A flash of shock colored Wu Zhangkong’s eyes. ‘<i>This little guy’s strength is simply tyrannical!’</i></p>
 <p>A fireball showed up at Wu Zhangkong’s side. Once again, Gu Yue’s attack had appeared at just the right moment.</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong’s weapon was a wooden sword, so using fire to burn it was definitely the best choice.</p>
 <p>The wooden sword drew a circle in the air, causing a bizarre stream of air to appear. The fireball suddenly strayed from its path and soared above Wu Zhangkong, heading straight for Xie Xie instead.</p>
 <p>Xie Xie’s Light Dragon Dagger slashed at the fireball, breaking it into embers. He curled his body in mid air as he was still within range of Wu Zhangkong. Then his left hand made a slight movement, and an invisible blade appeared as he thrust out with his Light Dragon Dagger.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin’s Thousand Refined Tungsten Hammers shot towards Wu Zhangkong once again, bombarding Wu Zhangkong.</p>
 <p>Three fireballs also shot out right at that moment. Tang Wulin, Xie Xie, and Gu Yue had synchronized their attacks.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, their opponent was simply too powerful.</p>
 <p>The wooden sword in Wu Zhangkong’s hands easily transformed into numerous sword silhouettes. The two hammers were deflected while Xie Xie was struck in the shoulder and sent flying directly into the path of the three fireballs. If it wasn’t for his courage, along with his Light Dragon Dagger and Shadow Dragon Dagger, he feared that he would have been seriously wounded.</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong dropped from the sky. This time, his target was Tang Wulin. The wooden sword thrust towards Tang Wulin.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin didn’t retreat. Xie Xie was still in a daze and wouldn’t be able to help him, and Gu Yue had been buried under Xie Xie, which made her unable to support him. This situation had been meticulously manufactured by Wu Zhangkong in order to isolate him.</p>
 <p>True combat would excite a student’s potential. This was exactly what he did back at the advanced academy. When faced with immense pressure, a student’s potential would be revealed by how they reacted.</p>
 <p>At this crucial moment, Tang Wulin didn’t shrink back. Instead, he launched his Bluesilver Grass and used Bind on Wu Zhangkong.</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong simply struggled a bit and broke free of Tang Wulin’s Bluesilver Grass, draining him of his soul power. There hadn’t even been enough time for Tang Wulin to withdraw his hammers which he had previously sent flying.</p>
 <p>With the wooden sword striking towards his chest, Tang Wulin’s expression turned to one of extreme focus. He still remembered the battle he had fought with Xie Xie before. It was only because he treated Xie Xie as metal, that he had been able to reach such a level and persisted for so long.</p>
 <p>At this moment, he will once again treat Wu Zhangkong like metal. He quickly entered an ethereal state that was solely focused on forging.</p>
 <p>Two grey lights simultaneously flashed. A hammer appeared in his right hand, obstructing the wooden sword, while the hammer that appeared in his left hand smashed towards Wu Zhangkong.</p>
 <p><i>Ding!</i> The wooden sword struck the hammer, issuing forth a crisp metallic note.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin only felt a tremendous force being transmitted as the Thousand Refined Heavy Silver Hammer flew into his stomach from the recoil, knocking him back.</p>
