 <p><span style>“Deal,” Yuanen happily said. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin perceived from Yuanen’s tone that he was selling his thousand refinement for cheap this time, but information could make or break newcomers like him. Besides, Yuanen was only one person. He couldn’t possibly need too many thousand refinements. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Academy purchases first-grade thousand refined metal for a minimum of two thousand contribution points.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The corner of Tang Wulin’s mouth began twitching. “But the working student thousand refining jobs rewards are all one thousand points!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s because you hadn’t joined the Blacksmith’s Association yet. Aren’t the fees only five percent now that you’ve joined? Apart from us working students who are required to accept a few missions every month, no one will bother with the jobs given by the administration. You’ll only get cheated if you do.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin said, “Okay. I get it now. It’s a good thing I didn’t find out too late. So I want to ask you, is there some secret about working students? Why do people act strange when they find out I’m a working student?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s because working students are freaks,” Yuanen answered bluntly. “The Academy usually accepts any person who doesn’t pass the exam but performs spectacularly in one area as a working student. Well, those with extraordinary qualities are admitted as working students too. For example, that Elder Feng you met earlier used to be a working student. Relying on his blacksmithing talent, he graduated from the outer court at the age of thirty-four. But in that same year, he succeeded at soul refining and broke into the seventh rank, becoming a Saint Blacksmith. The Academy made an exception for him, the youngest Saint Blacksmith on the continent, and accepted him into the inner court. Then his cultivation soared. He rose from six to nine rings in twenty years. He became a Title Douluo and an eighth rank Saint Blacksmith. He’s the greatest blacksmith of Shrek Academy and holds an exalted position. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Working students created a precedent of reaching to the top. In the eyes of ordinary students, working students are unpredictable and absolutely must not be offended. The chances for graduating working students to enter the inner court is thirty percent, much higher than ordinary students. Naturally, we’re under a lot more pressure than them too. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Academy established the working student system for those who excelled in one particular field, but didn’t meet the criteria for admittance. But now, after many generations of working students, these two words alone are enough to demand respect from ordinary students in the outer court.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin finally understood why the administrator had told him not to bring shame to the working students that day. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So then, Elder Cai wasn’t punishing us by making us working students! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have any other questions?” Yuanen asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin said, “I still have a question. You’re so strong, so why haven’t you entered the inner court yet? How old are you?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m fifteen years old. I entered Shrek Academy when I was twelve. As for why I haven’t entered the inner court yet, I can’t tell you. It’s a secret.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>A trace of loneliness flickered in Yuanen’s eyes. “Alright, if you don’t need anything else, I’m leaving now. I still need to finish my own tasks. Oh right, I’m a third-rank mecha designer. If you need any designs in the future, come find me and I’ll give you a discount.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin smiled. “Not for free?’ </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuanen stared at him. “Free? Shrek Academy advocates a system where the more work you put in, the more you benefit. In order to gain something, you have to pay the price.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, fine, stop being so serious. Let’s go. We’re going the same way so I’ll leave with you.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin had gained much this outing. Joining the Blacksmith’s Association would make his life much easier; that is, providing him with the means to feed himself. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You got what you wanted, so don’t forget to treat me to dinner.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re such a glutton.” Yuanen gave him a helpless look. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They left the school building and walked back to their dormitory. Just as they exited the forest, however, Yuanen raised his head and stared into the distance. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin noted Yuanen’s sudden stillness. He also looked in the same direction. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A person sat on the edge of the forest, his body turned to face the dormitory. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The man wore the green uniform of Shrek Academy, his golden hair neatly combed back. Tang Wulin thought he looked a bit familiar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuanen stopped walking. At the same time, the golden-haired man also noticed them and turned his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin instantly recognized him. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Isn’t he the rich kid from yesterday who bought out the drink shop because he wanted a girl’s number? He also had the angel martial soul, right? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Tang Wulin and Yuanen, the man stood up and strode over. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you two seen a red-haired girl here? Actually, does a red-haired girl live here at all?” The man stared at them arrogantly, his mere presence stifling to others. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s still looking for that Fallen Angel girl? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s heart thumped.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s right! Didn’t she say she was a working student as well? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He subconsciously turned toward Yuanen. As a second grade student, Yuanen knew more about working students. Besides, this Yue Zhengyu man was also a second grade student. The fact that he didn’t recognize Yuanen was puzzling. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuanen looked at Yue Zhengyu with indifference. “I don’t know anyone like that. Please move out of the way.” Not waiting for his reply, Yuanen began walking forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Zhengyu’s eyes flashed. “I’ve already waited half a day, but I’ve only met you two working students. Now, you say you don’t know anything?” He raised a hand to push Yuanen in the chest. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuanen’s expression instantly darkened. An imposing aura burst forth from his body, and he rammed Yue Zhengyu with his shoulder. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Astonishment flickered in Yue Zhengyu’s eyes. He hadn’t been in Shrek Academy for long despite being an outer court student. If not for his clan’s requirements, he would have entered the inner court long ago. He had been forced by his clan to go into seclusion to awaken his martial soul immediately after being admitted, so he started straight in the second grade upon completion. This was why didn’t recognize Yuanen. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Facing Yuanen’s attack, he also lowered his shoulder to ram into Yuanen’s. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin retreated two steps. He didn’t want to become collateral damage. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As Tang Wulin expected, the aftermath of their collision resulted in Yue Zhengyu being sent flying. A burst of radiance later, wings unfurled behind Yue Zhengyu’s back and he fought to steady himself in mid-air. Finally, his body righted itself. Yet, tremors still ran down his right shoulder.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Though the Holy Angel martial soul was formidable, its strength did not lie in power. When facing the tyrannical might of the Titan Great Ape, a soul beast whose mere punch could cause shockwaves, even Tang Wulin wasn’t confident in his strength! It would take all of his bloodline power for Tang Wulin to contend against Yuanen. </span></p>
 <p><span style>If Yue Zhengyu were fine after receiving such an attack, it would be strange</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You!” Fury blazed in Yue Zhengyu’s eyes. </span></p>
