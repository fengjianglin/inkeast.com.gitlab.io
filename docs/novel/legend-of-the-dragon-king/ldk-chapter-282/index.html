 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;282 - One Step to the Heavens! Ten Thousand Refinements of Life!</strong></span></p>
 <p><span style>The difference between spirit and thousand refining was as great as night and day, much like the power of a one-word battle armor versus a two-word’s. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Once spirit refined, the metal sublimated to another level. It was for this reason that fifth-rank blacksmiths were rarer and no weaker mecha craftsmen or designers of the same rank. </span></p>
 <p><span style>To break through the fifth rank, Tang Wulin only needed to successfully spirit refine once. This was considered a major milestone for any blacksmith. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Three years ago, Mang Tian had attempted this, and though he succeeded, it came with a price. Unknown to Tang Wulin, the man had sustained several injuries as a result and could not endure more advanced forging requests from then on. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen would never have permitted Tang Wulin to spirit refine if he were present. For this process, the demands placed on the blacksmith’s mind were immense. It could be dangerous for a soul master at Tang Wulin’s level..</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, Tang Wulin was no ordinary blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to his peers, his spiritual power towered over the rest at over two hundred points. With this, he could keep a clear mind as he poured his heart and soul into forging. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Immersed in his connection with the heavy silver, he could feel its joy and timidness. It was afraid of taking the next step, but Tang Wulin coaxed it along. </span></p>
 <p><span style>One step to the heavens! Ten thousand refinements of life! </span></p>
 <p><span style>The ten thousand refinements of life was to continuously connect with the metal. Each tap preserved the spirit of the metal, pouring soul power into it to obtain life. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Cultivating intelligence in metal was similar to that of soul beast. For soul beasts, there was a slight difference in intelligence between a ten-year soul beast and a normal animal. However, a soul beast’s intelligence skyrocketed once it reached the thousand-year level, until breaching the ten-thousand year mark. At that point, its intelligence rivaled a human’s. From there, it accumulated wisdom until it reached the ten-thousand-year level where it was no less intelligent than a human. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Higher leveled soul beasts weren't stronger just because of their energy growing, but also due to their increase in intellect. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Metal was no different. The greater its spirit, the closer the metal was to obtaining its own ego and changing on a fundamental level. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Oddly, under Tang Wulin’s gentle taps, the heavy silver trembled. Each tap coaxed a burst of light, a pattern of a whirling cloud pushing its way into existence on the metal’s surface. As its bulk shrunk, the silver grew brighter and brighter. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This signified a successful spiritual connection between Tang Wulin and the heavy silver, hinting at a smooth process until the end. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Now it was a matter of maintaining this connection and leading the heavy silver to transform and complete its refinement. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin drove his soul power into the heavy silver, using his Bluesilver Grass as the bridge. Although he relied on the Mysterious Heaven Method to restore as much of the lost soul power as possible, the chunk of heavy silver was a bottomless pit. This was a dire problem.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I have to succeed! Everyone’s acceptance depends on me! I have no choice but to succeed! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Three years of body tempering and experience gaining. The fruits of his labor were now revealed. He willed every ounce of strength and skill hidden in the nooks of his body to the surface. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Since two years prior, he’d been able to first-grade thousand refine. Owing to his diligence, Tang Wulin had not fooled around the slightest, striving to improve his foundation. Now he stood at the apex of the fourth rank. He only lacked the soul power necessary to take the next step forward. Otherwise, he would have long since attempted to spirit refine. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With his full strength unveiled, every strike of his hammers transformed the heavy silver more than before. His connection with the metal thrust him to new heights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would likely succeed if this continued on. </span></p>
 <p><span style>What was most frightening about spirit refining was the possibility of a premature disconnection. Should this happen, the metal lost its spirit, turning it into its normal, inert counterpart. This was why Spirit Refinement was expensive to attempt. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Countless blacksmiths failed at this step and never crossed into the next realm. Apart from talent and skill, money was a limiting reagent. Blacksmiths backed by large clans had better chances than the rest. They could succeed through brute force of resources.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s circling speed accelerated. Had he known Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track, the process would have gone even smoother. Unfortunately, he had been forced to spend his contribution points on spirit items instead of Tang Sect secret arts. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As the silver light flourished and the heavy silver shrunk, Tang Wulin’s hammers resonated with the lump of silver and emitted a similar hue of light. Crimson veins crawled over the surface of his hammers, the mark of his blood sacrifice. </span></p>
 <p><span style>These two hammers had always accompanied him in the last few years, his go-to tools for his innumerable first-grade thousand refined pieces. After he had performed the blood sacrifice, he fueled the hammers’ growth, to the point where they were now first-grade thousand refined. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the hammers struck the heavy silver simultaneously, a strange connection opened between them. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Under careful inspection, one would notice the shrinking in size of Tang Wulin’s hammers. They also grew smaller and brighter with each strike. </span></p>
 <p><span style>His soul power consumption was too high. Ten minutes had passed and he was approaching his limits. The second he ran out, his connection with the heavy silver would be broken. Despite the smooth start the connection was fragile, and could break at any moment.Once the spirit refining failed, this chunk of heavy silver would become useless and its spirit would attempt to devour the blacksmith in its fury. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Even four-ringed blacksmiths would need a long time to recover from the backlash, not to mention Tang Wulin who had two rings. Perhaps, he would never be able to recover from such a setback. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What can I do?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>My soul power is almost depleted but I’m not done yet. The heavy silver has a speck of life in it now. However, I still need to feed it more energy. </span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I can’t stop. No matter what, I can’t stop. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tightening his resolve, Tang Wulin’s next move astonished everyone. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He held both hammers in his left hand, grabbing the ingot with the one that’s free. Not once did the pounding stop. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As his skin met with the heavy silver, thick white smoke released from the metal’s surface, loud sizzles permeating the air. His hand convulsed from the sharp tendrils of pain, the temperature enough to melt off a person’s hand! </span></p>
 <p><span style>But Tang Wulin was spared of this fate. Besides a few wisps of smoke rising from his palm, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. He called back his Bluesilver Grass in favor of his golden soul ring, gold scales appearing over his arm. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Determined, Tang Wulin suppressed the daggers of pain stabbing into his body, beads of sweat dripping down his forehead as ignored wave after wave of exhaustion, his soul power depleting by the second. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He held the connection, though blood essence replaced soul power as the bridge. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin shouted with resolve. His clothes burst into shreds, revealing the lean and rugged body, the golden scales snaking across his toned torso and arm.The scales shined resplendently under the effect of Golden Dragon Body. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A golden fog rose from the scales, enveloping the chunk of heavy silver. This prompted him to circle around the mass of metal once more, striking its sides with the two hammers in his left hand the entire time. </span></p>
