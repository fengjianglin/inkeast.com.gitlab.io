 <p><span style>Xie Xie’s response was just as swift. He instantly activated his second soul skill, Light Dragon Storm, and spun like a whirlwind while attacking Tang Wulin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But the Bluesilver Grass was too quick and tenacious! Each time Xie Xie shredded the grass another wave would overwhelm him a moment later, eroding at the power of his Light Dragon Storm. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This isn’t good! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie sucked in a deep breath. He descended from the air and launched a second Shadow Dragon Storm. The two skills merged together, increasing its power and speed. He returned to Gu Yue, his speed so fast that he seemed like a phantom. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Light Dragon Storm and the Shadow Dragon Storm combined to make the Twin Dragon Storm! </span></p>
 <p><span style>This was Xie Xie’s greatest accomplishment over the last month. After all, who wouldn’t feel pressured to improve in such an environment? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin was momentarily stunned. He had believed that his thousand-year Bind could easily restrain Xie Xie, but he hadn’t expected Xie Xie to progress this much. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie landed far away, his complexion pale at the unpleasant oppression he had felt and the massive consumption of soul power by the Twin Dragon Storm. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue halted her advance. She gave Tang Wulin a thumbs up, an amused smile gracing her face as her eyes glittered. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Having known each other for so long now, Tang Wulin naturally understood her intention; she wanted to battle seriously now. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie dashed out from the side. As an Agility System Soul Master, he shouldn’t have charged from the front anyway. Meanwhile, Gu Yue waved her arms and summoned an array of elemental attacks that surrounded Tang Wulin from all sides. </span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was Tang Wulin’s previous self, he would have been hard pressed to deal with such an assault. But he had changed. His Bluesilver Grass slithered through the air as it weaved into a large net to shield him from the onslaught of elements. It was a battle of attrition now. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s advantage lay in his thousand-year spirit soul which minimized his consumption while Gu Yue’s lay in her Elemental Tide and her control of the elements, which also had a relatively low consumption rate. Gu Yue gradually gained the upper hand in this battle with her higher cultivate base. After all, the two were a Soul Master and a Soul Grandmaster, separated by a whole realm! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Tang Wulin wasn’t worried at all. He hadn’t forgotten that Gu Yue had no one to protect her! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin had completely disregarded Xie Xie—who was on the peripheral of the battle—and charged toward Gu Yue. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As long as he took out Gu Yue, then Xie Xie would be no problem. He hadn’t even taken Xu Xiaoyan into consideration. They had never worked together before and Xu Xiaoyan’s strength was a mystery to him, so he had treated the battle as a one on two from the very beginning. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With his thousand-year Bluesilver Grass and his intermediate level Spirit Connection realm spiritual power, he had infinite possibilities to attack and defend. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The sharing ability of Bluesilver Grass alleviated any fear Tang Wulin had toward Gu Yue’s six element assault. Of course, his confidence only lasted as long as his soul power did. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With such a restriction placed on him,what he needed to do now was use a blitzkrieg strategy. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue ran backwards to escape from Tang Wulin’s charge. Although her speed couldn't compare with Tang Wulin’s, each step bought her precious seconds. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She threw up her hands and made some complicated hand gestures that forth two balls of light, one cobalt and the other crimson. Waves of unstable power rippled out as the two fused. Gu Yue quickly threw it toward Tang Wulin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin would have directly crashed into the fused elemental ball had he not cultivated the Purple Demon Eyes. Fortunately, he had and could clearly discern how volatile this fusion of ice and fire was! </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She combined the two opposing elements, fire and ice? </span></i><span style>Although the fusion was unstable, he couldn’t fathom how Gu Yue managed to reach this state in the beginning! Even though the fusion was only temporary, its true power lay in it exploding! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin didn’t hesitate to command Goldlight to retreat. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Goldlight shot into the air, carefully avoiding the ball of ice and fire by gently deflecting it with a wiggle of its tail. At the same time, Tang Wulin saw an alarming violet glint in Gu Yue’s eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A wave of dizziness struck her as she lost control over the elemental ball. The ball, deflected by Goldlight’s tail swipe, flew off to the side towards the bystanders. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin took advantage of this opening to close the distance between them and use Bind on her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only did the Purple Demon Eyes enhance eyesight, it could also send a powerful spiritual attack. Once cultivated to a sufficiently high level, one could kill with just a simple look. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With Tang Wulin’s talent for Purple Demon eyes, he had made rapid progress. Though he couldn’t kill with a glance yet, he could easily disturb his opponent’s mind. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In this state, Gu Yue’s hands moved too slowly to defend herself. By the time she regained lucidity, Tang Wulin’s Bluesilver Grass was already in front of her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In this moment of crisis, Gu Yue used her strongest element, disappearing in a flash of silver light. This was her control over space! </span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next instant, the strands of grass that had swept out grabbed nothing but air. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Incredulity spread across Tang Wulin’s face. Just when he thought Gu Yue had evaded far away from him, she appeared before him in a flash of light! </span></p>
 <p><span style>That was right, she had chosen to teleport right in front of him. She thrusted an azure palm at his chest. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Her actions had been too unexpected for Tang Wulin to even process, let alone react to! She had rushed past his net and turned the most dangerous area into the safest area! Against all his expectations, she charged right into his arms! </span></p>
 <p><span style>He only had one option now: to retaliate with his Golden Dragon Claw! He was confident that even if he froze over, there was a fifty percent chance he could hit her back; but there was also a chance that she would immediately crumble apart under his claw. This was the claw that could kill a thousand-year soul beast! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s subconscious was in a state of chaos. His raised right arm lowered a moment later. </span><i><span style>She’s my comrade! A loss is just a loss! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>But at that instant, Gu Yue’s palm struck a white light that had enveloped Tang Wulin’s chest instead! </span></p>
 <p><span style>A chill swept out from his chest, repelling Gu Yue’s palm. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin didn’t let this chance slip away. He immediately summoned his Bluesilver Grass to restrain Gu Yue. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin lightly pinched Gu Yue’s neck with his claw, interrupting her control over the elements. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked back at Xu Xiaoyan in astonishment. Her ice staff was raised and pointed in his direction and her expression the definition of smug. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie was the most miserable one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He hadn’t expected Gu Yue’s attack to come flying his way. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He had just finished his preparations to break through Tang Wulin’s defences with his Twin Dragon Storm and join Gu Yue in a coordinated attack, but who would’ve expected that the ball of fire and ice would &nbsp;out of nowhere and explode! </span></p>
 <p><span style>The violent blast let Xie Xie experience what was called two heavens of fire and ice. </span></p>
