 <p><span style>The clock slowly ticked by. It was normal for the Thousand Refinements to take a few hours, but the relentless storm of Tang Wulin’s twin hammers had already reduced the Blue Coppertite to one-third of its original size in only a quarter of an hour. Its blue hue grew brighter and brighter while the ripples on its surface began to slow down and stabilize. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s almost done? </span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>So fast! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Stacked Hammers effect may have helped Tang Wulin, but it was his strength, judgement, and understanding of the metal that allowed him to finish so quickly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Having already become one with his hammers, Tang Wulin’s concentration could not be broken. Surprisingly enough, he was actually beginning to resemble his hammers. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang bang bang! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The final hammer strike descended, and an azure halo that was a third of a meter in diameter burst from the Blue Coppertite, fusing back into the metal a moment later and disappearing. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“A halo emerged!” Cen Yue cried. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Only metals at the second-grade and above could release a halo. Furthermore, the appearance of a halo signified the degree to which spirit was imbued into the metal. This was the origin of the name, “Half-Spirit Refinement.” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That halo just now wasn’t an ordinary second-grade halo! </span></i><span style>Cen Yue wiped cold sweat from his forehead. </span><i><span style>Did this boy just forge a first-grade metal? Is he trying to astonish us even more? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen’s eyes lit up. He raised one hand to stop Tang Wulin and used his other to grab the metal. “You don’t need to do anything else. We’re ending the test here. You’ve succeeded at Thousand Refining a second-grade Blue Coppertite and officially passed the fourth rank test.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Tang Wulin could forge a second-grade Blue Coppertite, they didn’t even need to check if he could do the same with lesser metals. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t of the first-grade?” Cen Yue asked Mu Chen. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen shook his head. “It falls a bit short, but it’s nearly there. You’ll make a lot of money off of this Blue Coppertite the next time you accept some tasks. Go back and prepare for the Grand Banquet of the Sea and Sky. It begins in one month.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“But... teacher, don’t I still need to attend class?” Tang Wulin asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen said, “You don’t need to worry, the association will help you take care of that. You need to spend the remaining time forging. I’ll continue to teach you once a week. It seems like I need to start teaching you the technique needed to forge first-grade metals.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin smiled. “Yes, thank you, teacher.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll go with you.” Mu Xi took the initiative to accompany him back to the academy. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the two left the Blacksmith’s Association, Mu Xi suddenly pinched Tang Wulin’s cheek. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ow! Senior disciple sister, what are you doing?” Tang Wulin complained. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Xi snorted. “I’m checking if you’re even human. Isn’t everyone supposed to be equal? You don’t have another face, so how are you able to progress so quickly?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior disciple sister, I don’t have a second face,” Tang Wulin said in embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Xi suddenly became all smiles. “I know. Can I talk to you about something? If no one ends up being better than me at the Skysea Alliance Tournament, can you let me win? &nbsp;I’ll give you the prize money too, and then you’ll have the money for both first and second places. I’ll even give you the metals that are awarded as well. How about it?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin stared at her in a daze. “Okay.” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Okay? </span></i><span style>Mu Xi thought she misheard him. </span><i><span style>He agreed so easily? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, do you even understand the significance of the Skysea Alliance Tournament? How can you agree so easily?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin said, “It’s just fame. The difference between first and second place can’t be that large anyway. If I can earn more money by giving up first place for second place, then I’m all for it!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m convinced now—you really only think about money!” Mu Xi smacked the top of his head lightly. “I’m just joking with you. If I stole first place from you, dad would kill me!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>A trace of a smile appeared on Tang Wulin’s lips. “Teacher wouldn’t do that. He actually looks at you with doting eyes. I’m serious, senior disciple sister. If no one is better than you, I’ll give you first place. I’ll be taking that prize money though.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s earnest insistence left Mu Xi in a daze. “I don’t want you to do this for my dad.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>With her intelligence, she immediately realized what Tang Wulin intended. He was doing a favor to Mu Chen. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin shook his head. “It’s not what you’re thinking. Teacher once said that the tallest tree in the forest will be ravaged by the wind. I’m still very young, so what do you think would happen if I reveal that I’m already a fourth rank blacksmith? I’m still a long ways from three rings and Spirit Refinement, so what does first place even mean to me? If I just take second place, then I can keep a low-profile while earning some money.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Xi curiously asked, “Can you tell me why you need so much money?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin forced out a bitter smile. “My cultivation path is a bit different from other people. I need a lot of heavenly treasures to continue evolving my martial soul. My strength comes from that evolution. You know that my martial soul is Bluesilver Grass. Take a look!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin raised his right hand and summoned his golden scales. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The sight of the golden scales left Mu Xi speechless. She slowly raised a finger and tapped on the scales, creating a sharp metallic tone. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is why you’re in class zero? This is the source of your strength?” Mu Xi asked in disbelief. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin nodded. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you afraid I’ll tell my dad?” Mu Xi asked suspiciously. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t intend to hide this from teacher!” Tang Wulin said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Forget about it, then!” Mu Xi nodded at Tang Wulin’s answer in satisfaction. “I’ll look out for you in the academy from now on. If anyone dares bully you, just tell me their name.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. “Senior disciple sister, what are you saying? I don’t get into fights anyway.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t get into fights? Who was it that sent his roommates flying out of their second-floor window on the first day, hm? I can't seem to remember...” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, right, do you like Zixin?” Mu Xi asked suddenly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin was blindsided by this question, and his face immediately went beet red before he waved his arms in denial. “N-No! No, I don’t! I don’t…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha! Look at how flustered you are! Aren’t you usually super calm? I understand. You’re confused about the matters of the heart and are trying to deny it, but it’s clear that you like her! Just what are you learning at such a young age?” Mu Xi pinched his face over and over. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin was distressed. “I really don’t! Senior Sister Zixin is just a really nice person, and we frequently run into each other during our morning jogs. Even if I did like her, it would be because she’s so pretty and gentle. I can appreciate those qualities, you know! Don’t go having any weird thoughts!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Xi raised her eyebrows. “So you’re saying that I’m not pretty or gentle enough for you to like… and you don’t appreciate me?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin was still a ten-year-old child, so how could he hope to win an argument against a developing young lady? Mu Xi was fourteen years old this year and was far more mature than him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I-I…” Tang Wulin gawked at her, speechless. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Isn’t that right though? You’re not gentle at all! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin had to admit Wu Xi was pretty, but he would never say so out loud. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After pinching Tang Wulin’s face a bit more, Mu Xi was satisfied. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bullying him is even more fun than being cold to him! </span></i><span style>Her mouth curled into a wicked smile. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They soon arrived at the academy and Tang Wulin let out a sigh. He flew back to his dorm while rubbing his aching cheeks, the sound of Mu Xi’s witch-like cackling chasing after him. </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>☀ </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“The Skysea Alliance Tournament?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin mentioned the tournament during lunch and immediately caught Xie Xie’s ear. He hadn’t realized just how much Xie Xie knew about the tournament! </span></p>
