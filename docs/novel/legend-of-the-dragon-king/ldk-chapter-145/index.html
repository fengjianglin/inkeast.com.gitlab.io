 <p><span style><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;145 - The Powerful Gu Yue</strong></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>A green tornado gradually whipped up as Gu Yue waved her hands in a mystical rhythm mid-air. Its viciousness increased as numerous &nbsp;icicles flew inside </span></p>
 <p><span style>The youth wielding an ice staff thought he was going to lose his mind. He simply couldn’t figure out what this lady’s martial soul was. If he said that her martial soul was of the ice attribute, then what was with that bright light? And then, what about this current tornado… </span></p>
 <p><span style>As the icicles merged with the tornado, Gu Yue’s aura grew at an insane rate. Even though the youth was a fair distance away from her, he could sense just how crazy this soul skill of hers was. </span><i><span style>It’s a dual attribute soul skill. So powerful! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>His second soul skill receded as his purple soul ring lit up. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s group watched the battle raptly. </span><i><span style>A</span></i><span style> thousand-year soul skill!</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had never witnessed the might of a thousand-year soul skill before. Furthermore, a thousand-year soul skill was already considered high-end in the current era of Soul Masters. As for ten-thousand-year soul rings… Tang Wulin had only ever seen the one Wu Zhangkong had. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Extremely pure ice energy erupted from the peak of the ice staff, slowly coalescing into a spear. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Fury of Ice! A powerful soul skill attack! </span></p>
 <p><span style>The ice spear grew to two meters in length. Faint magic patterns shone in its shaft. The students of class zero could instinctively sense its power just by looking at it. They were certain that none of them could survive a single strike from that spear. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This thousand-year soul skill is so powerful!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s still time for all of you to voluntarily withdraw,” the youth said to Gu Yue. His expression wasn’t as cold as before. In his eyes, the fact that Gu Yue was able to release such powerful elemental waves despite only having two rings made her worthy of praise. Although he had always been prideful, he now felt a bit of pity for her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The corners of Gu Yue’s lips curled. It wasn’t a smile, as only one side of her mouth curled up. It was clearly a derisive smirk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The youth’s eyes dulled with frost as he pointed his staff at Gu Yue once again. The ice spear shot forward in a flash, piercing toward Gu Yue like lightning. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But in that split second, the icicle tornado in front of Gu Yue crumbled apart and she disappeared in a flash of silver. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Space attribute soul skill? Is it that legendary teleportation skill, the godly skill that can evade the lock-on of another soul skill? How can this be!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Countless possibilities flashed through the youth’s mind in a single moment. His Fury of Ice had already flown off into the forest and disappeared. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big brother, what’s that above us?” The young girl beside him suddenly pointed at the sky. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The youth looked up. He stared, dumbstruck, at the sight of brilliant fireworks raining down upon them from the sky. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though his soul power had reached rank 35 and he was the strongest amongst his peers, it still didn’t change the fact that he didn’t have enough time to prepare another thousand-year skill attack which drained so much soul power. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How can this be!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As that last thought ran through his head, he moved to hit the button on the back of the girl’s hand. He couldn’t let his little sister suffer. Immediately afterward, he was baptized in water, fire, earth and wind… </span></p>
 <p><span style>Two lights flickered one after another, then disappeared. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Only, one of them had been sent out by the button, while the other had been destroyed by the four elements. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin muttered, “That guy’s actually decent. He knew to protect the person at his side first.” As he finished muttering, Tang Wulin abruptly felt as if there was something wrong with the atmosphere. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When Gu Yue turned back to her team, she saw Xie Xie, Zhang Yangzi and Wang Jinxi standing there frozen, as if they were statues. Their faces looked even weirder since their emotions were in chaos.. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s wrong with you guys?” Tang Wulin asked, puzzled. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie respectfully bowed to Gu Yue. “Big sister. From now on, you’re my big sister. I won’t ever argue with you again.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Yangzi hastily mimicked Xie Xie’s actions. “Hello, big sister.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Of the three, only Wang Jinxi remained as he was, bashfully staring at Gu Yue with eyes filled with both admiration and fear. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue silently walked over to Tang Wulin’s side and dully said, “What’s so amazing about defeating that arrogant guy? Come on, let’s go.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>As she spoke, the spirit energy that had surrounded the ice staff wielding youth flew over to them like a storm. Of course, the one who absorbed most of it was Gu Yue, followed by Tang Wulin who was standing next to her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The spirit energy released from a Soul Master was no different from the energy received from killing soul beasts. After losing its host, the spirit energy would be absorbed by the closest being to it. On top of that, the closer one was to it, the more one would absorb. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin finally understood why the other three had reacted like that. </span></p>
 <p><span style>That was right! That was a three-ringed Soul Master, and not just any three-ringed Soul Master; it was one with a thousand-year soul ring! That meant he had two spirit souls at the very least. They had seen just how powerful of a Soul Elder he had been when he had instantly killed the Six-armed Fire Snake. Yet, Gu Yue had only needed a few minutes to defeat him! They could only imagine how strong Gu Yue was now that she had two rings… </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s heart began to race as he guessed what Gu Yue’s second soul skill was. Her first soul skill was Elemental Tide, which strengthened her ability to attract elemental energy, but in the previous battle, she had been able to launch numerous low-level attacks as well as a icicle tornado. Using those attacks, she had provoked her opponent to use his thousand-year soul skill, giving her an opening to kill him with a mass of low-level attacks afterward. This level of control was simply too powerful and was definitely impossible to attain with just her spiritual power. If it wasn’t for her second soul skill, then just how had she managed to cover the sky with low-level elemental attacks? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although neither of Gu Yue’s soul skills were directly related to attacking, did she really need them to be? She could control six elements! With this array of elements, she could not only fight in countless styles, but also constantly change her tactics. And then there was her powerful spiritual power… Among the students of class zero, she was undoubtedly worthy of being called the strongest! </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was no wonder that Xie Xie no longer had any dreams of defeating her. How could he even possibly be a worthy opponent for the powerful Gu Yue? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although, Gu Yue had been right. That ice staff wielding youth had been careless and hadn’t even bothered trying to understand her abilities. If he had been more cautious and immediately used his second soul skill to defend, he likely wouldn’t have lost so easily. Furthermore, Gu Yue couldn’t possibly match him in a battle of attrition. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you want to rest for a while?” Tang Wulin asked Gu Yue. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue shook her head. “Let’s go.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Without the protection of the Man-Faced Demon Spider’s webs, it was extremely dangerous for them to stay in place for an extended period of time. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Soul beasts are approaching.” Zhang Yangzi, who was in charge of reconnaissance, urgently informed them. “There are a lot. It seems to be a group of soul beasts, and there are at least thirty of them. They seem to be Blazing Demon Lions.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Horror took over everyone’s faces when they heard his words. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lions were one of the strongest types of soul beasts that lived on land. Generally speaking, the greater a soul beast’s individual strength was, the greater its inclination toward being independent. That way, they would be able to obtain even more resources. Only lion-type soul beasts were unique in this aspect. With a single leader lion as the head of a pride of lionesses, they formed a powerful force regardless of whether they were in the forests or the prairies. Even soul beasts that were far stronger than the head lion wouldn’t dare to provoke the pride lightly. The combined power of the whole pride was simply too fearsome. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Run!” Tang Wulin shouted the order without the slightest hesitation before turning around to flee. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue waved her hands and enveloped them in a green light. Its effects were stronger than before and now they felt as if they were light as feathers, giving them a large boost to their speed. </span></p>
