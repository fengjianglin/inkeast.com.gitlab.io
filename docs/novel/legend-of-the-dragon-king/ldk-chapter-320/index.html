 <p><span style>While the rest of the class filtered out of the room, Tang Wulin’s eyes glimmered with doubt as they settled upon Wu Zhangkong, who had been silent throughout the assembly. However, Wu Zhangkong did not so much as twitch his fingers.</span></p>
 <p><i>What’s going on, Teacher Wu? You haven’t taught us once since we got here.</i></p>
 <p>It didn’t make any sense to Tang Wulin, but he swallowed it up anyway, leaving quietly with Xie Xie and Xu Xiaoyan.</p>
 <p>After stepping foot into the hall, Xie Xie broke into an immediate dash for his dorm He was eager to reflect upon what he had learned today, on the verge of making a breakthrough.</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaoyan was the picture of uncertainty. “Captain, do you think I can thrive at Shrek? Everyone’s so amazing here.”</p>
 <p>Although she had lasted to the end of the competition, it was due in large part to her cleverness. She had hidden herself in Luo Guixing’s team, then later reunited with her true teammates. It was only under their wing that she had lasted so long. As such, she understood well just how weak she was, especially during the day.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin responded with a reassuring smile. “Don’t underestimate yourself. You know, when my martial soul first awakened, it was just bluesilver grass! But I never gave up and moved forward step by step. And now, I’ve come all this way. You can do the same. Besides, your martial soul is an amazing variant. I’m confident once your soul rank is higher, you’ll be able to show off it’s true power. With your battlefield awareness and an improved martial soul, who knows how brightly you can shine?”</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaoyan glowed. “Yeah. You’re right. I have to do my best and become stronger.”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin couldn’t help but laugh. “It’s good to see you don’t lose confidence in yourself that easily.” Her previously troubled expression was nowhere to be found. If her second profession was being an actor, then she’d be the class representative for that no doubt.</p>
 <p>When they arrived at their dorm room, they found Xie Xie already meditating. Tang Wulin joined him without skipping a beat. Lunch was approaching, but he couldn’t let even a second go to waste.</p>
 <p>By lunchtime, the class representatives for the first grade were settled. Gu Yu became the designer representative, holding two positions like Tang Wulin. He found out later from Yang Nianxia that she was a fourth-rank designer. She had never bothered to tell him.</p>
 <p>Numerous people chose to walk the path of a mecha designer, yet she had managed to beat everyone else in their class. It was clear how skilled she was.</p>
 <p>The maker seat went to Luo Guixing, who was at the peak of the third rank. That wasn’t to say he had no competition; Xu Yucheng fought fiercely with him for that position, to the point where Lu Guixing had almost lost.</p>
 <p><span style>Despite what her beauty suggested, Wu Siduo was actually a skilled mechanic. She took the crown of mechanic representative.</span></p>
 <p>Mechanics weren’t to be looked down upon. They had to be well-versed in both the design and making process. It was practically a hybrid profession. Although a mechanic would never reach the pinnacle in both fields, they had to know enough to synthesize the two sides to repair damaged mechas.</p>
 <p>At the sixth rank, mecha mechanics would be skilled enough to repair battle armors. They were talents that took a long time to blossom. Moreover, because fewer people chose to become mechanics, skilled mechanics were in higher demand than skilled designers or makers. The number of people who chose this path was only a step above of blacksmiths. The amount of knowledge required scared most hopefuls away.</p>
 <p>Although all seven representative positions were occupied,there were only four representatives: class president and forging representative Tang Wulin, vice-president and designer representative Gu Yue, vice-president and mechanic representative Wu Siduo, and lastly, maker representative Luo Guixing.</p>
 <p>By chance, Tang Wulin had overheard during lunch the situation was similar in the other grades. Those who had managed to become the president or vice-president were usually superb in their professions, and more often than not, held multiple positions.There had even been a genius who was the designer, maker, and mechanic representative, as well as vice-president. They eventually entered the inner court, so now only the Academy knew the height of their abilities.</p>
 <p>With this matter settled, classes went into full swing.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin forwent stepping foot into the Blacksmith’s Association in the afternoon. He didn’t lack in contribution points for now and he had more than enough to feed himself. His current priority was to improve his cultivation and obtain his third soul ring. And once he accomplished this, he would attempt to spirit refine once more. Improving his soul rank was crucial due to the imbalance between his soul rank and blacksmith rank.</p>
 <p>There were no shortcuts to increasing one’s soul power. All he could do was ceaselessly cultivate and slowly grow.</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaoyan followed his lead and jumped into meditation. She was a step away from breaching rank 30 and obtaining her third soul ring. She trembled with excitement thinking of what new soul skill she would get her hands on, not to mention her second spirit soul.</p>
 <p>However, as they meditated in peace, an uninvited guest appeared at a different corner of the working student dormitory.</p>
 <p>“So I’m gonna live here from now on.” Yue Zhengyu plopped down onto the bed opposite of Yuanen’s.</p>
 <p>Almost immediately, Yuanen scowled. “This is my room! Get out!”</p>
 <p>Yue Zhengyu sneered. “Yours? This is the Academy’s, not yours! The Academy assigned me to this room, so we’re roommates now. We’re both second grade students you know. Or are you afraid I’ll discover your secret?”</p>
 <p>“No. I just really hate you,” Yuanen bit out.</p>
 <p>Yue Zhengyu had just joined the second grade and had already been kicking up a fuss all day in class. If not for his lack of experience, he probably would have challenged the class president for their position. Unfortunately for him, the second grade’s class president was none other than Yuanen, a highly respected working student.</p>
 <p>Yuanen rose and made for the door.</p>
 <p>“Where are you going?”</p>
 <p>“I’m going to request a room change.” Yuanen responded with ice in his voice. “I feel sick at the thought of sharing a room with you. You’re a bad influence on my cultivation.”</p>
 <p>“You! If you think you’re so good, then spar with me.”</p>
 <p>But Yuanen left the room without saying another word.</p>
 <p>Yue Zhengyu let out a silent scream, eyes still glued to the shut door.</p>
 <p><i>That guy!</i></p>
 <p>He had to suppress his desire to battle with Yuanen. Despite his goading, Yuanen refused his sparring requests every single time. He had thought a public provocation in front of the whole class would do the trick, but not once did the cool class president persona let out a crack.</p>
 <p><i>Just how thick is his skin!</i></p>
 <p>But the reality was that Yuanen’s status far surpassed Yue Zhengyu’s imagination. Every one of their classmates had looked at him with disdain as he tried to provoke Yuanen. No one thought him a worthy opponent for their class president.</p>
 <p>Afterward, he was reduced to the status of a pariah..</p>
 <p>That wouldn’t discourage him though. One of the reasons why he had wanted to be a working student was to find the Fallen Angel girl. But after asking around, it became clear to him there was no red-haired girl among the working students.</p>
 <p>With no other paths to explore, he could only go report his findings to the Academy. Yet what he was told was still the same as the first encounter. They told him the Academy would handle it, and as a student, his job was to study instead of chasing fruitless endeavours.</p>
 <p>There was a silver lining to all this, though. Yue Zhengyu had always been taken with the legends of the working students. Now that he was a working student himself, he was even more curious. Even though entering the inner court was a given for him, he wanted to know more about the types of people waving the working students’ banner. Now, he would be able to see for himself.</p>
 <p>As for becoming Yuanen’s roommate, that was truly out of his hands and of the Academy’s doing. They were both second grade students after all.</p>
