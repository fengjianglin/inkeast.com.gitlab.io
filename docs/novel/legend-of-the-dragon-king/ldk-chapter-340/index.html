 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;340 - The Blazing Fire Dragon and the Scarlet Armored Dragon</strong></span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Concerned, Wu Zhangkong followed Zhuo Shi back into the small house, leaving Tang Wulin to his thoughts and their softening footsteps. “Teacher, isn’t this too soon? That’s the first part of the most powerful soul skill you created! Can Wulin learn it as he is now?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t understand,” said Zhuo Shi, waving his hand dismissively in the air. “His draconic bloodline is very pure and noble. It’s at least a grade above mine. Besides being limited to dragon-type martial souls, my self-created soul skill requires an extremely powerful blood essence from the use. I’m only teaching it to him because his bloodline resembles my martial soul. It’s bizzare how his martial soul isn’t dragon related at all despite his powerful draconic bloodline! But that’s not important right now.” He stared Wu Zhangkong straight in the eye. “What matters is that he’s strong enough to start learning my soul skill. It’s just a matter of how much he can comprehend. Dragon Shocks the Heavens is the first of my Divine Dragon’s Nine Moves. If he can understand it, then that means he has talent. If not, his bloodline will ensure no harm to be done..” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuo Shi paused, seeming to remember something. Then he snorted. “Besides, if I don’t teach him anything, that shameless bastard Feng Wuyu is going to snatch him away. I gave him a call yesterday and you wouldn’t believe how arrogant he was, asking me what I’ve done for Wulin. Hmph! We’ll see who’s able to give the most to Wulin soon enough. He’s just a three-word battle armor master right now. He hasn’t even become a Divine Blacksmith yet. Let’s see if he dares fight with me!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong pulled a helpless face. “Teacher, Elder Feng is after Wulin’s forging ability. You don’t have to worry about it.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuo Shi groaned. “Nonsense! Are you saying I don’t understand that old bastard’s character? He’s utterly selfish and does nothing that wouldn’t benefit him! I don’t believe for even a second that he hasn’t taken notice of Wulin’s special bloodline. But Wulin is most suited studying under me. I don’t care if he also has a dragon-type martial soul. It’ll be a pain in the ass if that bastard teaches Wulin as well. So no matter what that bastard says, Wulin is still my granddisciple. Oh, that’s right. Since he accepted Wulin as his disciple, and Wulin is my granddisciple, doesn’t that mean I’m the elder between us?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuo Shi lit up at the thought, any trace of sourness about the situation completely washed away. The sight left Wu Zhangkong gaping </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since the two had entered Shrek Academy, Zhuo Shi and Feng Wuyu strived to one-up the other. Both wielded peak-level dragon-type martial souls, one being the Blazing Fire Dragon and the other the Scarlet Armored Dragon. Consequently, it was &nbsp;natural for them to become rivals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Later on, Feng Wuyu had taken a liking to forging and diverted much of his energy to becoming a blacksmith. His cultivation lagged behind Zhuo Shi’s as a result &nbsp;and he was soon suppressed by his rival’s might. Disgruntled, Feng Wuyu swore to become a Divine Blacksmith and create a four-word battle armor, all in the name of defeating Zhuo Shi. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Regardless of their fame as Shrek’s Holy Twin Dragons, the two rarely came into contact interestingly enough, and despised the rare occasions they did.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Left alone in the front yard, Tang Wulin immersed himself in the memory of Zhuo Shi’s Dragon Shocks the Heavens. Every bit of the move was scorched vividly into his mind, leaving behind an exhilarating motion picture for him to relive. He could even remember the way the blood coursed through Zhuo Shi’s palm, the crimson scales popping from his arm the moment he struck out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He found the circulation of blood essence within his body strange after replicating that action. Little by little, his blood essence moved opposite of its usual direction. Though it felt awkward, he couldn’t shake off his desire to unleash the same might as Zhuo Shi. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I can do it!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Reversed blood flow be damned, Tang Wulin thrust his palm out, feeling his blood essence spiraling into a frenzy, the energy contained within boiling over as it tried to escape. The effect was similar to that of his Golden Dragon Body. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This isn’t just an offensive technique; it’s also a blood essence cultivation method!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>So blood essence can be used like this too. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Before he knew it, his blood essence burst into a rage. He doubled over as though knives had stabbed into his stomach, lost and dizzy, &nbsp;and he had no choice but to stop. But that was not to say he did not grasp an understanding of Dragon Shocks the Heavens, and his hunger skyrocketed as a result. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Half an hour later, Wu Zhangkong understood the frightening meaning of Tang Wulin’s appetite increasing. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin cleared out all the food in Zhuo Shi’s house all by himself. Yet even so, his hunger was not satisfied. He went to pay the dining hall a visit after returning to the outer court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you so late?” Feng Wuyu stood at the dining hall’s entrance, hands clasped behind his back. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good morning, Teacher. Were you waiting for me here?” Tang Wulin asked, astonished. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Wuyu nodded, handing something over to his student. “Take this. It’s a dining hall card. Whatever you buy with it will be charged directly to my account. Now go on. Eat.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The card was black with silver engravings. It weighed a lot for its size as well. In fact it was ten times heavier than a silver card of the same size. What metal it was made of left Tang Wulin guessing. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As his trailing foot left the entranceway, he heard Feng Wuyu shout. “So Zhuo Shi is your grandteacher?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? How’d you know?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Wuyu revealed a mischievous smile. “How could I not? Now hurry on and go eat.” With these words said, he departed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Sparing the new card a final glance, Tang Wulin rushed off &nbsp;into the dining hall. He was about to wage war on the cooks. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s all free! I can eat as much as I want! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Since eating was a cultivation method for him, he had to consume as much nourishing food as possible. Due to not having enough contribution points, he had been restraining himself at meal time the past few days. But not anymore. He gorged himself like a king now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After terrorizing the cafeteria a while longer, Tang Wulin dragged his stomach to class just in the nick of time. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He was too content after his meal, practically radiating an aura of satisfaction as he walked through the lecture theater’s doors. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was hit with the sudden sense of unease. The moment he stepped through the doorway, absolute silence reigned in the classroom and all eyes turned to him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin wiped the satisfied smile off his face and nodded sternly to his classmates. He quickly made his way to his seat. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie elbowed him as he sat down. “What happened with you? Why were you absent the last few days?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin knitted his brows but before he could respond, he felt a thorny gaze digging into his back. He turned around. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Wu Siduo. She glared at him with icy eyes, not masking her dissatisfaction at all. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin nearly had a heart attack when he realized the reason for her glare. Right after they had decided to make battle armor, he went missing for three days. Those three days were absolutely invaluable! He sent her an apologetic smile. He knew his absence had inconvenienced everyone. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Siduo rolled her eyes, looking away from him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With that out of the way, Tang Wulin shot a glance at Luo Guixing, but the young man was all smiles as usual. He couldn’t piece together his groupmate’s true emotions. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s start discussing our battle armor design plans. Everyone has already chosen the metal they want to use,” Gu Yue whispered into his ears. “You need to get to working, Wulin. I have to finalize the design for everyone’s right hand armor soon.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mn. I know. I apologize, I’ve troubled all of you. I’ll forge everyone’s metals today,” Tang Wulin said, almost tripping on his words. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You broke through?” Gu Yue asked in astonishment, voice still low.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin faced her, eyes wide. “You can tell?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue nodded. “Your aura is different from before. It’s clear that you’ve reached a higher level. You have three rings now, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mn.” Tang Wulin answered with a smile. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, Captain! You broke through too?” Although Tang Wulin and Gu Yue had whispered to each other, Xu Xiaoyan still overheard from her seat next to Gu Yue’s. She had a good pair of ears on her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean ‘too’?” Tang Wulin was surprised to find Xu Xiaoyan in such high spirits. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Xiaoyan smirked, waves of satisfaction dancing off her. “I broke through to rank 30 two days ago. I feel great! Tomorrow is rest day, so Big Sis Gu Yue promised to take me to get a new spirit soul.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you want to come with us?” </span></p>
