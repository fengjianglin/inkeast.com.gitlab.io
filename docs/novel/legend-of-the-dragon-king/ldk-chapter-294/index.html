 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;294 - A Turn for the Worse</strong></span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s group shared looks of dismay, their hearts filling with apprehension. In the past, Elder Cai had proclaimed they needed to become battle armor masters before the age of twenty in order to enter the inner court. They finally understood where her outrageous demand had come from: she was the headmaster of the outer court! As such, she had the authority to impose such requirements on them! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Cai wore a mask of indifference. “Shrek Academy has never forced its students to cultivate nor is our education compulsory. There is an annual minor exam and a major one every three years. Failing the minor exam twice will result in expulsion. So, the number of students &nbsp;in each grade will decrease in the next three years. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“For those in the sixth grade who have yet to meet the graduation requirements, I hope you will all work hard and fulfill them before you turn thirty-five. As for our new students, you have the option to relax and take it easy, but then you might not be here in three years. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, Shrek Academy will not hold back in your education. You can ask for guidance from your teacher and make use of the numerous facilities on campus. Naturally, you must exchange contributions points to utilize them. You new students will soon realize the importance of contribution points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now, on the eve of the new academic year, let us celebrate Shrek’s generations of honor and glory, and to many more generations of magnificence. But whether you’ll be part of the glory or left on the sidelines in the future will be up to you.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s it? Isn’t her speech a bit too short? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>And here Tang Wulin had thought the opening ceremony at Eastsea Academy had been brief. It never crossed his mind Shrek Academy’s would make record time!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even so, he learned many new things from Elder Cai’s speech. Shrek Academy’s elimination system lived up to its fame. Anyone who wanted to graduate from Shrek would have to put in blood, sweat, and tears, progressing step by step until the day they stood at the world’s summit. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I have to work hard! </span></i><span style>Tang Wulin subconsciously clenched his fists. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With the ceremony concluded, the teachers in the air split up, each heading to their respective classes. The eyes of Tang Wulin and his friends shimmered when they saw Wu Zhangkong and Shen Yi flying toward them. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So Teacher Wu and Teacher Shen are our teachers… Wait, what? Why is she flying here too? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Their smiles stiffened. Someone they never wanted to interact with again was soaring through the skies in the four’s direction. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Her lips curled into a mocking smile as she locked her eyes on them. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No way… No way. No way! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yet there was nothing they could do to stop her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will be personally managing this year’s new class. Beside me are my assistant teachers, Teacher Shen Yi and Teacher Wu Zhangkong. Now to the classroom.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment these words left Elder Cai’s mouth, Tang Wulin’s eyes went wide, Xie Xie’s jaw dropped, Xu Xiaoyan gasped, and Gu Yue’s lips began to quiver. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wha...</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What is this? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>They had never expected Elder Cai to do such a thing. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just how far will she go to trouble us? How much does she hate us? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After Elder Cai finished speaking, she flew toward the school building, leading the way for the rest of the class. Unknown to Tang Wulin and the others, Elder Cai’s lips curved into a sly smile, her eyes shimmering with satisfaction. </span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a reason she hadn’t lost any sleep over Gu Yue’s rejection. As the headmaster of the outer court, she had them in the palm of her hands from the moment she stopped them from entering the inner court. </span></p>
 <p><span style>That was why she stipulated that they would have to become battle armor masters before the age of twenty just to enter the inner court. Not even Zhuo Shi could go against her words in this case. The division of labor between elders of the Sea God’s Pavilion were clear and absolute, and the the outer court was Elder Cai’s jurisdiction. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Her schemes are cunning and her foresight is deep!” Tang Wulin lamented. Compared to this veteran, they were the most naive of rookies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three teachers landed further ahead, leaving the students to hurry after them. Perhaps Tang Wulin and the others were relegated to the back of the congregation due to their working-student status, even though they had initially been at the front. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The school building felt different from how it did during the exam. Although the four felt depressed from Elder Cai’s presence, because they were now Shrek Academy students and their previous instructor, Wu Zhangkong, would still be teaching them, their situation couldn’t be too bad. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They entered the outer court’s classroom for the first grade, which was on the first floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a lecture theater large enough to hold three hundred people. Elder Cai ascended the platform and stood behind the lectern. On the side, Shen Yi said, “Students, please take your seat according to what I announce. Tang Wulin, row one seat one.” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Row one seat one? I’m the first one called? </span></i><span style>Tang Wulin suppressed his surprise as he scrambled to his seat. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Row one seat one was neither on the left edge, nor the right, but dead center. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Yue, row one, seat two!” This seat was on Tang Wulin’s right. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xie Xie, row one, seat three!” And this was on Tang Wulin’s left. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xu Xiaoyan, row one, seat four!” She sat next to Gu Yue’s other side. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Their seats were the closest to the lectern, no more than five meters apart. They were practically within arm’s reach of the lectern and in full view of whoever stood there. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Each of them pulled odd faces once they took their seats. A dark cloud settled over Xie Xie, and Xu Xiaoyan was pale as a ghost. On the other hand, Gu Yue seemed to handle herself better, maintaining a semblance of calm with only her brows furrowed. They all knew Elder Cai had arranged for them to sit in this spot. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Because they had offended the head instructor before school started, there would be hard days in store for them. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie shot a look at Tang Wulin, as if asking for the next course of action. Tang Wulin gave him a slight nod, acknowledging his concerns but affirming their lack of control over the situation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Apart from waiting to see her plans unfold, there was nothing else they could do. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With rest of the students seated, the lecture theater was only one-third full. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Cai, there should be 101 students in this year’s new class, and I’ve counted 101 students. Everyone is present,” Shen Yi reported. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Cai didn’t pay any mind to Tang Wulin and company, indifferently saying, “I believe you’ve all heard what I said at the opening ceremony, so I won’t be repeating any of that. Here at Shrek Academy, your teachers will show you the door, but it is up to you to step through it. Your success here depends on your own efforts. Well, that’s enough about that. Today you will be familiarizing yourselves with how things are done here. Teacher Shen will explain the rules and education style in a moment. Teacher Shen, if you will.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Cai made to leave immediately after finishing her speech. Before she exited the lecture theater’s doors, however, she flicked a glance at Tang Wulin’s group. </span></p>
 <p><span style>All four of them let out a collective sigh of relief once she left. Without a doubt, it was better for them if she wasn’t present. In fact, it would be best if she wasn’t managing the class of new students. </span></p>
