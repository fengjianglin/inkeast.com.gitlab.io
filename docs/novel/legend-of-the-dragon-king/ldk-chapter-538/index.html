It was a martial soul that integrated both attack and defense into one. However, he had opted for a stranger path. By harnessing the air around him to produce large blasts of fire to propel him, he became an unconventional agility-type.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the synergy of his abilities, he was quicker than even an agility-type one ring level above him. However, he could only display such shocking speed in a straight line.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Relying on her wealth of combat experience, Wu Siduo had judged herself to be in a disadvantage in a direct clash and so she had evaded to the side. Her decision proved correct.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Glancing back to watch Ye Wu swinging back around in a giant circle, power began to fill her as she called forth her martial soul. Might rippled through her muscles as she stood taller than before. Her hair took on streaks of black and white while tufts of hair appeared on her neck. Then her arms swelled thick and solid and her nails grew into claws. Her transformation was complete. This was her White Tiger form!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Wu finished turning around now and was accelerating rapidly toward Wu Siduo. His cheek twitched when he saw her current burly form. What the hell is it with girls these days? Why do they all have such brawny martial souls? Like damn they’re scary!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a white blur, Wu Siduo flicked her arms to the side and readied her claws. She would meet him directly this time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Wu was lightning quick. They two crashed into each other a blink of an eye later.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A boom rumbled through the arena. Flames burst from the collision.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Siduo was sent sliding backward a dozen meters, but she remained standing. On the other hand, Ye Wu’s momentum had been destroyed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a clash between a power-type and an agility-type, the power-type won out. This was why Wu Siduo opted for her White Tiger martial soul. By relying on the White Tiger’s increase to her physical strength, she could easily disrupt an agility-type.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both combatants’ blood was boiling now. They refused to back down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Wu let out a loud grunt and the flames around him danced with life. As the flames transitioned from orange to jade-green, the temperature around him rapidly rose. The air around him shimmered in a heat haze. Even a dozen meters away, Wu Siduo could feel the heat beating on her skin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Siduo’s White Tiger was still immature, incomparable as a second martial soul to Yuanen Yehui’s Fallen Angel. She currently only had three soul rings for it and had yet to find a suitable second spirit soul.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her third soul ring lit up and glittering gold cascaded down her fur while her body swelled with even more strength. Taking a step forward, she suddenly pounced toward Ye Wu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a blur of movement, Ye Wu dashed to the side in a long winding arc. He began madly dashing around the arena in circles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Wu was undoubtedly an oddity among agility-types. He did not rely on deftness, but the force of impact of ultra high speeds. Combined with his Flame Body, he was a crashing meteor each time he struck. Such unconventional combat tactics had allowed him to rise above the masses and claim a spot at Shrek Academy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there were steep disadvantages to this combat style. It was exceptionally hard for him to coordinate with teammates. He had only been able to cultivate the strength to become the strongest agility-type of the third grade through blood and sweat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Wu diverged from the perimeter of the arena and headed straight for Wu Siduo once more. He was a mere streak of fire as he dashed toward her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumbles filled the arena and the two were sent flying backward from their clash.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After rolling a few times on the ground, Wu Siduo bounced back to her feet. Her gaze sharpened as she focused on her opponent. Her blood boiled. His attacks hurt! He’s no ordinary agility-type. Even empowered by White Tiger Diamond Transformation, it was difficult for her to withstand his attacks. Her body was already littered with cuts and bruises.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Similarly to Wu Siduo, Ye Wu had rolled across the ground a few times before getting back on his feet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Relying on the flame elements that wreathed him, he could instantaneously raise the force of his attack’s impact. This was the core of his combat style.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Siduo pondered how to deal with him. Ye Wu was too fast for her to chase after him in her Hell Civet form and she couldn’t continue to endure his attacks in her White Tiger form much longer either. Even with White Tiger Diamond Transformation, the assault of his flames was shaving away at her defenses. It might have been possible for her to overcome him if her White Tiger had four rings, but it didn’t.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had no other choice now. Taking a deep breath in, her eyes began to shine with resolution. She threw out both hands and two beams of light shot out of her ring and onto her hands. An instant later, the lights manifested a pair of white and gold gauntlets. Then another two lights shot out and manifested a pair of pauldrons. She was now equipped with four pieces of battle armor!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two clashed for the third time, winds kicking up around them from the impact.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Wu was the loser this time. He had been moving too quickly to react when he saw Wu Siduo equip battle armor and was sent flying backward. On the other hand, Wu Siduo suffered no damage at all, unmoved from her position.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was finally an opening in Ye Wu’s defenses as he flew through the air. Wu Siduo instantly switched martial souls and pounced upon him. Her battle armor shimmered transparent as she darted forward with Hell Rush! In a flicker of movement, she reached Ye Wu and slashed with her claws!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Off-stage, Song Lin’s eyes went wide with astonishment, then she furrowed her brow and pressed her lips tight together. Just how strong are these first graders? This one already has four pieces of battle armor! And they were made with her twin martial souls in mind! Battle armor for twin martial souls is way harder to make! If she keeps going at this rate, she should just about complete a set of one-word armor by the time she enters the second grade! Impossible!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the audience, Luo Guixing smirked as he glanced at Tang Wulin and Gu Yue.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those pieces of armor were the results of the rankers’ blood and sweat. Although the pieces weren’t made of spirit alloys, they were still designed for twin martial souls. However, the armor was weaker than normal one-word level due to how short on time they had been and how demanding the production process was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After seeing Tang Wulin’s team pull off crafting battle armor with spirit alloys, the rankers had resolved themselves to succeed in crafting battle armor as well. After some discussion, they had decided to pour their efforts into making armor for Wu Siduo, resulting in these four pieces while leaving the rest with one or two each. They had elected her their champion to lead them on the path of catching up to Tang Wulin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the entire first grade, Wu Siduo had the highest rank of soul power of 44. While there was still a gap between her and Ye Wu’s rank 48, it was not insurmountable. Now with the appearance of those four pieces of battle armor, the gap was closed and the tide of battle shifted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just before Wu Siduo struck him down, Ye Wu’s cloak of flames turned from jade to azure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Siduo felt the heat recede, but burning pain struck her the next instant. Her entire body was aflame, and even her spiritual power was being eaten away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then Wu Siduo’s Hell Rush struck. Ye Wu thrust his arms out to defend. Shining blue armor clad his arms. It was battle armor!&nbsp;</span></p>

Ye Wu was in a disadvantage as his posture had yet to recover when Wu Siduo struck. With a spurt of strength, Wu Siduo’s tide won over and she sent Ye Wu flying backward once more.&nbsp;</span></p>

The azure flames burst to life on his body and he propelled himself further backward in retreat, cutting off Wu Siduo’s opportunity to finish the battle.</span></p>

Gauntlets, pauldrons, cuisses, and greaves. Eight pieces of battle armor in total. Although he didn’t have a chestplate to connect them all, he still had twice as much armor as Wu Siduo. This was his true strength and the advantage of time the third grade had over the first. With his armor equipped, he was twice as fast as before and his flames blazed with unrelenting might.</span></p>

She had no hopes of defending with any soul skills from either of her martial souls. As expected of a senior in the third grade! &nbsp;But even so, she did not back down. Her eyes shone with determination.</span></p>

In their wake, a tribal pattern began to glow on her body. This was the prelude to her soul fusion skill, Hell White Tiger!&nbsp;</span></p>

The instant it appeared, the space around it began to warp.&nbsp;</span></p>
