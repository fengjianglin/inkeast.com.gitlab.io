 <p><span style><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;114 -&nbsp;Monstrous Numbers</strong></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>The final one to take the test was Gu Yue. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A thought suddenly struck Zhang Yangzi. </span><i><span style>Does the order Teacher Wu arranged us in mean anything? Aside from Xie Xie in the beginning, the spiritual power ratings have only been increasing high afterward. Spiritual power is also essential to Gu Yue… Could it be? Has she also broken through to the Spirit Connection realm? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>His question didn’t go unanswered for long as the testing machine gave him the results shortly after. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue’s spiritual power flew past the white line and into the yellow zone. Zhang Yangzi and Wang Jinxi gawked as the number broke through 100 points in the blink of an eye, and even then it was still skyrocketing! Their jaws dropped in shock! </span></p>
 <p><span style>The final number displayed on the machine was 153. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How, how can she be this amazing!? Even if we disregard Eastsea City, I don’t think there is a single Soul Master on the entire continent that is this young yet has such high level spiritual power! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A human’s spiritual power would grow as their body matured, increasing all the way until they reached forty years of age. After the age of forty, however, an ordinary person’s body would begin to deteriorate, but Soul Masters could continue increasing their spiritual power until they were sixty years old. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue was only nine years old, the exact same age as the rest of them, yet her spiritual power was actually in the Spirit Connection realm with over 150 points! With her talent, wouldn’t she break through to the Spirit Sea realm by the time she graduated from the intermediate division!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the Spirit Sea realm, the spirit was as vast as the sea and one’s spiritual power could be considered to have finally attained a high enough level to be considered the foundation for an expert. The ones who stood at the pinnacle of both Mecha Masters or Soul Masters would need to have at least reached the Spirit Sea realm. At this level, one would be able to support five yellow spirit souls or three purple spirit souls. In fact, one could even support a single black spirit soul! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Apart from the effects on spiritual power, the Spirit Sea realm could also help a Soul Master cultivate to six or seven rings. Thus, to become a powerful Soul Master, it was necessary to reach Spirit Sea. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Silence. The room was enveloped in silence. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong seemed to have expected this result as after Gu Yue left the machine, he casually said, “Next is the strength test.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The order for the strength test was also very peculiar. The first one up was Gu Yue. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Similar to when she tested her powerful spiritual power, Gu Yue’s strength once again blinded everyone. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The strength test simply measured the power of one’s punch, and it didn’t measure anything like carrying capacity or how much stress their bodies could undergo. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, only attack power held any meaning to Soul Masters. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang! </span></i><span style>Left fist, 115 kilograms.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>D, damn! </span></i><span style>Zhang Yangzi nearly fell flat on his butt. </span><i><span style>Isn’t, isn’t she an elementalist Soul Master? Isn’t she just nine years old? How can she have 115 kilograms of strength? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie’s reaction was identical to his. In fact, he was even trembling a little bit. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As Gu Yue turned her head, she shot a cold glance at Xie Xie, her eyebrows slightly raised. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie swallowed a mouthful of saliva and quickly averted his gaze. This was his first time finding out that Gu Yue’s strength was actually so frightening! &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang!</span></i><span style> Right fist, 143 kilograms. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Yangzi and Xie Xie practically had tears streaming down their cheeks now. </span><i><span style>Can’t she give us just a little bit of face? Is she even a girl? Isn’t she actually a female T-Rex!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A trace of surprise flashed through Wu Zhangkong’s eyes as he announced, “Next, Zhang Yangzi.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang! </span></i><span style>Left fist, 61 kilograms.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang! </span></i><span style>Right fist, 69 kilograms. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He was able to attain these results because in addition to his speed, he was also a two ringed Soul Grandmaster, making his body much stronger than an ordinary person’s. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Yangzi originally hadn’t thought his strength to be subpar because after all, he mainly relied on his special attribute. Yet, when he compared his power with someone else’s, and that person was one who was similar as they relied on controlling the elements, he nearly wanted to weep. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xie Xie!” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang! </span></i><span style>Left fist, 153 kilograms.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang!</span></i><span style> Right fist, 164 kilograms. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie wiped away his sweat as he relaxed and let out a deep breath. At the very least, he was physically a bit stronger than Gu Yue. Although he was an Agility System Soul Master, the nourishing effect his twin martial souls had on his body couldn’t be overlooked. Thus, despite being suited for nimbleness, his body was still fairly strong, which was also the reason why Wei Xiaofeng had suffered at his hands during the Class Promotion Tournament. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wang Jinxi!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The slim-figured Wang Jinxi walked up to the strength testing machine. He inhaled deeply, mulling over what his results would be. Subconsciously, his gaze began to drift toward Tang Wulin, who was watching the machine for the results.. </span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a thought suddenly appeared in Wang Jinxi’s heart. </span><i><span style>Just how large is the gap between our strengths? </span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang! </span></i><span style>Left fist, 423 kilograms.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang!</span></i><span style> Right fist, 468 kilograms. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Terrifying numbers appeared. These numbers exceeded those of ordinary Assault System Soul Masters by far. In fact, it was comparable to a pure Power System Soul Master’s. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The total strength of his two arms already approached one thousand kilograms. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good!” Zhang Yangzi loudly proclaimed as if to vent the gloom he felt within his heart. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Jinxi was fairly satisfied with this result. Even though his arms had recently been broken, his strength had still increased, so this result was considered to be pretty good. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tang Wulin.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong observed Tang Wulin with a steady gaze. Naturally, he had also arranged the students in this test according to his estimates, from lowest to highest. It was just that Gu Yue’s strength had been outside of his expectations. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin walked over to the strength test machine with bright eyes and an intense desire to know just what level his power had reached after absorbing the essence of the first seal. </span></p>
 <p><span style>His hands subconsciously clenched into a tight fist, popping sounds emitting from his entire skeleton. The aura of the Golden Dragon King appeared, causing a slight change in Wang Jinxi’s expression. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He hadn’t even made a move yet, but his oppressive aura already differentiated him from the previous students. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Yangzi’s muscles began to twitch as he thought to himself, </span><i><span style>It won’t be that high. It won’t be that high. It won’t be that high…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang!</span></i><span style> Left fist, 1156 kilograms.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang! </span></i><span style>Right fist, 1348 kilograms. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A rumble resounded throughout the room, stunning the other four students. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though they knew Tang Wulin was very strong, they had never expected him to be </span><i><span style>this</span></i><span style> strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Wang Jinxi, who simply burst with power, was only barely able to match up to a third of Tang Wulin’s strength. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Jinxi quickly recovered from his shock because he already had a rough estimate of the gap between the two of them from the Class Promotion Tournament match after Tang Wulin had knocked him back a few steps. He had been able to do this despite the fact that Wang Jinxi had released his martial soul together with his strength increasing soul skills. Moreover, Tang Wulin’s martial soul was Bluesilver Grass; would it be able to increase his strength at all? </span><span style>Simply put, Wang Jinxi hadn’t expected the gap to be this large. He had thought Tang Wulin would only be twice as strong, not three times. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is… Is he even a human?” Zhang Yangzi muttered in shock. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong didn’t let Tang Wulin return, rather, he coldly instructed, “Once more with your right hand covered in the scales.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh.” Tang Wulin raised his right arm as a golden light appeared, covering his arm with a layer of golden scales. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As the Golden Dragon King’s oppressive aura emerged, Wang Jinxi subconsciously retreated back a step as his martial soul began to tremble &nbsp;in fear, and perhaps even submission toward Tang Wulin. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang! </span></i><span style>2,700 kilograms. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Numbness. Zhang Yangzi’s entire body was numb now. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone else would already be impressed when the total strength of two arms was over one thousand kilograms. Yet, for this guy, one arm already had over two thousand kilograms of strength! </span></p>
 <p><span style>When this number appeared, everyone, including Tang Wulin, was fired up. This number was truly too monstrous! </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No wonder my Heavy Silver hammers feel so light now, especially my right hammer. So my strength has reached this level now, huh? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Test your dragon claw now,” Wu Zhangkong said with a wooden expression. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh!” Tang Wulin wanted to try it too. After raising his right fist, however, he lowered it and asked Wu Zhangkong, “Teacher Wu, if I break the machine, do I need to pay for it?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong wrinkled his brows. “No. This machine can bear up to five thousand kilograms of strength. Even if you somehow manage to break it, you won’t need to pay.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>A golden light quietly filled Tang Wulin’s eyes, turning his pupils into slits while a tyrannical aura burst forth from his body. </span></p>
