 <p><span style>Mang Tian was shocked at Mu Chen’s words. “Isn’t that too quick? Saint rank by thirty?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen revealed a wry smile. “You know what they say; the sooner the better. The important thing is that people have the most energy in their youth, and if they don’t take advantage of that time to accomplish something, both the body and mind will begin to decline. My plans for him might seem hasty, but don’t forget, he’s only nine years old. He still has 21 years until he reaches thirty. If he can’t do it in 21 years, then I fear it will be near impossible for him to ever reach that level. Wulin, what level is your spiritual power right now?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin answered, “I just tested it today and it’s 66 points.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Spirit Connection realm?” Mu Chen and Mang Tian exclaimed in unison, eyes sparkling with anticipation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Nine years old and already at Spirit Connection. Just what did this mean? The two of them couldn’t even comprehend it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen blurted out, “No wonder your perception in forging is so great. It’s because of your immense spiritual power. This is great; I don’t have to worry anymore about whether you can fuse with another spirit soul or not. Now you just need to put all of your effort toward cultivating your soul power. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin said, “I am certain I can earn enough money through forging to buy my own cultivation resources, so long as the association can help me find the items I’m looking for when the time comes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His confidence came from the fact that his income was increasing and that he would soon become a fourth rank blacksmith. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This was considering the fact that he still had to balance this with his studies. If he solely focused on forging, then he could support a prosperous family with his output and success rate. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen wasn’t anxious to guide Tang Wulin on how to practice forging yet. Instead, he simply arranged a time for when Tang Wulin would come to the association next. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mang Tian and Mu Chen let Tang Wulin return to the academy first while the two of them stayed behind to discuss some matters. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After handing in his task and receiving his reward, Tang Wulin left the Blacksmith’s Association. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s mood was great. After all, President Mu Chen was a Saint Blacksmith! With him as a second teacher, Tang Wulin wouldn’t take any detours on the path of forging and would also have the association’s resources at his disposal. Those four thousand year spirit items wouldn’t be that hard to find anymore, as he would be able to obtain them as long as he had enough money. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He would forge and cultivate with all of his effort and break the second seal by the time he turned fifteen. This was Tang Wulin’s goal. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He clearly remembered what Old Tang had told him: there would be a nice surprise for him after breaking the second seal. But just what was this nice surprise? </span></p>
 <p><span style>The golden scales and dragon claw he had obtained after breaking the first seal had already greatly boosted his power and enabled him to barely enter the class of geniuses, class zero. Wouldn’t he be on the same level as those geniuses after breaking the second seal then? The only issue remaining was his low soul power. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he was on the verge of breaking through to rank 14, Tang Wulin could feel the effects of the Golden Dragon King’s soul fragment disappearing. In other words, he couldn’t continue as he had before as his soul power continued to increase naturally. In the end, cultivation was an endless process! The Golden Dragon King’s soul had mutated his Bluesilver Grass and made it much more powerful, but it didn’t increase his cultivation speed at all. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin pondered over his future cultivation path as he left the Blacksmith’s Association</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey!” A voice called out to Tang Wulin, rousing his from his contemplations. When he turned around, he was met with the sight of Mu Xi standing in the doorway. She stared at him with a complex expression. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello senior sister.” Tang Wulin was surprised to see her. He didn’t have any good impressions of Mu Xi after she displayed her bossy attitude in front of him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Xi said, “You’ve taken my dad on as your master, so you should call me senior disciple sister in the future.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello senior disciple sister.” Tang Wulin greeted her in a docile manner. </span><i><span style>That’s right! She really is my senior disciple sister now.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re going back to the academy now?” Mu Xi asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“En.” Tang Wulin nodded. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Xi said, “Then let’s go.” She took the lead to walk ahead. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin hurriedly caught up to her and began to awkwardly scratch his head. He really didn’t understand why Mu Xi wanted to walk with him back to the academy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what do you think of Heavy Silver?” Mu Xi asked. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A discussion about forging?</span></i><span style> Tang Wulin’s interest was piqued. Although Mu Xi’s blacksmith rank wasn’t as high as Tang Wulin’s, she had been learning how to forge from Mu Chen all her life. Her views were definitely much broader than his own. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heavy Silver is very dense, but its internal structure is actually granular. I am able to sense these granules transforming during the Thousand Refinements so I continuously try to pound them to decrease the gaps between the granules. Once the gaps are small enough, my Thousand Refinements is basically complete. I think Heavy Silver is actually very much suited for the Thousand Refinements because I can sense their joy during the process. They tell me just how much strength I need to use to make them the most comfortable. Like this, my Thousand Refinements require half the work with twice the effect.” Tang Wulin spoke without the slightest hesitation of his experiences with Heavy Silver. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“The metal speaks to you?” Mu Xi was amazed by what Tang Wulin had said. This was because Mu Chen had spoken to her of the very same thing when she was a child. </span></p>
 <p><span style>At that time, she had asked her father how she should forge and in response, Mu Chen told her that the metal would tell her how.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Mu Xi was prideful, she couldn’t help but submit to Tang Wulin at this moment. </span><i><span style>He actually experienced it himself! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Thousand Refinements was when one understood the thoughts of the metal. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They walked the rest of the way in silence. Tang Wulin didn’t mind the silence at all, he was just cheerfully thinking about his own matters. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like this, the two of them maintained a serene silence until they reached Eastsea Academy. </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>☀</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The sky was now blanketed in darkness. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As he walked toward the dormitory entrance, he saw someone sitting on the stairs leading to the door. Mu Xi was still lost in thought and didn’t notice this person as she continued walking forward. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior disciple sister, be careful.” Tang Wulin hastily pulled her back, preventing her from colliding with that person. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Xi only felt a powerful pulling force on her hand so she instinctively began to struggle. Yet the hand that held her’s was simply too strong and didn’t move a single inch. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So powerful. He really does have innate divine strength. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The person sitting on the stairs finally lifted his head to look at Tang Wulin. “You’re finally back.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, it’s you.” Tang Wulin looked at him with mild surprise. The person sitting on the stairs was his classmate and the Bone Dragon King Soul Master, Wang Jinxi. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Jinxi’s expression was haggard, but his eyes were sparkling. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can let go now.” Mu Xi’s cold voice interjected. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry.” Tang Wulin quickly let go of Mu Xi’s hand. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, Little Xi. You know each other!?” At that moment, a pleasant voice came from behind. Tang Wulin turned around, his eyes shining. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A white-robed Ouyang Zixin stood there daintily. Under the focus of the dormitory’s soul lights, her figure shown even further, making her seem even more beautiful. Her slender and straight legs created the appearance of a tall beauty who was brimming with the vigor of youth. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fifth grade’s class one? They should be classmates. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Zixin? What are you doing here?” Mu Xi brightened upon seeing her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ouyang Zixin walked over to Mu Xi’s side and hooked arms, quietly whispering a few sentences into Mu Xi’s ear. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Xi blushed slightly. “Go then. Let’s go now.” She began dragging Ouyang Zixin into the dormitory the moment she finished speaking. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ouyang Zixin smiled at Tang Wulin and waved him goodbye. As he watched the two of them leave, he couldn’t help but recall Xie Xie’s words. </span></p>
 <p><span style>‘</span><i><span style>There is a senior sister in the hearts of all youngsters.’</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is she the senior sister in my heart? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A cold shiver overcame his body. </span><i><span style>What am I thinking? But… she really is so pretty! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Jinxi had already gotten up and now stood in front of Tang Wulin. “There’s something I want to talk to you about. Are you free right now?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin helplessly said, “You’ve been waiting here so long already, so how can I refuse? Let’s go then. Do you want to go to my place or yours?” </span></p>
