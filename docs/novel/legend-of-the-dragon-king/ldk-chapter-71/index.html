 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter 71 – Hammer Practice</strong></span></p>
 <p>When Gu Yue was mentioned, Xie Xie couldn’t help but sigh. This week, he had competed against Gu Yue more than once or twice. Although he could hardly accept it, he had to admit that he couldn’t defeat Gu Yue at his current level. Gu Yue’s control of the six elements simply involved too many permutations – there was barely any patterns or rhythms behind them. Adding on to that, the amplification effect of her first soul skill, Elemental Tide made it so that even in a battle of soul power attrition, he still couldn’t match Gue Yue.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin called out, “Hey, it’s getting late; we should all start our meditation. I have to meet with teacher tomorrow, so I won’t be attending school.”</p>
 <p>The Intermediate Academy had a break once every week, and students were allowed to do whatever they liked during this period of time. Tang Wulin hadn’t had the time to complete his task of forging the Sky Dragon Iron and felt anxious about it. Mang Tian’s arrival came as a coincidence – &nbsp;he was there to complete his tasks too.</p>
 <p>The next morning. Tang Wulin headed out of the academy after breakfast, rushing towards Mang Tian’s forging workshop.</p>
 <p><i>Ding Ding Dang Dang.</i> Loud sounds could be heard from the forging workshop, although Tang Wulin hadn’t gone in yet.</p>
 <p>“Teacher!” Tang Wulin used his keys to open the door and entered the forging workshop. He found a rather busy Mang Tian.</p>
 <p>Mang Tian looked towards him. “En. You’re quite spirited. It seems that you have been earnestly cultivating.”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin scratched his head uneasily. “But, blacksmithing…”</p>
 <p>Mang Tian waved his hands. “You can already perform the Thousand Refinements. That’s already as good as being promoted to a different stage. Such a thing cannot be improved purely through practice. With regards to your current age, practicing harder to increase your soul power is still the most important. Thus, there was no fault in your actions. But from now on, come here every weekend. Okay, go and change your clothes. I’ll help you familiarise yourself on the use of the Thousand Refined Heavy Silver Hammers. You can complete your task later in the afternoon.”</p>
 <p>Mang Tian couldn’t bring himself to maintain a cool disposition towards his disciple. When he tried getting his disciple’s contact number from Grandmaster Cen Yue, he was pestered endlessly by Cen Yue for a long period of time. Even the President had taken the initiative to personally approach him for it.</p>
 <p>Despite Eastsea City’s low standing within the whole of the continent, Mu Chen was still one of the ten great Saint Craftsmen on the continent. Such status wasn’t only within the world of blacksmithing. He was a prestigious character throughout the continent. If not for his wife being a citizen of Eastsea City, he wouldn’t have come here.</p>
 <p>Yesterday, Mu Chen had suggested that if Tang Wulin had questions about anything in his studies, he would gladly help him. How could this not surprise and delight&nbsp;Mang Tian?</p>
 <p>However, it seemed to him that his own teachings for Tang Wulin was sufficient. He had his own selfish thoughts as well. If he were to pass Tang Wulin to Mu Chen now, who would be considered his actual teacher in the future?</p>
 <p>This was why Mang Tian didn’t give Tang Wulin the opportunity to display the entirety of his abilities with the Thousand Refinements and directly proceed to third rank craftsman.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin’s talent in blacksmithing wasn’t simply based on his innate divine strength. Though it was rare to have innate divine strength, it was still possible. However, the real ability needed to rise up and become a top notch blacksmith wasn’t simply based on that.</p>
 <p>The higher the rank of a blacksmith, the greater the importance placed on one’s comprehension and soul power needed to be. When they reached the later stages, it would be impossible to achieve a breakthrough without sufficient soul power – Mang Tian was one such example. If not for that requirement, he would’ve been confident enough to reach the Saint Craftsman rank.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin’s inborn power compensated for his insufficient soul power. More importantly, this child had a superhuman level of comprehension. He had the ability to enter a state of extreme focus during every forging session. Especially so when he performed the Thousand Refinements. This was where he was able to understand the life stored within the metal.</p>
 <p>Mang Tian remembered the past. It was only when he became a fourth rank blacksmith that he’d managed to occasionally enter that state..</p>
 <p>Having said that, Tang Wulin was talented in many aspects of blacksmithing. With his diligence and determination, Tang Wulin hadn’t slacked within these three years, and this had laid a solid foundation for himself. This obedient child – Mang Tian was not willing to send him off to others.</p>
 <p>Mang Tian had the intention of cultivating Tang Wulin to the Master Craftsman Rank before allowing him to reveal his full ability. Until then, Mang Tian vowed he would not let his disciple be snatched by anymore.</p>
 <p>After changing his clothes, Tang Wulin started his forging practice on a normal piece of metal with his Thousand Refined Heavy Silver Hammers.</p>
 <p>When he started, there was a little fuss due to the Stacked Hammers effect. These hammers, however, were forged via his blood sacrifice! After practicing with these hammers, he had worked to a state where his being synchronized with his hammers.</p>
 <p>Though similarly Thousand Refined, if one were to describe him and the tungsten hammers as two hearts that beat as one, then these Heavy Silver hammers that were forged using blood sacrifice had created a connection between his heart and soul. This feeling was weird, as it was both soothing and unforgettable.</p>
 <p>When he was immersed in such a stage, the use of the Thousand Refined Heavy Silver Hammers wouldn’t be a problem at all.</p>
 <p>When Mang Tian observed closely, the strikes of his disciple were quite simple. He watched &nbsp;as Tang Wulin worked in a state of deep concentration, with his eyes aglow as they seemed to reflect the sparks shooting from the Heavy Silver Hammers. Mang Tian couldn’t help it as a deep sigh escaped him. After completing the Thousand Refinements, this child’s brilliance is finally showing itself.</p>
 <p>All the way until dusk, Tang Wulin skillfully forged the Sky Dragon Iron with his Thousand Refined Heavy Silver Hammers. It’s completion marked the end of this day’s practice.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go! I’ll accompany you to the Blacksmith’s Association to submit your task. Then you can receive your second task. You can complete it during your break next week, and then have it delivered,” Mang Tian told him.</p>
 <p>“Yes!” Tang Wulin replied quickly.</p>
 <p>Mang Tian silently thought that with the presence of a week’s buffer time, nobody would suspect Tang Wulin’s true forging abilities.</p>
 <p>The Blacksmith’s Association was far busier during the evening than it was during the day. Mang Tian brought Tang Wulin straight up to the second floor to deliver his task and for the Association’s specialist to check on the task item prior to giving Tang Wulin his remuneration.</p>
 <p>20,000 federation coins. This was the first time Tang Wulin had received such a large amount and he passed the coins to Mang Tian. “Teacher, for you.”</p>
 <p>Mang Tian shook his head. “After reaching the second rank, and from a certain point-of-view, you’ve already finished your apprenticeship. This is rightfully yours.”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin answered, “But I’ve used your forging workshop!”</p>
 <p>Mang Tian’s face revealed a smile. “Do you think I mind that? Also, when your parents went away on their business trip, they informed me that you don’t have to call home.”</p>
 <p>“Oh. Okay.”</p>
 <p>Although Tang Wulin knew he was far from his aim, there was still a jubilant feeling within his heart with the gain of these 20,000 federation coins. Hard work brings wealth and glory. This money was earned solely through his hard work.</p>
 <p>After collecting another second rank task, he left the Association with Mang Tian.</p>
 <p>“Teacher, I’ll treat you to a meal.” Tang Wulin jumped forth with this suggestion.</p>
 <p>Mang Tian shook his head. “You can have your meal back at the Academy. Teacher has some other matters. You should remember to head to your teacher’s place weekly to smith. Every month, you have to produce a few Thousand Refined products. Teacher will leave some materials for you at the workshop. Those Thousand Refined products will be the fee for using my forging workshop.”</p>
 <p>“Yes!” Tang Wulin answered without any hesitation.</p>
