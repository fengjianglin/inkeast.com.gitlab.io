 <p><i><span style>How mystical! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Though he couldn’t feel a change in his spiritual power, there was an apparent change in the clarity of his eyesight. </span><i><span style>This really is an extraordinary eye cultivation method! It really deserves to be one of the Tang Sect’s secret methods. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The purple qi disappeared as quickly as it came. It truly was an ephemeral existence. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong had stood behind Tang Wulin, patiently guiding Tang Wulin’s soul power according to the Purple Demon Eyes method til the end. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The horizon shone with a halo of light as the sun vanquished the darkness with its slow ascension to its zenith. With dawn’s brief moment of twilight gone, Wu Zhangkong removed his hands and let Tang Wulin absorb the secrets of the method completely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Done. From now on draw the purple qi into your eyes every morning and immediately cultivate for half an hour. Cultivating the Purple Demon Eyes will take time and constant practice to reach a high level. You will progress rapidly in the beginning, but it will soon be difficult to improve and you will eventually stagnate. How do you feel now?” Wu Zhangkong said. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin nodded and said, “I feel warm and comfortable. I can see in greater detail than before now that my vision is clearer. The colors are more vibrant too.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong eyes glazed over. “You really feel like that? You’re not exaggerating?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin shook his head. “Nope! It really feels like that. Thank you, Teacher Wu.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>An unknown emotion clouded Wu Zhangkong’s mind. He distinctly remembered that when he had first begun cultivating the Purple Demon Eyes, it had taken him half a month to reach that stage. </span><i><span style>Could this child be compatible with the Purple Demon Eyes? This is the first time he’s cultivated it yet he has already progressed so much? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Peering into the depths of Tang Wulin’s large, bright eyes, Wu Zhangkong could only nod. “Continue practicing. If you have any questions, you can ask me. Let’s go down now.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The two quickly washed up and ate breakfast. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately for Tang Wulin, the inn they stayed at provided buffet-style breakfast. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Even a child as cute as Tang Wulin was unwelcomed once the inn discovered his unparalleled eating prowess. This was a commonly heard tale of Tang Wulin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher Wu, what are we doing today?” Tang Wulin asked with youthful curiosity. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong answered, “You’re staying in the room to cultivate the Purple Demon Eyes method today. This method is still beneficial to your spiritual power even without purple qi to enhance your eyesight.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh. Okay.” Tang Wulin deflated. He had wanted to go out and see the city with Wu Zhangkong but was tasked with cultivating inside the room. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin never imagined that this continued for half a month. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Every day in the early morning Wu Zhangkong would observe him cultivate the Purple Demon Eyes, provide guidance when necessary, then head out alone to take care of some unknown matters. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Where was the relaxation mentioned? </span></i><span style>Tang Wulin was immersed in gloom and boredom. Although he had a relatively steady temper, he was still a child. Coming to such a magnificent city yet unable to explore it at all, it was no wonder he was dejected. </span></p>
 <p><span style>To make things worse, Wu Zhangkong had forbidden him from meditating. He was to focus on practicing the Purple Demon Eyes method to increase his spiritual power. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Such a monotonous life truly was dull. Fortunately, the improvements were more than enough to motivate Tang Wulin onwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed that not only was he exceptionally compatible with the Purple Demon Eyes, it was the same for the Mysterious Heaven Method. He had made significant and smooth progress in both of these two Tang Sect methods.His cultivation of the Mysterious Heaven Method had stabilized; while his speed was not considered fast, it was greater than before. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s most prominent discovery though was that could condense his soul power with the Mysterious Heaven Method. As such, despite not increasing its volume, his soul power had become incredibly dense. He had immersed himself into condensing his soul power after Wu Zhangkong told him that the greater degree of purity and density his soul power was, the further he would reach in the future. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s cultivation of the Purple Demon Eyes was extremely quick. He reached the first realm of the Purple Demon Eyes that Wu Zhangkong had mentioned in half a month. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The world seemed to slow and become crystal clear in the wake of him circulating soul power according to the Purple Demon Eyes method. The smallest of details and changes were all observed by him in this state. </span></p>
 <p><span style>For instance, every speck of dust was clearly outlined under the gentle gaze of the sun; he could even discern the faint veins of distant leaves. Without such spectacular results, Tang Wulin would have found it too dull to persevere. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Today was their fifteenth day in Heaven Dou City yet Wu Zhangkong had only brought him around town on the first day. He had been cooped up in their room cultivating for the other days. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After cultivating the Purple Demon Eyes and eating breakfast, Wu Zhangkong finally spoke the words Tang Wulin had been yearning to hear. “Let’s go, you’re coming with me today.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay! Teacher Wu, where are we going?” Tang Wulin was jumping with joy at the long-awaited chance to go out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong turned around and said to him, “Did you feel that cultivating was very dull these last 14 days?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Though Tang Wulin was taken aback for a moment, he quickly regained himself. He spoke truthfully, “In the beginning, it was like that, but it got better as I continued. I like being able to see many things I couldn’t before with the Purple Demon Eyes.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Nodding, Wu Zhangkong reminded him, “Remember, cultivating is not for the sake of harming others but to have the strength to protect your loved ones. Strength is the basis for everything. The efforts you put in now are all to prevent any future tragedies.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin wasn’t mature enough to comprehend Wu Zhangkong’s words completely, but within Wu Zhangkong’s eyes were the same emotions he had in the cemetery. Tang Wulin carved those words into his heart. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go.” Wu Zhangkong walked away, leaving Tang Wulin to catch up. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like before, they walked on foot; this time though, they weren’t heading for the suburbs. No, this time, they headed straight for the core of the city. Tang Wulin didn’t mind walking at all; in fact, Tang Wulin was fond of it as it gave him the chance to look around. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Heaven Dou City truly was a city filled with beauty. Whether it be its historical sites, breathtaking scenery, or culture, it had it all. The lesser soul cars compared to Eastsea City changed the mood of the city.There was a qualitative difference between Eastsea City and Heaven Dou City, the two incomparable. Heaven Dou City, however, was far less industrialized than Eastsea City. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Two hours on foot later, the two arrived at their destination: an antiquated garden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The garden was surrounded by tall, mottley walls and a vermillion door. There were no signs or markings to name this aged garden. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong briskly strode over to the door and pressed his right hand on it with practiced movements without any regard to its outward appearance. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This… Isn’t this the same action Teacher Wu did when we were at the Dazzling Era Tang Sect? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A faint light swept over his body and beeped once before the door opened. Wu Zhangkong lead the way in. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The vermillion doors silently closed behind them. Inside was a space that was untouched by time and without any signs of soul technology. It possessed an aura so pristine that it was almost as if they were back in the ancient era. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve brought him?” A deep voice penetrated the silence before an elderly man walked out from the only building present in the garden. The old man’s short height emphasized how fat he was. Coupled his bald head, he looked almost like a mountain of meat. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong actually let his usual arrogance go and bowed in greeting to this old man. “Branchmaster Zhao.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come on in.” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is this really a Tang Sect branch? </span></i><span style>Tang Wulin wondered. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin was awed beyond comparison the moment he entered the building. Two rows of towering sculptures lined each side, exuding a majestic air. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The building appeared to be a single-story building that was no taller than five meters from its exterior but he was shaken to discover that once he was inside, the ceiling was well over thirty meters tall and the interior larger! The sculptures loomed over him at a height of more than ten meters. </span></p>
 <p><span style>These sculptures were of both men and women, all appearing to be in their twenties and were displayed with an assortment of martial souls. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin suddenly found a familiar figure among the sculptures. The third sculpture on his left was a smiling sweetly young lady with a delicate figure. In her left hand was a three-legged cauldron while in her right was a flute. </span></p>
