 <p><strong><u>Chapter 590 - Green Skull Renegades</u></strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pilot of this black-grade mecha was Feng Linwan, a famous member of the Green Skull Renegades. At the young age of twenty-seven, he was already a Soul Emperor and one of the Renegades’ rising stars destined to become a divine-grade mecha pilot.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since the tender age of three, he had loved mechas and dreamed of becoming Star Luo’s greatest mecha pilot, always yearning to be near one of these great embodiments of modern technology. His every action was for the sake of this goal. By the time he was &nbsp;twenty-seven, &nbsp;he had defeated many of his rivals in the Green Skull Renegades, eventually obtaining his own black-grade mecha. And he had rejoiced the moment he received it and loved it dearly. So much so, in fact, that he once slept for three whole days in it. If truth be told, that wasn’t a rare thing for him to do.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A mecha was an extension of the body in Feng Linwan’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For the sake of becoming an ace mecha pilot, he had fervently cultivated since the day he awakened and spared no effort in improving his pilot skills, opting to even ignore any secondary profession. To him, those were only distractions. All he needed in his life were mechas.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although battle armors were powerful, Feng Linwan didn’t believe the power of an individual could overcome that of science. As mecha technology progressed, he was certain that mechas would one day surpass battle armor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The operation this time had been planned long in advance. They were to strike the train with overwhelming military force and take out the most powerful people in the Douluo delegation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the watchful eye of the powerful Star Luo Empire, the Green Skull Renegades could barely continue to survive. For the sake of more breathing room, they needed an external force to intervene and draw away the Empire’s attention. The delegation from Douluo was perfect for this purpose. As such, the goal of this operation was to eliminate the entire delegation, causing a rift between the two continents’ governments.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their surprise attack had been kept under lock and key. Before they commenced, a communications blockade was imposed on every participant. In fact, most of them hadn’t been privy to the operation’s objective.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the Green Skull Renegades had bombarded the soul train with special radar-jamming shells, everything seemed to go according to plan. That a Tiled Douluo would be present had been known in advance, and they had prepared accordingly with a divine-grade mecha. However, Feng Linwan hadn’t expected that there would be people left over able to defend the train.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The next phase of the battle now strayed from their careful planning. In the firefight between both sides, although they had managed to suppress the defenders with overwhelming numbers, the casualties for the Douluo delegation numbered extremely few. The vast majority of the Douluo delegation’s members were soul masters of at least some repute. Combined with the Star Luo Empire’s mecha squadron, they were able to put up a fierce fight. Against such a great defensive, the Green Skull Renegades couldn’t dominate the battlefield.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The defenders had managed to send out an energy signal, and as the seconds ticked by, the reinforcements grew closer and closer. Although the Green Skull Renegades knew their long-ranged bombardment would eventually wear down their targets until annihilation, they were pressed on time and were forced to engage in close combat. Thoroughly and quickly eliminating the Douluo delegation was now more important than ever.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Earlier, Feng Linwan had noticed the iron-tight defense mounted by Gu Yue in this section of the train. She was like a one-man artillery line. Even without a mecha or battle armor to amplify her power, she intercepted the incoming attacks by just waving her staff, unleashing wave after wave of elemental attacks. Feng Linwan couldn’t let this be and had flown over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Feng Linwan neared the train carriage, he pulled out a pair of gigantic hammers from the back of his mecha. In consideration of their potential for catastrophic damage and the mecha’s tremendous strength, he had opted for hammers over swords.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Energy surged into the hammers. They crackled with pitch-black sparks upon his downward swing toward the carriage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he could inflict any damage, a teenage boy leaped out of said carriage and soared his direction, instantly filling up his screen sensors. Enroute, four soul rings appeared around him, three purple and one black.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His fourth ring is a ten-thousand-year?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Linwan was taken aback. It was his first time facing such a young genius. Then he saw the black ring shine. A swarm of dark blue vines, each as thick as a human leg, shot toward him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the vines neared, Feng Linwan noticed a dark-gold twinkle within them, for some reason reminding him of a golden dragon. The sheer number of vines engulfed the figure of the boy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What the hell kind of martial soul is that?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Linwan’s lips parted in disbelief.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So what if he has good soul rings? He’s still only got four. I have six! And a black-grade mecha too! How could he possibly be my opponent?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mecha changed targets in mid-air. It threw the hammer in its right hand straight at the approaching Tang Wulin!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Linwan’s combat style favored crushing his opponents through brute strength. He himself was a power-type soul master, so he was quite skilled at dominating his opponents in this way.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black hammer zipped toward Tang Wulin like a giant missile. Air parted before it as it broke the sound barrier, exploding in a sonic boom.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The vines showed no will to block the hammer, peeling back one after another to make way for it. Yet an instant later, they weaved a giant net in the air. Upon collision, the net recoiled, but it managed to slow the hammer. As the hammer continued to push against the net, the net began to shake, enduring the hammer’s power and dispersing its energy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Linwan’s eyes went wide. His were no ordinary hammers; they were imbued with the pulverizing property from his martial soul! The moment they hit their target, this usually resulted in a mangled death. When the hammer struck the net of vines, the vines shone gold and revealed what looked like a skeletal structure within. Bathed in gold, the vines managed to absorb all of the hammer’s force!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Linwan furrowed his brow. He reached out with the mecha’s right hand to recall the hammer. Naturally, he wouldn’t have thrown the hammer if there wasn’t a mechanism to return it to his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, a vine wrapped around the hammer’s handle and prevented it from leaving. From the swarm of vines, Tang Wulin appeared, swinging from one of the vines toward his hammer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hammer the black-grade mecha wielded was over five meters long, its head about two meters in diameter. Absolutely huge. Yet Tang Wulin had managed to stop the hammer from moving long enough to grab on to it. As he wielded the giant hammer, the vines unfurled around him into a multitude of tentacles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re seeking death!” Feng Linwan coldly snorted.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Trying to use my owner hammer against me? We’ll see about that!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a flash of black light, a five-meter-tall silver bear appeared. Its scarlet eyes gleamed with blood lust. This was Feng Linwan’s third spirit soul, the Dusksilver Bear! Although not as great as the Duskgold Dreadclaw Bear, the Dusksilver Bear possessed exceptional strength. Furthermore, it synergized well with Feng Linwan’s mecha, able to wield one of his giant hammers that weighed over 2500 kilograms by itself. Practically a slaughter machine!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dusksilver Bear stepped off the mecha’s palm, then burst toward the returning hammer Tang Wulin was currently holding.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A smirk made its way across Feng Linwan’s lips. The power of a ten-thousand-year spirit soul would tear this boy apart in the blink of an eye. And if the boy retreated, then the Dusksilver Bear could take control of one of his mecha’s hammers and go wild with its attacks. He saw only death in the boy’s future.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After taking care of the boy, he could continue wiping out the rest of the Douluo delegation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dusksilver Bear reached the returning hammer in no time. It stretched its arms wide to give Tang Wulin a crushing embrace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not before a tremendous shadow appeared behind him, however.</span></p>
