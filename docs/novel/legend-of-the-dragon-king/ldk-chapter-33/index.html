 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter 33 – First Arrival in Eastsea City</strong></span></p>
 <p>Eastsea City.</p>
 <p>This was the second largest seaside city in the Sun-Moon Federation. Its main feature was its port, which served as a nexus for travelling the seas and exploiting the resources of the ocean.</p>
 <p>The city had a population of over three million people. By exploiting the natural resources in the ocean, the city was able to prosper. Even when compared to the rest of the Sun-Moon Federation, it could still be considered a second-tier city.</p>
 <p>Eastsea City had a long history and its overall appearance had preserved its original state of a simple and unadorned style. In the last several hundred years, the Sun-Moon Federation had taken extra care to protect some of the more ancient buildings. Thus, many of the millennia old buildings could be found in this ancient city.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">☀</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Eastsea City soul train station.</p>
 <p>A dark blue soul train slowly entered the station and came to a stop.</p>
 <p>In Eastsea City, nearly all of the soul trains were blue in color.</p>
 <p>After coming to a stop, the train’s doors opened up, letting the people onboard off. Many people greeted each other but after a moment, the station returned to its usual hustle and bustle as people headed towards the exit.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin tightly held onto his rucksack as he followed the stream of people towards the exit. This was the first time he had ever been to such a major city so his curious gaze was wandering all over the place.</p>
 <p>The train station’s ceiling was constructed from a bunch of metal tubes. With a glance, Tang Wulin could tell that all these metal tubes had been casted and were pressed into completion like ordinary metal.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin’s expression wasn’t too good and he seemed rather gloomy.</p>
 <p>Before his eyes was an unfamiliar environment. Naturally, a nine-year-old child like him would inevitably feel a bit frightened by this.</p>
 <p>He had come to Eastsea City to attend the Eastsea City Academy. He had thought his mom or dad would have accompanied him here, but his dad told him he was a big kid already, and that he should go and experience it for himself. After buying him a ticket, they brought him to the soul train and saw him off.</p>
 <p>This was the first time Tang Wulin was so far away from home. Even after leaving the house, Lang Yue had been tirelessly instructing him on various matters. His mind had already gone blank when he arrived and he could only follow the stream of people outwards with a face full of perplexion.</p>
 <p>While he was following the stream of people, it suddenly split in two, giving Tang Wulin a clear look at a polished black soul car that was parked on the platform. The stream of people had split in order to avoid this car.</p>
 <p>Although he didn’t recognize what type of car this was, he could tell from its exterior that it was absolutely high class. The body of the car was slender and sleek, its four wheels had caterpillar tracks on them. It seems it was an all-terrain vehicle.</p>
 <p>Beside the car doors stood two men in black suits who were peering into the crowd.</p>
 <p>When Tang Wulin neared the car, the two men found their target. One of the men walked in Tang Wulin’s direction with large strides and respectfully called out, “Young Master!”</p>
 <p>Naturally, this address wasn’t directed at Tang Wulin. While he was looked around for this young master, a youth strode out from behind him.</p>
 <p>This youth looked to be about the same age from his appearance. He was dressed in blue from head to toe and had short brown hair. When Tang Wulin turned around to look, the youth had already walked past his side, so Tang Wulin was only able to catch a glimpse of the side of his face.</p>
 <p>Fair white skin, a straight nose, eyes that were slightly sunken in, long eyelashes that curled up slightly and eyes that were deep green in color.</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, Tang Wulin was pushed from the side and stumbled into that young master’s shoulder.</p>
 <p>Staggering backwards from the collision, the youth caught himself and abruptly turned towards Tang Wulin.</p>
 <p>The youth was handsome but Tang Wulin could clearly feel that he had a cold and arrogant temperament. The youths expression soured, but after a glance, he continued walking towards the soul car. His expression wasn’t one of indifference to his offender, rather, it was one of disdain.</p>
 <p>“My apologies!” Tang Wulin hastily said.</p>
 <p>The man who had stepped forward to greet his young master raised his hand and pushed Tang Wulin away, back into the crowd, nearly causing him to fall over.”</p>
 <p>“Be careful you hick.” The man in black said fiercely before following the youth to the car.</p>
 <p>The other man in black opened the car door for the young master with one hand, while the other rested on top of the door.</p>
 <p>The youth didn’t turn back even once, and directly entered the car. The two men in black quickly entered and started the soul engine, which let out a muffled rumbling sound before the black soul car drove off.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin rubbed his stomach. Although it didn’t hurt, he was still furious in his heart and thought to himself, ‘<i>These city people are truly too tyrannical!’</i></p>
 <p>Tang Wuling followed the stream of people which dispersed after leaving the train station,</p>
 <p>When he turned around to look, he only saw these words plastered on a sign: <i>Eastsea Soul Train Station.</i></p>
 <p>As he looked at this huge structure that was the train station, Tang Wulin couldn’t help but sigh in admiration. Compared to the largest building in Glorybound City, this train station was even more grand.</p>
 <p>He turned back around and surveyed his surroundings. Reflected in his eyes was a wide street with many skyscrapers off in the distance. All kinds of soul cars could be seen on the streets as the constantly sped about. The stream of people was simply bustling with activity. This all combined together to give one a feeling of constriction.</p>
 <p>Shrinking into his body, Tang Wulin rummaged through his rucksack for his water bottle, and quickly drank a mouthful.</p>
 <p>After taking a drink of water, he rummaged through his rucksack once again and took out a slip of paper. This slip of paper was written for him by his father. His father had written what he should do once he arrived in Eastsea City.</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, a middle aged man that with slim build walked over with a beaming smile. “Little friend, is this your first time coming to Eastsea City? Where are your parents?”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin looked at his slip of paper. The very first thing the paper said was: Don’t trust strangers easily.</p>
 <p>He raised his head and glanced at the middle aged man before shaking his head. Without speaking to the man, he quickly walked off.</p>
 <p>The direction he headed in had a tower and on top of it was written: Administrative Law Enforcement.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin asked to the two officers in uniform as he neared the tower, “Hello uncle police officer. Can you tell me where the regular bus to the Eastsea Academy is?”</p>
 <p>For the famous Eastsea Academy, every year around registration time, there would be regular busses near the train station that would take students to the academy. As long as he found the bus, he would be able to go to the academy without a hitch.</p>
 <p>One of the officers pointed to a location not too far away and said, “It’s right over there. Child, where’s your family?”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin straightened his posture and answered, “Uncle, I’m not little anymore. Thank you.”</p>
 <p>After he finished speaking, Tang Wulin turned around and ran off in the direction the officer had pointed in.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, after passing through the crowd of people, Tang Wulin saw a sign with white words on a blue background that said: Eastsea Academy.</p>
 <p>Under the sign was a chair, and behind the chair were several 17 to 18-year-old youths in blue sportswear.</p>
 <p>When they saw Tang Wulin walk over, a black haired girl smiled and said, “Little brother, are you here to report?”</p>
 <p>The black haired girl had a pair of red phoenix eyes, a moderate build and a sweet appearance that gave a feeling of warmth.</p>
