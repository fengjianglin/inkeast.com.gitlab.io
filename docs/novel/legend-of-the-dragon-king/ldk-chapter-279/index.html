 <p><span style>Shen Yi walked over and bowed to the three elders, then stood to the side. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The tenth trial is also known as the Three Hall Review. These three elders will evaluate your previous performance in the trials and give you a comprehensive score that will be added to your total,” Shen Yi explained. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Three Hall Review? </span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But with that Elder Cai who failed us twice here… This trial is… </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin glanced at Gu Yue. Though she furrowed her brows, her eyes still shone with a stubborn light. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She’s only short two points! This trial… </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The elder in the middle spoke up, his voice deep as he said, “Tang Wulin, come up.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin hastily stepped forward and bowed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Full marks for seven trials and zero for two… Your performance has been remarkable, simply outstanding. You’re brave, wise, and a capable leader. We’ve been watching you the entire time. However, we will hold off on your score until later as we want you to take a makeup trial.” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A makeup trial? </span></i><span style>Tang Wulin thanked the elder despite his confusion and quickly returned by his companion’s side. With seventy points, he was safe either way. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xie Xie,” The grey-haired elder called out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie rushed forward. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your talent is slightly higher than average and your situational awareness is poor. However, you have the courage to charge head-first in the face of danger. So, overall, your performance has been satisfactory. You get six points.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Elder.” Xie Xie let out a breath of relief. He had sixty-one points so he feared getting a negative score the most. After all, his performance in some trials had been quite embarrassing. And yet, unknown to him was that his accomplishments had already surpassed the average. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xu Xiaoyan.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your talent is average, but your uniqueness lies in your absolute control with the astrological attribute of your variant martial soul. Not only that, you work well with your team and have a clever mind, undiscouraged by your weaknesses. Your potential is actually quite impressive. So, you get seven points.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Elder.” Xu Xiaoyan smiled shyly as she returned to her friends. Now she had caught up to Xie Xie. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Yue.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue went up and bowed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, the grey-haired elder did not say anything. Instead, he looked to the Silver Moon Douluo at his side. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Cai coldly snorted. “Gu Yue, you’re arrogant and insolent. Though you might be gifted, you lack situational awareness and have impacted your entire team with your actions. Not only that, you’re both impulsive and unreasonable. I don’t think you’re suitable for Shrek Academy. One point. Your total is fifty-nine.” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>One point? She only gave Gu Yue one point? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue raised her head to glare at Elder Cai, biting her lip as she trembled. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The grey-haired elder said, “Tang Wulin, Xie Xie, Xu Xiaoyan, you have been accepted into the academy. Tang Wulin, you will take the fifth trial again in a moment. Gu Yue, you only have fifty-nine points, so you can go now.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin, Xie Xie, and Xu Xiaoyan were stupefied. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fifty-nine points? </span></i><span style>Everyone shared the opinion that Gu Yue was the most amazing of them four, yet she had only received fifty-nine points. She was just one point shy of making it into Shrek Academy, but that one point meant she was rejected and had to return home now. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When they had first arrived in Shrek City, they all assumed that if only one of them made it to Shrek Academy, it would definitely be Gu Yue! None of them expected this outcome. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue’s curled her hands into tight fists but obstinately remained standing there, her face full of pride. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A hand grabbed her shoulder. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She turned around, and her gaze connected with Tang Wulin’s resolute eyes. He gathered her trembling body into his arms, then looked straight at the elders. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t accept this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuo Shi was taken aback. He wouldn’t have been surprised if Gu Yue had spoken these words, but no, it was Tang Wulin who said them! </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why do you not accept this?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin said, “Respected elders, may I ask if Shrek Academy is fair?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>A cold smile formed on Elder Cai’s lips. “Nothing is fair in this world. If you want fair, then you need strength. Justice is fought for, not freely and willingly given. Of course, that is under the condition you’re powerful enough to suppress everyone.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin was stunned. He had never expected such a reply. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He nodded to Elder Cai and gave a slight bow. “Thank you for your advice, I have learned from it. Since this is how things are, I have nothing more to say. Elders, I renounce my Shrek Academy admittance. One day, I will return. One day when I’m strong enough, I will come back to enforce justice.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin turned towards Xie Xie and Xu Xiaoyan and sternly said, “You two don’t need to follow me, this is just mine and Gu Yue’s business. You should stay and properly cultivate.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie chuckled. He stuck his hands into his pant’s pockets and, as if he hadn’t heard Tang Wulin’s words, casually strolled over. “Since my talent is only average, it seems Shrek Academy doesn’t think too highly of me. Captain, are you trying to ditch me? No way. Back when you defeated that Duskgold Dreadclaw Bear and avenged me, I swore I would follow you for the rest of my life. I can only become strong by following you. I like your plan. We’ll return when we have the strength to demand justice.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>He arrived next to Tang Wulin and placed his hand on his captain’s shoulder. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I never wanted to be a soul master anyway, it was my old man that forced me. The pressure here is a bit too high for me. Let’s go back now.” Xu Xiaoyan also stood beside them. Speaking as if this was a trivial matter. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys…” &nbsp;Tang Wulin was at a loss for words. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He turned to Shen Yi. “Teacher Shen, my apologies. I’m afraid we aren’t qualified to be Shrek students. It was once my dream, but now my dream has shattered. May I ask where Teacher Wu is?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Emotions warred within Shen Yi’s heart as she stared at them. </span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the grey-haired elder said with a gloomy expression, “Good, you’re all really stubborn. That stubbornness must have been taught to you. Very good, nicely done. Now leave. You can all get out now.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>His cold words stunned the four that were preparing to leave. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Yi sent them a meaningful look as she quietly explained, “This elder is senior brother Wu’s teacher as well as your grandteacher. Hurry up and pay your respects.” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Grandteacher? Teacher Wu’s teacher? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s heart thumped. He tugged on Gu Yue’s sleeve then bowed to Zhuo Shi. “I pay my respects to grandteacher.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie and Xu Xiaoyan quickly followed suit. Nudged by Tang Wulin, Gu Yue was the last to bow. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuo Shi’s expression lightened a few shades, but his voice was as cold as before. “Do you guys think you’re something amazing, renouncing everything for the sake of your companions huh? You fools. Each and every one of you are fools. Why did you even come here? Was it to show off your stubbornness? Your pride? Do you not know what effort is? All you know is how to fight, but not how to beg? Did Wu Zhangkong teach you his stubbornness? It really is just as they say: like teacher, like student. You’re all a bunch of stubborn fools.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The corner of Shen Yi’s mouth twitched as she silently cursed. </span><i><span style>Aren’t you the one who taught senior brother? Don’t your words apply to yourself too? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandteacher, may I ask you a question?” Xu Xiaoyan asked in a cute voice. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hm?” Zhuo Shi eyes shifted to her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Xiaoyan’s eyes welled, then reddened as she choked back sobs. “Grandteacher, is this grandma more amazing than you?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Her question completely blindsided Zhuo Shi, and he was left unable to answer. He sneaked a glance at Elder Cai. “We’re about equal.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tears escaped from the corner of Xu Xiaoyan’s eyes before it began to stream down her face. “Grandteacher, it’s said that once a teacher, forever a father. We’ve treated Teacher Wu like a father, and Teacher Wu definitely treats you like one too, so you’re our grandfather. How can you let your grandchildren be bullied when you’re such a powerful Title Douluo and a battle armor master? We would have had enough points to pass the exam long ago if it wasn’t for this grandma. Is it because you are afraid of her, you don’t speak out when your granddaughter is being driven out?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuo Shi was stunned. He was famed for his old-fashioned ways and stubbornness throughout Shrek Academy, and he had a stern expression that cowed all the inner court students into submission. Yet, he never expected the girl before him to speak such words. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me, afraid of her?” He inadvertently let slip his thoughts. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Xiaoyan, throat stifled with emotion, said, “You’re not afraid of her, yet you don’t care when your granddaughter is being driven out?” </span><span style>After a dumbstruck moment, Zhuo Shi said, “That’s right! Why wouldn’t I care if my granddaughter is being driven out? Cai Yue’er, what are you trying to pull? Why are you bullying my granddaughter?” </span></p>
