 <p><span style><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;151 - A Problem Appears</strong></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie’s mouth twitched as he said, “Just be content with how things are. I can’t even count the number of advanced department students that want Teacher Wu to teach them.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Catch up,” Tang Wulin cut in. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The five students followed Wu Zhangkong to the academy’s training facilities. </span></p>
 <p><span style>These facilities were specially prepared for students to engage in real combat. It was equipped with a soul barrier to minimize the damage caused by stray soul skills. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are we being demoted?” Zhang Yangzi covertly whispered to Wang Jinxi. This training facility was frequently used by the ordinary students. After joining class zero for several months, they hadn’t come here as much, so it was only natural that Zhang Yangzi was confused. Their combat training had largely been conducted in the spirit ascension platform against the various soul beasts as, after all, they wouldn’t be sufficiently challenged otherwise. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Jinxi shot him an annoyed glare. “You really speak a lot of nonsense.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong found the teacher in charge of the building and reserved a training field for them. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The training fields varied in size, ranging from 30 to 50 meters in diameter. The facility had three floors in total. Each floor had four training field of differing sizes, and each field was usually bustling with students from all grades training. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong had requested a field on the third floor as it was currently empty. This way, they would be able to train in peace. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong brought them to a large training field that reached 50 meters in diameter. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie eagerly asked, “Teacher Wu, are we three going to fight against them two? Hehe.” Xie Xie shifted his gaze to Zhang Yangzi, a mischievous grin on his lips as he geared up for battle. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“No.” Wu Zhangkong said in a cold voice. “The five of you willing be battling me.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Five against one, that’s very unfair… Huh? Against you…” Xie Xie stared at Wu Zhangkong, dumbfounded. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With his usual indifference, Wu Zhangkong said, “Don’t forget, this no longer is the spirit ascension platform. You won’t revive here in the real world and I might not be able to properly hold back. I will suppress my soul power to the same rank as you all, and I won’t amplify my soul rings. This time, however, I will be using my martial soul. Begin.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Without even giving the students a chance to respond, soul rings immediately rose up from beneath his feet. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Two yellow, two purple and two black soul rings appeared. An unstoppable aura engulfed the students for a split second before his soul power rapidly decreased to about rank 20. </span></p>
 <p><span style>An ice blue sword appeared in his right hand. It was as if his usual coldness had condensed into that glacial sword; a rarely seen tender expression graced his face. </span></p>
 <p><span style>White robes and blue sword, sky ice and snow cold! </span></p>
 <p><span style>These words couldn’t help but pop into Tang Wulin’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The memory of when Wu Zhangkong revealed his martial soul in the battle against Guang Biao was still crystal clear in his mind. He hadn’t even been able to make out what sort of attacks Wu Zhangkong had used back then and the battle had already ended in a few brief moments. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet today, they were supposed to face his Skyfrost Sword? </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Into formation!” Tang Wulin’s thunderous order shocked the rest of his comrades out of their stupor. Gu Yue was the first to respond, appearing behind Tang Wulin in a flash. Wang Jinxi, Zhang Yangzi and Xie Xie moved into their positions, forming a cross with Gu Yue at the center and poised to face Wu Zhangkong. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin shouted, “Everyone, be careful! I’ll restrain him, Gu Yue, you control the battle. The rest of you, focus on attacking. Go!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Bluesilver Grass gathered in his right hand as he spoke. Tang Wulin had learned from his experiences in the spirit ascension platform and was far more skillful in his control over the vines now. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Strand after strand of Bluesilver Grass issued forth, closing in on Wu Zhangkong’s position. At his rear, two soul rings sparkled as Gu Yue raised her hands to shoot out a series of blazing fireballs at Wu Zhangkong. With some flying straight at him and others arcing toward him, Wu Zhangkong faced a fiery assault. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although ice could indeed extinguish fire, fire could also melt ice. After taking into consideration the fact that Wu Zhangkong had lowered his soul power rank to their level, Gu Yue decisively chose to first suppress his attribute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dozens of fireballs filled the air, some quick, some slow. Regardless of which, in the end, they all shot toward Wu Zhangkong. The fireballs besieged him from all sides, seemingly impossible for him to deal with the all at once. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s Bluesilver Grass exploded forth at the same time. A multitude of strands engulfed Wu Zhangkong, binding his body. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie, Zhang Yangzi and Wang Jinxi dashed forward from different directions, but all three converged towards Wu Zhangkong. With strands of Bluesilver Grass tied around their waists, Tang Wulin was in complete control of them. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The first to arrive were the fireballs. Despite this, Wu Zhangkong’s gaze never left his Skyfrost Sword. He took a slow and calculated step to the side as the fireballs seemed to slow down. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In the blink of an eye, the Skyfrost Sword’s chilly aura filled the training grounds. Dozens of fireballs extinguished quietly, and as their warm light disappeared, the surroundings returned to its original luster. </span></p>
 <p><span style>For a brief moment, a sliver of emotion made it past Gu Yue’s grim expression. She had felt the cores of her fireballs obliterated instantly by Wu Zhankong’s move. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The next second, Wu Zhangkong moved in an eerie rhythm, his mystical footwork dodging the bindings of Bluesilver Grass as they shot forth one after another. </span></p>
 <p><span style>At that instant, he was no different from a ghostly general, his body almost illusory. This scene shocked and dazzled the assault team of three to their very bones. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Not good! </span></i><span style>Tang Wulin pulled ferociously on several strands of Bluesilver Grass as he shouted, “Withdraw!” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s best not to aim too high against an opponent like Teacher Wu. We need to avoid making any mistakes and prioritize our safety first. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>His reaction was swift enough, but his actions were still lacking in power. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie had understood Tang Wulin’s thoughts from the very beginning, so the moment he heard the order to withdraw, he had immediately changed directions and flown back at his maximum speed. </span></p>
 <p><span style> Zhang Yangzi and Wang Jinxi, on the other hand, were a moment too slow. The frost had already crept onto their bodies. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They were not fools though. Having learned from past experiences, they instantly locked hands and were enshrouded in a black light. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Martial soul fusion skill!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadow Eagle Dragon! </span></p>
 <p><span style>They didn’t dare to hold back against Wu Zhangkong! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Waves of darkness rippled out, unveiling a monstrous scene. Wang Jinxi’s aura had clearly grown stronger; however, there was a hint of dissonance between him and Zhang Yangzi. The two of them let out a groan before their bodies quickly separated. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Two cold lights landed on their bodies, causing them to stiffen in place as Wu Zhangkong appeared before them. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on?” He didn’t continue attacking and began to examine the two instead. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Their soul fusion skill failed? </span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Although they had only partially succeeded in using their soul fusion skill during the Class Promotion Tournament, it was still considered a success. But now, their soul fusion skill had actually failed? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Yangzi and Wang Jinxi paled. They both knew that their martial souls weren’t particularly powerful, and it was only because of their soul fusion skill that they had been able to enter the ranks of geniuses with a slim possibility of becoming famous powerhouses in the continent in the future. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, their soul fusion skill had just failed. They were dumbstruck. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Try it again.” Wu Zhangkong moved back and brandished his Skyfrost Sword once again. The chill immediately returned. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Yangzi and Wang Jinxi exchanged a knowing look as they charged at each other once again, their soul powers pushed to their very limits. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A pair of wing unfurled from Zhang Yangzi’s back as he swept Wang Jinxi into his arms. &nbsp;</span></p>
