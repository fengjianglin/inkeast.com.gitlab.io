 <p>Gu Yue’s face was slightly flushed but Tang Wulin had already rushed up. With his pair of heavy silver hammers, he directed an assault at Guang Long</p>
 <p>Guang Long smiled grimly and swung his fists. Two fists and two hammers collided.</p>
 <p><i>Boom, boom, boom!</i> Tang Wulin leapt into the air, and with the addition of his hammers, his strength had increased greatly. Guang Long, however, had displayed both his soul skills – Armored Body and Armored Dragon Body. Putting both together had increased his toughness to an astonishing degree.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin was thrown out forcibly once more, a stuffy groan emitting out. Blood dripped from his mouth and nose.</p>
 <p>Xie Xie’s response was lighting fast. He dashed behind Tang Wulin in the blink of an eye, hoping to support Tang Wulin and prevent him from falling.</p>
 <p>But he had underestimated the force of Tang Wulin’s body. After taking hold of Tang Wulin’s body, the both of them were slammed into the ground.</p>
 <p>This precisely getting crushed by force.</p>
 <p>Guang Long shook his shoulders, but didn’t continue to pursue Tang Wulin. Instead, he looked towards the surrounding spectators. “You see? If you dare defy me, this will be the outcome. Although these kids are Soul Masters, there are in no way a match for this daddy. Whomever dares defy me, beware of this daddy’s Armored Dragon claws tearing you into shreds.”</p>
 <p>“So painful. Xie Xie, your Light Dragon Dagger is stabbing me.” Tang Wulin, who had fallen to the ground, howled in pain.</p>
 <p>Xie Xie, who had initially tried to support him, was pushed away by the immense force and was in no way able to control the Light Dragon Dagger in his grip. It had slashed against Tang Wulin’s back.</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry. That wasn’t my intention.” Xie Xie had also collapsed onto the ground in a mess.</p>
 <p>Gu Yue prepared her water element in advance to heal them both. Upon reaching Tang Wulin, however, ,she found a strange energy radiating from his body.</p>
 <p><i>‘So hot!’ </i>Tang Wulin’s body trembled lightly. A fiery heat radiated from the wound on his back, spreading throughout his body.</p>
 <p>The familiar burning sensation from so long ago reappeared once again, flowing from his tailbone, throughout his body and toward his brain. His body felt as though it was lit on fire and had released an intense wave of heat from his body. This wave of heat had completely cleared the tightness within Tang Wulin’s chest when he’d been sent flying by Guang Long</p>
 <p>The soul power within Tang Wulin’s body rose as well, but he only felt that his spirit was in chaos. Unknown to him was that his strength had increased to a shocking level, as if it could now shake both the heavens and earth.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin turned to look at his right hand subconsciously showing golden spots had appeared upon the back of his hand. The whole of his right arm felt as though it was recharged and it vibrated lightly. That huge increase in strength all came from his right hand.</p>
 <p>Golden Scales. These were the Golden Scales that previously appeared.</p>
 <p>A few months had passed, and Tang Wulin had almost forgotten about these golden scales that had once appeared. Now, not only have they reappeared, they also reappeared in his time of need.</p>
 <p>After a deep roar, Tang Wulin jumped up with full force and sped towards Guang Long.</p>
 <p>Xie Xie had failed to stop Tang Wulin and shouted at him, “Wulin, don’t go!”</p>
 <p>Gu Yue, however, kept quiet as she’d clearly seen the sudden appearance of the golden scales on Tang Wulin’s neck. Her expression was dulled. ‘<i>What is that…’</i></p>
 <p>Guang Long hollered arrogantly when he sighted Tang Wulin coming towards him. This time, however, he only had one hammer. Guang Long shouted at him, “Punk, you’re pretty tough aren’t you! If you weren’t a child, this daddy would have already kneaded you to death.” After making this remark, he slapped at Tang Wulin’s incoming heavy silver hammer.</p>
 <p>At this moment, however, almost instantly, Guang Long felt a shiver from within his body. He now clearly saw the golden luster within Tang Wulin’s eyes. Golden bits of light flashed, Tang Wulin’s pupils morphed into a pair of icy slits, and a incomprehensible feeling overcame Guang Long’s body, causing him to go limp.</p>
 <p><i>Bang!</i> Guang Long’s massive body was hammered out of the way. The surrounding spectators clearly heard the bones in his arm fracturing.</p>
 <p>Guang Long’s two men tried their best to catch him as he fell, but failed and crashed into a pile along with him, just like what had happened to Xie Xie a while ago.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin looked at his right arm in shock. At that moment, the golden scales had spread up to his wrist as well, and claws had appeared. The whole of his right arm brought a boiling sensation to him.</p>
 <p>Compared with the previous instance, he had a more vivid experience this time round. He could clearly feel his soul power diminishing at a shocking speed.</p>
 <p><i>‘Quickly release!’</i> He prayed in his heart.</p>
 <p>A bizarre scene appeared. The glowing golden scales that had just grown on his arms dimmed as it rapidly changed into spots of light before disappearing from his arm The heat within his body had also cooled.</p>
 <p>The entire process of his golden scales’ appearance to his willful removal of these scales had only lasted a little more than ten seconds, but Tang Wulin felt as though his soul power had been rapidly used up. The only thing he had done better than the last experience was that he hadn’t fainted from the overuse of soul power.</p>
 <p>His arm ached so badly that he felt it couldn’t be lifted. Tang Wulin’s head was only filled with chaos. If last time’s appearance of the golden scales was like a hallucination, then this time it was a vivid feeling. If it was a hallucination, then how could he possibly explain this feeling?</p>
 <p>“Your… your power reappeared again?” Xie Xie had been right behind Tang Wulin ever since he rushed out, and had been able to witness first hand how Tang Wulin was able to send Guang Long flying with a single hammer. He had also witnessed the appearance of the golden scales on Tang Wulin’s arms.</p>
 <p>Not only did Guang Long feel a wave of fear at that instant, Xie Xie had as well. The appearance of the golden scales on Tang Wulin’s body had brought some sort of magical power, and it was frightening.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin smiled grimly. “I don’t know what happened too. Ah, where are the others?”</p>
 <p>As he looked for Guang Long once again, Guang Long and his two men had disappeared. At this instant, the surrounding crowd suddenly appeared before him and made themselves useful in aiding Uncle Li in lifting up the kitchen table and clearing the mess. These were passersby who, like Uncle Li, were owners of other shops along the same street.</p>
 <p>“This bastard, ran off without giving any compensation,” Xie Xie cursed.</p>
 <p>“Your hand…” Gu Yue looked skeptically at Tang Wulin.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin smiled grimly. “I also don’t know what happened. This was its second appearance. Those scales rapidly consumed my stamina and soul power, but gave me a rapid surge of power for a short time. That’s all I know.”</p>
 <p>“Let’s return first and talk later.”</p>
 <p>The trio exchanged farewells with Uncle Li. Xie Xie secretly stuffed some money into Uncle Li’s chest before speeding off in the direction of the academy.</p>
 <p>“That guy, will he go after Uncle Li to seek revenge?” Gu Yue asked Xie Xie.</p>
 <p>Xie Xie answered, “He won’t do so in the near future since he doesn’t have the ability. His arm has probably been smashed by Tang Wulin. Even if he was here to collect protection money, it’s merely a street stall, so he shouldn’t have gone overboard. I’ll have my family keep an eye on the shop. It shouldn’t be a problem.”</p>
