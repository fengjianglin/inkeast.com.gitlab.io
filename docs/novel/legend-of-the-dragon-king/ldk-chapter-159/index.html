<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;159 - Gu Yue's Decision</strong></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue’s eyes were blank. Wu Zhangkong glanced at her, not particularly surprised at her expression. “Gu Yue, your opponent was the Spirit Pagoda’s founder, the Spirit Ice Douluo Huo Yuhao back when he only possessed two soul rings.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you three shouldn’t be discouraged. You were defeated by powerful legends after all. If you do well in the Hall of Heroes and keep rising up, you might even get the chance to battle the original Shrek Seven Monsters one day.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin subconsciously swallowed at these unbelievable words. He didn’t even need to think about his answer and directly shouted out, “I want to join!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Having heard the tales of the legendary Tang Sect since childhood, one could only imagine his burning desire to join the organization. These stories, however, weren’t the main reason behind his willingness to join—it was his idol, the founder of the Tang Sect who possessed the same martial soul as him! Any previous doubts he held towards joining Wu Zhangkong’s organization were blown away after hearing that it was the Tang Sect. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie came to a similar conclusion after a moment of hesitation. “I want to join too.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong cautioned them, “You don’t need to decide so quickly. You can go home and ask your family first.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie shook his head. “There’s no need. I don’t want to miss out on such an opportunity. Teacher Wu, I will join. I’m sure I can convince my family too.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s and Xie Xie’s gazes drifted to Gu Yue. Neither of them knew whether she would join or not, but it was indisputable that her performance was the best out of all of them today. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>In reality, their only requirement was to pass the first trial of the medium level to be eligible for membership. The trials after that were to push them to their limits. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry, Teacher Wu. Wulin, Xie Xie, I won’t join,” Gu Yue said with utmost calm. There wasn’t a single shred of regret in the depths of her eyes, as if she was only dealing with a mundane matter. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh, why?” Xie Xie and Tang Wulin asked in unison. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue simply shook her head. “There’s already another organization that I want to join, so I can’t join the Tang Sect.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin wanted to say something, but Wu Zhangkong cut him off. “That’s fine. Everyone has their own ambitions, so it’s fine as long as you have thought things through properly. Gu Yue, you’re very talented and would be able to shine no matter where you go in the future. With this being the case, I’ll make some other arrangements for the combat component of your education.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Teacher Wu.” Gu Yue curtly nodded. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Still in disbelief, Tang Wulin approached Gu Yue. “But Gu Yue, it’s the Tang Sect! The Tang Sect that has traditions from 20,000 years ago and countless mysteries!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a slight change in Gu Yue’s expression, but her mind was firm. She shook her head once more at Tang Wulin’s words. “I’m sorry Wulin. I had already decided to join the Spirit Pagoda before we came here, and they require that I don’t join any other organization.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>While Tang Wulin was stunned at these words, Wu Zhangkong’s eyebrows jumped up in surprise. </span><i><span style>When did the Spirit Pagoda approach Gu Yue? They made their move so quickly! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>But Gu Yue’s excellence had been apparent from the beginning. Regardless of whether it was during the rebellion period or the ordinary spirit ascension platform, Gu Yue had always demonstrated extraordinary strength and potential. Neither Tang Wulin nor Xie Xie could compare to her, especially with her never-before-seen martial soul which could control six elements. Moreover, her control power was formidable, allowing her strength to far surpass her peers. The Spirit Pagoda had undoubtedly paid a tremendous price to rope her in. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was exactly as she had said. There would be some disputes if she joined the Tang Sect after joining the Spirit Pagoda. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong’s gaze returned to Tang Wulin and Xie Xie. “What Gu Yue said was correct. Both the Tang Sect and the Spirit Pagoda are top-notch organizations on the continent. An organization isn’t like an association; you can only join one organization. If you choose to join the Tang Sect, then in the future, you cannot join the Spirit Pagoda. If you want to leave the Tang Sect, then you’ll need to return everything you received from it, including cultivation methods. With this in mind, you two should carefully consider your decision again and tell me at a later time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without the slightest hesitation, Tang Wulin said, “I don’t need to think it over. I want to join the Tang Sect. It’s my dream!” That was right, he had dreamed of joining the Tang Sect since childhood. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Though he didn’t want to separate from Gu Yue, he had to prioritize his dream! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie looked back and forth between Tang Wulin and Gu Yue before nodding to himself. “Teacher Wu, I have also settled on joining the Tang Sect.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine. We’ll end today’s testing here. After filling in some forms later, you will officially become outer members of the Tang Sect. I’ll explain to you at a later time everything you need to know about the organization such as rules, benefits and duties.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>On the bus ride home, Tang Wulin stared off into the distance with a lonely expression. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Jinxi had left. Zhang Yangzi had left. Even Gu Yue was choosing a different path from him. His companions were leaving one by one, and he truly felt powerless since he had no basis to influence their decisions. If joining the Tang Sect hadn’t been his dream, he definitely would have chosen to join the Spirit Pagoda with Gu Yue. Companions had to stay together after all! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, it was as if fate had decreed that he must be alone. His family and friends were leaving one after the other, and the only one left by his side was Xie Xie. </span><i><span style>Will Xie Xie leave me too? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Seated beside him, Xie Xie prodded him with a few words. “What’s up? Are you feeling down because Gu Yue isn’t joining the Tang Sect?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin shook his head. “I just feel like everyone I hold dear is leaving. My parents and Na’er left. Zhang Yangzi and Wang Jinxi left, and now Gu Yue has chosen a different path. Maybe I really am meant to be alone.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie heartily laughed. “How can that be? Don’t you still have me? I won’t leave.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>A depressed sigh escaped Tang Wulin’s lips. “Maybe you won’t have a choice but to leave me in the future too.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who said I’m going to leave?!” Gu Yue suddenly appeared beside them. She pulled Xie Xie out of his seat before stealing it to sit beside Tang Wulin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re so emotional,” Gu Yue said, displeased. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin was startled by her words. “Maybe.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue pressed on. “I only chose not to join the Tang Sect, and it’s not like I’m leaving class zero. Whatever organization I join doesn’t change the fact that I’ll always be together with you guys.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing an opening, Xie Xie took this chance to cut in. “If you just say ‘you’ instead of ‘you guys’, he’d be far more moved.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go away!” Tang Wulin and Gu Yue yelled at him in unison. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys are bullies!” Xie Xie said with grievance. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin chuckled. “Sorry Gu Yue, I didn’t mean to blame you. Everyone makes their own decisions. I just feel a bit frustrated. You were right. Maybe it’s because my family left, but I’ve been very emotionally weak. I’ll do my best to fix that."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Poking his head in once more, Xie Xie said, “Just vent your feelings whenever you need to. For example, let me beat you up once.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin snorted. “I’m not so certain I’d be the one getting beat up.” </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>☀ </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The end of a semester was a joyous occasion for all students as it marked the start of their one month long vacation. They could finally relax and forget about studying or cultivating during this time. Despite their status as prestigious Soul Masters, in the end, they were only children. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After one more trip to the Dazzling Era Tang Sect the next day, class zero also began their vacation. Gu Yue and Xie Xie chose to spend their vacation away from campus. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Naturally, they were both going home to play and relax, leaving Tang Wulin the only one left in the dormitory. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Where can I even go? Back to Glorybound City?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Mom and dad aren’t there anymore, so can that place even be called home anymore? </span></i><span style>Tang Wulin bitterly laughed at his lonesome thoughts. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The only place he had now was Mang Tian’s workshop. He hoped that by devoting himself to cultivating and work, he’d be able to forget about his family. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He had already filled out the Tang Sect’s registration form and handed it to Wu Zhangkong, who submitted it to the Dazzling Era Tang Sect for review. Only after approval would he officially become a member of the Tang Sect.</span></p>
