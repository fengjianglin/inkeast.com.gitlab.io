 <p><span style>Tang Wulin sighed as he packed what he needed for the next month’s stay at the workshop. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wulin,” a familiar voice called out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher Wu.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong stood in the hallway, patiently waiting for Tang Wulin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What plans do you have for your vacation?” Wu Zhangkong stoically asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Somewhat at a loss, Tang Wulin shook his head. “I don’t really have any plans yet. I figured I’d just focus on forging and cultivating.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking it over, Wu Zhangkong set out a proposal. “Since you don’t have any plans, how about you come with me? I’m visiting another city in order to take care of some business. If you come along, you’ll be able to learn more about the world outside of school and relax at the same time.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?” Tang Wulin stared at Wu Zhangkong in astonishment. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong considerately asked, “Do you want some time to think it over?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin quickly shook his head. “No, I’ll go with you.” In that split-second, his mood brightened up from his previous lonely depression. </span><i><span style>I wonder where Teacher Wu will be taking me? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Since Wu Zhangkong didn’t say, Tang Wulin didn’t bother to ask. </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>☀</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>A short hour later, they were waiting for the train at Eastsea City’s soul train station. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As usual, Wu Zhangkong was clothed in his white garbs and carried no luggage. Clearly, he possessed a soul storage device similar to Tang Wulin’s. As for Tang Wulin, he had packed lightly, only bringing along a few sets of clothes and his two forging hammers. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-clad Wu Zhangkong caught the attention of many women in the train station. Regardless of their age, their eyes would naturally drift to Wu Zhangkong. Surprisingly enough, there were quite a few younger girls who chose to eye Tang Wulin instead. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s appeal was different from that of the mature and handsome Wu Zhangkong’s. His large, limpid eyes as well as the calm aura that was beyond his years easily drew the gazes of girls around his age. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Today, Tang Wulin wore white sportswear that he had purchased himself. They were the cheapest of the cheapest clothes he could find. Though he was in no way hurting for money right now, his frugal nature wasn’t something he could easily change. He couldn’t even imagine what kind of high-quality materials Wu Zhangkong’s white robe was made of. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After spending a semester together, it was clear to Tang Wulin that Wu Zhangkong liked silence, so as long as Wu Zhangkong didn’t say anything to him, he didn’t try to engage him in conversation either. He was resolved to be a quiet and well-behaved child. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The train’s arrival was preceded by a low, rumbling noise. At the sight of the train they were to take, Tang Wulin finally realized their destination. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They were headed toward Heaven Dou City. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Heaven Dou City? Didn’t that use to be the capital of the Heaven Dou Empire? </span></i><span style>It was a large metropolis that could still be considered one of the greatest cities on the Douluo Continent today. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The distance between Eastsea City and Heaven Dou City was by no means small! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong had bought them economy class seats. Each carriage could seat four passengers, two on each side separated by an aisle in the middle. The cheap price of the ticket was obvious from how cramped the carriage was. Tang Wulin was fine since he was still a small child, but Wu Zhangkong’s long legs were already leaning against the back of the seat in front of him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>While Tang Wulin was seated by the window, Wu Zhangkong had taken the outer seat, acting as a human barrier between him and the rest of the crowd. In his isolated space, Tang Wulin felt a sense of security. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here.” Wu Zhangkong handed him a booklet. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin curiously examined it. There wasn’t a single word on its cover, making him assume it was a notebook. When he opened it, however, there were drawings of people alongside many notes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this, Teacher Wu?” Tang Wulin inquired. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Tang Sect’s investigation into your background shouldn’t turn up with any issues, so I’m giving you this booklet right now. Inside it is the Tang Sect’s cultivation technique, the Mysterious Heaven Method. It can also be used to meditate, so you could also call it a meditation method. The benefits you get from it should be far better than what you’re receiving now. Later, when you learn other Tang Sect techniques, this Mysterious Heaven Method will serve as the foundation.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The Tang Sect’s methods? </span></i><span style>Tang Wulin’s eyes instantly lit up with excitement. So far, he’d been using the basic cultivation methods provided by the academy, but now he would be able to replace it with a method from the legendary Tang Sect! Considering its reputation, he had no doubts about its quality. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Wu Zhangkong had to caution him. “When you first join the Tang Sect, you’re initially only allowed to learn the Mysterious Heaven Method since it’s the foundation of everything. Only after familiarizing yourself with it will you be able to cultivate in the other methods and techniques of the Tang Sect. But in your case, since you entered by passing the medium level test, you can also pick one more technique to cultivate.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher Wu, wait a minute.” Tang Wulin suddenly interrupted Wu Zhangkong and then lowered his voice. “Can we really talk about the Tang Sect’s methods in such a crowded place?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong shook his head dismissively. “They won’t hear our voices. Listen and see for yourself.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?” It was only then that Tang Wulin noticed the total silence that surrounded him. The people continued to clamber onto the train, but not a peep could be heard. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As he focused on his surroundings, he observed a thin layer of soul power separating them from the crowd. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this?” Tang Wulin looked back at Wu Zhangkong in astonishment. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong casually explained, “This is merely a way of using soul power. You’ll be able to do this once you reach a certain level as well. Now back to the topic of Tang Sect techniques. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are a total of six: Mysterious Heaven Method, Mysterious Jade Hands, Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon, Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track, Purple Demon Eyes, and Hidden Weapons Hundred Separations. Among them, Hidden Weapons Hundred Separations has already fused with the development of soul device technology and is incorporated into the Tang Sect’s unique battle armors. As for the other five techniques, you’d still learn them as you normally would. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You may learn one extra technique after passing the medium level test, the advanced level test, and so on. So right now, you can choose another one in addition to the Mysterious Heaven Method. I personally recommend that you choose Purple Demon Eyes. It’s a method to cultivate your eyes’ strength while also increasing your spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eyes are the windows to the mind, and this is the easiest way to increase your spiritual power. You will gain many advantages, so you really should pick Purple Demon Eyes.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay!” Tang Wulin’s gaze sparkled. </span><i><span style>It’s a Tang Sect technique! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, Teacher Wu, what obligations do I have to keep for the Tang Sect in return?” Tang Wulin asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong said, “You must memorize and abide by the rules of the Tang Sect. As long as take care not to break any of them, your status as a member of the Tang Sect will be guaranteed. In this world, nothing comes freely. If you want to increase your position in the Tang Sect, you will have to contribute to the sect. For example, you can complete missions in order to earn some contribution points, which you can then exchange in the sect for many different items that you can’t obtain anywhere else. You may also use them to increase your contribution level in the sect. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“As for the matter of documenting your contribution points, even as you spend them, your total, recorded contribution points never change. As such, you can call that total your effective contribution points value. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll explain these things more in detail later, but what you really need to remember right now are the rules of the Tang Sect. If you break any of them, the lightest punishment you will receive is expulsion and having to return everything you received from the sect. In the worst case scenario, there are much harsher and more severe punishments that may follow. As such, pay attention. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“The first rule of the Tang Sect: be filial to the sect and to your teachers. This one is pretty simple. Just don’t join any other sects or organizations and you’ll be fine. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Second rule of the Tang Sect: you will not commit rape or robbery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Third rule of the Tang Sect: you must not divulge the secrets of the sect. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fourth rule of the Tang Sect: It is the duty of everyone in the Tang Sect to uphold virtue and condemn evil.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fifth rule of the Tang Sect: you must not deceive others.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong continued to profoundly list off one Tang Sect rule after another, and Tang Wulin took each of them to heart. Though there were ten rules in total, none of them were particularly harsh. The intent behind their regulations could be summarized in one phrase: be a good person who cherishes the Tang Sect. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tang Wulin, are you capable of following all of these rules?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am,” Tang Wulin solemnly answered. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With a more solemn tone than usual, Wu Zhangkong said, “Remember, this is a lifelong commitment. The Tang Sect’s objective is to uphold virtue and condemn evil while supporting the continent’s steady development. There aren’t many restrictions other than the ten rules, but you must absolutely never break them. As your teacher, as well as the person who recruited you, I will be held responsible for any mistake you make.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sensing the sudden severity in Wu Zhangkong, Tang Wulin’s pulse began to race, and he nodded solemnly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright then. Return the book to me after you’ve finished reading it.” Wu Zhangkong let out a long sigh, then reclined in his chair and closed his eyes. He was now quietly waiting for the train to arrive at their destination. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, the clamoring of the crowd didn’t return, and they were still enveloped in the same peaceful calm as before. Tang Wulin understood that Wu Zhangkong was maintaining the barrier of soul power so that he could read in peace. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The section on the Mysterious Heaven Method wasn’t particularly long, and Tang Wulin finished reading it within half an hour. Despite that, he still had some confusion about some of the acupuncture points and things of that nature. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong gave him detailed explanations to any questions he asked about the cultivation method and even had him begin moving his soul power along some of the paths outlined in the booklet. </span></p>
