 <p><span style><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;100 - Tang Wulin Returns</strong></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>The teacher for class one of the first grade was none other than Ye Yingluo, Ye Yingrong’s elder sister and the person whom Wu Zhangkong ruthlessly rejected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Yingluo nodded her head towards her younger sister. Her eyes, however, were involuntarily attracted to the person standing on the other side. She looked at Wu Zhangkong, her eyes a bit complicated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few days ago, she witnessed the battle between Wu Zhangkong and Guang Biao, and it had etched a deep impression in her mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But this didn’t wipe off the scar that Wu Zhangkong had left in her heart. </span><i><span style>Which part of me doesn’t deserve you?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wu Zhangkong, just you wait. I’ll ensure your cheeks will be pressed against the ground, and I’ll make that arrogant coldness of yours disappear.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong felt as though someone was watching him from afar, so he turned around to look. Though Ye Yingluo’s heart was full of hatred towards him, she involuntarily tried to pose in her best position when he looked over at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But...</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was that look of his?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Yingluo was infuriated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Wu Zhangkong’s eyes rested on her, they didn’t stay at all. Furthermore, his gaze was emotionless when they swept past her, as if nothing was out of the ordinary.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bastard! This person, he’s still a bastard.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Yingrong saw the expression on her sister’s face and knew it meant nothing good. She understood this arrogant sister of hers well enough to know that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Yingluo was given the title of child prodigy when she was younger. Her failure in getting accepted into Shrek Academy had devastated her, changing her into a highly temperamental person. Thus, when she had been rejected by Wu Zhangkong, she became like this.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sister, you should know very well that whatever you do won’t help. There is no place for us in this man’s eyes. To put it plainly, we have never been on the same level as him! Regardless of what you do, it won’t change anything.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Ye Yingrong didn’t dare voice these words out loud to her elder sister, as she was highly aware that with her elder sister’s temperament, Ye Yingluo might go mad if she was told this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yangzi, help me teach them a good lesson.” Ye Ying Luo turned back and barked ferociously at the calm teenager who stood behind her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, teacher.” There was a flash of light in the eyes of this teenager by the name of Yangzi before he regained his previously calm demeanour.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Director Long Hengxu walked up the stage at this point in time. He first nodded his head to both classes’ teachers in acknowledgement before he began to speak in a deep voice, “This ranking tournament had previously been postponed because of the typhoon. Today will be the fourth match; first grade’s class five will be competing against first grade’s class one. First grade class five’s Teacher Wu, how many participants from your side will compete today?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Hengxu’s mood was very complicated at this point in time. He had wanted first grade class five to be defeated quickly to prevent those black horses from climbing up. Class sorting was a duty of his, so if these participants from class five were still undefeated, he would be very ashamed of his decisions!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The academy would then question him on his class sorting decisions. In particular, their audit would be on the possibility of first grade class five remaining undefeated. This would include some leads into the investigation of Wu Zhangkong’s methods of teaching, but would ultimately cover his error in the sorting of students into classes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong’s display of strength and power that day, however, had aided in easing the difficult situation for him. At least, Wu Zhangkong’s teaching ability was recognised by most of the school directors. A direct advancement opportunity was thus created for this Teacher Wu into the Advanced Academy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, it would be very advantageous for the academy to have someone this powerful within Eastsea Academy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Competitions were rife within academies in every city, especially so within the intermediate academies. In the advanced academies, the sole purpose of these students was to bring glory to their academy by competing against higher ranked academies and winning. As these academies became more renowned, they would naturally attract better students to enroll in their academies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, after what happened that day, Long Hengxu didn’t really dare to offend Wu Zhangkong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Our class will have…” Wu Zhangkong was about to mention that two would be competing from his class when a voice traveled to him from behind first grade class five.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher Wu, please wait.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this familiar voice, Xie Xie and Gu Yue, who were standing behind Wu Zhangkong, broke out into surprised grins.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd parted, and a worn and weary Tang Wulin rushed to the front.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His current appearance starved him from others’ compliments as his hair was unkempt and a pale pallor painted the whole of his face. He appeared to be breathing erratically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where did you run off to? Why did you only come now?” Xie Xie snapped at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin grimaced as he answered. “It’s a long story. Let’s compete first. Teacher Wu, I’m able to battle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong looked towards him with an expressionless face and nodded his head before speaking to Long Hengxu again, “We have three participants from our class.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Hengxu replied, “First grade's class one may select three students to compete as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Yingluo tilted her head upward. “Fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Hengxu spoke again, “Participants from both classes, please enter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue moved towards Tang Wulin’s side and whispered, “Do you think you can compete? How’s your body?” While she could see that there was something wrong with Tang Wulin, his body emitted an aura that further befuddled her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m fine.” Tang Wulin had regained, once again, that grin of confidence from before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue nodded her head, “Let’s win together.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin moved to occupy the center position once more. Xie Xie and Gu Yue were positioned behind him as the trio walked together up towards the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other side, class one’s three students entered the stage as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m Zhang Yangzi,” said the calm teenager in the center.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wei Xiaofeng, we’ve met a while ago.” Wei Xiao Feng reached out his hand and stuck out his thumb before slowly twisting his wrist downward, issuing a provocative move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You!” Xie Xie was infuriated and was about to rush up towards him, but was prevented from doing so by Tang Wulin grabbing his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie was shocked as he eyed Tang Wulin. </span><i><span style>This guy’s strength grew again!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Wang Jinxi.” The wiry student from class one introduced himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin introduced his side. “First grade’s class five, Tang Wulin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Yue.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xie Xie!” Xie Xie’s eyes were brimming with iciness as he stared at Wei Xiaofeng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Hengxu observed both teams. There seemed to be a powerful smell of gunpowder even when the match had yet to begin. He scowled as he emphasized again, “Let me make myself clear once more. This is a school tournament. In this tournament, there will only be winning and losing, nothing else. No participant shall harm the competitor. If they do so, they will be punished severely by the Academy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood!” All six of the participants shouted in unison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good. Prepare yourselves; both sides please step back.” Under Long Hengxu’s supervision, both teams moved back and opened up the distance between one another.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Start!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd hollered out loud in companion to the director’s command, signifying the start of the first grade’s final match in the tournament.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From both sides of class one and class five, Wei Xiaofeng and Xie Xie respectively rushed forward at the same time. They had long decided that the other was an eyesore and had since been unable to tolerate one another, even before the start of the match.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that instance, two yellow soul rings appeared beneath Wei Xiaofeng’s feet. At the same time, a green ray of light appeared on his body and a small green snake appeared on his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Comparing this with Tang Wulin’s tiny earthy snake, Goldlight, his snake was vastly different. This small snake was turquoise in color and had a pair of transparent green wings. Although it looked small, it seemed very powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was even more shocking was Wei Xiaofeng’s apparent changes. He grew more flexible, and his skin now had a green tint.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be an outstanding student in class one and to be able to maintain that title, Wei Xiaofeng was obviously not an easy opponent. This was naturally demonstrated by his attainment of the two ringed realm at such a young age.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His spirit soul was a hundred-year Green Shadow Snake. It was an arduous and expensive task to search for this spirit soul which matched his body completely since his martial soul was the Green Shadow Snake. After fusing with this spirit soul, his enhancements when cultivating grew immediately, and within a short span of time, he advanced from one ring to two rings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, a hundred year spirit soul could only add two soul rings. After twenty ranks, his speed of advancement would greatly depreciate. Nevertheless, the Green Shadow Snake soul spirit had aided him in building up a strong foundation, allowing his advancement to exceed his peers by far.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Xiaofeng was also an Agility System Battle Soul Master, and as he was charging forward, he flickered from left to right, creating illusions of himself. Although he didn’t have Xie Xie’s speed, he seemed to be more agile than Xie Xie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What shocked Wei Xiaofeng the most, however, was the two yellow soul rings beneath Xie Xie’s feet. His vigor had increased greatly with the appearance of those two yellow rings.</span></p>
