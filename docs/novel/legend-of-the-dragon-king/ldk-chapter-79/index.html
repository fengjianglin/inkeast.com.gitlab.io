 <p>On the road back, Tang Wulin had a pensive look the entire trip. Gu Yue also looked somewhat thoughtful while Xie Xie wrinkled his brows. Each and every one of them had many things on their mind.</p>
 <p>“I’m going back now.” As soon as they entered the academy grounds, Gu Yue bid farewell to the other two and returned to the girl’s dormitory. As for Tang Wulin and Xie Xie, they returned to their own dorm.</p>
 <p>“Xie Xie, wait a moment,” Tang Wulin called out as they reached the door to their room.</p>
 <p>“What is it?” Xie Xie suspiciously looked at him.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin looked him in the eyes and said, “I think I know how to get my golden scales to appear now.”</p>
 <p>Xie Xie was startled. “You know? Hurry up and spit it out then.”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin said, “I tried nearly everything to get it to happen after the first time it appeared, but no matter how I circulated my soul power, hurt myself, or exhausted my soul power, it never appeared. Its appearance today may seem sudden, but it’s the same as the first time it appeared.”</p>
 <p>“What is it?’ Xie Xie seemed to have grasped an idea of what it was.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin said, “It’s the Light Dragon Dagger. Your Light Dragon Dagger. The first time the golden scales appeared was when you injured me with the dagger. When it appeared today, it was also because you scratched me with your Light Dragon Dagger.”</p>
 <p>A radiance began to twinkle in Xie Xie’s eyes. “That’s right! It does seem to be so. But, why is it like this?”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin shook his head. “I don’t know. I don’t even know what those golden scales are. It doesn’t seem to be related to my Bluesilver Grass.”</p>
 <p>Xie Xie said, “Could it be that you have a second martial soul too? Maybe it’s just that your second martial soul is hidden, and you need a special kind of power to arouse it from its slumber.”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin responded, “I don’t really understand what twin martial souls are so I’m not sure if that could be it.” He could sense the power from his golden scales, and if it truly was his second martial soul, then he wouldn’t be a Soul Master with a trash martial soul anymore. With those thoughts in mind, Tang Wulin’s heartbeat couldn’t help but speed up.</p>
 <p>Xie Xie said, “Let’s go look for Teacher Wu and ask then. Teacher Wu is experienced and knowledgeable, so he might be able to explain what it is.”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin mulled over it for a moment before agreeing. “Alright then. Let’s go look for Teacher Wu tomorrow.”</p>
 <p>Xie Xie began pulling on his arm. “You still want to wait until tomorrow? Let’s just go right now. Come on. Teacher Wu shouldn’t have gone to bed this early.”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin said helplessly, “Why are you even more impatient than me?”</p>
 <p>Xie Xie laughed mischievously. “It’s because your body has this kind of situation! Even more things could be hidden in your body, and if there are, I’ll definitely benefit from it!”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin asked with a trace of suspicion, “What do you mean?”</p>
 <p>Xie Xie answered, “Martial soul fusion skill! Don’t tell me that you haven’t heard of it before? When two people have a highly compatible martial soul, they’ll be able to use a powerful combined ability, which is called a martial soul fusion skill. The higher the compatibility rate between the two martial souls, the stronger the fusion skill. If we really do do have a soul fusion skill, that would simply be too wonderful!”</p>
 <p>With regards to martial souls and their capabilities, Xie Xie was clearly much more knowledgeable than Tang Wulin.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin had heard of soul fusion skills before. In the world of Soul Masters, it was a peak existence! In fact, there wasn’t anyone in the entire Eastsea City who was capable of using a soul fusion skill!</p>
 <p>The teacher’s living quarters were also in the dormitory building. In order to make it convenient to supervise the students, the class teachers would all live on the same floor as their class. Thus, Tang Wulin and Xie Xie only needed to walk down the hall to get to Wu Zhangkong’s room.</p>
 <p><i>Bang bang!</i> Xie Xie knocked on the door.</p>
 <p>“Who is it?” Wu Zhangkong’s ice-cold voice came from within.</p>
 <p>“Teacher Wu, it’s me, Xie Xie. Tang Wulin and I have something to consult with you about,” stated Xie Xie.</p>
 <p>“Come in then.” The door opened, revealing a Wu Zhangkong clad in pajamas.</p>
 <p>His moon-white pajamas outlined his slender figure. As they looked into the depths of his eyes, Tang Wulin and Xie Xie couldn’t help but recall the hardships they’d endured during their special training.</p>
 <p>As a teacher, Wu Zhangkong naturally got a room to himself. In fact, his room was twice as large as Tang Wulin and Xie Xie’s room. It had a personal washroom, dressing room, bedroom, and a small living room.</p>
 <p>Xie Xie stuck out his tongue and said, “Teacher Wu, we’ve interrupted your cultivation.”</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong shook his head. “Out with it already. What’s the matter?”</p>
 <p>Xie Xie unexpectedly nudged Tang Wulin. After taking a moment to arrange his thoughts, Tang Wulin said to Wu Zhangkong, “Teacher Wu, there seems to be a problem with my martial soul.”</p>
 <p>“Oh?” Wu Zhangkong’s originally calm expression suddenly revealed a trace a surprise. He had already confirmed that Tang Wulin’s Bluesilver Grass was a variant, moreover, it had mutated in a good way. Yet now, he was saying that there was an issue with his martial soul. That likely meant that his Bluesilver Grass was mutating even further. This was definitely a good thing.</p>
 <p>“What kind of issue?” Wu Zhangkong asked.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin explained what had happened the last two times with his golden scales, as well as his guesses and evaluation.</p>
 <p>“Golden scales?” Wu Zhangkong’s eyebrows bunched together. Tang Wulin’s situation was indeed something rarely seen. Moreover, Xie Xie’s judgement was very correct as well. With such a situation, a hidden second martial soul or a soul fusion skill was the most likely possibility.</p>
 <p>“Xie Xie, stab him and try it out. Let’s see if the same thing happens again,” Wu Zhangkong said to Xie Xie.”</p>
 <p>“Yes!” Xie Xie looked at Tang Wulin with malicious eyes as he released his Light Dragon Dagger and happily laughed. “Wulin ah! Where do you think is a good place to stab you?”</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong glared at him. “Less nonsense. Hurry up with it.”</p>
 <p>Xie Xie stuck out his tongue as Tang Wulin extended his arm.</p>
 <p>Xie Xie carefully cut Tang Wulin’s arm with his Light Dragon Dagger. This time, his movements were very slow. Three pairs of eyes attentively watched.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin felt a burst of pain come from his arm, but he was astonished to discover that faint rays of light poured into his body from the Light Dragon Dagger and through his wound.</p>
 <p>A tenseness was felt as the scorching feeling from before appeared once again. His body ignited the same way as before, the scorching heat wave spread from his tailbone all the way to the rest of his body. Golden scales began appearing on his arm.</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong raised his hand and caused a sharp stream of air to scrape against Tang Wulin. Tang Wulin’s shirt was cut into tatters, exposing his upper body.</p>
 <p>Golden scales covered all of Tang Wulin’s right arm and his arm had lengthened a bit as well. Beautiful, sparkling golden scales had instantly covered his arm. His hand had also begun to change. Inch long claws began sprouting out of his five fingers.</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong reached out and gripped Tang Wulin’s palm. He said deeply, “Exert force.”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin knew it was impossible for him to injure his teacher, so he hastily exerted force through his right arm, kneading Wu Zhangkong’s right hand.</p>
