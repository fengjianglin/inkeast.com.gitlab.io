 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;289 - Tang Wulin the Wicked</strong></span></p>
 <p><span style>The whirlwind of elements grew until it was five meters high. Just when Tang Wulin and the others felt it was about to go berserk, Gu Yue gently said, “Go!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Spirit Ice Plaza wasn’t dirty to begin with, merely covered in dust. There wasn’t even a single piece of trash in sight. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A bizarre scene played out the moment Gu Yue’s whirlpool landed on the plaza. Dust gathered together, whirling around the hurricane in a frenzy before being sucked inside and leaving the floor as spotless as if it had been scrubbed by a brush.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue withdrew her first and third soul skills, leaving only Elemental Control in effect as she followed the whirlpool forward. They began to walk around the plaza, watching everything within its path become clean. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow!” Xu Xiaoyan clapped gleefully. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She really is amazing! </span></i><span style>Tang Wulin inwardly gave Gu Yue a thumbs up. She was the most skilled master of elements he had ever seen. Moreover, not only could she wield six different elements she could even fuse them together into infinite offensive and defensive moves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her future was boundless. She was the first soul master in history to wield so many elements. With fire, water, wind, earth, light, space, and the variant ice attribute, nothing was impossible for her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>If they were ordinary people instead, even two days worth of time wouldn’t be enough to finish cleaning the plaza. Yet, in the face of Gu Yue’s water-and-wind whirlwind sucking in dust and cleaning everything within a twenty meter radius, this task would be completed without breaking much sweat. At their current speed, they would be finished within three hours. This was obviously assuming that Gu Yue’s soul and spiritual power would last. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In truth, Gu Yue was no superhuman. She was forced to recall the now black whirlpool and drain it into sewers after cleaning a third of the plaza. She then walked off to the side and sat down cross-legged to meditate. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’d be embarrassed if I let Gu Yue do it all,” Xie Xie mischievously grinned. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin smiled. “Then you can just treat us to dinner tonight.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie saw through Tang Wulin’s scheme, however. “Sure, as long as you’re not coming! Those two girls can’t eat much, but if we add you, I’d be concerned if the restaurant even has enough stock. I swear, your stomach is an endless hole!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin chuckled. “You’re so insincere.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine!” Xie Xie ground his teeth as he reluctantly said, “I’ll treat you all to dinner. But! You have to finish those black buns before we go out.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Those black steamed buns would do well to curb Tang Wulin’s appetite. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They left the rest of the plaza to Gu Yue. In the meantime, Tang Wulin, Xie Xie, and Xu Xiaoyan would spruce up their dorm room. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They had only received two sets of school uniforms and a Shrek Academy identification card when they were registered. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The card was made of metal and had obvious signs of soul circuits running within it. The administrator had told them they needed this card to go anywhere within the academy, as well as leaving and entering. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shrek Academy’s administration wasn’t extremely strict though. They didn’t actually restrict its student’s passage in and out of the academy. Besides, the outer court was a small town in of itself. Students could find everything needed for their daily lives here and rarely needed to leave campus. </span></p>
 <p><span style>While Gu Yue cleaned up the plaza, Tang Wulin went to go buy some planks. He had Xie Xie use his daggers to fashion proper beds out of them. As for the mattress, they had actually brought their own. After buying a cloth to divide the space, the room had shaped up quite nicely. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But they stopped there. Tang Wulin believed that since the dormitory was for working students, it would be best if they didn’t live extravagantly compared to the others. At the very least, they all understood how fatal it could be for them to act blindly without thinking. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin had already noticed that not all the rooms in the dormitory were occupied. In fact, only three or four rooms had signs of any recent occupation. Even then, those rooms appeared simple and crude on the outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since this living condition seemed to be a tradition among working students, it wasn’t their place to break the status quo. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue’s cleaning speed was unbelievably quick with the use of her martial soul, but it still took her until noon, a total of four and a half hours to finish cleaning the gigantic plaza. Of those hours, half were simply spent recovering her soul power. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The four meditated in their room together in the afternoon. Though they had just enrolled and were still unfamiliar with Shrek Academy, they could already feel a mountain of pressure weighing down on their shoulders. </span></p>
 <p><span style>All the continent’s geniuses gathered here in this haven and while Tang Wulin and the others may be exceptionally talented, Shrek Academy had no shortage of students of their caliber. There were people like that student number two who had stomped Xie Xie. None of the four companions would dare say they could absolutely defeat him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The only way they could flourish in Shrek Academy was to become stronger faster. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The dining hall was enormous and filled to the brim, as if all of the outer court students were packed into the place. Unlike normal students, working students had to pay for their meals here with points obtained from completing jobs. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Since it was their first day at the academy, however, they were allowed a free meal. They would only start paying tomorrow. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They had received one hundred Shrek contribution points each after completing their assignment at the administration building, but it was then that Tang Wulin discovered that one hundred points was only enough to feed them for one day. Moreover, they faced another problem; to be more precise, Tang Wulin faced a problem. His stomach was simply too gluttonous and the dining hall wasn’t a buffet. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, the dining hall served food comparable to Eastsea Academy’s first window. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’d be great if I could eat here for free. </span></i><span style>Tang Wulin exclaimed inwardly as he ate lunch. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Since their dinner was free tonight as well, Xie Xie would treat them on another day. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps, because he had to start paying for his meals the next day, Tang Wulin finally revealed his true wickedness during dinner. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He first found a large table. Then, he started collecting food. The dining hall was large enough to accommodate one thousand diners at a time, so his actions were laid bare for all to see. He went from window to window, showing his Shrek ID card to get as much free food as he could carry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At first, few took notice of his actions, but by the time his table had three levels of food stacked up, people began to watch. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A stern-looking man around twenty years old wearing a red armband walked over. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m Xie Peichen, a member of the discipline committee. Which class are you from? Why did you get so much food? Don’t you know that according to the academy’s rules, if you waste food, you have to pay ten times its weight as a fine?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin stopped mid-step. “Hello senior. I can finish all of this food.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can finish all of this? By yourself?” Xie Peichen’s voice raised an octave. He had originally thought that all this food was for him and his classmates to eat together, but that wasn’t the case. Tang Wulin had filled a table for ten with enough food to feed thirty! </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah. I can finish this all myself. I still have three friends joining me though,” Tang Wulin sincerely answered. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Four people can finish all of this?” Xie Peichen was evidently not convinced. With how nourishing the dining hall’s food was, people generally didn’t need to eat as much to become full. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin nodded earnestly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, let’s see you eat it all then. If you can’t finish, don’t blame me for being rude.” Though Xie Peichen’s had a dark expression, but he couldn’t do anything as Tang Wulin had yet to violate any rules. He stood to the side and watched. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin smiled, exposing his sparkling white teeth. “Senior, how about we make a bet? If I finish all this food, you’ll help me get another round. If I can’t, you can punish me as you wish.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.” Xie Peichen agreed immediately. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With the bet established, Tang Wulin began eating. He ate leisurely, taking his time. Nonetheless, his eating speed was shocking. </span></p>
