 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s martial soul had already become an extension of his own body, but his control over it during combat wasn’t great—he simply used it like rope. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong was able to clearly discern these issues, but he didn’t talk to Tang Wulin about them because he knew just how amazing Tang Wulin’s perception was. He had faith in that Tang Wulin would discover these flaws himself. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, Wu Zhangkong wanted to see if Tang Wulin’s bloodline power would gain any other effects when he reached rank 20. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But now, he didn’t even need to wait until Tang Wulin reached that rank. The answer had already presented itself. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If it’s like this, then the growth of his martial soul is something to look forward to.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong had never believed that Bluesilver Grass was a weak martial soul. After all, the strongest member of the first generation of Shrek Seven Monsters, who was also the strongest Soul Master in history, had eventually ascended to godhood with Bluesilver Grass at the beginning. It was through using Bluesilver Grass that he had taken one step after another on the path toward godhood. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In the last 20,000 years, apart from the Spirit Pagoda’s founder, no one else had been able to ascend to godhood. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Bluesilver Grass wasn’t necessarily as weak as one may think. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The radiance emitting from Tang Wulin gradually dim. Little Goldlight opened its mouth wide as if to yawn before lowering its head, disappearing into Tang Wulin’s body. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With the evolution now complete, Tang Wulin stopped glowing and entered a deep slumber. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The evolution of a spirit soul would lead to many changes both in the martial soul and the Soul Master. An improvement in one’s martial soul also led to gains for the Soul Master as a whole. Whether it be in terms of strength, speed, soul power, reaction speed, or the tenacity of one’s body; all of them would be increased. </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>☀</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The evolution had taken a long time and left Tang Wulin exhausted. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That was some great sleep! </span></i><span style>Tang Wulin woke up the next day feeling incredible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since he broke the first seal on the Golden Dragon King, he felt as if his whole body were swollen. But now, this feeling had disappeared, leaving a pleasant surprise in its place. His soul power had increased a bit, and though it had yet to reach rank 15, this increase was still something that would have taken far longer had he cultivated normally. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems I benefited a lot from yesterday’s battle! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re up?” The sudden voice gave Tang Wulin quite the scare. He looked over to discover Wu Zhangkong sitting legs crossed on a chair nearby. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher, you…” After staring blankly at Wu Zhangkong for a moment, Tang Wulin started to recall the events of the previous evening, and of how Wu Zhangkong had watched over him throughout the night. His heart surged with warmth as he quickly got off his bed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong met his eyes and said, “Wash up and go eat breakfast. Your spirit soul has evolved so we can go test the changes that your soul skill gained after that.” Having finished speaking, he got up, patted Tang Wulin on the shoulder, then left. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Spirit soul evolution? A spirit soul evolution! My spirit soul evolved! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin stood there stunned. His spirit soul had always been a sore spot for him. His heart would ache whenever he saw his comrades and their hundred-year spirit souls. He compared them with his own mere ten-year spirit soul. With his competitive spirit, it had simply been too demoralizing! </span></p>
 <p><span style>When Xie Xie told him about the possibility of a spirit soul evolving in the spirit ascension platform, he hadn’t seriously taken it to heart. After all, it wasn’t something he would even dare dream of. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But Wu Zhangkong wouldn’t lie to him! </span></p>
 <p><span style>With a flash of light, his Bluesilver Grass appeared and a halo rose from beneath him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The originally white soul ring had been transformed into a soul ring with a gentle yellow glow!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was yellow! A hundred-year soul ring!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Goldlight slithered out onto Tang Wulin’s shoulder. Tang Wulin lifted his hand toward it and it slithered onto his palm. After carefully examining Goldlight, Tang Wulin’s eyes became a bit dull as he reminisced for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not too long ago, he had been filled with sorrow to the point of wishing for death due to this little Goldlight. It had been a defective spirit soul that represented three years worth of hard earned money. Amidst his despair at that time, it had only been due to his sheer willpower that he had been able to persevere! At last, his source of sorrow had now turned into a source of joy! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Goldlight could no longer be considered trash now that it had evolved. As a hundred-year spirit soul, it could provide him with two soul rings. This meant that he didn’t need to purchase another spirit soul for a while longer. With Goldlight’s evolution, he could save even more money and buy the spirit items needed to break the second seal. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin released a long sigh as these thoughts crossed his mind. He felt that now, endless possibilities had opened up to him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bind!” With his command, strand after strand of Bluesilver Grass shot out and bound everything in his room. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Along with the evolution of his spirit soul, Tang Wulin discovered that his Bluesilver Grass had grown thicker, become more tenacious, and consumed less soul power than before. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When he used his soul skill, a golden color, the same as Goldlight’s color, appeared in his mind. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This had never happened before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Goldlight, what’s this? You…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Without even waiting for Tang Wulin to finish speaking, Goldlight suddenly sprang forth and sank into the numerous strands of Bluesilver Grass. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately, several strands of Bluesilver Grass turned golden as they were covered by a fine layer of scales . </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is… </span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is this a fusion of the spirit soul and martial soul? It is! Little Goldlight isn’t a defective product anymore. He can help me in combat now! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Wulin tugged on a strand of golden Bluesilver Grass, he immediately discovered that not only was it tougher than before, it was also stronger than the other normal strands of Bluesilver Grass. This strand of Bluesilver Grass felt as if it were an extension of himself, like an additional limb. Although it wasn’t nearly as strong as his right arm with the golden scales, it was still only just slightly weaker than his left arm. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is a hundred-year spirit soul! With how strong my Bluesilver Grass is now, my Bind will definitely be much more impactful from now on!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s face was plastered with a knowing smile as he rushed out of his room, cheering. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was still early in the morning and the first glimmers of light had just then creeped up over the horizon. After washing his face, he madly rushed over to the training field. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Evolved. My spirit soul evolved! I’m the same as the others now. I have a hundred-year spirit soul too! With a hundred-year soul ring! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin shouted with excitement in his heart as the wind swept past him, seemingly dispersing the haze within him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This spirit soul evolution didn’t only upgrade his strength, it had also given him peace of mind. He was able to circulate his soul power more smoothly than before, while the power of his bloodline and martial soul seemed to fuse under these bizarre circumstances. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Standing outside the dormitory’s doors, Ouyang Zixin stared at the scene in shock. A youngster was running wildly on the training field with his arms spread wide.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s going on with him? </span></i><span style>Ouyang Zixin couldn’t help but smile at this scene. </span><i><span style>This boy is really interesting. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After running for some time, Tang Wulin caught sight of a beautiful figure and slowed his pace at last. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good morning senior sister!” Tang Wulin wasn’t his usual bashful self today and had actually taken the initiative to call out to Ouyang Zixin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s large eyes were shining and his cheeks flushed with wildness, showing off his youthful vigor. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you so happy junior brother?” Ouyang Zixin curiously asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin laughed. “It’s nothing really. I merely made a breakthrough in my cultivation so I’m pretty happy.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ouyang Zixin beamed a smile at him. “That’s good then. Fight on! M</span><i><span style>n</span></i><span style>. This is how a kid should act. You shouldn’t always be so depressed, looking like an old man. After all, you’re still only ten years old.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Child?</span></i><span style> Tang Wulin was stunned and awkwardness filled his heart. </span><i><span style>So I’m just a child in her eyes… </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s body was feverishly hot by the time the sky had lit up and he went to the dining hall. The first window provided nourishing gourmet food that comforted Tang Wulin’s gloomy heart. After all, wasn’t a good frame of mind beneficial to his cultivation speed? </span></p>
