<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;230 - Spirit Item Exchange</strong></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Because of Wu Zhangkong’s identity as both a Soul Sage and a two-word battle armor master, the doors to the inner sect opened for him. The inner sect cared about neither experience nor origin; only strength and contributions mattered. Once one fulfilled both requirements, one would be let into the illustrious inner sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that he was a part of the inner sect, he could learn the rest of the Tang Sect’s secret arts and gained access to more of the sect’s resources. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mission turn in,” Tang Wulin said to the screen before retrieving several chunks of metal in a flash of light. These materials were his mission’s objective. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, he was accepting missions from both the Blacksmith’s Association and the Tang Sect. The tasks completed for the Association gave him money. On the other hand, he accrued contribution points from the Tang Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Apart from its secret arts, the Tang Sect offered various products exclusive to the sect. It was for these products that Tang Wulin was exchanging his points. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Three pieces of first-grade thousand-refined metal: 600 points. Available contribution points: 8463.” The electronic voice announced his new total. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s eyes twinkled with excitement as he tapped the screen a few times, navigating to a list of spirit items. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ignoring the rest of the inventory, he scrolled down until he found the particular ingredient he wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thousand-year Land Dragon Tendon: a legendary spirit medicine that can refine a soul master’s physique without any side effects. Perfect condition. Price: 3,900 contribution points. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin did not hesitate to tap the ‘purchase’ button before resuming his search.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A moment later, he stopped looking. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Thousand-year Sea Dragon Marrow: a legendary spirit medicine that refines a soul master’s body and strengthens their qi and blood without any side effects. Perfect condition. Price: 4,500 contribution points. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Exchange! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After securing the item, he let out a long sigh, his eyes glistening like clusters of stars. </span></p>
 <p><span style>During his trip three years ago to Heaven Dou City with Wu Zhangkong, he had managed to buy a thousand-year Dragonscale Fruit. Afterward, he discovered that the thousand-year Land Dragon Tendon and Sea Dragon Marrow were on the Tang Sect’s inventory. After hoarding his points, he was able to lay his hands on them. Now, he only needed a thousand-year Azure-veined Vine. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he had yet to turn fourteen, he was in no rush to obtain the last item. He was confident that with his savings, he could acquire the precious ingredient at an auction or through some other means without an issue. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Once the time came, his martial soul would evolve even further. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was left with a pitiful 603 contribution points after splurging. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Tang Wulin was about to logout, the electronic voice spoke. “Tang Wulin, congratulations. You have surpassed 15,000 total contribution points and will now be promoted to class five. You can now enjoy even more benefits from the Tang Sect and the exchange list has been expanded.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Class five?&nbsp;</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Since he neither possessed twin souls like Xie Xie nor had more than two rings, he had not been promoted in a while. He had never expected to reach class five before receiving his third soul ring. Naturally, Tang Wulin understood how rare his situation was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A class five associate enjoyed much higher privileges than a class four associate. The pool of available missions was enlarged; the number of Tang Sect arts currently opened to him was increased. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Generally speaking, Tang Sect missions were not dangerous, rewarding few contribution points as a result. Despite this, the exchange rate of the goods they offered beat the market’s by a long shot. Tang Wulin had accumulated a small fortune through the Blacksmith’s Association and acquired these two spirit items thanks to his efforts these past three years. This much already satisfied him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He was a step away from finishing his preparations to break the second seal. This was a beneficial occasion for him</span></p>
 <p><span style>The memory of his first unsealing was still fresh in his mind. Old Tang had informed him that after the second seal, a nice surprise would be waiting for him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Now, he could wholeheartedly look forward to it. It was so close. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie also turned in a resource collection mission, but received a paltry hundred or so contribution points. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyan has been cultivating a lot recently. She hasn’t even done any missions,” Tang Wulin said to Xie Xie. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Xiaoyan had passed the middle level test and joined the Tang Sect a year after them. Due to the special properties of her Starwheel Ice Staff, she had ascended the ranks with remarkable speed, becoming a class three associate. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Tang Sect’s administration was relatively relaxed and did not force members to take on missions. The missions that awarded the most contribution points were also the most dangerous. Even so, Tang Sect regulations forbade anyone under sixteen from accepting life-threatening missions. It was the sect’s way of protecting its fledgling members. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Xiaoyan’s recent devotion to cultivation was fueled by her soul rank, which hovered over the peak of rank 29. She was itching to hit rank 30, a major milestone for soul masters. Such an event wasn’t limited to acquiring an additional soul ring; one could also fuse with a second spirit soul, improving one’s power drastically. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you going to accept another mission?” Xie Xie asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin shook his head. “Aren’t we about to head off to Shrek City? It’s not a good time to take another mission. I’ll consider it once we return.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie winked. “Maybe we won’t return at all?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin smiled wryly. “That would be awesome.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The two left the Tang Sect and ran back to Eastsea Academy. In reality, class zero had continued to exist the whole time, simply hidden from the public’s eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The battle three years ago had brought Wu Zhangkong’s name to fame, overshadowing his four spectacular disciples. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He was a battle armor master! The fact that an intermediate academy had a battle armor master working as a teacher took the Skysea Alliance by storm. Therefore, hordes of students applied to Eastsea Academy. Class zero’s lackluster results weren’t given much thought apparently. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The academy had wanted to transfer more students into class zero on several occasions, but Wu Zhangkong refused vehemently each time. Even the academy president, Yu Zhen, could not persuade him. After all, he was a two-word battle armor master! The difference in status between the two was as great as night and day. Yu Zhen was already more than happy that Wu Zhangkong agreed to continue teaching. </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>☀ </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The office of Eastsea Academy’s president. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher Wu, are you sure about this?” Yu Zhen’s brows were creased, his expression grave, and his gaze wavering. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong said calmly, “From the academy’s perspective, raising outstanding students who achieve great things and drawing in more talented students are of the highest priority. We have already been nourishing class zero for three-and-a-half years; don’t you want them to contribute to the academy? Being admitted to that academy</span><span style>&nbsp;is a far better achievement than anything else. When the time comes, the academy can announce it to the public. Surely many will be drawn here.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Zhen frowned. “Isn’t it a bit too early?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong shook his head. “Shrek Academy only holds its entrance exams once every three years. They’re already thirteen years old; if they don’t go now, they’ll miss their only chance.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Zhen still couldn’t yield. “But didn’t you come from Shrek Academy, Teacher Wu? In my opinion, you should be more than enough to teach them.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong’s eyes narrowed before he shook his head once more. “I can to a degree, but only that much. They need to lay down a proper foundation in preparation for the future.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Zhen’s heart skipped a beat. “The future? Teacher Wu, in your opinion, how high can they reach?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Without any doubt in his voice, Wu Zhangkong proclaimed, “Battle armor master!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Trembles gripped Yu Zhen, droplets of sweat bouncing from each hair as they descended his back. He understood the weight of those words. Sucking in a deep breath, he stood up. “Fine. I only request one thing of you then: in the future, when the children are battle armor masters, have them visit us and give a talk to our students.” </span></p>
