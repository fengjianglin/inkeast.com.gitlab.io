 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;297 - Working Student Yuanen</strong></span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, some heaven-defying genius mecha designers and makers had reached the same heights as Tang Wulin at his age. However, it was easier to progress through later stages as a blacksmith than as a designer or maker. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After reaching the fifth rank, blacksmiths only needed to keep forging in order to one day reach the sixth. Designers and makers, on the other hand, had to overcome huge hurdles to progress to each rank after the fifth. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Most people found designing or making mechas more appealing, and due to the fast rate of growth early on, many chose to become designers or makers. Not all soul masters were suited for blacksmithing. Forging took a toll on one’s body, and it was a tedious job. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s stomach growled. It had been ten minutes since he had begun advertising at the door, yet no one had so much as looked at him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gloom haunted Tang Wulin as he fought back his hunger. </span><i><span style>I’m starving! If no one bites, then I’ll just have to chug some water to fill my stomach. At least I’ll earn one thousand points after completing the forging job and have enough for dinner. If I have to miss a meal, there’s nothing I can do about it. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin came to terms with his misfortune with gritted teeth. </span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, he heard a soft voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can thousand refine?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?” Tang Wulin raised his head and to his astonishment, saw his fellow working student, Yuanen. “Yeah! That’s right!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuanen looked as ordinary as he usually did, but his eyes blazed with intensity. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Instead of treating you for a year, I’ll give you 1100 points for a first-grade thousand refining,” Yuanen offered. “What do you say?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Eleven hundred? That’s more than what the Academy is offering!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright!” Tang Wulin had no reason to refuse. Right now, food was the most important thing. “But you have to pay me first. I don’t have any money to buy food.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine. You cover the transaction fee though,” Yuanen said. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Transaction fee?” Tang Wulin exclaimed, confusion on his face. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“All contribution point transactions between students are subject to a one percent fee that the Academy takes,” Yuanen explained. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s horrible! Absolutely criminal! </span></i><span style>Tang Wulin thought in horror. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about you just treat me to a meal instead?” Tang Wulin countered “You won’t have to pay me directly.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin calculated the costs and came to the conclusion that, if he didn’t gorge himself as much as he did yesterday, 1100 points would be enough to feed him for the day. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After yesterday, however, he understood how important it was for him to eat good food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Highly nutritious food helped increase his blood essence. Furthermore, Old Tang said that breaking later seals would be easier if he ate such food every day. An increase to his blood essence meant an improvement in his body as well as his blood essence soul ring, so eating was another method of cultivation for him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>During today’s class, Shen Yi told them that the stronger a soul master’s body was, the sooner they could try using battle armor. Even two-ring soul masters could use battle armor, but they would obviously only be able to use the smallest of parts. If a blacksmith spirit refined the metal used to create battle armor, the user’s body would then have to be even stronger to use it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Rank fifty soul power was required to become a battle armor master because, by then, a soul master’s soul power would have tempered their body enough. The process of a user fusing with battle armor would cause a shock to their mind, body, and martial soul. The more armor parts they fused with, the stronger the shock would be.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since that was the case, refining and increasing his blood essence would not only help him break seals in the future, it would also increase his chances of becoming a battle armor master. Investing his hard-earned contribution points was painful for Tang Wulin, but first-grade thousand refining was nothing to the current him. Now that he was a fifth-rank blacksmith, completing ten first-grade thousand refinings in a day posed no problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, such success required him to devote all of his attention to forging. Despite him being such a penny pincher, even Tang Wulin understood there were some things he couldn’t cut corners on!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright,” Yuanen agreed readily. Many students did such things to avoid paying the fees. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin put away his advertisement board and followed Yuanen into the dining hall. In spite of how hungry he was, he didn’t dare to cause a scene like the night before. He utilized all of his experience eating at Eastsea Academy’s first window to choose the most nourishing foods to feast upon. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Once he had picked them out, his meal totaled roughly 420 contribution points. He had never eaten so extravagantly before. After all, if a meal paid for with a first-grade thousand refining wasn’t luxury, then nothing was. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have a question for you, Tang Wulin.” Having finished eating long ago, Yuanen watched Tang Wulin digging in, an eyebrow raised. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? What’s up?” Tang Wulin set aside his thirtieth plate and wiped his mouth. He nearly felt satisfied now, but he definitely still had room for more. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue, Xie Xie, and Xu Xiaoyan had long since finished eating and left. Yuanen had only stayed because he still needed to pay for Tang Wulin’s food. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you really human?” Yuanen asked earnestly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh… Of course I am,” Tang Wulin said. “I can just eat a bit more than normal, that’s all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But... you know that overeating is bad for you, right?” Concern filled Yuanen’s voice. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin shook his head. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not overeating,” he replied. “Overeating is when you occasionally gorge yourself beyond your limit. I, however, eat this much every day, so you can’t call it that. This is normal for me.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a good thing I didn’t promise to feed you for a year then. I’d go broke if I had. Well, let’s go then. You still need to forge for me.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, that’s right. I wanted to ask you, where I can find a workshop to use?” Tang Wulin asked as the two got up from the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had already discussed things over lunch. The cost of the meal would be considered Yuanen’s down payment. Tang Wulin would then thousand refine a metal of Yuanen’s choice. After that, Yuanen would pay the value of the product minus the cost of lunch by treating him to dinner. If that still wasn’t enough, he would cover Tang Wulin’s breakfast too. </span><span style>“The Academy’s Blacksmith’s Association has some,” Yuanen replied. “But if you’re not a member, you’ll have to pay a fee to use one.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blacksmith’s Association?” Tang Wulin exclaimed in astonishment. “The Academy has its own Blacksmith’s Association?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah. There are a lot of associations on campus. All of them were established by students that have rented land on campus though. Since they provide experience related to cultivating, you new students will probably receive invitations from the various associations soon. You won’t be able to improve in your second profession without joining an association here. Since you’re a blacksmith, you might as well join the Blacksmith’s Association.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>As they conversed with each other, someone ran through the doors of the dining hall. Since Tang Wulin and Yuanen were just about to leave, that person barred their way. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The person standing before them was a middle-aged man with disheveled hair as red as flame and a scorching hot aura. He wasn’t particularly tall, only about 170 centimeters tall, but his shoulders were broad. His arms were thick with muscle, each much larger than Tang Wulin’s waist. He looked like a human fortress as he stood there. </span></p>
 <p><span style>His thick beard blazed red, working with the hair on his head to give him the appearance of a lion. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately after entering the dining hall, he took a deep breath in and roared., </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is Tang Wulin? Come here!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the man’s presence wasn’t all that impressive, his shout instantly silenced the droning of over a thousand students and attracted all of their gazes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin stood only ten steps away the red-haired man, struck numb by his explosive aura.. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What kind of strength is that? </span></i><span style>He exclaimed inwardly, staring at the man in awe. </span><i><span style>He’s so powerful! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I-I am.” Tang Wulin inadvertently raised his hand. With this man blocking the doorway, he couldn’t leave anyway. Besides, Tang Wulin hadn’t offended him, so he had no reason to hide his identity. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are?” Confusion spread across the man’s face as he glared at Tang Wulin with his crimson eyes. Tang Wulin could now tell that the man was about fifty years old. He just didn’t care about his appearance and dressed slovenly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come with me!” The red-haired eccentric walked over and reached out to grab Tang Wulin’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?” Tang Wulin asked, subconsciously raising his hands to stop the man. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He took a step backward, bent his leg, and shoved both hands outward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet his attack was useless against the man. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s two hands were no match for the single hand the man reached out with. The force in his arms were easily diverted to the side, and as if the man’s arm had instantly grown longer, his large hand clamped down onto Tang Wulin’s shoulder. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A wave of dizziness washed over Tang Wulin as the man abducted him from the dining hall. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey!” Yuanen shouted. Seeing that he was about to be left behind, he quickly ran after the two. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He still needed to get his first-grade thousand refining after all. </span></p>
