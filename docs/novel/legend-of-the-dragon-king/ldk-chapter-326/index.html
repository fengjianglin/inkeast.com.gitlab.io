 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;326 - Fury</strong></span></p>
 <p><span>As soon as Xie Xie’s Twin Dragon Storm collided with the sword lights, a boom tore through the air. The explosion sent him crashing into the dormitory’s wall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>The girl’s eyes gleamed with killing intent as she pressed her attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Suddenly, a burst of golden light erupted, bright and blinding, as if a miniature sun had descended from the skies. An arrogant chuckle cut through the air. “I didn’t think you’d try your hand at killing a student at night. I’m really curious what excuses you have this time.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>As the radiant figure reached the ground, his brilliance dispelled the murky darkness. A pair of white wings unfurled to protect Xie Xie from the girl. It was Yue Zhengyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Something blazed in his eyes as he stared the red-haired girl down. “Let’s see if you can run away again this time.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>The girl shot a cold glare at him. “Screw off.” Despite how pleasant her voice sounded, the intensity of her killing intent was as palpable as ever.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Yue Zhengyu snorted. “So you’ve finally revealed your true colors as an evil soul master! How could a Fallen Angel possibly be anything but evil? Today, I’ll judge you in place of the heavens!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>His second soul ring lit up and a sword brimming with holy light materialized in his hand. Compared with the girl’s blade, the embodiment of darkness and a mixture of shadowy violet tones, Yue Zhengyu’s sword seemed entirely the opposite: radiant and golden. It was a sacred weapon created to banish evil.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>She scoffed at his display, her eyes bottomless pits. “Do you really think I’m afraid of you?” In the blink of an eye, a third purple soul ring appeared beneath her and her aura thickened and soared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Yue Zhengyu went on high alert, heart thumping and ears straining. He flapped his wings, absorbing the light element energy in the air. It struck him that this girl might possess a soul skill that concealed her true cultivation level. Perhaps during the day, he could defeat her with complete confidence. But it was currently nighttime, the domain of darkness-attribute soul masters. Moreover, her cultivation base was equal to his.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>All of a sudden, three people arrived on scene—Tang Wulin, Gu Yue, and Xu Xiaoyan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Noticing the crumpled body of his friend on the ground, Tang Wulin rushed to Xie Xie’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Are you alright?” Tang Wulin asked gravely.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Before Xie Xie could respond, Yue Zhengyu interjected, “Don’t you see? Under the cover of night, this Fallen Angel snuck into the Academy to attack us working students. Tang Wulin, what are you waiting for? Help me defeat her and bring her to the administration for judgement.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>When Tang Wulin saw blood trickling out of the corner of Xie Xie’s mouth, his expression turned grim. His friend had been injured! This was unforgivable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>After taking another glance at the mysterious girl, he recognized who she was. He marched over to Yue Zhengyu’s right and Gu Yue walked to his left. Xu Xiaoyan stood in front of Xie Xie like a shield,releasing her martial soul without another second wasted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Under the sea of twinkling stars, she called upon the power of her Starwheel Ice Staff!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Despite facing off against four working students alone, the red-haired girl didn’t betray a hint fear. She pointed her sword at them. “I’m going to kill you!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Her third soul ring lit up and once again darkness flooded the surrounding space. Her figure flickered, and she shot forward like an arrow, charging straight at Xie Xie. As she flew toward him, her wings took on a deep purple hue. Under the effects of her third soul skill, she melted into the wave of darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Sacred radiance!” Yue Zhengyu’s first soul ring gleamed and holy light erupted from his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>The holy light fought back against the encroaching darkness, revealing the girl’s flickering figure within. Each of her dancing afterimages seemed ethereal, yet tangible at the same time. The sheer intensity of her aura was like a sharp spear piercing toward them. She charged straight for Xie Xie, not a single thought paid to her defense.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Tang Wulin was taken aback.&nbsp;</span><em><span>How deep is her grudge? She’s ignoring her safety just to get to Xie Xie!&nbsp;</span></em></p>
 <p><span>As Yue Zhengyu’s third soul ring began to hum with light, he aimed his holy sword at the red-haired girl. “Light of Judgement!” A beam of light descended from the heavens.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Tang Wulin made his move as well. The girl’s killing intent toward Xie Xie fanned Tang Wulin’s fury, drummed up his resolve. Golden scales rippled into existence along his right arm, and he charged forward with a punch.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Because they were still on campus, Tang Wulin restrained himself a bit and didn’t bring out his golden dragon claw. That said, even a chunk of metal would stand not a chance before his tyrannical strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>A flash of silver, and Gu Yue appeared at Xie Xie’s side, a condensed icicle in her hands. At the same time, Xu Xiaoyan raised her staff into the air, summoning a starwheel beneath the red-haired girl.</span></p>
 <p><span>Starwheel Shackles!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>True to its name, shackles shot out of the ground an instant after the starwheel appeared, binding the red-haired girl. No matter how powerful she was, she could do nothing for at least a second in the face of the absolute restraints.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Her Starwheel Shackles had even restrained Wu Zhangkong in the past. Under the blanket of night, Xu Xiaoyan was a terrifying opponent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Trapped by Starwheel Shackles, the red-haired girl couldn’t escape the falling Light of Judgement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Don’t hurt her!” Xie Xie croaked out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Tang Wulin and Gu Yue stopped in their tracks, but Light of Judgement continued to fall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>A thundering explosion shook the very ground. The shockwave from the blast kicked up a cloud of dust and debris in a five meter radius, tossing Tang Wulin and the other three away from the blast zone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>The Holy Angel martial soul truly was formidable. While it might not be as powerful as Wu Siduo’s Hell White Tiger, it wasn’t far off! And Yue Zhengyu seemed like he still had some strength left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Most importantly, he only had three soul rings!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>The point of impact was now a charred crater, smoke hissing from it surface.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“You!” Xie Xie screamed, flinging himself toward the huge hole.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>But before he reached the edge, a dark purple light shot out from the crater.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Xie Xie, be careful!” Tang Wulin shouted, reeling in the frozen Xie Xie with a strand of bluesilver grass right before the light made contact with him. His eyes popped when he noticed how close the attack had been, missing by a few inches.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Tang Wulin’s actions illustrated his meticulousness. The moment he had arrived on scene, he had wound strands of bluesilver grass around the waists of his comrades, connecting them with him. It was preparation for yanking his friends out of harm’s way.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>From the corner of Tang Wulin’s eyes, he noticed a line of blood oozing from Xie Xie’s skin. “Xie Xie!” The second he recognized what it was, Tang Wulin burst forward like a cannonball, face contorted into a snarl. With a roar, he summoned his golden dragon claw. He didn’t bother holding back anymore. He unleashed his most powerful attack, Golden Dragon Dreadclaw, firing lines of dark-gold light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>She wasn’t playing around! She truly wanted to kill Xie Xie! Even when Xie Xie told his friends to hold back, she still chose to launch a sneak attack. If Tang Wulin hadn’t pulled Xie Xie out of range, he would be dead now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>This was neither the spirit ascension platform nor some illusory world. In the real world, <a href="https://cdn.wuxiaworld.com/uploads/hyperdimensional-space-vampire/legend-of-the-dragon-king/images/ouueyzje.xu3.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title>people die when they were killed</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Before the blades of dark-gold light collided with the fiery-haired girl, her body expanded, swelling with power and bursting with a tyrannical aura. The ground cracked under her power, the crater’s radius doubling in size, the dormitory’s glass windows shattering and falling upon the earth like solid rain..&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Yue Zhengyu’s jaw dropped as he watched the spectacle. His first impression of Tang Wulin was a new student who managed to get into Shrek Academy on the merit of his blacksmithing genius. However, he now understood how wrong he had been. Tang Wulin was far more formidable than he had imagined! Even with his three soul rings, Yue Zhengyu felt a chill run down his spine when Tang Wulin unleashed his Golden Dragon Dreadclaw.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Despite this, the girl in the crater managed to defend against that power.&nbsp;</span></p>
