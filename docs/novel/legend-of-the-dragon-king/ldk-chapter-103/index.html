 <p><span style><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;103 - Bluesilver Whip</strong></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Under that golden light, the area of darkness dissipated, revealing four figures inside. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Light attribute? </span></i><span style>Off stage, Ye Yingluo was shocked once again. Even Xie Xie having two rings didn’t shock her to such an extent. </span><i><span style>Just what is this class five girl’s martial soul? Ever since the start of the competition, she has used wind element, fire element, and now the light element. How can she control three elements? This is simply inconceivable. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Regardless, it was useless. With Xie Xie besieged by three people, how could he possibly endure?</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was truly astonishing, however, was that despite them assembling together, Zhang Yangzi, Wang Jinxi, and Wei Xiaofeng were unable to catch Xie Xie in that short period of time. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The golden ball of light that shone above the mass of darkness suddenly exploded and began to spin. Amidst the chaos of the light’s flurry, a series of clashes could be heard. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie’s second soul skill, Light Dragon Storm!</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right, this was the powerful soul skill Xie Xie had obtained after making his breakthrough. With his body as the axle, he would spin rapidly whilst holding his Light Dragon Dagger, turning the edge of his dagger into the winds of a violent storm that spiraled and slashed at his surroundings. This was a skill that encompassed both attack and defense! </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was only by relying on this powerful soul skill that he was able to withstand being attacked by all sides. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin had already arrived, once again punching out with his right hand. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like before, only Xie Xie and Wang Jinxi reacted to his punch. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie’s Light Dragon Storm halted for a moment, while Wang Jinxi couldn’t bear the pressure at all, his entire body turning rigid. </span></p>
 <p><span style>One after another, strands of Bluesilver Grass entered the area, heading out to bind their three opponents. At the same time, the hammer in Tang Wulin’s left hand furiously smashed at Wang Jinxi. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Yangzi moved quickly, but with Wang Jinxi’s rigid body, it was easier for Tang Wulin to fight. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A green light wrapped around Wang Jinxi’s waist and in the next moment, three shadows retreated back together. A black shadow helped open up a distance between them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Wei Xiaofeng who had grabbed Wang Jinxi. His right leg seemed boneless as it continued to bend at impossible angles. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The three of them retreated while Xie Xie stopped his soul skill, regrouping with Tang Wulin and Gu Yue. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The battle returned to a three versus three. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good, very good!” Zhang Yangzi’s face was colored with excitement, but his battlelust and confidence took precedence. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie was gasping for breath beside Tang Wulin. He stole a glance at his teammates. He didn’t know why, but from beginning to end, he felt a terrifying aura coming from Tang Wulin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you okay?” Tang Wulin whispered. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie shook his head. “I’ve used quite a bit of soul power, but I can still persevere.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t the only one alarmed by Tang Wulin. The opposing Wang Jinxi looked at Tang Wulin as if he were a monster. He was flabbergasted by Tang Wulin, but more than that, he was terrified of him. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s going on? How come I can’t control my martial soul when I face him? </span></i><span style>Wang Jinxi’s mind overflowed with questions. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Yangzi said, “Very good. You’re even stronger than we thought. Still, it is only till here. The three of us have grown up together, become Soul Masters together, and cultivated together. We’ll let you see our coordination next.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>As he spoke, the two wings on Zhang Yangzi’s back unfolded once more. The black light suddenly strengthened, hiding the three of them within it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The corner of Gu Yue’s mouth curved into a smile. “Darkness attribute control, huh?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>She pulled Tang Wulin back, preventing him from rushing forward as she took two steps forwards herself. Standing in front of their opponents, a yellow ring glimmered beneath her feet. In that moment, it seemed as if Gu Yue’s eyes had begun to shine. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A faint silver light flashed in the depths of her eyes as she raised her right hand. Suddenly, a golden light burst into life above her palm, as if she were holding a miniature sun. An overwhelming radiant aura rushed forth from her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie was alarmed. In the instant that Gu Yue’s light element shone, his whole body felt an indescribable feeling of comfort, helping him recover his spent soul power. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As Xie Xie’s Light Dragon Daggers were of light attribute and his Shadow Dragon Daggers were of space attribute, basking in this golden light would naturally feel extremely comfortable. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Yangzi’s Curtain of Darkness received the light’s attack, immediately diminishing as the three figures within were now faintly discernible. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A blazing red light followed the golden light, fusing to create a golden-red flame that ignited Gu Yue’s surroundings. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Element fusion?” Ye Yingluo gaped at that one-ringed girl on stage. </span><i><span style>A genius. She is absolutely a genius! Although I don’t know what her martial soul or soul skill is, for being able to merge the two elements of light and fire at such a young age, even the word ‘genius’ isn’t enough to describe her! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As the Curtain of Darkness approached the golden-red flame, it began to melt away, just like snow. It was impossible for it to come any closer. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Right at that moment, a Bone Dragon Claw shot out of the Curtain of Darkness with lightning speed, heading straight for Gu Yue. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Following the Bone Dragon Claw was a figure surrounded by several large green snakes. There were six in total, their mouths wide open as they revolved around the Bone Dragon Claw. Unlike the Bone Dragon Claw, the snakes went around Gu Yue and shot towards Tang Wulin and Xie Xie in an attempt to bite them. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Devouring Green Shadow</span><span style>! This was Wei Xiaofeng’s second soul skill. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A golden-blue vine pulled Gu Yue back while the golden-red radiance spread across all of their bodies, covering them in a layer of light. This light warded off that darkness while Tang Wulin controlled his Bluesilver Grass to attempt a binding once more. Suddenly, Xie Xie exploded forward with great speed. In that moment, his entire body seemed illusory as light and shadow flickered upon his Light Dragon Dagger, creating an even brighter light that met the Devouring Green Shadow head on. None of the snake heads were able to press their assault. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As Tang Wulin pulled Gu Yue back behind him, he moved up to face the Bone Dragon Claw once more. He smashed apart a snake head with his left arm while his right arm turned golden again as he threw a punch to meet the claw. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Bone Dragon Claw withdrew, and in its place, a black figure suddenly shot out toward Tang Wulin. The light and fire elemental light covering Tang Wulin’s body clashed with that black figure’s black light, causing an explosive boom. He nimbly avoided Tang Wulin’s right arm and landed a punch on Tang Wulin’s stomach. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This black figure arrived too suddenly; Tang Wulin hadn’t been able to react at all! With regards to speed and combat techniques, he was far inferior to Xie Xie, and that black figure had cunningly avoided the Bluesilver Grass covering the ground! </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It can’t be avoided!</span></i><span style> Tang Wulin’s eyes twinkled as his Heavy Silver hammer once again appeared in his right hand. </span><i><span style>Since it can’t be avoided, then I won’t try to dodge at all! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>His hammer smashed into that darkness, warding off his opponent. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pu!</span></i><span style> A punch landed lightly on Tang Wulin’s body while his hammer swept past. </span></p>
 <p><span style>What was strange, however, was that the black figure, after being struck by his hammer, unexpectedly fell apart and scattered into countless black lights. Seeing this, a chill rose from within his body and numerous bones began popping as he was overcome with a cold trembling. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Not good. I fell into his trap. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Yangzi’s second soul skill, Shadow Clone, created clones of himself that possessed half of his combat strength. Anything hit by the clones would be infected by the corrosion of darkness. Their soul power would be unceasingly devoured and their body would corrode. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Right at that moment, Tang Wulin’s Bluesilver Grass finally managed to penetrate the mist of darkness. Tang Wulin groaned as he resisted the corrosion within his body and suddenly exerted all of his soul power. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A strand of Bluesilver Grass abruptly rose into the air, flying towards that curtain of black light. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It didn’t bind, but rather, it was a Bluesilver whip!</span></p>
 <p><span style>That soft-looking Bluesilver Grass suddenly turned tough in that moment. It covered the Curtain of Darkness, striking towards the interior. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if it was that Bone Dragon Claw, it still would have been driven aside. </span></p>
 <p><span style>For a moment, Zhang Yangzi, Wang Jinxi, and Wei Xiaofeng suffered from the move, causing them to stagger backwards at different degrees. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Who would have imagined that the weakest-looking Bluesilver Grass with a measly ten year soul ring could actually exert such power! Zhang Yangzi had relaxed a bit when he’d successfully attacked Tang Wulin, and as a result, he fell prey to this strand of Bluesilver Grass. It whipped him, sending a scorching pain throughout his body. Wei Xiaofeng also suffered at the hands of this whip, making him to lose control of his Devouring Green Shadow. Wang Jinxi, however, had relied on his powerful body to endure; but was still trembling from the pain of the whip and couldn’t help but stagger back. </span></p>
