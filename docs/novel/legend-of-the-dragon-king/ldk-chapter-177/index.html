 <p><span style>So then, where was the source of their fear</span><i><span style>? </span></i><span style>Tang Wulin tried to convey this question to the plants using his own spiritual senses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he had never attempted this before, he thought it was worth a try. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As his conscious melded into the spiritual network of the plants, his senses broadened and the fear grew. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Where is it? Where is the cause of our fear? </span></i><span style>He asked again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He suddenly felt the surrounding Bluesilver Grass’s consciousness ripple in one direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s over there.” Tang Wulin opened his eyes and pointed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Trusting Tang Wulin, Wu Zhangkong immediately brandished his sword and released a gigantic Skyfrost Slash in that. It sliced through the black fog, leaving a trail of frost-covered plants in its wake. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Awoo!” A deep howl filled the air, and the black fog converged into a newly-appeared purple light. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Skyfrost Slash collided with the purple light and dispersed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin patiently waited for the darkness to disappear and reveal their foe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A two-meter tall black ape appeared from the black fog. A head full of peculiar blazing gold hair, it didn’t look particularly strong, though it was clearly agile. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A shimmering purple aura surrounded its body as it stared at Tang Wulin and Wu Zhangkong with bright topaz eyes, incredulity on its face. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What soul beast is this? </span></i><span style>Tang Wulin couldn’t remember any records of such a beast. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a Three-Eyed Demon Ape! Be careful, it has already reached the ten-thousand-year level and has opened its third eye. It will be a difficult opponent.” Wu Zhangkong immediately dashed forward, aiming to enter a melee combat with the ape. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong had never acted hastily in previous battles, but this time was different. He knew that against such a formidable opponent, he would not be able to protect his charge if they stuck together. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Three-Eyed Demon Ape snarled, baring its large white fangs. Tension curled in its body before it shot forward like a whirlwind to welcome Wu Zhangkong. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The fear emanating from the Bluesilver Grass fed his own until Tang Wulin’s entire being screamed of danger as the two clashed. Tang Wulin instinctively dashed ahead and rolled to the side, latching onto a distant tree with his Bluesilver Grass to alter his trajectory.&nbsp;</span><span style>His gut feeling had been right. While the Three-Eyed Demon Ape and Wu Zhangkong fought back and forth, the ape suddenly turned into mist and reappeared where Tang Wulin had just been. It had swiped at the air, forming a hexagon of amethyst light. If Tang Wulin had acted any slower, he would have been pulverized. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He broke out into a cold sweat. </span><i><span style>How terrifying. It even deceived Teacher Wu! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph!” Wu Zhangkong’s expressionless face finally showed traces of anger. Tang Wulin sensed something from behind him and turned around in time to see countless azure sword waves explode, swallowing the Three-Eyed Demon Ape. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Three-Eyed Demon Ape lacked the ability to teleport, and its sudden disappearance just now was attributed to the illusion it had created to trick Wu Zhangkong. But that’s all it was, a trick. It would not work a second time. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong’s eyes glowed amethyst, his Purple Demon Eyes in full force now as a barrage of Frost Scars flew out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Three-Eyed Demon Ape’s reaction speed was remarkable; it lowered its body and a ball of violet light burst forth and ensconced him. The light deflected the Frost Scars before exploding outwards to repel Wu Zhangkong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Its other arm fired a tanzanite light that flew past Wu Zhangkong and headed straight for Tang Wulin. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just where did I provoke it? Why is it still after me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin didn’t dare to relax and launched himself out of the way with a wrench on the Bluesilver Grass he prepared. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A tanzanite flame blazed into existence at the spot he just vacated, crystallizing all the plants touched by its fire into amethysts that melted soon afterward. Tang Wulin paled at this hauntingly beautiful scene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once the strength of a darkness attribute reached a certain level, it could achieve such terrifying effects. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Wu Zhangkong relentlessly pursued the Three-Eyed Demon Ape, unwilling to let it escape. Frost Scars cut through the air and struck the ape, but it dissipated into purple lights once more, merely another illusion. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong, having expected this, immediately dodged to the side and evaded the ape’s attack while countering with a Skyfrost Slash. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This Skyfrost Slash was different than before; its energy was now condensed into a one-meter sword wave and shone with a blinding azure light. The soul power was condensed to the astonishing point that not even a drop of energy leaked out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Three-Eyed Demon Apes violet barrier split open and the sword wave sliced right toward it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the first time the battlefield had gone out of its control, throwing it into a panic as it fiercely swung its arms and threw up another shield. The Skyfrost Slash and the shield of light collided and paused momentarily, giving the ape just enough time to leap out of the way. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong didn’t chase after it, motionless as the sword wave and shield clashed. He switched to a two-handed grip on the Skyfrost Sword and his sixth soul ring lit up.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s...</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>His sixth soul ring? It’s a ten-thousand-year soul skill! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin stood rooted in place, his eyes wide open and unblinking to capture every moment. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ten-thousand-year soul rings were almost on the same level as myths. In the world of Soul Masters, out of ten thousand, perhaps only one person would be lucky to have it! </span><i><span style>I wonder just how amazing Teacher Wu’s ten-thousand-year soul skill is? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Three-Eyed Demon Ape continued moving to the side, leaping and rolling. It was fuming with fury, its eyes shining a brilliant gold and its black fur tinged with indigo. It looked like a blazing violet flame. A golden light appeared on its forehead and finally revealed its third eye. Golden light gushed out as its body swelled until it was three meters tall. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So formidable! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The ape stood up on its hind legs and raised its hands in Wu Zhangkong’s direction. Violet light gathered in its hands and coalesced into a ball of light that kept growing larger. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s getting bigger? Will Teacher Wu’s sixth soul skill be more powerful? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin looked back to Wu Zhangkong with anxiousness. Though Wu Zhangkong’s sixth soul ring still flickered, he stood as still as a statue. It was as though he didn’t care about his opponent any more, and had even gone as far as to close his eyes, his mind seemingly free from mundane worries as it drifted off to another world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t for the fact that the &nbsp;black soul ring continued to enlarge and the increasing radiance of the Skyfrost Sword from icy blue to pure white, Tang Wulin would have believed Wu Zhangkong had given up. </span></p>
 <p><span style>An indignant roar sounded from the Three-Eyed Demon Ape. Its palms struck the one-meter in diameter ball of violet light and the moment they touched, a beam of indigo power shot straight at Wu Zhangkong. The ape’s energy quickly drained as it maintained this attack. </span></p>
