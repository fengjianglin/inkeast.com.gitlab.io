 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong said, “You’re still young and there are some things you needn’t know about just yet. As long as you remember my words, you’ll be fine. The Spirit Pagoda doesn’t think the same way you do. They possess so much power that even the Federation is afraid of them. Moreover, the Spirit Pagoda spans across to other continents too.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin was stunned. </span><i><span style>Other continents? The Star Luo Continent and the Heaven Dou Continent? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher, have you ever been to the other two continents? Do you know what’s different about them?” Tang Wulin curiously asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong calmly answered, “There are many different kinds of places in this world, and you’ll know what they are like when you visit them in the future, but for now, you shouldn’t be thinking about that. Now tell me, what did you feel in the spirit ascension platform today?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Wu Zhangkong didn’t wish to talk about the other two continents, Tang Wulin wisely chose to drop the topic and quickly began explaining his thoughts. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher Wu, after absorbing all that spirit energy today, I realized that it’ll be extremely hard for my teammates with two soul rings to evolve their spirit souls. In fact, it’s practically impossible for them to evolve them to the thousand-year level since the spirit energy is split between their two rings evenly. Even if they did evolve their spirit souls to the thousand-year level, their bodies wouldn’t be able to bear two thousand-year soul rings, not to mention that neither Wang Jinxi’s nor Zhang Yangzi’s spiritual power is strong enough to handle a single thousand-year spirit soul yet. Isn’t this the reason it’s so hard for Soul Masters to evolve their spirit souls in the spirit ascension platform?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong nodded. “The fact that you’ve arrived at this conclusion shows just how seriously you have been thinking about this. Not bad. Even if you had enough resources to enter the spirit ascension platform more times, there is still a limit to what your body can handle. In the end, your chances of success would still be tiny. What you really should be considering isn’t that.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mn.” Tang Wulin nodded in understanding. “I think my situation is actually a bit special. My body is stronger than an ordinary Soul Master’s so I’m actually able to support a thousand-year soul ring despite only having one ring. I’m not restricted to an up to four-hundred-years ring like other one-ring Soul Masters. My spiritual power is also at the Spirit Connection realm, so if I absorb enough spirit energy, I should be able to gain a thousand-year spirit soul, right?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>For a moment, a glimmer of surprise twinkled in Wu Zhangkong’s eyes before he nodded and said, “It’s possible in theory, but you will have to absorb enough spirit energy to evolve your spirit soul before you gain a second soul ring. Moreover, your body will need to be able to bear two thousand-year soul rings when it comes time for your second soul ring.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong’s words immediately reminded Tang Wulin of something. </span><i><span style>That’s right! If I evolve my spirit soul to the thousand-year level, that means my second soul ring will also be at the thousand-year level. It’s no problem for me to handle one thousand-year soul ring right now, but will I be able to handle two thousand-year soul rings by the time I become a Soul Grandmaster? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong continued, “How about this, we’ll run some tests on your body later and figure out just how much you can bear. We already know your spiritual power can support a single thousand-year spirit soul, so all that’s left to determine is whether or not your body can bear two thousand-year soul rings. You’ll really be a unique case if you can.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, teacher.” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Teacher Wu isn’t the only person I can ask about how much my body can bear. I can also ask… Old Tang! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After Tang Wulin left, Wu Zhangkong sat there in deep thought. </span><i><span style>There really is something special about Tang Wulin. I think he’ll actually be able to do it. </span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Should he actually obtain a thousand-year spirit soul, then even though his martial soul is weak, it will be enough to make up for it and make him strong! This set of circumstances is even rare in Shrek Academy.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>However, this isn’t a certainty. After all, I’ve never entered the land of the true monsters of Shrek. </span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He should only be a step away from evolving his spirit soul once more. It seems I’ll need to conduct some special tests on him. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong narrowed his eyes. </span><i><span style>It’s best to keep this matter a secret from the Spirit Pagoda. </span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>At the very least, this can’t be revealed until he’s stronger. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As his train of thought traveled along this path, a series of plans began to form. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He had never expected these children to make such a great harvest this time in the rebellion spirit ascension platform. Without a doubt, having survived the longest, it was Tang Wulin who had benefited the most. He had absorbed the most spirit energy with Gu Yue in second place. She had suddenly broke through to become a two-ringed Soul Grandmaster, gaining enough power to even defeat a three-ringed Soul Elder who had two spirit souls and a powerful martial soul! It was true that her opponent had been careless, but it would have been impossible to grasp victory without her insane control over the elements!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nobody knew just how strong Gu Yue’s spiritual power was after gaining her second soul ring. This little girl had a chance of reaching the Spirit Sea realm by the time she turned fifteen! </span></p>
 <p><span style>The others’ spirit souls had also made some progress, but now they were faced with a problem. They couldn’t enter the spirit ascension platform again for a while, otherwise they might accidently absorb too much spirit energy which would negatively influence their bodies. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He had never expected they would make so much progress in a short six months. According to the original plan they had for class zero, they shouldn’t be this powerful until the third grade. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems I’ll have to adjust the originally planned curriculum. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style> ……</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Tang, now that I have fully absorbed the power of the first seal, how many soul rings and spirit souls can my body handle?” The moment Tang Wulin returned to his room, he began meditating to call out Old Tang. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Tang’s body was still bathed in a golden light, but for some reason, Tang Wulin felt as though the light had grown a bit more resplendent than before. Old Tang also no longer seemed as transparent to him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Tang asked, ”Oh? What do you mean? Is there a problem with your soul rings?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin didn’t know why, but he placed an immense amount of trust in this mysterious Old Tang that dwelled within his body. He didn’t bother to hide anything as he explained what had happened in the spirit ascension platform, as well as his thoughts on the spirit soul evolution he had already experienced. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After hearing his explanation, Old Tang suddenly blurted out, “I understand what you’re thinking. You’re worried that your body won’t be able to absorb that much spirit energy, correct?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right! That’s what I’m worried about.” Tang Wulin hurriedly added, “So what level of soul ring do you think my body can bear right now? And my spirit soul?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Tang said, “This is actually a very simple matter since there’s no one more familiar with your body than I. Your spiritual power is gradually increasing, but your job to find a way to improve faster. It would be best for you to find a spiritual power cultivation method that will help you increase your spiritual power improvement rate. With your current level, you should be able to support a single thousand-year spirit soul or two hundred-year spirit souls. As for soul rings, you need not worry. Having absorbed the power of the Golden Dragon King’s first seal, it’ll be no problem for your body to bear two thousand-year soul rings.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin said, “Then, is it possible for me to break the second seal before I reach rank 20? And what level will my body reach after absorbing the second seal’s power?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Tang answered, “Based on your body’s current condition, it should be possible. However, you will need to find the items I told you about first. You can only break the second seal after obtaining those items. You will also need to strengthen your body further by that time. Actually, if you really can evolve your spirit soul and soul ring to the thousand-year level, it will provide you with an overall improvement to both your body and essence, so I fully encourage you to evolve them before you reach rank 20. When that time comes, I’ll give you some new advice. Just remember though, the earlier you break the seals, the higher the chance they will break on their own in the future and so your period of safety will become even smaller.”</span></p>
