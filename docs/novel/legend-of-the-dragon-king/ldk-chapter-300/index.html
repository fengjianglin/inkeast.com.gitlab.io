<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;300 - Feng Wuyu</strong></span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Wuyu pinched his lips so tight they seemed to disappear into his face. “You mean that kid Mu Chen? What kind of dog shit luck does he have to snatch you as a disciple?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>This didn’t sit well with Tang Wulin, prompting a strained frown. “I’m the one who’s lucky enough to study under him. I still have another teacher as well, Teacher Mang Tian. It was only thanks to their guidance that I am here today. Someone like you, the president of Shrek Blacksmith’s Association, shouldn’t be asking me to betray my teachers.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s…” Feng Wuyu was at a loss for words. “Betraying them isn’t that serious. That kid Mu Chen is pretty good at forging, but his strength is a bit lacking. He barely managed to break through as a Soul Douluo, and that was with external help. He isn’t even a Title Douluo. It’s damn near impossible for him to become a Divine Blacksmith, but me? I’m different! My cultivation base puts his to shame! See for yourself.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>As the last word left his lips, a red aura permeated the air from which Feng Wuyu stood, the temperature in the room surging several degrees. All this through the exertion of his soul power. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin felt as if he’d been tossed into a furnace, taking a few steps back out of reflex. At the same time, he urged his blood essence to protect him from the inferno. But it still wouldn’t have prepared him for what was coming next, his pupils dilating from shock. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ring after ring rose from beneath Feng Wuyu, surrounding him like blinding stars in a spiraling nebula.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Purple, purple, purple, purple, black, black, black, black, and red! </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He has nine soul rings! He actually has nine! He even has a red one! From his soul ring configuration, he shouldn’t be any weaker than Elder Cai! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Never had it struck Tang Wulin that the person who abducted him would be a Title Douluo. And it wasn’t an exaggeration to call him exceptional among this group either. </span></p>
 <p><span style>If he counted his grandteacher, then Shrek Academy already boasted at least three Title Douluos. It blew his mind to think he met so many, all who had unimaginable soul ring configurations. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In tandem with his materializing soul rings, Feng Wuyu’s body grew a bit fuller, a bit wider, but otherwise not disturbing his overall appearance. Tang Wulin couldn’t recognize his martial soul. This was the strength of a Title Douluo: total control on how much of the martial soul was revealed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take a good look. Aren’t I powerful? No matter where you go on the continent, no one will dare cross you if you become my disciple. And if anyone does touch a hair on your head, I’ll burn them to ashes!” There was a fire blazing in Feng Wuyu’s eyes. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This guy isn’t normal at all! </span></i><span style>Tang Wulin laughed in his heart. Nevertheless, he did not immediately reject the offer. After witnessing Gu Yue’s dealings with Elder Cai, he had learned better. Any response he gave had to be nuanced and tactful. </span><span style>“Senior, you are too great. However, I cannot forsake my teachers for your strength. If I’m willing to betray them today, then wouldn’t that make me capable of betraying you in the future?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s impossible. You won’t ever meet a blacksmith better than me. At the very least, not one &nbsp;who’s more powerful.” Feng Wuyu’s eyes caught a glazed look, mind wandering the universe, before snapping back into the present. “Even that guy’s cultivation base isn’t as good as mine.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if the words were pilfered out of his mouth, and Tang Wulin could not summon anymore in the face of such a demanding person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, how about this. Next time I receive lessons from my teacher, I’ll ask if he agrees with you guiding me as well. And if he does, I’ll have no objections. Is that fine? I’ll also accept joining this Blacksmith’s Association for now. In any case, I’ll be spending a lot of time on campus, so you won’t have to worry about me disappearing, right?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Wuyu scratched his head as he mulled it over. “Okay. Fine. You’re such a troublesome kid. But like they say, the able ones cause all the trouble, just like how others always say I’m causing always trouble.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, can I go then?” Tang Wulin probed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Wuyu waved his hand dismissively. “Go on, leave. But don’t forget, you can’t join any other association!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Got it! If anyone tries to lure me into their association, should I make use of your name?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Wuyu’s glare was hot enough to melt butter. “Of course you should! No one would dare steal you from me!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin returned to the forging table, grabbing the two pieces of meteoric iron and moving them into his storage ring. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The metals were a dusky gold, speckles of light twinkling over the surface, reminiscent of the night sky. He made off with quite a profit this time. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Didn’t Yuanen say the Academy can sell things on our behalf? I’ll bet these two chunks of meteoric iron are worth a lot. I won’t have to worry about my meals for a while. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll come find you later!” Feng Wuyu shouted at Tang Wulin’s retreating figure, throwing his thoughts asunder and causing him to stumble. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With his back to the room, Tang Wulin was surprised to find himself on one of the upper levels of the school building. He patted his chest a few times to settle his heartbeat. For Tang Wulin, Feng Wuyu was an enigmatic puzzle and facing him had been terrifying. He was lucky, pure and simple, to catch the fancy of a Saint Blacksmith. That said, he couldn’t shake off the tendrils of doubt clinging to his body. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s a nine-ringed Title Douluo! I wonder what’s his title… I need to go ask a teacher about it later. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Still unfamiliar with the layout of the school building, Tang Wulin took some time to find the stairs. As he descended, he ran into Yuanen. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve been looking for you for half a day now, and you’re here just as I thought. Are you alright?” Yuanen asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin nodded. “I’m fine.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuanen’s eyes drifted toward Tang Wulin’s chest. “You’ve joined the Blacksmith’s Association?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>At his inquiry, Tang Wulin followed Yuanen’s gaze to his chest. He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when he saw a crude looking badge depicting a black hammer. Without a doubt, it was what Feng Wuyu had forced upon him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess you could say so.” Tang Wulin forced a smile out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re pretty lucky to have Elder Feng personally recruit you. You must be quite the blacksmith.” Yuanen nodded in approval and heaved a sigh of relief. </span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Mad elder<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>?” A twitch of Tang Wulin’s lips. </span></span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That guy really is crazy! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, there’s no need to leave now. The Blacksmith’s Association is based here on the fourth floor. You can use the forging tables for free since you’re a member, but you’ll still have provide your own metal for forging.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? So the Blacksmith’s Association is on this floor. Can you take take me to it?” Ever since he had stepped foot in Shrek City, Tang Wulin had craved for a forging table to call his own. Especially so now that he was a fifth-rank blacksmith. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The workshop Feng Wuyu had taken him to was at the edge of the fourth floor, tucked deep within winding corridors and the such. Yuanen led him elsewhere, back straight and proper, brimming with confidence. They arrived at the foot of a large sign shortly after.. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Blacksmith’s Association!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The words were written with an air of grandeur. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He pushed the door open and entered. The first thing he saw was a counter stretching over twenty meters long, with more than fifteen windows for helping visitors. At the moment, three staff members with youthful appearances sat behind the windows. They were likely students as well. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuanen spoke softly, “It’s quiet right now because it’s lunchtime, but once that’s over this place will be bustling The Blacksmith’s Association is very popular because even though there are so few blacksmiths in Shrek, the demand for their forging is off the charts.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing these words, Tang Wulin’s heart thumped. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In a flash, he was in front of one of the windows. “Hello, I’m a new student and my name is Tang Wulin. I just joined the Blacksmith’s Association. Elder Feng gave me this badge.” He pointed to his chest. “I was wondering if there is anything else I need to do?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>A young man, about eighteen years old, glanced at the badge from behind the window. At the sight of it, he asked, “Elder Feng personally recruited you?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” Tang Wulin said. </span></p>
