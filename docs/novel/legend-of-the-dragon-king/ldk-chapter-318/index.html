 <p>“One versus one?” Wu Siduo stared at Gu Yue in astonishment.</p>
 <p><i>She really wants to duel me one-on-one? Why is she so confident? Isn’t she just a support-type?</i></p>
 <p>“One-on-one.” Gu Yue nodded.</p>
 <p>“Alright,” Wu Siduo coldly answered. Four soul rings rose from her feet. She lightly tapped the ground, then her figure became illusory as she dashed straight for Gu Yue.</p>
 <p>She reached Gu Yue in an instant, black light flashing as she extended her claws and swiped down.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin stood away from the battlefield, watching attentively. During their brief alliance, he hadn’t gotten a sense of Wu Siduo’s abilities. Now that she released the brunt of her power onto Gu Yue though, he could see just how oppressive her speed and power were.</p>
 <p>Despite Wu Siduo’s speed, her attack failed.</p>
 <p>A split-second before the claws could tear Gu Yue apart, silver light burst out, and she disappeared. Wu Siduo’s claws slashed through nothing but air.</p>
 <p>Gu Yue reappeared ten meters away, her expression as tranquil as ever. Three soul rings, two yellow and one purple, revolved around her. They began to glow, then shine brilliantly as her hands moved in the air like fluttering butterflies, teasing the natural elements of the world to do her bidding.</p>
 <p>With four soul rings, Wu Siduo’s elemental perception was keener than most soul masters. She sensed that Gu Yue’s entire being was turning into a whirlpool that crazily sucked in the surrounded elemental energy. She even felt a slight tugging on her own soul power.</p>
 <p><i>This is…</i></p>
 <p>With a snap of Gu Yue’s fingers, an icicle coalesced and shot toward Wu Siduo.</p>
 <p>This icicle, however, was completely different from a normal icicle. It was tri-colored icicle with a blue tip, silver body, and a fiery red base. The red section exploded when it shot out, accelerating the icicle missile to unbelievable speeds and was in front of Wu Siduo before she could even blink.</p>
 <p>Even so, Wu Siduo displayed the power of an assault-type soul master by instantly slashing the icicle with her claw.</p>
 <p>The icicle exploded into millions of shards, and the air temperature around Wu Siduo rapidly plummeted. Then, the air around her seemed to distort, tightening around her and hindering her movements.</p>
 <p><i>This…</i></p>
 <p><i>Is that a three-element icicle? An icicle with the fire element included?</i></p>
 <p>Wu Siduo may be shocked, but Gu Yue was only getting started.</p>
 <p>Gu Yue summoned another icicle, identical to the last. Like before, it shot forward with lightning speed. It was several times faster than an ordinary icicle due to the explosive power of the fire element, leaving its target no time to react at all. Wu Siduo managed to slice it apart once more, but that only strengthened the space element constricting her. Although the restraining effect wasn’t as powerful as Luo Guixing’s Spatial Lock, it was enough to slow her down.</p>
 <p>A cold light flashed in Wu Siduo’s eyes. Her fourth soul ring lit up and she split into two clones, each heading towards Gu Yue from different angles.</p>
 <p>Gu Yue began spinning in place. The air stirred. Wind picked up, circling around Gu Yue. More and more strands of wind joined in until a green tornado surrounded her, howling as it quickly grew in size. Soon, Gu Yue was no longer visible.</p>
 <p>The winds roared their fury as Gu Yue emerged for a moment. White started to drift down from the sky. It increasingly fell faster as she called down more snow, then she disappeared into the resulting snow storm.</p>
 <p>The tornado sucked in the snow, quickly merging to become a blizzard.</p>
 <p>Wu Siduo stiffened when she came into contact with the extreme cold, but still courageously rushed in to find Gu Yue. Her instincts told her that the longer she stayed in this blizzard, the worse her position would be.</p>
 <p><i>Her martial soul is too strange! How many elements does this make now?</i></p>
 <p>Yet just when she found Gu Yue and prepared to strike, a wall of earth burst from the ground and blocked her path.</p>
 <p>Wu Siduo’s ferociously attacked the wall, breaking it and sending stones flying. However, Gu Yue was nowhere to be found. The blizzard tornado immediately absorbed the stone fragments as well, becoming a storm of ice and stones. The chaos surrounding Wu Siduo completely cut off her vision, enveloping her in a whirlwind of death.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin stood protectively in front of Xie Xie. He was wary of the aftermath of the tornado, alert for the first signs of danger. Gu Yue had improved her control and could effortlessly wield three elements at once. In fact, she could even exploit her opponent’s attacks to hasten the fusion of the elements and economize on her soul power.</p>
 <p>The tornado alone did not possess much destructive power. It was the fusion of multiple elements that made it dangerous. In the eye of the storm, Wu Siduo could neither see anything around her nor sense Gu Yue’s location.</p>
 <p>Wu Siduo’s first soul ring lit up as she decisively chose a direction and charged.</p>
 <p><i>I need to get out of this tornado first. Something this big can’t last very long!</i></p>
 <p>Hell Rush was her first soul skill. It momentarily doubled her speed while condensing her soul power into an explosive attack in front of her. It was perfect for breaking out of a siege. Furthermore, all of her soul rings were powerful purple ones.</p>
 <p>Relying on her soul power to protect her body, she braved the assault of the biting cold winds and dashed fifty meters out with Hell Rush.</p>
 <p>Her vision cleared and the air pressure around her normalized. A smile graced her lips.</p>
 <p><i>I made it out!</i></p>
 <p>Suddenly, the hairs on the back of her neck stood on end. Light twisted around her and the next thing she knew, she was back in the eye of the storm, the pressure stronger than before. It was as if the storm’s eyewall was trying to rip her apart.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin stood right in front of where Wu Siduo had broken out of the tornado, so he clearly saw what happened.</p>
 <p>Wu Siduo really had succeeded in rushing out. A second later, however, Gu Yue had teleported behind her and then teleported the both of them away.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin chuckled. There was no need to doubt Gu Yue’s strength; after all, her martial soul gave her control over six elements! Her only weakness was her lack of explosive attack power. Although she could unleash powerful elemental fusion attacks, those required time to prepare.</p>
 <p><i>The best strategy to use against Gu Yue is to rush her and instantly decide the battle so that she doesn’t have time to prepare any large-scale attacks. The longer the battle is drawn out, the stronger Gu Yue’s position is. With her Elemental Tide and Elemental Fusion soul skills, as well as her ability to call upon the elemental energy found in the world itself, create a truly terrifying combination.</i></p>
 <p><i>Wu Siduo’s mistake is not knowing the extent of Gu Yue’s abilities. If she had known beforehand, she could have immediately used her Hell White Tiger transformation to clinch victory. Not even Gu Yue’s teleportation could escape the Hell White Tiger’s might.</i></p>
 <p><i>But it’s too late. Perhaps Wu Siduo can put up more of a fight if she transforms into that Hell White Tiger, but Gu Yue has complete control over the battlefield now. Besides, Wu Siduo’s Hell White Tiger consumes too much soul power to be effective here. Now it’s a battle of attrition. The outcome of the battle is pretty obvious.</i></p>
 <p>In reality, Tang Wulin’s conjectures were slightly off. Wu Siduo simply could not use Hell White Tiger again right now.</p>
 <p>Hell White Tiger was her powerful self-soul fusion skill. However, the laws of the world were fair. Such a powerful ability naturally came with harsh restrictions. Just like how the power of Xu Yucheng’s Demon Scythe was balanced by the corrosion of his body, Wu Siduo needed three days of rest before she could use Hell White Tiger again. It was impossible for her to use it again right now!</p>
