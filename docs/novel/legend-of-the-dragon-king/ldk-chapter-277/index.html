 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s dragon claw descended upon the Three-eyed Golden Lion’s head. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin flew into the air high above the Three-eyed Golden Lion’s head. Since Xu Xiaoyan’s starwheel immobilized it, the lion couldn’t do anything but watch as Tang Wulin swung his claw down at it.</span></p>
 <p><span style><a href="https://i.imgur.com/b01q3Jx.gifv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">He struck the lion’s head, using his claw to spike it head-first into the ground. </a>However, instead its crushing effect activating, the dragon claw rebounded off of the lion’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Three-eyed Golden Lion crashed into the floor of the cave with a resounding boom, unconscious, but alive. For the moment. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Captain!” Xie Xie hurriedly spoke up. “Don’t destroy its head, it could leave us a soul skull.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin withdrew his claw, deciding not to follow up with another attack. Having struck the lion, he an odd hunch that the crushing effect wouldn’t activate no matter what he did. It was undoubtedly the influence of the Auspicious Emperor’s luck. It truly was a strange soul beast! </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think it’s only a ten-year Three-eyed Golden Beast. If it were at the hundred-year level, we wouldn’t have been able to beat it so easily.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The unconscious lion that lay before them was practically a lamb ready for the slaughter! Its tough scales were nothing in the face of Tang Wulin’s golden dragon claw. </span></p>
 <p><span style>His claw may have bounced off of the lion’s head, but the scales on it had been smashed to bits. Golden blood trickled from the wound.. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now we need to decide who gets the spoils,” Tang Wulin said, turning to his companions. “Xiaoyan, if you can make a breakthrough, then the soul ring goes to you. I’ll pass on the soul bone... so Xie Xie and Gu Yue, you two talk it over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His three companions went silent. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This was an Auspicious Emperor, a Three-eyed Golden Lion! They could no longer be found in the real world, yet they encountered one here and even had the chance to obtain its soul ring and soul bone. Anyone who fused with either would receive a massive boost in strength. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite the fact that it was only a ten-year soul beast, its soul bone wasn’t ranked number one for no reason. Its effect on one’s spiritual power was unfathomable. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you giving up on the soul bone, Captain?” Xu Xiaoyan exclaimed suddenly. &nbsp;“It’s the soul bone of a Three-eyed Golden Lion!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I already got the Duskgold Dreadclaw Bear’s right hand bone, so it wouldn’t be right for me to take this one too,” Tang Wulin answered. “We’re a team after all. I can’t hog all the good stuff, so go on. You guys decide how you want to distribute it.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie looked at Gu Yue, then at Xu Xiaoyan. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It would have been absolutely spectacular if Xu Xiaoyan were already at rank 30 and could absorb the soul ring of a legendary Three-eyed Golden Lion. However, she was currently one step shy of it at rank 29. The gap seemed small, but it was actually enormous, so all they could do was decide on who gets the soul bone. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The three of them were supposed to split a single soul bone—a priceless one at that! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie gazed at the lion on the ground, then reluctantly took a step back to stand beside Tang Wulin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll pass on it as well.” After retreating from the lion, he seemed to relax. “I’m a man, so I understand that ladies go first. Besides, the Three-eyed Golden Lion’s skull bone mainly affects spiritual power, which doesn’t matter as much to me anyway. It would be better for either of you girls to get it. You two can decide. Or you can play rock-paper-scissors if you can’t.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue and Xu Xiaoyan stared at him in astonishment. </span></p>
 <p><span style>While Xie Xie seemed aloof on the outside, in reality, he was a guy who really cared about his friends. He was the first one to bring up the value of the Three-eyed Golden Lion’s soul bone, yet he still chose to give it up so quickly. Such a decision wasn’t easy to make! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue and Xu Xiaoyan looked each other in the eye. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They both excelled at ranged elemental attacks, and there was no doubt that the lion’s soul bone would suit either of them. Whoever fused with it would experience a fundamental change to their cultivation base. It was hard to come by such and opportunity and even rarer to encounter one like this again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Fusing with this soul bone could even have a permanent effect on their fates! Just how would they decide? Who would get it in the end? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin stood there silently, lips pressed together tightly. He had no suggestions to give them in this situation. As their captain, whatever he proposed would be unfair to the person who ended up with nothing. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This situation would have been far easier to resolve if it were an ordinary soul bone. All of them would have plenty of chances to obtain one in the future. However, this was the soul bone of a Three-eyed Golden Lion! It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue turned around and walked over to Tang Wulin. Meeting his gaze, she said, “Let’s give it to Xiaoyan. I’m passing on it too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Sis Gu Yue!” Xu Xiaoyan yelped. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue turned around, a gentle smile playing at her lips. “The Three-eyed Golden Lion’s soul bone will grant you luck. I don’t want luck. I want strength. Besides, you’re the youngest, and weakest, of the four of us. If you want to catch up, you’ll have to take every chance you get. Go on. Absorb it.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tears welled in Xu Xiaoyan’s eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>First Tang Wulin backed off, then Xie Xie, and now Gu Yue. </span></p>
 <p><span style>All of her companions had renounced the soul bone. </span></p>
 <p><span style>If it were a matter of compatibility, then Gu Yue was definitely the most suited to the soul bone. The power of her Elementalist martial soul would increase proportionally to her spiritual power. Absorbing the soul bone of this Three-eyed Golden Lion would definitely allow her to break into the Spirit Sea realm and experience an explosive increase strength. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, she still chose to give it up without complaint. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s only response was a thumbs up. He was proud to have teammates like them! </span></p>
 <p><span style>One by one, they turned their backs on a precious treasure capable of tempting every soul master in the world. To them, their companions were far more important than material items. This refusal was proof of their camaraderie. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Xiaoyan crouched down and examined the Three-eyed Golden Lion. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She shook her head and stood up once more, quickly walking back to Tang Wulin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Captain, I’m giving up on it too.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” He stared at her in shock. “Why?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it were a different soul bone, I wouldn’t hesitate at all, but this…” Xue Xiaoyan shook her head. “This is the soul bone of a Three-eyed Golden Lion. My heart would never be at ease if I took it for myself. And besides, it’s still a child. It can’t have been born too long ago. Just think about how sad its mother would be if she came back to see her child dead! We might have already killed a lot of soul beasts, but all of them attacked us first. We acted in self defense. This time, however, we were the ones to break into its home. It wouldn’t be right to kill it for our own benefit, and I definitely wouldn’t be able to bear doing such a thing. So… I don’t want the soul bone. Let’s leave.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Her words surprised Tang Wulin, but a moment later, a smile formed on his lips and he gave her a big thumbs up. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s right! </span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It would be best for us if we didn’t get this soul bone. Besides, my gut tells me that this trial definitely isn’t as simple as we think it is. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It didn’t matter which of the four them took the soul bone. All of them would forever be haunted by it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, Xu Xiaoyan had a point. This Three-eyed Golden Lion was just a cub. They weren’t monsters who would indiscriminately slaughter beasts. No, all the beasts they had killed until then had attacked them first. This cub had merely been hiding in its home. It didn’t actively target them in any way. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie and Gu Yue were both moved. In their adolescent mindsets, slaughtering soul beasts in the spirit ascension platform had always been a game. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Xu Xiaoyan’s choice had sparked a flame their hearts.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is it right for us to kill soul beasts? Or is it wrong? Are soul beasts evil? Do they harm people? Or is it just our greed that has driven them to the brink of extinction…?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Some soul beasts still exist in the world today, but what about in a hundred years? Or a thousand? If soul beasts really become just a part of history, what will happen to humanity? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Since you’ve all decided to give it up, let’s get out of here. I’m afraid the big one will return any minute now.” Tang Wulin swiftly made a decision. As their captain, he had to put his team’s safety first. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He started running for the cave’s entrance. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>We can talk more after we leave. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The cave’s exit soon came into view. Stars filled the sky, casting a mystical light onto the valley. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Off in the distance, three eyes appeared, two golden and one a demonic red. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin, Xie Xie, Gu Yue, and Xu Xiaoyan immediately froze as the space around them hardened, locking them in place.</span></p>
