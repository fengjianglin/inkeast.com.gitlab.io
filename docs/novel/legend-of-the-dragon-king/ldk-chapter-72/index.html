 <p>With the Thousand Refined Heavy Silver Hammers’ Stacked Hammers effect, the difficulty of the Thousand Refinements was now much less than before.</p>
 <p>The days soon flew by. For six days of the week, he would be hard at work cultivating. On the remaining day, he would forge.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Tang Wulin, along with Gu Yue and Xie Xie, were inside Wu Zhangkong’s office. He informed them that the first match of the Class Promotion Tournament would begin the following week. Before Tang Wulin knew it, two months had already passed.</p>
 <p>During these last two months, everyone had changed by more than a little. The most important change was that under Wu Zhangkong’s ‘special training,’ all three of them had gained a mutual understanding between each other, causing their relationship to be much more harmonious now.</p>
 <p>Gu Yue was without a doubt the strongest among the three of them. Even when he went all out, Xie Xie was unable to close the gap between them by even a bit.</p>
 <p>Xie Xie’s soul power, however, had surprisingly grown to rank 19 over the past two months. After one more rank up, he would be able to receive the second soul ring from his hundred year spirit soul, thus becoming a Soul Grandmaster.</p>
 <p>Gu Yue’s soul power had increased by two and reached rank 17. Despite him having Bluesilver Grass as his martial soul, Tang Wulin worked hard everyday to improve his martial soul control while also using a higher level meditation technique as he underwent Wu Zhangkong’s training. This had allowed his soul power to increase by one rank to rank 12.</p>
 <p>According to his current speed, he would definitely be able to reach rank 20 before he graduated from the intermediate academy. With his abundant self-awareness, Tang Wulin didn’t bother to compare himself with Xie Xie and Gu Yue, instead completely satisfied with his progress.</p>
 <p>“Teacher, who is class four sending to battle with us? Do you have their data?” Xie Xie eagerly asked Wu Zhangkong.</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong coldly answered, “If you guys need data on that measly class four in order to defeat them, could you still be considered my disciples? You only have one mission during the tournament next week: crush your opponents! Do you understand?”</p>
 <p>“Yes!” All three of them exclaimed.</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong said, “The Class Promotion Tournament will begin soon. There will be one battle a day until the tournament ends. I’ll give you guys a target: win your way to the fourth grade!”</p>
 <p>Winning all the way until the fourth grade? When they heard these words, Tang Wulin’s eyes were filled with shock while Xie Xie couldn’t help but gulp down his saliva—despite his confidence.</p>
 <p>It had to be known that the talented individuals of the fourth grade would already have acquired their second ring. In fact, there were even some two ring Soul Grandmasters within the third grade! Yet, they were only in the first grade and were tasked with fighting until the fourth grade. This was easier said than done.</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong indifferently replied, “What I’m talking about is the fourth grade’s class one. Defeat the fourth grade’s class one and you will all receive a reward. If not, I’ll discard all of your class achievements.”</p>
 <p>Xie Xie defiantly said, “Teacher, isn’t this too harsh?”</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong said, “If you find it harsh, then you can withdraw. Only Wulin and Gu Yue will compete then.”</p>
 <p>“Great! I don’t want this leftover child,” Gu Yue said with indifference as she played with her fingers.</p>
 <p>“You!” Xie Xie turned to glare at her.</p>
 <p>Since Gu Yue had always suppressed him with her strength, Xie Xie treated her with hostility from beginning to end.</p>
 <p>Gu Yue tilted her head and stared back at him. “You can’t accept this?”</p>
 <p>Xie Xie looked at Tang Wulin, who said, “Teacher has never changed his mind after deciding on something before. It’s best if you do your best, young man!”</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong’s eye’s twinkled as he revealed a smile. He was exceptionally pleased with these three disciples of his. Although Tang Wulin’s innate talent was lacking, his innate divine strength more than made up for it. Moreover, Tang Wulin always put in his greatest effort!</p>
 <p>Although they had both increased by one soul rank, it would be wrong to compare Tang Wulin with Xie Xie. In comparison to Xie Xie, Tang Wulin had put in far more effort for that one rank. Moreover, it seems that after his Bluesilver Grass mutated into a variant, it seemed truly decent now. While it seemed that it could no longer evolve anymore, if it did evolve after he obtained his second ring, then there was the possibility of it becoming a high level martial soul.</p>
 <p>“Alright then. We’ll commence with today’s training. Tang Wulin, partner up with Xie Xie and face Gu Yue.”</p>
 <p>Xie Xie revealed a mischievous smile and then proudly said to Gu Yue, “Yue Yue, &nbsp;watch how big brother puts you in your place!”</p>
 <p>Gu Yue coldly stared at him. “You will pay for how you just addressed me!”</p>
 <p>Thus, the day’s special training began.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">☀</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>The Class Promotion Tournament was a grand event for Eastsea Academy and was held annually. This was because the Class Promotion Tournament was the only event where the whole academy participated.</p>
 <p>The advanced academy had their own advanced division Class Promotion Tournament, keeping their event separate from the intermediate academy’s tournament.</p>
 <p>They would show off their most exceptional students in the tournament and the city would record their info and archive it. As for the upcoming Class Promotion Tournament, it was crucial for obtaining a recommendation to enter high class academies in the future.</p>
 <p>The rewards were also equally as generous. Classes that obtained exceptional results in the tournament would gain not only a change in rank, but the teacher in charge would also receive commendations.</p>
 <p>As a result, the Class Promotion Tournament had become a symbol of honor and glory over the years. Being defeated by a lower ranked class was considered a disgrace, while defeating a higher ranked class was considered glorious.</p>
 <p>The reason the tournament was held three months after the start of class was to give the teachers enough time to choose the students who would participate, and also to provide ample time to plan their tactics.</p>
 <p>There was a moderate wind blowing and a beautiful sun shining down on this day. The blue sky was void of clouds for as far as the eye could see. A competition stage stood in the middle of the intermediate division’s field. Although it was called a competition stage, it was actually just a 10 centimeter thick metal plate with a diameter of 100 meters. It occupied the majority of the field’s area, and there were many soul barrier devices surrounding it, guarding against any potential accidents that may occur during the matches.</p>
 <p>Today was the first day of the tournament. For the sake of not disturbing the studies of the students, the tournament was held after school. At that moment, the bell rang, marking the end of the school day. Students began pouring out of the school building. Despite this, only a few headed towards the competition stage.</p>
 <p>For a match between class five and class four of the new first graders, how could it possibly be worth watching? The upper graders viewed a match such as this with disdain. They wouldn’t come to watch the matches until the next day, when the first grade’s class three stepped onto the stage.</p>
 <p>After the bell rang, the students of the first grade’s class five lined up neatly and made their way to the field, standing to the side. After three months of special training, class five had a completely different aura about them now. Although their talents weren’t remarkable, under Wu Zhangkong’s instruction, their stamina had made outstanding progress and their soul power had also increased greatly.</p>
 <p>The students of the first grade’s class four arrived in twos and threes just a while later. It seemed that they weren’t worried about the match at all.</p>
 <p>A short and stout teacher walked over to Wu Zhangkong’s side, wearing a massive grin. “Teacher Wu, your students are pretty good! I’m nearly dying from how orderly they are in their line. My class four’s students are so undisciplined. As such, please start off leniently on my class four today! Although we might not be able to be promoted to class three, you must help us preserve our position as class four.”</p>
 <p>Wu Zhangkong shot him a glance before returning his gaze to the front, completely treating him as air.</p>
