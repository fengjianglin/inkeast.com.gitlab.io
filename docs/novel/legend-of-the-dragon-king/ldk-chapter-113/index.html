 <p><span style>Tang Wulin was quite miserable. As one of the two who received no injuries as well as being a male, he had been used as a living teaching example by Wu Zhangkong. With him as the opponent, Wu Zhangkong continuously used him to demonstrate combat techniques and important topics to the other students. Tang Wulin was knocked down time and time again by the teacher’s pointing stick. </span></p>
 <p><span style><span>He felt that this was Teacher Wu’s revenge for him being late to the match. But even so, this type of training was effective as it was clear just how quickly Tang Wulin was improving. This was the so-called, ‘pain and joy’.<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>News of class zero’s establishment quickly spread throughout the academy, turning its five students into celebrities in an instant. Naturally, they couldn’t reveal what they were doing in class, so the curiosity of others died down after a few days and the academy returned to its usual tranquility. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As their only teacher, Wu Zhangkong provided them with plenty of guidance. Their curriculum required that they study different theories from those of regular classes and become more inclined toward combat training. And just as President Yu Zhen promised, the academy poured a tremendous amount of resources into the class. Regardless of whether it were the teaching methods, nourishing food, teachers, or facilities, all were provided and of the highest quality. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ten days later, Tang Wulin was no longer the only one being beaten up by Wu Zhangkong’s pointing stick. Xie Xie, Zhang Yangzi, and Wang Jinxi had all recovered and could now join Tang Wulin in being beaten up for combat training. Ever since their recovery, inhuman cries of pain would constantly ring out from class zero. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They had rejoiced in Tang Wulin’s misfortune when they were still bystanders that were watching him being beaten up, but after experiencing the painful strikes of the pointing stick for themselves, they had gained a thorough understand of what pain truly was. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Jinxi fared a bit better than the others as his Bone Dragon King made his body much stronger. But for Zhang Yangzi and Xie Xie… they were definitely suffering. Zhang Yangzi was an Agility-Control System Soul Master and Xie Xie was a pure Agility System Soul Master so both of their bodies were suited for nimbleness and couldn’t compare in toughness with Tang Wulin or Wang Jinxi. </span></p>
 <p><span style>From the very beginning, Wu Zhangkong didn’t even know the concept of ‘starting off leniently’. Instead, each strike of his pointing stick would create a pain that penetrated all the way to their bone marrow! Yet, despite this unfathomable pain they were subjected to, they didn’t suffer any real injuries. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In Wu Zhangkong’s words: ‘Only pain can deepen your learning!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only one who was fortunate enough to be spared was Gu Yue. Perhaps it was because she was a girl, but Wu Zhangkong reined in a bit of his harshness when he taught her. Even when the occasional pointer struck, it only made her feel a bit numb. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Today we will be running a few tests on your bodies so combat training will be suspended.” Wu Zhangkong announced this piece of good news the moment he entered the classroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They all harbored a fear of combat training now. That bone-piercing pain was simply too much. </span></p>
 <p><span style><span>Tang Wulin was the only one who felt some disappointment.<a id="footnoteref-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a> Having absorbed a portion of the Golden Dragon King’s soul, he had discovered over the past ten days of combat training that his body’s strength had risen to another level. Apart from his right arm, any place Wu Zhangkong’s pointer struck would experience extreme pain, but he would recover from it extremely fast without even leaving a bruise. Moreover, he felt that his soul power cultivation rate increased after receiving a good beating. </span></span></p>
 <p><span style>After those ten days of training, he sensed as though his body was on the verge of breaking through once more. It seemed that the fragment of the Golden Dragon King’s soul hadn’t been completely absorbed by him yet. The more he cultivated, the more completely he absorbed the soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was also growing more and more skilled at controlling his bloodline power. Apart from the Golden Dragon Claw, which he couldn’t use too often due to the excessive amount of soul power it consumed, he could use the golden scales as he wished due to its minimal costs. Thus, his right arm had turned into his strongest weapon. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong brought them to a room that was filled with a scientific feeling. The interior of the room was covered in a layer of a silver metal which made them feel as if they had entered a silver world the moment they stepped inside. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Table after table of strange apparatuses were arranged within this room. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll start with the spiritual power test. Xie Xie, you’re first.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong was holding onto a form, ready to record Xie Xie’s results. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie’s spiritual power growth was quite normal. Compared to last time, his spiritual power had increased by two. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After Xie Xie was Wang Jinxi. His spiritual power was quite low, a mere 18 points. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wang Jinxi, you must spare no effort in improving your spiritual power otherwise you won’t be able to fuse with any more spirit souls in the future,” Wu Zhangkong dully advised him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Jinxi was normally very quiet. Just like usual, he merely nodded after hearing Wu Zhangkong’s words. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Yangzi’s turn was next. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Spiritual power of 41. Not bad. If you do your best you might be able to break through from the Spirit Origin realm within a year.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin was the second last to go. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Yangzi’s gaze was fixed on him. Among his three ex-opponents, he bore the greatest grudge against Tang Wulin for breaking his legs. He couldn’t help but feel the need to compare himself against Tang Wulin now. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past few days he had interacted with Tang Wulin, he discovered that Tang Wulin’s main power came from his body that was gifted with strength and that peculiar right arm of his. As for his martial soul, it was merely Bluesilver Grass. It wasn’t even worth mentioning to Zhang Yangzi. The more he found out about Tang Wulin, the more he felt that his loss that day was unjustified. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since he’s an expert at assault like Wang Jinxi, just how high could his spiritual power be? It can’t possibly be that high.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin walked over to the apparatus and sat down. The spiritual power testing machine slowly descended, enveloping his head. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The test was beginning! </span></p>
 <p><span style>This spiritual power testing machine was the most advanced one the academy had. It displayed the spiritual power on a graduated scale with different colors. Thus, one could differentiate the spiritual power level based on the color shown. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Spirit Origin was white. The number representing Tang Wulin’s spiritual power kept on rising, and soon, it surpassed Wang Jinxi’s 18 points. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It steadily increased. 20 points. 25 points. 30 points… </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Yangzi stared at the scale in astonishment. </span><i><span style>No way. He’s just an Assault System Soul Master with one ring’s worth of cultivation. How can he have more than 30 points of spiritual power? Even Jinxi pales in comparison to him… </span></i></p>
 <p><span style> 40...</span></p>
 <p><span style> 43. He had now surpassed Zhang Yangzi and yet, the number was still increasing!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie proudly said to Zhang Yangzi, “You see that? Wulin’s spiritual power is so great!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Yangzi had an unsightly expression as he snorted. </span><i><span style>I refuse to acknowledge him! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Fifty!” The quiet Wang Jinxi suddenly shouted. </span></p>
 <p><span style>That was right, Tang Wulin’s spiritual power surpassed 50. This meant that his spiritual power had progressed from the Spirit Origin realm to the Spirit Connection realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sure enough, the scale turned from white to yellow. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Spirit Origin. Everything started from the origin and would grow from there. The moment one was born, they would be in the Spirit Origin realm with the most basic of spiritual powers. Spiritual power in the Spirit Origin realm was enough to bear a yellow spirit soul. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Spirit Connection realm was when the heart could connect with the spirit, conveying simple thoughts. Once one attained Spirit Connection, one would be able to truly control one’s spiritual power and have it move to one’s needs as well as being able to support two yellow spirit souls or one purple spirit soul. </span></p>
 <p><span style>There didn't seem to be much of a difference between Spirit Origin and Spirit Connection, but it was truly a qualitative leap! It was only natural for Wang Jinxi to be shocked. After all, reaching the Spirit Connection realm meant that Tang Wulin could already fuse with a purple spirit soul. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Dumbstruck, Zhang Yangzi stared at Tang Wulin with his mouth gaping. </span><i><span style>This guy’s martial soul is nothing, but his spiritual power is so amazing!</span></i><span style> He had never heard of someone who could break through to the next realm while still in the first grade of intermediate academy before! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyone who could break through to the next realm in the intermediate division would already be considered talented. It had to be said that the greatest obstacle for graduating from the advanced division was attaining Spirit Connection! This one requirement had already stopped countless Soul Masters from graduating. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Tang Wulin had already broken through while still being in the first grade! This was simply unfathomable! </span></p>
 <p><span style>66!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s spiritual power reading finally stopped at 66 points. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie had been bragging for him just now, but he was still stupefied after seeing this number. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It has only been a few days yet this guy’s spiritual power has already grown this much? His spiritual power growth rate is almost like a cheat!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>66? </span></i><span style>Tang Wulin was also startled when he saw the results. Although he had felt that his spiritual power had increased after absorbing the Golden Dragon King’s soul, he had never expected to directly enter the Spirit Connection realm. This was simply too amazing for him! Strong spiritual power would be extremely beneficial for him when he fused with another spirit soul in the future as well as when controlling his martial soul and soul skills!</span></p>
