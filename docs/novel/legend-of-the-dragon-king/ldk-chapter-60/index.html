 <p>Cen Yue smiled and said, “Soul communicators are gifted to new members of the association. Since every blacksmith has one, you can consider it one of the benefits of joining the association. As for this ring, the President wanted me to give it to you. He said that it’s just a temporary loan. It has a space of ten cubic meters, so it’ll be convenient for when you hand in your work. How else could you carry around all the metal required for the tasks?”</p>
 <p><i>‘There are even benefits? This storage ring is simply too valuable.’</i> Tang Wulin couldn’t even comprehend the worth of a ring with ten cubic meters of storage space.</p>
 <p>Cen Yue placed the two items into Tang Wulin’s hands. “Take it. It’ll be fine so long as you complete some tasks from the association. Just consider this ring as something that the association issued you. It’s usually only given to fourth rank blacksmiths, but the President believes that you’ll definitely become a fourth rank blacksmith in the future. Don’t disappoint us.”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin took a step back and kneeled before Cen Yue. “I must thank you, Grandmaster Cen Yue, and the President.”</p>
 <p>Cen Yue helped him up, then rubbed his head with a smile. “Even though I’m not your teacher, it’s still my duty to remind you that every single profession is but a different route to the same destination. Even though soul power is no longer crucial to this profession during this era, and many ordinary people are now able to forge things that previously required the power of a Soul Master to finish, some accomplishments within the cultivation of soul power is needed to reach the peak of this profession. Because of this, you definitely can’t abandon your studies!”</p>
 <p>“Yes!” Tang Wulin earnestly nodded his head. His dream, after all, was to become a powerful Soul Master! Despite being more accomplished as a blacksmith at this moment, he’d never wanted to give up on being a Soul Master.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t until he left the Blacksmith’s Association that Tang Wulin snapped out of his dream-like state. He owned a soul communicator now? Moreover, the Association would reimburse him for the calling fees? He even had Cen Yue’s number within the soul communicator already.</p>
 <p>He looked at the storage ring on his right ring finger. This ring had a storage space of ten cubic meters! It’s value was simply unimaginable. It was likely worth even more than a hundred year spirit soul!</p>
 <p>However, Tang Wulin was unaware that even though this was a benefit given by the association, it still wasn’t something a fourth rank blacksmith could receive. Rather, one had to be a fifth rank Master Craftsman rank blacksmith to receive it!</p>
 <p>Mu Chen had clearly given him this ring as his investment into a talented child.</p>
 <p><i>‘The association’s benefits are truly too great. Ah!’ </i>Tang Wulin suddenly remembered something he had to do.</p>
 <p>He wasn’t just a blacksmith, he also a Soul Master! He needed to go register at the Soul Master’s Association. With his current rank, he would receive an allowance of one thousand federal coins each month.</p>
 <p>After asking around a bit, he discovered that the Soul Master’s Association wasn’t too far away. Since it wasn’t too late yet, he might as well drop by.</p>
 <p>The Soul Master’s Association was about the same size as the Blacksmith’s Association. As a one ring Soul Master, Tang Wulin was only able to enter the first floor of the Soul Master’s Association. After showing his soul ring, he was able to register and was given one thousand federal coins.</p>
 <p>His experience at the Soul Master’s Association was different from the one in the Blacksmith’s Association. In this place, no one would pay attention to a brat with a ten year spirit soul.</p>
 <p>However, Tang Wulin was still very happy with his gains today.</p>
 <p>When he returned to his dorm room, he found that Yun Xiao, Zhou Zhangxi and Xie Xie were all already meditating. He quietly climbed onto his own bed and began meditating according to what Wu Zhangkong had taught them today.</p>
 <p>Teacher Wu had said that he would begin training Tang Wulin and Xie Xie the next day. Tang Wulin couldn’t help but wonder what kind of methods he would use.</p>
 <p>He began revolving his soul power in an even more complicated pattern. Soon after, Tang Wulin entered a meditative state. His weak soul power began circulating its way to his meridians, converging bit by bit.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">☀</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Early morning.</p>
 <p>As Tang Wulin finished meditating, he was astonished to discover that Xie Xie had already disappeared and that the sun had already risen. This was the first time he had tried this new meditation method, and he’d woken up much later than before.</p>
 <p>He immediately got off his bed and ran to wash his face and rinse his mouth.</p>
 <p>For Tang Wulin, meal time was the most important time of the day.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin joyfully ran towards the dormitory’s doors. However, before he even neared the door, he saw a group of upper grade students looking all over the place, as if they were searching for something.</p>
 <p>When he neared them, he suddenly discovered that there was a familiar figure in this group of students.</p>
 <p>Mu Xi was dressed in the school uniform, her long, golden hair done up in a ponytail. Girls matured early, and she was already half a head taller than Tang Wulin. She had a charming figure, tall and thin. Although she hadn’t finished maturing yet, she still had a bit of the scent of a young woman.</p>
 <p>Just as Tang Wulin saw her, Mu Xi had also coincidentally turned her head, looking straight at him.</p>
 <p>“It’s him!” She suddenly raised her finger and pointed towards Tang Wulin.</p>
 <p>Before Tang Wulin could even react, Mu Xi, along with seven or eight upper grade male students, surrounded him.</p>
 <p>“What do you guys want?” Tang Wulin asked, confused.</p>
 <p>“There’s a matter I have with you. Come with me boy.” A tall, but average looking male student said to Tang Wulin with an odd tone.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin asked, “What matter? Just tell me it here.” He had a faint understanding of the situation in his heart. These advanced division students were here to look for trouble. This was definitely related to Mu Xi.</p>
 <p>There were quite a number of newly admitted first grade students here. However, they were all scared off by the fierce expressions of the upper grade students.</p>
 <p>“You think you have a choice?” The upper grade male student who’d previously spoken reached out a hand, grabbing Tang Wulin’s shoulder.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin fiercely shook his grip off of his shoulder. His strength was far greater than that upper grade student had expected, causing him to stumble and nearly fall.</p>
 <p>Without any hesitation or wishful thinking, Tang Wulin immediately attacked. A strand of Bluesilver Grass shot out of his palm. In a flash, the surrounding upper grade students were bound. He also directly knocked down the one that had been previously staggered.</p>
 <p>During the time he had been at the elementary academy, regardless of whether it had been for himself or Na’er, he had never backed down from a fight. Even if he was outnumbered, he would fight back. If he didn’t fight, then he wouldn’t have any chances at all. This was an academy after all, and he would be fine as long as he broke out of the encirclement.</p>
 <p>Clearly, these upper grade students hadn’t expected this action. Even with so many people on their side, Tang Wulin had dared to attack. Moreover, he had been very decisive and had been able to bind them all with his Bluesilver Grass in a flash.</p>
 <p>Right as the male student in front began gathering his soul power, Tang Wulin collided with him.</p>
 <p><i>Bang!</i> The upper grade male student was sent flying. It looked as if Tang Wulin was going to break out of their encirclement.</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, a figure quietly appeared in front of him along with a glaringly bright light.</p>
 <p>In the wake of this blazing light, Tang Wulin felt as if his whole body was about to ignite. His speed suddenly decreased. He only heard a cold snort before he felt a pain in his stomach and was kicked back into the encirclement.</p>
