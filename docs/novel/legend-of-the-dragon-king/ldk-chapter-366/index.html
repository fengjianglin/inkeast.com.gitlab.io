 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;366 - Goldsong</strong></span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Lightning arced through the air, striking the golden serpentine grass in a burst of sparks. The grass’s glow dimmed a bit, but it had more than enough energy to keep advancing. It continued to shoot toward the thunder beast, a deathly screech resounding within the hall. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is… is that Goldlight? Did Tang Wulin fuse Goldlight into the bluesilver grass? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This was the the first time anyone present had ever seen Tang Wulin’s bluesilver grass behave like this, even Gu Yue and Xie Xie. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Goldlight whipped its tail and the grass behind it stood up straight. It took on a golden luster and began moving to form a gold snake of which Goldlight was the head. Below the snake, an enormous formation, a battle array, blazed into existence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that a spirit soul skill?” Yuanen Yehui and Yue Zhengyu asked in unison. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Generally speaking, spirit souls could only assist their soul master indirectly. Some especially powerful spirit souls could actually participate in battle of course, which was possible for the exceptional few who possessed both a strong martial spirit and a spirit soul capable of matching its strength. However, since all spirit souls started out relatively weak, a soul master would prioritize compatibility over strength when choosing a spirit soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A spirit soul skill was the product of fusing a spirit soul with a soul skill, something that would normally only be possible with one’s second or third spirit soul. It would also require said spirit soul to be extremely compatible with the soul skill. Although spirit souls granted soul skills, in this particular situation, martial souls would first process the granted power. Spirit soul skills couldn’t compare to soul fusion skills, but they were still far more powerful than ordinary soul skills. . </span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Goldlight served as the heart of Tang Wulin’s third soul skill, Bluesilver Golden Array! Under Goldlight’s control, Tang Wulin’s vines could attack in more intelligent ways and display even greater strength. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Goldlight had completely changed from when Tang Wulin first got it. It was originally a defective spirit soul only capable of granting a single weak soul skill. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But with Tang Wulin, it grew. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Under the influence of Tang Wulin’s bloodline, and after absorbing a wealth of spirit energy, it ascended and grew to what it was today. However, in the end, Tang Wulin’s Golden Dragon King bloodline had influenced Goldlight the most. All snakes possessed a sliver of draconic blood in them. A defective spirit soul like Goldlight possessed an infinitesimally small amount of draconic blood, yet Tang Wulin’s Golden Dragon King bloodline was that of a peak-level dragon. Simply being fused to Tang Wulin constantly exposed Goldlight to a supreme bloodline, gradually transforming it over time. Wang Jinxi had also received many benefits from the Golden Dragon King bloodline when he cultivated with Tang Wulin, but Goldlight’s transformation was completely beyond that. This was especially true after Tang Wulin broke the third seal and poured the blood essence he couldn’t handle into Goldlight. Its body had grown another by yet another level and now possessed formidable combat strength. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s Bluesilver Golden Array only became like this because Goldlight initially couldn’t grant Tang Wulin three soul skills. This particular soul skill came into existence through the combined factors of the Golden Dragon King bloodline’s influence, Goldlight becoming a thousand-year spirit soul, and Tang Wulin’s bluesilver grass mutating! This was Tang Wulin’s first time using this soul skill. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to use it earlier. He just hadn’t quite grasped its power yet, and he didn’t have any chances to test it beforehand because he had focused solely on forging alloys instead of gaining combat experience. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Another boom rang out as the golden snake formed by the Bluesilver Golden Array dispersed yet another bolt of lightning. This infuriated the thunder beast, and it summoned a lightning bolt that pulsed with power that was far greater than before. In the next instant, it descended upon the giant snake. The lightning bolt struck the snake, sending electricity surging across its glittering golden scales and through every grassy vine, but the grass simply went erect and spread the electricity into the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now a curtain of lightning lingered around the grass snake. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What! Elemental guidance?” Gu Yue gaped. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Elemental guidance was a powerful ability that allowed a certain amount of control over every element! Gu Yue could tell that elemental guidance was a passive ability of the Bluesilver Golden Array. This meant that as long as Tang Wulin didn’t face an overwhelming assault, he could simply shrug off elemental attacks using the Bluesilver Golden Array! He could just scatter any elemental attacks like dust in the wind! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lightning continued to pour through the air, rumbling booms filling the hall as electricity soaked bluesilver grass. The barrage grew more and more intense as the thunder beast continued to rage at how well the grass snake weathered its attacks. Soon enough, dark thundering clouds filled the hall, continuously smiting the Bluesilver Golden Array! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone stood inside of the array, staring at the spectacle in shock. Tang Wulin himself was no exception! There was no way any of them could withstand such electrical might on their own. Even if they all worked together, they would have had to pull out all of their reserved strength to survive the attack, and probably would have been crippled in the process. The thunder beast had gone berserk and its speed had increased several times over! After clearing nine floors and entering the second level of trials, the difficulty had ramped up. Now their only chance at passing this trial was for Tang Wulin to use his Bluesilver Golden Array to exhaust all of the thunder beast’s soul power!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet that could hardly be called a victory. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Goldlight continued to glare up at the stormy clouds, hissing its defiance. Lightning continued to flood the bluesilver grass, but each bolt that did was drawn out by elemental guidance, and electricity continued to build up and shroud the grass. The array gradually turned violet-blue, and the area completely became saturated with crackling energy. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s soul power reserves declined rapidly, but compared to the thunder beast, his rate of consumption was much lower. It was far easier to defend and disperse the potency of the lightning bolts than it was to summon them. What shocked him, however, was that his blood essence slowly depleted along with his soul power! He now realized that his Bluesilver Golden Array had some connection to his bloodline, which most likely stemmed from Goldlight acting as the heart of the soul skill! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Goldlight’s hissing grew louder and louder, and although none of Tang Wulin’s team understood what it meant, its arrogance was extremely apparent. This led everyone to the realization that it was sneering at the thunder beast! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shivers ran down Xie Xie’s spine. “Even Boss’s spirit soul is as two-faced as him! Boss, ‘Goldlight’ just isn’t a suitable name for it! The name doesn’t do it justice at all! Look at how much it likes to hiss. Why don’t you change its name to Chatterbox!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Yue glared at Xie Xie as she slapped the back of his head. “You’re the chatterbox!” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since the day Gu Yue beat him, he no longer found himself able to muster even an ounce of defiance toward her. He zipped his mouth shut and lowered his head in embarrassment. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about calling it Goldsong?” Gu Yue said with a thoughtful smile on her face. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t that just a nicer way of calling it a chatterbox?” Tang Wulin asked helplessly. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Goldlight turned around and yelped at Gu Yue. The difference between how it regarded the thunder beast and Gu Yue was clear. It was practically fawning over her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“See? It likes the name,” Gu Yue said, nodding earnestly at Tang Wulin. “Let’s call it Goldsong from now on!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin resigned himself. “Alright, fine.” He always felt that Goldlight had been too simple of a name anyway. Goldsong was definitely a more pleasant name to say. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Then it shall henceforth be known as Goldsong.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Little did they know that Goldsong would become a name known and revered by all, once Tang Wulin rose to prominence in the future.</span> <i></i></p>
