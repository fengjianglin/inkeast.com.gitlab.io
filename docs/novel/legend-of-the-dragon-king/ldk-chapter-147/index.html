 <p><span style>Half of Xie Xie’s spirit energy flew toward Tang Wulin while the other half flew in another direction. As he watched the energy fly away, a giant figure emerged. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an enormous bear, its fur dark-gold in colour. Standing over three meters tall, it had thick arms and its majestic shoulders, akin to a great wall. Four golden claws of at least one meter in length extended from each paw. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Xie Xie!</span></i><span style> Tang Wulin screamed in agony within his heart, for he knew just what sort of backlash Xie Xie would experience after being slashed into pieces. Although dying in the spirit ascension platform did not signify a true death, Soul Masters would still face powerful mental backlash from their death experience. Though they all had plenty of experience in this by now, it was still Xie Xie’s first time being killed in such a gruesome manner. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin could instantly recognize the formidable soul beast before him. As a matter of fact, it would be impossible for him to not recognize it; it was simply too famous in the world of Soul Masters. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Reputed to be the strongest soul beast in the world, the Duskgold Dreadclaw Bear. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was rumored that the Duskgold Dreadclaw Bear was one of the most powerful bears within history and when mature, it would not need to fear any predator, not even true dragons. Should a battle between titans come to pass, the outcome would be difficult to guess. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Duskgold Dreadclaw Bear preferred to to live independently. Whether it be attack or defense, it possessed overwhelming power in every aspect. It truly was an existence that stood at the apex of the soul beast world. </span></p>
 <p><span style>If the Blazing Demon Lions were said to be one of the top predators in the elementary spirit ascension platform, then when faced with the Duskgold Dreadclaw Bear, all they would be able to do was beg for their lives. The reason was simple. Throughout the ages, the Duskgold Dreadclaw Bear had always been an existence that stood at the very peak! </span></p>
 <p><span style>This Duskgold Dreadclaw Bear before his eyes was only three meters tall, but should still be at the hundred-year level, if not higher. In comparison to other hundred-year soul beasts, if it was said that a hundred-year Man-Faced Demon Spider could kill a thousand-year soul beast, then a hundred-year Duskgold Dreadclaw Bear could make even ten-thousand-year level soul beasts run away in fear! That was just how frightening it was. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Never in his wildest dreams did Tang Wulin expect to run into this legendary bear within the rebellion spirit ascension platform. After all, wouldn’t such an amazing beast appear in the higher leveled spirit ascension platforms instead? </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fight it? You have got to be joking with me. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin threw his hammer straight at the Duskgold Dreadclaw Bear before turning around and fleeing. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Clang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A metallic note rung out as the Duskgold Dreadclaw Bear tore the hammer apart with one swipe. Furthermore, it had already completely absorbed the spirit energy left behind by Xie Xie. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Such a powerful claw! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, a bizarre thought popped into Tang Wulin’s mind. </span><i><span style>Is my Golden Dragon Claw stronger, or its Duskgold Dreadclaw? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Pressured by the dangerous aura behind him, Tang Wulin felt as if the entire forest had darkened. As soon as the Duskgold Dreadclaw Bear had appeared, the entire forest fell into a complete silence. Not even the chirping of birds could be heard. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Having dealt with the unexpected troubles from the sky, the Blazing Demon Lions roared and rushed toward Tang Wulin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin knew that it was impossible for him to escape. He clenched his teeth and run headfirst into the pride of lions. </span><i><span style>Regardless of who kills me, you won’t get off lightly either. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t immediately hit his ejection button. To him, even a little bit more spirit energy absorbed could lead to a wonderful situation. He wanted to hold out and absorb as much energy as possible. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The head lion stood over four meters tall and had a fiery red mane like a flickering flame. Its entire body was coated in an orange fire. A domineering aura emanated from its body, which was only bolstered when it roared wrathfully as if it was proclaiming its sovereignty. It was telling all the surrounding soul beasts that it was the ruler of this forest. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With one glance, it spotted Tang Wulin, his rich aura of spirit energy instantly catching its attention. The Blazing Demon Lion snarled a command to its lionesses, who quickly split up and surrounded Tang Wulin while it pounced directly at him. With such a fat slab of meat in front of it, how could it share with others? Its strength would leap substantially if it absorbed all of Tang Wulin’s spirit energy. </span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, however, Tang Wulin suddenly leapt up. A strand of Bluesilver Grass shot out. Pulling on it, he instantly changing his direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dark-gold light flew out, announcing the arrival of the Duskgold Dreadclaw Bear. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Its speed was completely uncharacteristic of its gigantic body. It hadn’t made a single noise while running. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aflame with arrogance and wildness, the thousand-year Blazing Demon Lion took one look at the bear and, as if a switch had been flipped, it immediately pressed down on all four legs and skidded to a halt. The flames on its body blew out and even its fiery mane had become dull. It flipped over a few times and landed in front of the bear with its tail between its legs. Rather than immediately trying to flee, it crawled on the floor and let our some sad cries. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“This, this is the Blazing Demon Lion King? Is it really a thousand-year Blazing Demon Lion?” Tang Wulin was dumbstruck as he witnessed such a shocking scene. </span><i><span style>Isn’t that guy just a little kitty now? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>That was right. In front of the Duskgold Dreadclaw Bear, the thousand-year Blazing Demon Lion and its lionesses were merely kittens. All their fires had extinguished as they crawled on the floor, swishing their tails as they begged for pity. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Duskgold Dreadclaw Bear didn’t even put them in its eyes. Its icy gaze had been fixed on Tang Wulin the entire time. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin urgently raised his right claw just as a dark-gold light flashed, filling his heart with panic. He immediately pulled on the strand of Bluesilver Grass he had shot out and swung in another direction. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A gigantic dark-gold figure destroyed everything in the place he had been just a split-second before. </span></p>
 <p><span style>That was right! Everything!</span></p>
 <p><span style>There wasn’t even any rumbling as the trees, bushes and even the earth were torn to shreds. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Duskgold Dreadclaw… That’s a real Duskgold Dreadclaw! It could even tear open a dragon’s body! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The humongous Duskgold Dreadclaw Bear soared into the air with a terrifying leap, overtaking Tang Wulin in a flash. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ll risk it all! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A golden light twinkled in Tang Wulin’s eyes as he directed all his soul power into his right arm. A wave of golden scales covered his arms and his Golden Dragon Claw appeared. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to the huge Duskgold Dreadclaw, Tang Wulin’s Golden Dragon Claw was simply tiny. He fiercely slashed at the Duskgold Dreadclaw with his dragon claw. </span></p>
 <p><span style>While attacking, Tang Wulin adjusted his posture in the air, keeping his head away from the bear. Even if his Golden Dragon Claw was torn apart and his body was cleaved into two, it would be fine as long as his head wasn’t destroyed immediately. If it were, the split-second of pain he would experience would leave many residual effects. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He had just decided on this retaliation, because if he didn’t test the true might of his Golden Dragon Claw, he would regret it. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Clang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Golden Dragon Claw met with the Duskgold Dreadclaw in an explosive collision. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In the brief moment that their two claws had clashed, Tang Wulin felt all his soul power being drawn out and his blood boiling. In particular, a spot between his eyebrows was burning as a faint golden light appeared. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As the Duskgold Dreadclaw swept past, it not only missed his head, but also his entire upper body. Unfortunately, Tang Wulin’s Golden Dragon Claw disappeared in the next moment while the Duskgold Dreadclaw continued to slash across his body. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie had been torn in half vertically, while Tang Wulin was cleaved in half horizontally. The last thing he felt was his lower body separating from his upper body. </span></p>
 <p><span style>An icy numbness washed over him as darkness enveloped his mind. </span></p>
