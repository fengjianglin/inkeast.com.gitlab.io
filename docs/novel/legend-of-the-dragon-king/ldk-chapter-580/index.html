 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Tang Wulin and his friends gawked at Mu Ye’s sudden arrival, Mu Ye said, “The ocean is very dangerous right now. A powerful ocean soul beast is attacking. Stay here and don’t move.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A shiver ran down Tang Wulin’s spine. Mu Ye was a body cultivator, divine-grade mecha pilot, and rank 94 Titled Douluo. Seeing how he was acting, Tang Wulin could only imagine how terrifying the attacking soul beast was!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Teacher, what’s attacking us?” Tang Wulin asked, surprising everyone since they all knew this wasn’t the time for questions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Ye furrowed his brow. “It looks like a shiver of great white demon sharks, a very large one made up of ten smaller packs. Each pack is led by a ten-thousand-year shark. One of the sharks in the shiver is even bigger than those ten-thousand-year sharks.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wulin’s heart thumped anxiously. He met Mu Ye’s eyes and saw his master’s cheek twitch. Even without being told explicitly, Tang Wulin understood that this attack had something to do with his training the previous night.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Ye waved a hand and a white porcelain jar appeared. Handing the jar to Tang Wulin, he said, “Eat this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wulin opened the jar and a fishy smell instantly assaulted his nose. He peered in and saw some tawny oil. “This is…?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s oil from the head of a ten-thousand-year great white demon shark. It’s a good supplement packed full of nutrients.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What the hell?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wulin averted his gaze and coughed.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Well, this is pretty nice. Teacher is giving me supplements now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without another thought, Tang Wulin raised the jar to his lips and chugged all of the shark oil. It tasted just as fishy as it smelled, but the moment it entered his belly, it filled his body with warmth and brought clarity to his mind. The tension eased from his shoulders as a relaxing, comfortable feeling enveloped him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While the students watched Tang Wulin chugging oil, Mu Ye muttered to himself, “I never thought there would be such a gigantic and powerful pack of soul beasts in the ocean. The one that shot the stream of water earlier has to be an abyssal demon whale. Judging from that attack, it’s at least at the ten-thousand-year level. An Abyssal Demon Whale King versus a Great White Demon Shark King. What a mighty showdown!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After finishing the oil, Tang Wulin turned his mind back to the problem at hand. Now he was certain that the attacking soul beasts were related to them, but he couldn’t understand why Mu Ye acted as if they had nothing to do with them. In fact, Mu Ye seemed to be delighted by the situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before Tang Wulin could voice his concern, he saw several figures flying out from the ships. Three from theirs, and two from the other. The five people hovered in the air, waves of valiant might rolling off of them. Tang Wulin’s eyes went wide as he recognized one of them. It was the Silver Moon Douluo, Cai Yue’er!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A chilly breeze swept in through the balcony door, and Wu Zhangkong floated down to the balcony. He furrowed his brow at the sight of Mu Ye. “Who are you?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Ye gestured at his clothes. “A chef.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Zhangkong’s directed a cold glare full of pressure at Mu Ye, but Mu Ye shrugged it off and smiled. Despite the chill enveloping him, he paid no mind to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Zhangkong’s gaze sharpened, and just as he was about to step forward to confront Mu Ye, Tang Wulin blurted out, “Teacher Wu, it’s okay! He’s another one of my teachers.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Zhangkong blanched in surprise, but the expression only lasted for a moment. He regained his composure, landed on the balcony, and looked to Tang Wulin. “Where’s Xu Xiaoyan?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She went ahead to eat breakfast.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Find her and bring her back,” Wu Zhangkong ordered. “The situation isn’t good. We’re completely surrounded by soul beasts, all of which are quite powerful, and since we’re in open water, they have the advantage.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll go find her!” Yue Zhengyu exclaimed, immediately dashing off. The moment the door closed behind him, another giant pillar of water shot out of the ocean.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Floating high up in the air, an elderly man with red hair scoffed at the sight. He instantly disappeared in a blur of movement, only to reappear in front of the pillar of water. With a wave of his hand, crimson light blossomed and struck the pillar of water, reducing it to scattered mist. The man snorted once more, and in the blink of an eye, he returned to his previous position.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Humans...” a chilling voice came from the depths of the ocean. “You trespass in my territory... You slaughter my clansmen... If you do not hand over the murderer responsible... I will take vengeance upon all of you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These words had not been spoken. They did not ring in everyone’s ears. Instead, they resounded in their minds, directly transmitted with spiritual power! Even protected by a soul barrier, everyone on the ship could hear it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A gigantic shark slowly rose from the water’s depths and surfaced. Its silver back was a small island unto itself, and its mighty fin had a sharp edge to it. A distance away, a purple whale rose from the depths as well, the true enormity of it becoming clear as its shadow stretched hundreds of meters. With the appearance of these two beasts came an oppressive aura that weighed down upon everyone present. Hundreds more beasts, lesser sharks and whales, broke the surface around their respective lords. At a glance they numbered over a thousand in total.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We never killed any of your clansmen,” Elder Cai said. “We’re only passing through. If you continue to bar our way, don’t blame me for being ruthless. Do you think just two of you hundred-thousand-year soul beasts can stop us? We humans always need more hundred-thousand-year soul rings anyway.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Humanity and soul beasts shared a relationship filled with tension. The soul beasts on land had already been hunted to extinction, and with the Spirit Pagoda’s technological advancements on top of that, soul beasts were becoming irrelevant. For the sake of avoiding humans, the soul beasts in the ocean actively avoided land and hid in the darkest depths of the water.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shrek Academy had always been in favor of humanity and soul beasts living in harmony, but Elder Cai was no gentle soul. When faced with soul beasts blockading her ship, she would act politely. Even if someone on the ship had slaughtered ocean soul beasts, she couldn’t turn them over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waves of might burst from both the great white demon shark king and abyssal demon whale king. A roar exploded through the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And a massive jet of water shot toward Elder Cai.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Cai snorted and pointed a finger to the sky. In an instant, the sky grew dim, and a silver moon flashed. Silver light slashed down and destroyed the jet of water in an explosion of mist. Once the ocean spray dispersed and the water settled down, everyone saw that the silver moon was still hanging in the sky. With it, a domineering aura was bursting from Elder Cai.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She’s a Hyper Douluo?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shock ran through the hearts of everyone presents, including the lords of the sharks and whales, and even and the powerhouses at Elder Cai’s side. There was no mistaking the strength of her aura. She was undoubtedly a Hyper Douluo! Furthermore, she possessed this level of tyrannical strength before equipping her battle armor. It was no wonder she could talk with such arrogance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then Elder Cai’s Soul rings appeared Three purple, three black, and three red! These nine twinkling soul rings revolved around her. The sky darkened further, and the silver moon shone brightly in the sky. As she floated at the boundary between heaven and earth, she seemed to be the center of the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of the members of the Star Luo delegation gaped at Elder Cai’s majesty.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is this the strength of an expert from Shrek Academy? Shrek really is worthy of being called the greatest academy on Douluo!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The abyssal whale king and great white demon shark king faced Elder Cai in silence for what seemed to be an eternity. Then the purple hue of the water deepened, and numerous whirlpools appeared around the ships. They rapidly grew in size, soon threatening to swallow both ships whole. Faced with Elder Cai’s threat, instead of fleeing, the two soul beasts decided to fight!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Cai frowned. The next instant, she appeared right above the shark king and whale king. Streaks of silver flew out from her body and transformed into her battle armor.&nbsp;</span></p>
