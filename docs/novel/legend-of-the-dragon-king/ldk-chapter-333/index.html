 <p></p>
 <p><i><span style>So senior sister will be in Yuanen Yehui’s class...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The thought of Yuanen Yehui reminded Tang Wulin of the twenty thousand contribution points he had been fined, and his heart soon began to ache. If not for the exceptional circumstances, he probably would have given Xie Xie a good beating. After all, this fine came about because Xie Xie peeped on a girl! However, Tang Wulin could tell that there was something amiss with Xie Xie lately. Even though they were basically sworn brothers, there wasn’t much he could do beyond offering a few words of comfort. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, Tang Wulin had a fairly good relationship with Yuanen. However, now that Yuanen became Yuanen Yehui, and after the recent incident, he was afraid it wouldn’t be easy to repair their relationship. The entire incident had been Xie Xie’s fault, and Tang Wulin had taken action without completely understanding the situation. He resolved to find her and apologize when he got back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Xi escorted Tang Wulin to the entrance of the building. “I’m going to campus to report tomorrow. I’ll give you a call once I get there.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay,” Tang Wulin replied. Senior sister, there’s a lot of freedom at Shrek. Since you’re a fourth-rank blacksmith, you’ll definitely be very popular!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Xi snorted. “What’s so great about being a fourth-rank blacksmith? You’re already at the fifth rank. Who knows when I’ll finally catch up to you.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin gave her a wry smile. “What’s your soul power rank at now, senior sister?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rank 38,” she answered. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow! You’re almost at rank 40! I’ll probably get to rank 30 around the time you reach rank 40. When that happens, let’s try spirit refining together. Senior sister, have you decided to become a battle armor master?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Xi paused for a moment, staring at him blankly. “I haven’t thought about that before. I’ve only ever wanted to be a great blacksmith.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think you should work toward becoming a battle armor master like me!” Tang Wulin exclaimed. “Shrek is a place where geniuses grow and prosper—not taking advantage of it would be a waste. Becoming a battle armor master is the requirement for graduating from the outer court anyway. Making battle armor will definitely help us a lot. It’ll make us more powerful, aid in our cultivation, and will also improve our blacksmithing skills. With it boosting our cultivation, we will be capable of higher-level blacksmithing even sooner. We’ll be doing half the work for double the results!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Xi mulled it over. Although her soul power rank was higher than Tang Wulin’s, she was seventeen years old this year. She couldn't be considered anything great in Shrek Academy. In fact, she was a bit below average. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What you’re saying does make some sense, but can I really do it?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you’re determined, nothing’s impossible. Let’s do our best, senior sister!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mn. Alright.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>As Mu Xi watched Tang Wulin’s departing figure, she subconsciously clenched her fists. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll definitely do my best,” she muttered. “I won’t fall too far behind you! I’m going to catch up one day!” </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>☀ </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>At the working student dormitory, Xie Xie paced back and forth in front of a door, occasionally rubbing his hands nervously. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The dormitory had been cleaned up and all the broken windows replaced. Xie Xie had done it all himself. Even after replacing the window panes, he wiped all of them until they were sparkling. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He was the only person in the dormitory at the moment. Xu Xiaoyan had gone to report to the Designer's Association, Gu Yue had disappeared as she usually did, Tang Wulin had gone out as well, and neither Yuanen nor Yue Zhengyu had returned yet. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie continuously replayed the forbidden scene he had witnessed that day. Although he only remembered her hazy silhouette, the room had been misty with only a dim light, the image was burned into his mind. To a youth of no more than thirteen years old, the impact of that scene had been too much for his innocent heart. </span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, the sound of footsteps rang out. Xie Xie’s heart leaped to his throat and he quickly hid. After a moment, he realized that it was just Yue Zhengyu. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Zhengyu wore a dour expression. He thought he had finally caught an evil soul master, but instead he had misidentified her and was punished. It was as if fate were playing a cruel joke on him. The sight of Xie Xie made his face darken even further.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing here? Oh, all of the windows are fixed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mn.” Xie Xie nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Zhengyu walked over to Xie Xie, a slight smirk on his lips. “Are you waiting here to admit you were wrong?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie knitted his brow. “Why does it matter if I admit it? It’s only natural for me to acknowledge my mistakes.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you can just wait here patiently.” Yue Zhengyu chuckled and casually placed his hands behind his head as he turned toward his room. “Be careful though! Tang Wulin and the others aren’t here this time, so don’t make her mad again. You’ll be toast if you do.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie grumpily shooed Yue Zhengyu away then turned to to the dormitory entrance and waited. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he turned around, he was astonished to see Yuanen Yehui returning. She walked in complete silence, completely ignoring Xie Xie as she returned to her room. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuanen Yehui currently wore her usual men’s uniform and had her Yuanen disguise on. If Xie Xie hadn’t confirmed her femininity with his own eyes, he wouldn’t have been able to claim that she was wearing a disguise. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Summoning his courage, Xie Xie ran over before she could enter her room. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yuanen!” he exclaimed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuanen Yehui stopped and turned to him, both of her eyes icy to their very cores. Before her aura of fury, Xie Xie couldn’t help but falter. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Screw off!” she yelled, going into her room and slamming the door in Xie Xie’s face. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… I came to apologize,” Xie Xie mumbled to the door. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A loud bang resounded from within the room, startling Xie Xie. Fearing for his life, he immediately took off running. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He was still traumatized by Yuanen Yehui’s killing intent from that night. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside of her room, Yuanen Yehui threw herself onto her bed. The ice in her eyes instantly thawed, and in its place was emptiness. She lay there unmoving, and soon enough, tears began streaming down her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet she did not sob a single time. </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>☀ </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>By the time Tang Wulin returned to the dormitory, Gu Yue had come back as well. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin frowned when he saw Xie Xie sitting on his bed, staring off into nothingness. “What’s going on? Why do you look so dazed?’ &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Xie slowly turned to Tang Wulin, his blank expression transitioning into one of defeat. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I went to go apologize to Yuanen Yehui, but she completely disregarded me.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin made dumbfounded face. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can't be so impatient!” he said. “You have to wait for her to calm down before you try apologizing. Just forget about it for now and focus on earning enough contribution points to pay off your fine. You can just work on slowly making amends. As she is now, however, things between you two won’t be easy to fix. Anyway... just be careful and try to not make her angry.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mn.” Xie Xie smiled bitterly. “I know. I don’t want to die just yet.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your thinking has been wrong these past few days,” Tang Wulin said. “Xiaoyan is practicing her designing, so why aren’t you over at the Maker’s Association? The competition here is so fierce yet you’re not making good use of your time. Are you trying to be one of the ten people that’ll be expelled? Stop overthinking things. The past is the past. Just focus on improving yourself first. If you don’t, you won’t survive even a minute against Yuanen.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s words lit a fire in Xie Xie’s eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re right!” he cried. “I’m still too weak compared to her. First, I need to become strong!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as he finished speaking, he leaped from his bed and made for the door. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are you going?” Tang Wulin asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to the Maker’s Association to practice!” Xie Xie shouted as he dashed out the door. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin couldn’t help but smile. </span><i><span style>That guy’s mood changes so often. Well... at least he recovers quickly too. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin climbed onto his bed, closed his eyes, and began meditating. As of now, nothing was more important for him than reaching rank 30. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tang Wulin! Kiddo, are you here?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Tang Wulin began clearing his mind of distracting thoughts, a familiar voice called to him from outside and his eyes shot open. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why’d he come all the way here to find me? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Having no other choice, he got up and went outside. The moment he set foot out of his room, Tang Wulin saw the energetic Feng Wuyu. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m here, Elder Feng,” he said. “What are you here for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Am I not welcome here?” Feng Wuyu scowled at him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin smiled apologetically. “You’re welcome here! Of course you are. There’s no way you wouldn’t be welcome. Did you need something from me?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Wuyu snorted. “It’s your win, kid. I admit defeat. Now come with me.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>With no further explanation, he grabbed Tang Wulin, threw him over his shoulder, and rushed off like a gale. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Seconds later, they were in Feng Wuyu’s workshop. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin sighed in resignation. “Elder Feng, can you stop doing this all the time? I’ll give you my number, so you can just call me when you need me. You don’t have to abduct me every single time, you know?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Wuyu threw Tang Wulin to the ground. “We can talk about that later. First, I’m going to help you get to rank 30.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Feng, I don’t have any money or contribution points!” Tang Wulin shouted. “I still have a twenty thousand point fine to pay off! You can’t force me to do this!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin still owed Yuanen Yehui twenty thousand contribution points. Even if he paid her by way of thousand refining, he would have to buy the raw metal himself. If he needed to pay Feng Wuyu ten spirit refinings as well, it would take even longer to for him to pay off his debt. The success rate for spirit refining was low, and countless pieces of metal would be reduced to scraps in the process of successfully spirit refining ten times. </span></p>
