 <p><span style>Unlike other soul master academies, Shrek Academy enrolled students once every three years. The various alliances and unions on the continent would select their most outstanding talents to apply. Applicants were required to be under fifteen years old. There was no minimum soul power prerequisite; however, applicants must show excellence in at least one area. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Because the Skysea Alliance was known to have inferior soul masters compared with other Alliances, they received fewer quotas. Each time Shrek’s enrollment came around, they were granted about 120 quotas. These 120 quotas would be split between dozens of cities! On average, each city received two or three of these. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As the number one academy in the Skysea Alliance, Skysea Academy kept twenty to itself. Meanwhile, the other academies had to rely on luck and the whims of the Alliance. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Naturally, Skysea Academy had a higher position than other normal academies. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Zhenpeng, your Sealand Academy has always managed to secure a few quotas with your strength. Why are you asking me for more?” Long Huantian spoke without batting an eyelash. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After a moment of silence, Zhang Zhenpeng said, “I’m not talking about the normal quotas. I’m asking for the inner court examination ones.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Huantian stared wide-eyed at the request, a powerful aura spilling out of his body. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you say? The inner court quotas?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>They were given about 120 ordinary quotas. As for the inner court examination quotas, the entire Skysea Alliance was granted five. This was the same number of fingers on a hand! </span></p>
 <p><span style>These five quotas were usually monopolized by Skysea Academy.It was atypical that one would be given to an outstanding student in another academy. Even then, many conditions and benefits had to be offered as compensation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a distinct gap between Shrek Academy’s inner and outer courts. Anyone who could become an inner court disciple would be the pride of the entire Skysea Alliance. However, several years had passed since someone from the Skysea Alliance had entered the inner court. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Rarely did Shrek Academy’s inner court admit more than ten people at once. It wasn’t an uncommon sight for them to accept none at all. One could imagine how difficult the exam was. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Typically, the inner court disciples were promoted from the outer court. Only once in a blue moon would someone matriculate directly into the inner court. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite this, inner court examination quotas were worth their weight in gold. Possessing this quota was like receiving the backing of the Skysea Alliance. Such lucky fellows were guaranteed admittance into the outer court if they failed the inner court examination. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, these five quotas were precious. They were practically five tickets to becoming a future battle armor master! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shrek Academy was very strict on its internal affairs. None of its students could participate in the continent’s disputes. Even so, many of the restrictions were lifted after graduation. As long as they didn’t tarnish Shrek Academy’s name, the outer court graduates could choose their path without interference. Of course, becoming criminals was out of the question. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The importance of a future battle armor master recommended by the academy was obvious. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Zhenpeng asked for the inner court examination quotas so suddenly; how could Long Huantian’s not be shocked? </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Huantian, hear me out first. I know it’s rude to ask this of you, but my students this time are truly excellent. If I didn’t believe they could pass the inner court examination, then I wouldn’t request this of you. In the end, isn’t Sealand Academy a part of the Skysea Alliance? Should my students enter the inner court, that would bring glory to the entire Alliance. In fact, it might even increase the number of quotas we receive in the future.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shrek Academy had a rule that stated any region whose student had passed the inner court examination were due extra quotas in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Huantian’s expression was stern. “Brother Zhenpeng, you should know that I don’t have sole control of the inner court quotas. The decision is up to the Alliance.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Zhenpeng smiled calmly. He knew that this was just an excuse. Long Huantian had no intention of giving up the quotas. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about this, Brother Huantian? Watch a few of my disciples’ matches first. If they can distinguish themselves in the junior division, perhaps you’ll reconsider. We don’t have much time until the examinations.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>In a noncommittal manner, Long Huantian said, “Alright. Let’s see for now then.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The screen in box one displayed the arena. The two competing teams had just entered. </span></p>
 <p><span style>On one side was a team of three girls. The leader of the three stood tall and had sky-blue hair. Though no more than fifteen years old, she was slender, bearing the elegant charms of a lady.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>To her left was a girl whose appearance mirrored hers. Only the shade of her hair—light green like meadow—was different. Such a hair color was few and far in between. The contrast between their identical faces and different hair tones drew Long Huantian’s attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Huantian understood his old friend and knew that Zhang Zhenpeng would not speak without thinking. </span><i><span style>Since he made such a request, he must hold utmost confidence in his disciples. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Apart from the twins, the remaining girl had a head of blonde hair. Her figure was thin and she towered over her teammates. She looked like a bean sprout and her bright eyes were striking. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“The blonde one is Wang Dongqi. Her martial soul is the Thunderflash Sword. She has three rings and is a rank 32 assault-type soul master. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“The blue-haired one and green-haired one are twin sisters. They are Zhou Hanyou and Zhou Tian’er, respectively. Zhou Hanyou has three rings and is at rank 31. Zhou Tian’er has two rings at rank 27,” Zhang Zhenpeng introduced his three disciples briefly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Huantian nodded in approval. He studied their competition statistics and was alarmed, sucking in a deep breath. He was not surprised that Sealand Academy’s team had four victories in the round-robin tournament. Yet, their opponents from Eastsea Academy also had four wins. Moreover, it was Eastsea Academy’s tertiary team. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Eastsea City was large, it was not blessed by talents often. As such, Eastsea Academy ranked slightly below the median. The fact that their tertiary team accumulated these victories added to Long Huantian’s disbelief. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A single glance was needed to see how young they were. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you paid any attention to this team from Eastsea Academy, Brother Zhenpeng?” Long Huantian asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A strange expression slithered its way across Zhang Zhenpeng’s face. He gave a slight nod. “I watched them for a bit. That team is really peculiar. Although they’re really young, their combat strength is extraordinary.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh?” Long Huantian directed a look of inquiry at him. He understood his friend’s high standards, aware that such an evaluation would not be given lightly. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eastsea Academy’s tertiary team is composed completely of ten-year-olds. Their captain is called Tang Wulin and he only has one ring. That being said, it’s a thousand-year ring. In the previous matches, he was able to fend off the combined attacks of his opponents alone. His martial soul is supposedly Bluesilver Grass, though it is likely a variant. His body’s strength is extraordinary and his right hand can transform into a dragon’s claw. From my observations, he shouldn’t have twin martial souls. I haven’t seen a second ring appear yet. Maybe it’s one of those rare soul bones.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Long Huantian was surprised a moment ago, then now he was in denial. </span><i><span style>Zhang Zhenpeng actually paid so much attention to Eastsea’s tertiary team? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The understanding between Zhang Zhenpeng and Long Huantian went both ways. A smile appeared on Zhang Zhenpeng’s lips as he stared at Long Huantian, fully aware of his friend’s thoughts. “You’ll understand once the match begins. These kids aren’t normal by any means! If they hadn’t met my team, then would have continued their winning streak most likely. Eastsea Academy must have recruited an amazing teacher; otherwise, how else could they have raised such astounding talents?” &nbsp;</span></p>
