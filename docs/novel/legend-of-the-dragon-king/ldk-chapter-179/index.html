 <p><span style>The world around him gradually came into focus; then, he saw Wu Zhangkong. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong’s white robe was in tatters and he haggardly stood while using his Skyfrost Sword as a cane. </span></p>
 <p><span style>His long hair was a disheveled mess, creating a sight of him that Tang Wulin had never seen before. Yet he still stood tall, despite his injuries and exhaustion. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking out further, Tang Wulin realized that a dozen soul beasts circled them while several beast corpses littered the ground. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s… </span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s protecting me… We’re still in the spirit ascension platform? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Tea-Teacher Wu…” Tang Wulin feebly called out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A tremble ran through Wu Zhangkong as he looked back. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Wu Zhangkong cut a sorry figure, Tang Wulin’s appearance was far more frightening. Little snakes of blood seeped from his eyes, ears, nostrils and mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re awake?” Wu Zhangkong dashed to Tang Wulin’s side. The ice in Wu Zhangkong’s eyes thawed to reveal a burning self-blame, but Tang Wulin didn’t notice this—his mind was still muddled. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mn.” Tang Wulin simply responded. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong ordered, “We’re returning!” He let out a deep breath, relieved that Tang Wulin was fine. Even though it would take some time for Tang Wulin to recover, everything was good so long as he lived. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He slapped the escape button on the back of Tang Wulin’s hand before hitting his own. The two instantly disappeared with a beam of light. </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>☀</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin remained motionless as the glass cover opened slowly. The murkiness of his mind hadn’t disappeared even after leaving the spirit ascension platform but rather, it became more obvious and pronounced. His body felt bloated and he was unable to move his body. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The glass cover of the container beside him opened and Wu Zhangkong got out. He rushed over to Tang Wulin and lifted him out of the glass case. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s case could only be described as a rag doll-like body right now. His limbs were so feeble that he could do nothing but be at the mercy of others. Wu Zhangkong helped Tang Wulin into his clothes before clothing himself. Gently lifting Tang Wulin’s limp body, Wu Zhangkong carried Tang Wulin on his back. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“He absorbed too much spirit energy. Does he need an inspection?” A staff member asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong shook his head. “No need. I’ll be enough to take care of him and he’ll be fine once he wakes up.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright. But once you leave it will no longer be a concern of the Spirit Pagoda,” warned the staff member. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong nodded then left the Spirit Pagoda with Tang Wulin on his back. He had planned on heading back to Eastsea City immediately after their venture in the Spirit Pagoda, but right now he needed to find an inn to stay another night. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was necessary for Tang Wulin to adjust to the sudden influx of energy at the moment, otherwise he may be faced with some residual effects. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s mind was still befuddled, so he immediately dozed off the moment he hit the bed. Wu Zhangkong also yearned for rest. His complexion was pale after a day-long adventure in the spirit ascension platform, one that was plagued with challenges far more difficult than he had expected. There were very few beasts that posed a threat to him in the intermediate level, yet they actually managed to run into one today. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Three-Eyed Demon Ape’s advantage lay in its spiritual-attribute. Not only could it employ spiritual attack, it was also bestowed with intelligence far beyond its peers. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Even so, it wasn’t really that difficult for him to defeat the Three-Eyed Demon Ape. What he never expected was to make such a grave mistake while his mind was rebounding from the spiritual attack. If it hadn’t been Tang Wulin who absorbed the energy, then the consequences would have been far worse. </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>☀</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>It took a full night’s rest before Tang Wulin awoke, yet his mind was still murky, preventing him from sensing the changes in his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you feeling any better?” Wu Zhangkong asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin strained himself to nod, having finally regained some control over his body. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong helped him sit up. “Your mind received a powerful attack and you will need some time to recover. I know you’re in pain right now but you must still cultivate your Purple Demon Eyes to adjust your spiritual power. There may be some residual effects left otherwise.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay!” Tang Wulin readily agreed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong took a seat behind Tang Wulin and pressed one palm into Tang Wulin’s back while the other lay against the back of his head. A gentle stream of soul power seeped into Tang Wulin’s body, facilitating his cultivation of the Purple Demon Eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin had never found cultivating hard, but now he faced some difficulties in controlling his soul power. Without Wu Zhangkong’s help, he would have been unable to circulate his soul power properly in this state. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He circulated his soul power according to the Mysterious Heaven Method, gradually filling every inch of his body with power. Warmth spread throughout his body and restored his vitality. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With the immense gap between their cultivations, it required practically no effort on Wu Zhangkong’s part to guide Tang Wulin along. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After cultivating the Mysterious Heaven Method for a whole day, he was able to start practicing the Purple Demon Eyes. His body felt refreshed and his mind grew clearer, relaxing him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s suffering gradually subsided as his mind and body regained their normalcy. It took him a few more circulation cycles before he was able to cultivate on his own again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Zhangkong withdrew his hands and released a long sigh. </span><i><span style>This child really is a genius! Who else would be able to bear an over two-thousand-year spirit soul! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin’s spiritual world barely contained all of this energy but his body was more than sturdy enough. His soul power had also been refined through this process and was now at rank 16. </span></p>
 <p><span style>His spirit soul, however, had not yet finished its evolution due to his insufficient spiritual power and it would take a while longer before the process was complete. Danger shadowed him during this process, forcing the two to sit there and wait until it finished. Even once it finished, they would have to continually examine Tang Wulin’s state. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly, they stayed for a whole week. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin meditated nonstop the entire time. A golden glow appeared on his body the third day, signaling the beginning of the spirit soul evolution. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Goldlight resonated with Tang Wulin’s breathing and gradually began to change. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to the first spirit soul evolution, the changes were much more distinct this time. Goldlight grew to one foot in length and its scales rose up slightly, gaining a sparkling and limpid luster. Its entire body was now a dull gold while two small points appeared on its head. The golden veined pattern on it became more distinct. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Its bright eyes possessed a violet gloss as the evolution progressed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It had grown from a ten-year to hundred-year to thousand-year spirit soul in such a short period of time. It was as if Goldlight had been born again, possessing an aura completely unlike before. With each breath, the golden veined pattern on Tang Wulin brightened. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When the spirit soul evolution finished four days later and Tang Wulin roused from his meditation, there was an imperceptible change to him. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>His skin became more fair and radiant, his height had increased by at least three centimeters, his eyes were practically sparkling now, and his aura had transformed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Wulin was well aware of these transformations. He also discovered that as he practiced the Mysterious Heaven Method, a small whirlpool of soul power began to form in his dantian. When this whirlpool appeared, both his cultivation and recovery accelerated. </span></p>
