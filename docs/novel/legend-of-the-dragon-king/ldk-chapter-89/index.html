 <p>Eat, study, Class Promotion Tournament.</p>
 <p>The days flew by quickly. Tang Wulin’s trio had begun to be pointed out of the crowd countless times throughout the day. Naturally, this was because of the events at the entrance gates the day before.</p>
 <p>Many people found it strange that Tang Wulin’s trio hadn’t been punished by the academy. In fact, everything went on like normal, as if nothing had happened at all.</p>
 <p>The number of students who had gathered around Wu Zhangkong to watch him grew even larger now, so much so that many teachers weren’t even able to enter. After the previous day’s battle, the Icily Arrogant Prince Charming’s fame had reached a whole new level. He wasn’t just the female student’s Prince Charming now, rather, he was the Prince Charming of the entire academy. Despite all of this, Wu Zhangkong showed no reaction at all and was his same old self.</p>
 <p>In the match after school with the first grade’s class two, Tang Wulin, Xie Xie, and Gu Yue hadn’t expended too much strength. Only one of their opponents had a hundred year soul ring, and when faced with the coordination of Tang Wulin’s trio, they were completely helpless. Xie Xie was supported by Gu Yue’s firepower and was easily able to defeat their opponents.</p>
 <p>Three battles, three victories. With the addition of the outburst at the gates the day before, class five had become the focus of attention of the entire academy.</p>
 <p>Tomorrow was their rest day, and after their rest day, it would come time for them to challenge class one. Every single grade’s class one was completely different from the rest. That was because class one was a gathering of that year’s most outstanding geniuses. In the last twenty years, class one had never been defeated by a class below them in ranking.</p>
 <p>After eating dinner, Tang Wulin and Xie Xie prepared to return to their dorm, but Gu Yue stopped them.</p>
 <p>“Where are you two going tomorrow? Hurry up and tell me, otherwise, you can’t blame me for being rude.” Gu Yue spoke with her hands on her hips and gave them a fierce expression. Although she wasn’t particularly beautiful, she was definitely pretty. With her appearance like this, others couldn’t help but laugh.</p>
 <p>“Why do we need to tell you where we’re going or what we’re doing?” Xie Xie snorted out.</p>
 <p>Gu Yue’s mouth twitched as she said, “I already heard what you guys were talking about when we were eating. You guys are going out tomorrow. It’s fine if you don’t tell me, but I’ll just go and find Teacher Wu and ask him for additional training. Then you two can forget about running off tomorrow. And in any case, we’re going to do battle with class one soon, so extra training would be fitting.”</p>
 <p>“How can you be so loathsome?” Xie Xie stared at her with wide eyes before turning it into a glower.</p>
 <p>Gu Yue coldly snorted. “I’m just this annoying. Got a problem? Are you going to tell me or not?”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin hastily smoothed things over. “Gu Yue, I’m the one who asked Xie Xie to take me to the auction house tomorrow. I haven’t ever been to one before.”</p>
 <p>Gu Yue smiled. “Good. Then we’ll all go together then.”</p>
 <p>Xie Xie avoided looking at her as he said, “Who wants you to come? This is a man’s matter.”</p>
 <p>Gu Yue answered, “I didn’t say I want to go with you either. With your revolting behaviour, it’ll be fine if it’s just me and Wulin.”</p>
 <p>Xie Xie eyed her suspiciously. Although he was only nine years old, Tang Wulin was still exceptionally handsome. “Could it be that you like Wulin? You’re only this old yet you’ve matured so much already.”</p>
 <p>“Are you looking to die?” Gu Yue raised her hand, sending an ice ball flying towards him. Xie Xie evaded it in a flurry.</p>
 <p>“<i>Haha</i>. It looks like I was right! I’ll go tell Teacher Wu that you’re following bad examples at such a young age!”</p>
 <p>“You can do so if you wish to die.” Gu Yue threw herself forwards, a bright light flying from her hand as she chased after Xie Xie.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin helplessly looked at the two of them. He had long since gotten used to the scene of their squabbling. All he could do was raise his arms and stop their fighting.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">☀</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Ultimately, the three of them set off early in the morning the next day. Xie Xie had wanted to leave early to throw off Gu Yue, but was unable to have his way. Gu Yue was waiting at the dormitory doors and caught him red-handed.</p>
 <p>“Xie Xie, where is the auction house?” Tang Wulin curiously asked as they walked.</p>
 <p>Xie Xie shot a glance at the smiling Gu Yue to the side. “It’s in the Eastsea Museum! Our Eastsea City’s auction house is combined with the museum. There’s a special place to exhibit auction goods in the museum. They will also periodically hold auctions. Let’s go look at the goods on exhibition. The auction times will also be listed there.”</p>
 <p>Gu Yue curiously asked Tang Wulin, “Wulin, how come you suddenly wanted to go to the auction house? I never saw you show this much interest in it before.”</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin said, “It’s just a sudden whim. Let’s just go and casually take a look.”</p>
 <p>Eastsea Museum was located just south of Eastsea City’s center. It was a simple and unadorned building, and consisted of one main building and two secondary buildings.</p>
 <p>The main building had on exhibition with all sorts of rare soul beast specimen. Eastsea City had encountered all sorts of items and beasts over the various ages.</p>
 <p>To the left was a secondary building, which was the auction house’s goods exhibition area Xie Xie had spoken of. As for the auction house itself, it was on the upper levels of the main building.</p>
 <p>The auction house’s goods exhibition area within the secondary building didn’t require one to purchase a ticket to enter, and one could directly enter as one pleased. The number of people who were looking at the goods within numbered more than just a few.</p>
 <p>The secondary building had four floors in total. Although it was just a secondary building, its size was still enormous. Looking at it from the outside, the building was at least two hundred meters wide.</p>
 <p>Eastsea City was the second largest city on the eastern coast and this was the city’s only auction house. Naturally, its size had to be great. Goods were being exhibited on all four floors. They were, however, separated according to their grade. Naturally, some of the rarer and more expensive items would only be displayed in special areas that weren’t open to just anyone.</p>
 <p>As soon as they entered, the trio saw an enormous signboard that showed that the first floor was divided into two large sections: Soul devices and non-soul device. Within these two divisions, the soul device area was divided further into uncommon metal section and the larger finished soul devices section.</p>
 <p>“Where are we going?” Xie Xie could vaguely guess Tang Wulin’s purpose in coming to the auction house, but he still directly asked Tang Wulin.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin said, “Let’s go to the non-soul device section. I want to see if they’re auctioning those two fruits I told you about that day.”</p>
 <p>“Spirit fruit? You want to buy some spirit fruit?” Gu Yue curiously asked.</p>
 <p>Tang Wulin said, “I don’t really want to. I’m just a bit curious and want to take a look, that’s all.” Although Xie Xie and Gu Yue were his friends, the matter pertaining to the Golden Dragon King was simply too shocking to tell them. He was still very young, yet he knew that this was the type of secret he absolutely couldn’t tell anybody.</p>
 <p>“Then let’s go take a look.” Clearly, it wasn’t Xie Xie’s first time here. He was at ease as he guided the other two into the exhibition hall.</p>
 <p>Their surroundings were filled with enormous glass display cases. Within them were countless things Tang Wulin had never even heard of before. The cheapest of the items would still cost at least a hundred thousand federal coins. These glass cases were all manufactured using a special transparent alloy and were definitely incomparable with normal glass.</p>
 <p>“This is the spirit fruit section. You go and take a look then.” After they entered an expansive rectangular room, Xie Xie stopped.</p>
 <p>The room was approximately three hundred square meters in area. It contained all sorts of spirit fruit and rare plants. Every single spirit fruit had a description attached to them.</p>
