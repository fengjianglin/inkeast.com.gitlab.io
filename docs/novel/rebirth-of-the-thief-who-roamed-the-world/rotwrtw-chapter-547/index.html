 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nirvana Flame, fight me!” Krow shouted as he activated Charge. Clad in his golden armour, he resembled a tank as he crushed everything in his path. His arrogance soared beyond the heavens. He had never put Nie Yan in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“War God’s Rage!” Smoke Stub’s muscles swelled with power as he rushed forward to intercept Krow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">War God’s Rage was a step above Barbarian Strength. After activating it, Smoke Stub’s veins swelled. He brimmed with a destructive power that couldn’t be contained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Punk! You think you can challenge Nirvana Flame? You’re not qualified! Get past me first!” Smoke Stub roared.「Klang!」As the two Warriors clashed, Krow was forced several steps back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Krow’s expression turned ugly. Smoke Stub’s overwhelming might left him with no choice but to pay attention. He didn’t dare to drop his guard in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the instant Krow took action, Raven and the others also stepped forward, each finding a respective opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Yao, Xie Yao, and the other Mages raised their staffs, firing a barrage of spells at Raven’s group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On top of this being a 12 versus seven, Asskickers United’s side also had the equipment advantage. Direwolf’s players didn’t stand the slightest chance. Their resistance was only delaying the inevitable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the most difficult battle Raven and the others had experienced since entering Conviction. As elites of Direwolf, each with their own pride, they had at least some confidence in victory. Thinking back to that now, they realized the absurdity of this conjecture. It was laughable!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nie Yan, King of the World, Painted Muslin, and the others remained off to the side without taking action, conveying that ganging up on the enemy would be beneath them. Smoke Stub, Tang Yao, and the others were enough to deal with these Direwolf players.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Yao raised his staff, firing spells out like a gatling gun. His attack speed was frightening, and the gap between spells was extremely short. Furthermore, his mana bar never seemed to fall. The Arcane Fairy constantly buffed him, so he was free to use high damage and high mana consumption spells without worry. His firepower was unmatched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Direwolf Warrior took the brunt of Tang Yao’s attack. As his health rapidly fell, he quickly drank a Health Potion. Behind him was also a Priest healing him non-stop. However, he still failed to hold out in the end and was sent flying. Tang Yao’s damage was too high. Even with the support of a healer it wasn’t enough!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a Warrior with 6,000 defense and 8,000 health! Even with the support of a healer, he still couldn’t endure. Tang Yao was too overpowered!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Raven’s expression distorted. Both he and Tang Yao were Arcane Mages. However, the difference between them was like heaven and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fact that Young Sparrow Hawk had stayed at the top of the level leaderboards all this time without ever once falling wasn’t without reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Raven’s opponent was Xie Yao. After being part of Direwolf for so long, this was the first time he had met his match. Furthermore, his opponent was a girl. This was something he had a hard time accepting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With this exchange, the difference between the two sides was clear as day. After encountering Asskickers United’s top elites, the insufferably haughty players of Direwolf became soft eggs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Smoke Stub, Tang Yao, and the others were completely dominating the Direwolf players. Even in a one versus one situation they weren’t a match. To top it off, Nie Yan hadn’t even taken action!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Raven was dejected. Perhaps Nie Yan felt it was beneath him to fight with them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Watching their videos, Raven and the others only had a rough idea of Asskickers United’s strength. Only after meeting them face to face did Raven and the others experience the heavy pressure which left them with no room for a comeback.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A single person, no matter how talented, would find it extremely difficult to reach the level of these players from Asskickers United, let alone create such a shocking lineup. Just how did Nie Yan accomplish this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nie Yan was different from others. He was a reincarnator. Before Bladelight and the others had revealed their talents to the world, he had already gathered them together, allowing these experts to learn from each other as well as imparting his 10 years of game experience to them. Their progress was definitely outside the perception of normal players.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Smoke Stub’s previous words weren’t spoken from arrogance, but rather from his absolute confidence in Asskickers United!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a thud, another Direwolf player collapsed to the ground. They couldn’t understand for the life of them how they were getting crushed so badly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Krow and Smoke Stub had exchanged several dozen blows by now. Both were powerful Warriors. Even though Krow was a famous talent, his skills were a notch below Smoke Stub’s. One could clearly see the difference. In terms of equipment, however, Krow was far inferior. Smoke Stub’s equipment was handpicked by Nie Yan, sporting a full set of twinked Level 100 gear. Krow’s equipment was roughly on par with Smoke Stub’s previous set. However, Smoke Stub’s old set had long since been gifted to Cold Peak Absolute Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Krow was getting thrashed left and right. He didn’t expect Smoke Stub to be so domineering, appearing far stronger than in the videos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During this one month’s time, Smoke Stub and the others had continuously improved their skills. Meanwhile, the legends of Krow, Raven, and the other Direwolf players were fading into history.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Krow’s face flushed with anger. Each of Smoke Stub’s blows seemed to carry the weight of Mt. Tai. He couldn’t even breathe under this pressure!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Krow felt unwilling. Was he really going to lose to Smoke Stub and the others like this? Were his past glory and achievements going to vanish like a puff of smoke, washed away in the river of time?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Krow roared out in anger. He leaped into the air, his greatsword igniting with raging flames as he slashed down at Smoke Stub.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Impudent!” Smoke Stub snorted. Blocking the Flame Slash, Smoke Stub went for an elbow strike. The thick elbow pad of his armour was ruthlessly planted into Krow’s stomach. Krow immediately curled up like a cooked shrimp as the sharp pain caused him to lose all control of his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">「Klang!」With a Seismic Slam, Krow was sent flying. Smoke Stub immediately rushed forward and dealt the finishing blow, draining Krow of his remaining health.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Raven looked back, he saw the corpses of Krow and his five other Direwolf companions lying on the ground. He was the only one left alive. He couldn’t help but despair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nie Yan gazed at Raven. “Pass this message onto your boss. Alliance of Mages is finished. Next up will be Divine Protectors. Tell him to quickly scram out of the Viridian Empire, or risk getting none of his investment back. Of course, if the Century Financial Group thinks they have all the money in the world to waste…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Nie Yan’s words, Raven didn’t have any opportunity to reply before Xie Yao’s spell sent him flying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Glancing at the corpses on the ground, Nie Yan faintly smiled. “Seems like we’ve cleared out the area here. Collect the equipment. We’re leaving.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before long, the results of the battle in the Realm of Death became known to the public. No videos of the battles were leaked out, with both Alliance of Mages and Asskickers United staying radio silent. However, the statistics of the battle were still announced. All 3,000 players on Alliance of Mages’ side had been wiped out while Asskickers United had only lost 392 players.</span></p>

However, when players saw these casualty numbers, they were absolutely dumbstruck. What was going on? How did Asskickers United only lose 392 people? This was unbelievable!</span></p>

Even if they lost in the end, how could they have lost so badly? Losing 3,000 players while not even being able to kill 400 from Asskickers United, this was too shocking!</span></p>

Eventually, some information leaked. With so many different organizations participating on the side of Alliance of Mages, it was only a matter of time. A video website paid big bucks to obtain footage of the battle. After watching the video, everyone finally understood what had happened.</span></p>

Some players were saying Nirvana Flame was despicable resorting to such dirty tricks. They said that even though Asskickers United defeated Alliance of Mages, the victory didn’t count. Others were on Asskickers United’s side. If winning like this wasn’t honorable, was needlessly sending your own people to their deaths honorable?</span></p>

Alliance of Mages had lost, losing so badly there was nothing left to say!</span></p>

Nie Yan’s benevolence was deeply engraved in their hearts. He would never send his players to their deaths needlessly. In this battle in the Realm of Death, even though he was the one to propose the challenge, he had done his best to prevent losses on their side. Having this kind of guild leader was definitely a blessing.</span></p>

Asskickers United’s troops had left Calore’s borders and were advancing towards Moonlight City. Was Asskickers United planning to lay siege to Moonlight City?</span></p>

These five strongholds formed an enclosure around Alliance of Mages’ main stronghold, the Edgarton Stronghold.</span></p>

War was unavoidable!</span></p>

Under these circumstances, could the Edgarton Stronghold hold out?</span></p>
