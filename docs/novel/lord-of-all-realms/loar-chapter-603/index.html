 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian moved deeper and deeper into the forest of sinister-looking trees and plants as he formed new Wood Thriving Formations to heal Li Langfeng.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Wood power was very rich in this forest, which was named Graydusk Forest. However, as Nie Tian moved from one place to another, the areas he covered rapidly became bereft of wood power, and the odd-looking trees and thorny plants rapidly withered and died.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the Wood Thriving Formation continued to channel rich wood power from its surroundings, Li Langfeng’s festering wounds, severed meridians, and damaged muscles were quickly healed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All the damage he had sustained by breaking through into the late Worldly realm was rapidly fixed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Time flew. Five days passed in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">During this time, Nie Tian didn’t summon the Bone Blood Demon and reignite its flame of life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That was because he hadn’t detected any mutant spirit beasts in his surroundings as he slowly moved deeper and deeper into Graydusk Forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Every time he formed the Wood Thriving Formation to heal Li Langfeng’s injuries, it would take him a large amount of time and effort.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Because of this, it took him five days to march only fifty kilometers into Graydusk Forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, he left a trail of dead trees and plants behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">On the sixth day.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After Nie Tian moved to a new location and established another Wood Thriving Formation, Li Langfeng took the initiative to say, “I’m good now. Given my current condition, I can take care of my injuries for the time being. I won’t sustain any more significant damage for a while, before I advance to the Profound realm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After Nie Tian’s unrelenting efforts, Li Langfeng’s face was no longer as pale as a piece of paper, and he no longer coughed up blood all the time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even his shriveled figure became somewhat muscular.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Looking at him now, Nie Tian could no longer see the gruesome, scrawny person who looked like a corpse that had crawled from hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Instead, he now looked somewhat gentle and graceful, like an experienced scholar who taught in a school.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Looking up at the Wood Thriving Formation that he had just established, Nie Tian nodded, smiling. “Alright, it’s your turn to help me now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With this spell formation, he planned to recover the power he had consumed to heal Li Langfeng and restore himself to his peak state so that he could make his breakthrough whenever an opportunity presented itself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“No problem!” Li Langfeng replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">On the seventh day, Nie Tian continued to form new Wood Thriving Formations as they moved deeper into the forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">By this time, he had already replenished the liquidized wood power in his vortex of wood power, and recovered all the power he had consumed recently.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He wondered if he was now able to start the next round of refinement of his fleshly body with Heavenly Wood Heal and the newly-established Wood Thriving Formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, before he could act on it, he finally detected the movements of mutant spirit beasts through one of his Heaven Eyes that he had scattered in the vicinity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This was the first time he had discovered spirit beasts over the seven days he had entered Graydusk Forest, and there were five of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the Wood Thriving Formation, Nie Tian’s eyes snapped open as he called out to Li Langfeng, who was standing on guard outside the spell formation, “There are mutant spirit beasts in the vicinity. There’re two fourth grade Golden Stone Rhinos, two fourth grade Blood Eye Crocodiles, and a fifth grade Strongwind Beast.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a pondering expression, Li Langfeng said, “If that’s it, you don’t need to summon your Bone Blood Demon. I can hunt them for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The strength of a fifth grade Strongwind Beast matched that of a Worldly realm human Qi warrior. Meanwhile, Li Langfeng was at the late Worldly realm, and he practiced special poisonous incantations, which made his actual battle prowess higher than most at the late Worldly realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Seeing the determination and confidence on his face, Nie Tian decided to grant him the opportunity, and thus said, “Okay, but be careful though. The mutant spirit beasts in the Realm of Split Void are no ordinary spirit beasts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Don’t worry,” Li Langfeng said, smiling. “I’ll be fine.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Alright,” Nie Tian said. “But also, try not to pollute their flesh and blood too much with your deadly toxins. I’ll have an important use for them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Li Langfeng went blank briefly before saying, “I’ll try my best.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Immediately afterwards, he dashed off in the direction Nie Tian pointed out for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian, however, sat unwavering in the Wood Thriving Formation. Through his Heaven Eyes, he kept a close watch on Li Langfeng and the mutant spirit beasts he was after.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As Li Langfeng had promised, he returned in fifteen minutes with the bodies of the five mutant spirit beasts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As he did, his whole body was still wreathed in an intense spiritual aura, which was filled with deadly toxins that could rot the flesh of any living being.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though the mutant spirit beasts in the Realm of Split Void were tougher than those in other realms of the Domain of the Falling Stars, and they had already developed a strong resistance to the various toxins in the tainted spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth, they had still fallen under Li Langfeng’s fatally poisonous attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meanwhile, Li Langfeng had heeded Nie Tian’s reminders, and only attacked their heads. As soon as they had fallen, he had rush over and cut their poisoned heads off.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had done that to stop the deadly toxins from flowing to other parts of the mutant spirit beasts’ bodies. That way Nie Tian would still be able to use the spirit beasts’ flesh and blood as he wished.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After placing the five headless bodies in front of Nie Tian, Li Langfeng said, “You were right. These mutant spirit beasts were hard to kill, especially that fifth grade Strongwind Beast. I could only attack their heads with my poisonous magics and cut their heads off afterwards.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian, who had already seen everything through his Heaven Eyes, nodded slightly as he deactivated the spell formation and let Li Langfeng in.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After Li Langfeng dragged the bodies of the mutant spirit beasts into the spell formation, Nie Tian placed his hands on two of the fourth grade mutant spirit beasts’ bodies and unleashed Life Drain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Like crimson snakes, wisps of blood-colored light flew out of his fingertips and infiltrated the corpses.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Li Langfeng’s eyes suddenly widened, shock filling his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Under his gaze, the two corpses rapidly shriveled and shrank like deflating balloons.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As they did, the originally pungent bloody smell on the corpses quickly became fainter and fainter.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">From that, Li Langfeng could tell that the dead mutant spirit beasts were quickly being drained of their profound and pure flesh power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Moments later, not a shred of flesh aura could be sensed on the two corpses anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, Nie Tian took a deep breath and applied the same method to two of the other dead mutant spirit beasts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Similarly, they also shriveled rapidly and looked like dried up meat that had been left in fierce sunlight for years.</span></p>
 <p><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“Here comes the last one!”</span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">&nbsp;Nie Tian’s eyes shone with the light of excitement as he placed both hands on the fifth grade Strongwind Beast. Even Li Langfeng, who was standing off to the side, looked somewhat afraid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Strongwind Beast, which was eight meters long, also rapidly shriveled as Nie Tian unleashed Life Drain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Moments later, it shrank to one third of its original size.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Li Langfeng was flabbergasted by the scene, feeling that he had discovered a prodigious secret of Nie Tian’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, he said nothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Shortly afterwards, Nie Tian pulled his hands back from the dried up corpse.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Without saying anything to Li Langfeng, he restarted the Wood Thriving Formation to channel wood power from the trees and plants in a ten kilometers radius.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At the same time, he closed his eyes to concentrate on himself.</span></p>
 <p><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“Such rich flesh power!”&nbsp;</span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">he marveled inwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The flesh power of mutant spirit beasts was richer than that of regular spirit beasts to begin with, not to mention that they were four fourth grade and one fifth grade mutant spirit beasts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The strength of a fifth grade mutant spirit beast wasn’t any weaker than that of a fifth grade outsider.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After channeling such copious flesh power into himself, Nie Tian felt as if a sea of flesh power was storming inside of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He sensed it with rapt attention, and discovered that the torrential flesh power first flowed into his bones, and then his internal organs, meridians, muscles, and eventually his blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Instead of rushing into cultivation, he took his time to observe the process. Suddenly, a realization came to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He realized that the refinement of his body would follow the sequence of the parts that his flesh power naturally flowed to.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Bones first, then internal organs, meridians, muscles, and finally blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That was when the five steps of refining his body with Heavenly Wood Heal suddenly appeared in his mind.&nbsp;</span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“Bone Crystallizing, Internal Organ Nourishing, Meridian Toughening, Muscle Tempering, and Blood Condensing!”</span></em></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It seemed that crystallizing his bones was only the first step. Bones were the foundation of people’s bodies. Meanwhile, since they were the most solid, they were the easiest to refine.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The following steps would be more and more difficult, and would each take more time to achieve.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After coming to such enlightenment, he started channeling the raging flesh power and rich wood power, and launched Heavenly Wood Heal without the slightest hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">One after another, streams of crimson flesh power and green wood power fused into rivers that rushed into his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Since the heart was the most important of his internal organs, it needed to be the first to be nourished and refined.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His heart suddenly started to race.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, the green aura was still lying completely still at the bottom of his heart, like a snake during hibernation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Every time his heart pounded, he felt as if he were being stabbed with a thousand needles.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He could see with great clarity that as the essences of flesh and wood poured madly into his heart, every fiber of his heart was being rapidly severed and reattached.</span></p>
