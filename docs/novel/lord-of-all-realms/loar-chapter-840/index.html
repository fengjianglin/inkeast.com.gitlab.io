 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Right before the Earth Spirit Sect disciples were about to reach Nie Tian’s location on their air-transportation spiritual tool, fear appeared in their eyes as they exclaimed, “I’m afraid that puppet won’t be easy to deal with, future sectmaster!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Bone Blood Demon was standing on guard by Nie Tian right outside the Wood Thriving Formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Like a god of bones, the enormous Bone Blood Demon looked very awe-inspiring.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In fact, its formidable might was the main reason why Yin Yanan and Mu Biqiong had dared to leave Nie Tian alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Both of them had witnessed the Bone Blood Demon’s terrifying battle prowess, and assumed that Fata, the Floragrim, wouldn’t dare to make a move against Nie Tian as long as it was there to protect him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“It’s only a puppet,” Qiu Ji said, his face ice-cold and filling with killing intent. “There’s nothing to fear. My gravity-altering incantation will greatly limit the mobility of something that large. The larger things are, the more they’ll be affected by my strengthened gravitational field. Once I cast my spell, that puppet won’t even be able to move about, much less pose a threat to us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, Qiu Ji and the other Earth Spirit Sect disciples flew to Nie Tian’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qiu Ji assumed that since Nie Tian, Mu Biqiong, and Yin Yanan were on the same team, the girls must attach great importance to Nie Tian’s safety. By killing him, he would get back at the girls.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Those two bitches dared to set themselves against me and the Earth Spirit Sect! No matter who they are, they must suffer!” With these words, Qiu Ji took out that earthy-yellow rock and altered the gravitational field around him with the earth power it contained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The gravity in the area where Nie Tian was instantly skyrocketed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Feeling the strengthened gravity, a shred of anger flashed across the Bone Blood Demon’s dark-green eyes as it stood unwavering by the Wood Thriving Formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Its mobility was indeed limited by the sudden change in gravity as it swung its huge arms to swat at the incoming air-transportation spiritual tools.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">One air-transportation spiritual tool after another flew through the space under its slowed arms and arrived directly above the Wood Thriving Formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Chai Fengwu from the Martial Spirit Sect saw what was happening, and thus couldn’t help but shout, “Big brother!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Chai Longge hesitated for a few seconds before finally making up his mind and yelling, “Help Nie Tian fight those people from the Earth Spirit Sect!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The brother-sister pair then sprang to their feet and flew towards Qiu Ji, leaving their Fortune Wells behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Since Chai Longge had intentionally yelled at the top of his lungs, Mu Biqiong and Yin Yanan, who were in distant locations, also noticed what was happening at Nie Tian’s location.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The two of them fixated their furious gazes on Qiu Ji simultaneously.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Also at this moment, other cultivators and outsiders sniffed opportunities, and quietly gathered to Yin Yanan’s and Mu Biqiong’s locations.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They either practiced wood power or frost power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Obviously, they intended to occupy Yin Yanan and Mu Biqiong’s Fortune Wells as soon as they left. They would channel frost power and wood power from them as fast as they could, and use them to improve their battle prowess.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The girls saw right through their plans, and thus grew hesitant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At that very moment, the Floragrim who referred to himself as Fata flung his arm towards the Earth Spirit Sect disciples with a disgusted look on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the next moment, an emerald bamboo stalk grew out of his palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The bamboo had many joints, all of which were translucent and sparkling, as if they contained a shockingly large amount of wood power essence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the bamboo swept across in the air, dazzling green light split heaven and earth like a sword of light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">FZZZ!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The green light slashed through one of the Earth Spirit Sect’s air-transportation spiritual tools, and it split in half like a piece of paper.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This strike was every bit as mighty as the ones Mu Biqiong had launched with that black root growing out of her palm, if not mightier.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Splitting along with that air-transportation spiritual tool were two screaming Earth Spirit Sect disciples. Their blood spilled in all directions before their mangled bodies fell into the bubbling dark gray marshland, where they vanished in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“You!” Qiu Ji shouted furiously, glaring at Fata. “We only came for that man! In fact, we were going to give his Fortune Well to you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Completely ignoring him, Fata continued to swing the green bamboo stalk that had grown out of his palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Its dazzling green light seemed to carry some all-conquering divine power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Two more Earth Spirit Sect air-transportation spiritual tools shattered to pieces, as if they were made of paper. All of the Earth Spirit Sect disciples on them died miserable deaths.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I made myself perfectly clear that I’m here to observe and learn from those tree patterns, not for that Fortune Well,” Fata said in fluent human language. “You thought I was trying to trick people or something?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That was in fact exactly what Qiu Ji had assumed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had thought Fata would form an alliance with them and help them kill Nie Tian in order to take those tree branches and that Fortune Well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had never thought that as an outsider, Fata would help Nie Tian fight them instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Chai Longge and Chai Fengwu, who were just about to go help Nie Tian defend against the Earth Spirit Sect disciples regardless of Qiu Ji’s status as the future sectmaster of the Earth Spirit Sect, suddenly went blank.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Flabbergasted, they looked at Fata from afar.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The same went for Yin Yanan and Mu Biqiong, who were also going to come to Nie Tian’s aid, as if none of them had expected that Fata would actually carry out his promise and drive away those who came at Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Get out of here now so I can resume my cultivation.” With an aloof face, Fata continued to sweep the translucent and sparkling bamboo that had grown out of his palm across the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As dazzling green light filled this part of the sky, one Earth Spirit Sect air-transportation spiritual tool after another was split in two, along with the Earth Spirit Sect disciples on them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In less than a minute, there wasn’t a single Earth Spirit Sect disciple left besides Qiu Ji.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even Yin Yanan and Mu Biqiong were deeply shaken by the terrifying battle prowess Fata was displaying.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Only at this moment did they realize that this strange Floragrim was actually just as powerful as Pergson, the Bonebrute, and Froste, the Phantasm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Fata must enjoy a lofty status among his race as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That was when Mu Biqiong suddenly realized that Fata had never been afraid of her or Yin Yanan. All of their intimidation had been pointless.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Given Fata’s battle prowess, even with the help of that black demonic flower’s root, she wouldn’t necessarily be able to defeat him in battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Furthermore, Yin Yanan’s Frost Blood Python hadn’t unleashed any power back then, so Fata must not have known how powerful Yin Yanan really was.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Such a weird guy.” Mu Biqiong muttered in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As surprised and confused as she and Yin Yanan were to see Fata carry out his word and display such battle prowess, they finally put their hearts at ease.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After sweeping their gazes over the people around them, they went back to channeling frost power and wood power into themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">SHEW!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qiu Ji from the Earth Spirit Sect fled on an air-transportation spiritual tool at a speed that was even faster than when he had come.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, he no longer dared to lurk at the perimeter. Instead, he gave up the opportunity to seek fortune from the Fortune Wells, but soon disappeared into the distance like a streak of light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He was truly scared this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After the miserable deaths of all of his companions, he wouldn’t possibly be able to defeat Fata alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Besides, if he were still here when Nie Tian awoke, and Yin Yanan and Mu Biqiong finished gathering power, wouldn’t he be seeking his own death?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After Qiu Ji left, peace and quiet were restored to Nie Tian’s area.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Fata, the Floragrim, withdrew that translucent and sparkling bamboo stalk, and went back to sitting in the lotus position in midair.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His eyes were still fixed on the patterns from the tree of life in the green power ward, as if he was trying to learn their secrets and brand each and every one of them into his memory.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Fata’s formidable strength had made many in his surroundings tremble with fear, completely dropping the idea of taking the opportunity to attack Nie Tian while he was busy with his breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Gradually, more Fortune Wells worked their wonders.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Fortune Well Yin Yanan had left earlier started to spew golden light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Chai Longge’s expression flickered. Ecstasy filled his eyes as he looked at that Fortune Well from afar. He wanted to take it very much, but at the same time, he was worried that Yin Yanan wouldn’t be happy about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">While he was hesitating, Nie Tian awoke from his cultivation. He opened his eyes and nodded at him. “Go ahead and use it. I’ll talk to her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Chai Longge’s eyes lit up as he clasped his hands to express his gratitude. Immediately afterwards, he flashed to that Fortune Well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a faint smile, Nie Tian looked at his Fortune Well, which had stopped giving wood power essence. Then, after putting the seventy-two tree branches away, he said to Fata, “Thank you for guarding me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“There’s no need to thank me,” Fata said, not taking the credit. “You would have been just as safe without me. There’s no way those people could have broken that spell formation of yours. Others may not know, but I know perfectly well how powerful that spell formation was.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian nodded and said with a confident tone, “I guess you’re right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I’d like to have a private talk with you after we’re finished with the Fortune Wells here,” Fata said sincerely.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Sure.” Nie Tian agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Without saying another word, Fata turned around and flew off to a Fortune Well guarded by a human cultivator, which was now spewing rich wood power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as the green bamboo shot out of his palm again, the human cultivator’s protective ward shattered, along with the cultivator himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, Fata sat down as if nothing had happened. Like a whale swallowing seawater, he started channeling wood power from the well at an alarming speed.</span></p>
