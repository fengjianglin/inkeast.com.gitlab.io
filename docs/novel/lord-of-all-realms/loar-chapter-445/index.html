 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Deep in the night.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Atop a barren mountain peak that didn’t grow a blade of grass, Nie Tian and Dong Li stuck out their heads from behind a huge rock and gazed off into the distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">There were a few caves halfway up this mountain peak, which they had already examined on their way up to the mountaintop.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Some of the caves stretched deep into the belly of the mountain. Apparently, powerful equipment forgers had once used them to forge spiritual tools.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This was an extinct volcano that had long since been drained of flame power and earthflame essence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Bathed in chilly moonlight, Nie Tian scanned the vicinity with the help of his nine Heaven Eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He spread them as far as he could in every direction. Floating high in the sky, the Heaven Eyes covered an extremely large area around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Through them, he noticed that people seemed to be moving about on a remote volcano, which had smoke and blazing flames rising from it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Under the night sky, streams of lava poured down the volcano with twists and turns, making them look like dragons of flame twisting their gigantic bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li was also glancing around, though she was limited by her cultivation base, and couldn’t see very far.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian pointed off into the distance and explained to her in a low voice, “There’s nothing but a cluster of volcanoes over in that direction. No normal people would linger in such a place. &nbsp;However, many powerful Qi warriors are now bustling in that area. Since it’s very far away, I can see their shapes, but not their faces. So I don’t know who they are or where they are from.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“However, a few Profound realm experts and Rainbow Lightnings from the Tool Sect are heading over there.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“According to Huang Yuan, people are gathering earthflame essence in the Realm of Unbounded Desolation. Those powerful experts from the Tool Sect must have been sent there to learn what the situation is.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“If my speculations are correct, those bustling Qi warriors in that remote area are gathering earthflame essence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After gazing a while into the direction pointed out by Nie Tian, and failing to see anything, Dong Li gave up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She withdrew her gaze and turned around to sit behind a huge rock, with her back against it. With a bitter smile, she said, “Nie Tian, you’re such a star of calamity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“What do you mean?!” Nie Tian seemed disgruntled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li’s bright eyes glittered with a strange light. “Have you noticed that, wherever you go, calamities follow? Back when you were still in the Realm of Flame Heaven, Heaven Gates appeared out of nowhere, through which Demon outsiders returned. Later, when you went to the Realm of Split Void, Phantasms descended from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Afterwards, when we went to the Realm of Dark Underworld, the ‘Phantasm relic’ turned out to be one of the Phantasms’ ancient starships.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Now that you’ve come to the Realm of Unbounded Desolation, not only has Zhao Shanling returned with his Death Reign, but foreign Qi warriors are also gathering earthflame essence during the Tool Sect’s assessment assembly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Wherever you go, upheavals occur, and people are plunged into misery and suffering. You tell me if you’re a star of calamity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian mulled over her words, and discovered that she actually wasn’t wrong, and that he couldn’t refute her statement.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Snorting out a laugh, Dong Li said, “You were right earlier. If we don’t return to Desolate City, at least we can avoid the Death Reign and stay out of Zhao Shanling’s grudge against the Tool Sect. At this moment, we’re in the middle between the Tool Sect and the foreign Qi warriors who are gathering earthflame essence. We can’t go further, since if we do, we may run into those who are gathering earthflame essence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Considering that they dare to break the rule established by the Tool Sect and gather earthflame essence in the Realm of Unbounded Desolation, and that the Tool Sect have sent out Profound realm experts to deal with them, they’re not the kind of people we can mess with.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“We can’t go back, since if we do, we may come across the Death Reign.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“It’s such a sad situation we’re in. Neither going forward nor back is an option. I really don’t know what we should do now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing her words, Nie Tian smiled bitterly and inwardly sighed over his bad luck.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a moment of awkward silence he said, “Well, I’m hungry. Let’s eat something first.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, he took out some of the spirit beast meat he had purchased in the Dong Clan, cooked it with fire-attributed spiritual materials, and shared it with Dong Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After consuming a significant amount of spirit beast meat, he sat silently and started practicing cultivation with Star Stones.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It wasn’t long before wisps of rich flesh power rose from his stomach.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Some of them were secretly absorbed by the Flame Dragon Armor in his bracelet of holding, though the majority of them were attracted and devoured by the green aura coiled up in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Moments later, all of the newly-generated flesh power was gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That was when Nie Tian noticed the anomaly with the green aura again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The green spots in some of the crystal-like chains within the green aura once again started to flicker, looking quite active.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The same thing had happened a few times recently, and finally caught Nie Tian’s attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He formed a strand of awareness and soul power and sent it into his heart, where it observed in silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had a feeling that the green spots in those crystal-like chains must have sensed something or been set off by something. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have behaved so strangely.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“This is odd...” He thought to himself as he attempted to let that strand of thought approach the flickering spots in those crystal-like chains.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BANG!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The moment his thought made contact with the bright spots in those crystal-like chains, a mysterious feeling struck him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He felt as if something somewhere was attracting that green aura, which contained the profound truths of life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Immediately afterwards, with bated breath and rapt attention, he formed more strands of thought and soul power, with which he repeatedly touched the flickering spots within the few crystal-like chains.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As he did, the originally vague feeling gradually grew clear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All of a sudden, his eyes snapped open.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The direction he was looking was neither towards Desolate City nor towards the cluster of active volcanoes where the foreign Qi warriors were.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Rather, he was looking to his left, at a cluster of extinct volcanoes that were just like the one he was sitting on.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He withdrew his thought and pondered with a frown,&nbsp;</span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“What can it be that’s causing my bloodline to grow restless?”&nbsp;</span></em></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“The Realm of Unbounded Desolation is such a miraculous place,” Dong Li muttered. “On the one hand, Zhao Shanling forged the Death Reign in this realm, which can wither all lives and reduce living beings to dried corpses. On the other hand, people say there’s a magical place in this realm where wood power is as thick as water, and can even produce Fruits of Life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“The Death Reign and that magical place are none other than two extremes, yet they both seem to exist in the Realm of Unbounded Desolation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian listened to Dong Li’s muttering as he wracked his mind for an answer. Suddenly, his eyes suddenly lit up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A shudder ran through him as he thought to himself, “A magical place where wood power is as thick as water, and can even produce the Fruits of Life! My bloodline is called ‘Life Bloodline’. Those fruits are called Fruits of Life. Can it be that they’re somehow related? If the rumor is real and that place does exist, can the Fruits of Life be what have been stirring my bloodline?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Another shudder ran through him as soon as he came to that realization, believing that was most likely the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a deep breath, he once again gazed off in the direction from which his bloodline had received a mysterious stir, and discovered that there was nothing but extinct volcanoes in that direction. Not a single person could be seen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Both the experts from the Tool Sect and the foreign earthflame essence gatherers were very unlikely to go to that area.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If it weren’t for the abnormal changes that had repeatedly occurred to his bloodline, he would never have considered probing into that area either.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these thoughts in mind, he finally knew where to go. Pointing in that direction, he said determinedly, “Let’s go there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li followed his hand and looked in the direction he was pointing out. After a brief glance, she nodded with a smile, saying, “That’s a wise choice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“It is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“The area you’re pointing at used to be where the Bonebrutes’ headquarters was. All of the volcanoes in that area have remained silent for thousands of years.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Furthermore, as the Bonebrute’s former headquarters, that area has long since been searched by countless Qi warriors from everywhere in the Domain of the Falling Stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“All of the secrets buried there have been unearthed. Anything that seemed related to the Bonebrutes, no matter how remotely, has been dug out and taken away for research.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“No one has discovered anything noteworthy in that area in centuries.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“That’s why almost no one ever goes there to try their luck.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Plus, since there are nothing but extinct volcanoes in that area, those foreign Qi warriors who are here to gather earthflame essence won’t go there. It’s also far from the Tool Sect, so Zhao Shanling’s Death Reign won’t float there either.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Considering everything that’s going on, that’s probably the safest place in the Realm of Unbounded Desolation now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li assumed Nie Tian had only chosen to go to that area to avoid trouble and stay safe.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Instead of explaining, Nie Tian grinned and said, “That’s exactly what I thought.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“...Alright, let’s go. I hope the turbulent situation in the Realm of Unbounded Desolation will end soon. It’s probably the safest choice to stay there before it does.” Dong Li supported his decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Therefore, the two of them moved out according to Nie Tian’s directions, hiding their tracks as they did.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Several days later, Dong Li and Nie Tian arrived at the area that used to be the Bonebrutes’ headquarters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian scanned the vicinity with his Heaven Eyes. All he could see was desolation and silence, and not the slightest sign of life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, since the moment he had arrived, his bloodline had grown more and more restless.</span></p>
