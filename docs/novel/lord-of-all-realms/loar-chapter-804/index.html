 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Numerous stone pavilions stood towering in the Divine Seal Sect’s trading area in the Realm of Maelstrom, where the middle Void domain Meng Li oversaw matters year-round.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Since Nie Tian had decided to stay in the Realm of Maelstrom for the time being, Duan Shihu and Jing Rou stayed as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, the two of them didn’t just sit around and wait. Instead, they either dug into the art of seal wielding, or investigated Xing Bo’s collusion with the Bonebrutes through various resources.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As Nie Tian expressed his intention to build a teleportation portal in the Divine Seal Sect’s stronghold in the Realm of Maelstrom that led to the Domain of the Falling Stars, Jing Rou agreed without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She did it because Nie Tian was not only Duan Shihu’s junior martial brother, but also a Son of the Stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She even assigned a five-story stone pavilion to Nie Tian, where Zhao Shanling would be able to build the teleportation portal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the most special trading center throughout the entire Domain of Heaven Python, the Realm of Maelstrom held all sorts of spiritual materials. It would be easy to gathered all the necessary materials here.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meanwhile, Zhao Shanling already had numerous materials of this kind in stock. He would only need to get ahold of some subsidiary materials with the Divine Seal Sect’s help, and he would be good to go.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The establishment of a teleportation portal that connected the Realm of Split Void and the Realm of Maelstrom wasn’t important at all to the Divine Seal Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the eyes of Meng Li and others, the Domain of the Falling Stars was only a remote, weak domain, where even entering the Void domain was extremely difficult.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It was only natural that they didn’t attach importance to such a domain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, for all of the sects in the Domain of the Falling Stars, it was of great importance that they had a teleportation portal through which they could visit the Domain of Heaven Python.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The establishment of such a teleportation portal would mean that Qi warriors from the Domain of the Falling Stars would be able to travel to and from a domain that was much more advanced than theirs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Furthermore, since the other side of the teleportation portal was in the Realm of Maelstrom, Qi warriors from the Domain of the Falling Stars would be able to directly communicate and trade treasures with outsiders and Ancientbeasts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They would probably be able to find all of the rare treasures they needed to enter the Void domain in the Realm of Maelstrom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Since the teleportation portal Zhao Shanling was building would allow people to travel across the boundless starry river, it would take a long time to build.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">During this time, Nie Tian didn’t pay attention to any of the transactions that happened all the time in the Realm of Maelstrom, but instead focused on practicing cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the cultivation room in the stone pavilion the Divine Seal Sect had assigned for him, he refined his spiritual core and three vortexes of different powers with spiritual materials of different attributes, and made significant progress.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The sky in the Realm of Maelstrom was like the mouth of a well, through which people could see no suns or moons, but only dotted stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As he practiced cultivation in this place, the Nine Stars Flower that was rooted in his vortex of star power channeled star power from the heavens unceasingly, and grew slowly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had long since recovered his ten drops of Blood Essence, and his bloodline aura had fallen dormant again, waiting for the awakening of his next bloodline talent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Soon, three months passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian was so indulged in cultivation that he didn’t notice it at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">On this day...</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A loud clamor suddenly woke him from his cultivation. Then, he walked out of his cultivation room.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He left the building and followed the clamor to a square that was paved with cyan stones and surrounded by stone pavilions. In the square stood many people, including Meng Li from the Divine Seal Sect and Du Zheng From the Thousandsword Mountain Sect, as well as Zhong Shishu and the old woman named Wu Yun from the Golden Vast Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the representatives of the Divine Seal Sect, the Thousandsword Mountain Sect, and the Golden Vast Sect in the Realm of Maelstrom, Meng Li, Du Zheng, and Wu Yun were all at the middle Void domain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Every one of them had a grim expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon seeing Nie Tian, Duan Shihu beckoned for him to come to him. “Over here, junior martial brother.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, he introduced him to everyone. “This is Nie Tian, my junior martial brother from the Domain of the Falling Stars.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Du Zheng and Wu Yun nodded slightly, not attaching much importance to Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They didn’t know Nie Tian’s status as a Son of the Stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a moment of silence, Jing Rou said, “Xing Bo’s connection to the Bonebrutes has been proved. We caught him and a few members of his clan red-handed while they were meeting up with Bonebrutes on a dead star. However, Xing Bo and Xing Lifeng escaped our blockade with the Bonebrutes’ help.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Xing Lifeng is a middle Void domain expert from the Xing Clan, which is one of the Thousandsword Mountain Sect’s subordinate clans.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“The two of them seem to have fled to a Bonebrute realm, from where they’ll eventually go to the Shatter Battlefield.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a cold face, Du Zheng from the Thousandsword Mountain Sect said, “If Xing Beichen hadn’t summoned Ke Jinpeng and four others to a remote region in the starry river and disappeared since, Xing Bo and Xing Beichen wouldn’t have been able to escape from us.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Our sect wasn’t aware of the Xing Clan’s secret actions. Now that we’ve learned that they actually colluded with the Bonebrutes and provided them with a large number of human corpses for them to build burial grounds, it’s our duty to root them out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“But it’s a pity that we let two of them get away, which may cause us trouble in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Xing Bo and Xing Beichen were both chosen ones of the Thousandsword Mountain Sect, and the two of them had ranked rather high among all of the Thousandsword Mountain Sect’s chosen ones.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After losing Ke Jinpeng and four other Void domain experts, the Thousandsword Mountain Sect’s overall strength had suffered greatly. Now, Xing Bo, their most valued chosen one, had gotten into a scandal. All of this made Du Zheng very angry and edgy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Thousandsword Mountain Sect’s strength would shrink further, and the Xing Clan would die out. At the same time, Xing Bo’s collusion with the Bonebrutes also made the Golden Vast Sect, which had away sided with the Thousandsword Mountain Sect, very unhappy. It was only right that the Thousandsword Mountain Sect atone for what had been done.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Du Zheng made it perfectly clear that their sect had nothing to do with this incident, and showed their determination to root out the Xing Clan, yet he was rather ambiguous about hunting down Xing Bo and Xing Lifeng.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a frustrated tone, Du Zheng said, “Those two traitors will go to the Shatter Battlefield. We all know how dangerous and complicated that place is. Since too many messy matters have happened in our sect recently, we don’t really have the energy or the ability to march disciples into the Shatter Battlefield to kill those two.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“But to atone for what has been done, we’ll stay out of whatever plan you have with the Domain of the Falling Stars.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, Du Zheng turned around and left without sparing Nie Tian a glance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had learned that the Domain of the Falling Stars was a domain with only nine realms.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Besides, it wasn’t rich in cultivation resources, and had produced only one Void domain expert so far.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In Du Zheng’s eyes, the value of the Domain of the Falling Stars was very limited. He didn’t think that seizing a few realms of it would give a noticeable boost to their sect’s withered strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After Du Zheng left, Wu Yun, the old woman from the Golden Vast Sect, took her time to say, “About that Domain of the Falling Stars...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, Meng Li leaned over and whispered into her ear, “The Domain of the Falling Stars might have something to do with the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace. I’ve received solid proof of Heaven Gates opening there repeatedly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Wu Yun gasped with astonishment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a moment of hesitation, she said with determined tone, “We won’t have anything to do with the Domain of the Falling Stars either! Disciples of the Golden Vast Sect will not go there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Before Zhong Shishu could say anything, she gave him a hard look, then took him and left in a hurried manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Surprised, Nie Tian asked, “What did you say to her, Senior Meng?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a soft chuckle, Meng Li said, “I just told her that Heaven Gates opened in the Domain of the Falling Stars a few times, and she was so scared that she voluntarily gave up on the idea of splitting it. From the look of it, the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace’s name is indeed awe-inspiring.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">SHEW!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhao Shanling suddenly flew over from behind a stone pavilion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After assuming a foothold beside Meng Li, he said with his eyes filled with arrogance, “I’ve fulfilled the mission. The teleportation portal I built successfully teleported me to the Realm of Split Void and back.” Even facing a middle Void domain expert, who enjoyed a lofty position in the Divine Seal Sect, he didn’t seem servile in the slightest. “I also destroyed the spatial rift in the Realm of Split Void that lead to that burial ground of the Bonebrutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“From now on, no Bonebrutes or Qi warriors from the Domain of Heaven Python will be able to travel to or from the Domain of the Falling Stars through the spatial rift in that burial ground anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Those who want to visit the Domain of the Falling Stars will have to go through the teleportation portal I set up with the help of my spatial tool.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had destroyed the spatial rift that connected the Void Illusion Mountain Range and that burial ground of the Bonebrutes without notifying the Divine Seal Sect first.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had done it to eliminate the possibility of Thousandsword Mountain Sect and Golden Vast Sect disciples entering the Domain of the Falling Stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He hadn’t learned about Golden Vast Sect and Thousandsword Mountain Sect’s decision to keep their hands off the Domain of the Falling Stars until his return.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This proved that this person actually cared a great deal about the Domain of the Falling Stars. He didn’t care about the attitude of the Golden Vast Sect, the Thousandsword Mountain Sect, or even the Divine Seal Sect when it came to the safety of the Domain of the Falling Stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Among the experts who had come on this trip with Nie Tian, Qi Bailu was the mild one, Hua Mu was the experienced and far-seeing one, and Zhao Shanling was the arrogant and unruly one.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had been a pain in the neck for all of the major sects when he had been in the Domain of the Falling Stars. He had acted without any scruples. Everything he had done had been in his interest, and he had rarely taken others’ feelings into consideration.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Who would have thought he still adopted the same style now that he was in the Domain of Heaven Python?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meng Li from the Divine Seal Sect was inwardly displeased after hearing that he had destroyed the spatial rift that led to the Domain of the Falling Stars without consulting the Divine Seal Sect first.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though they had promised to take no land from it after learning about Nie Tian’s identity as a Son of the Stars, they had announced that they would go explore it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, Zhao Shanling’s actions had placed them in an awkward position.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“When the Shatter Battlefield opens again, I’ll go there and kill those traitors from the Xing Clan and try my best to bring Pei Qiqi back alive,” Zhao Shanling continued. “But before that, I’ll leave my spatial tool in the teleportation portal as the eye of its spell formation, while I advance to the Void domain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, he flew skywards and disappeared into one of the numerous unknown spatial rifts in the water curtain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“This person acted just as unruly in the Domain of the Falling Stars, didn’t he?” Jing Rou asked softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian nodded and smiled bitterly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Eye narrowed, Meng Li said with a meaningful expression, “He actually has the confidence to enter the Void domain within such a short period of time? Also, he’ll go to the Shatter Battlefield and kill Xing Lifeng once he enters the Void domain? What gave him such confidence? The materials required for cultivators who practice spatial power to build inner domains are very rare. Has he gathered all of them already?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“It appears so,” Nie Tian said.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He knew that Zhao Shanling had gained Master Voidspirit’s legacies from that space disruption zone. Thanks to that, he might have already gathered all of the materials he needed to break through into the Void domain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">RING! RING!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, sharp sounds came from a green jade bracelet on Jing Rou’s milky white wrist.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She held it to her ear and listened. After a few seconds, her expression grew strange as she said, “Nie Tian, that couple who stayed in the Realm of Withering Flame to practice cultivation have both entered the late Soul realm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A shudder ran through Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meng Li went blank for a moment before sighing. “So it seems that the Domain of the Falling Stars is actually a blessed land that produces cultivators with extraordinary talent.”</span></p>

 <p><strong>Door Gods</strong></p>
 <p>Li Shimin was one of the greatest emperors in Chinese history. However, when he was young, he killed countless enemies in battle. He also killed two of his brothers during the Incident of Xuanwu Gate. He often had nightmares, in which the ghosts of those who had died because of him would drag him down into the hell. He told this to Qin Shubao and Yuchi Jingde, two brave generals who had served him for a long time. Therefore, Qin and Yuchi decided to guard Li Shimin's bedroom at night, so that no one could ever hurt the emperor in his sleeps. After that, Li Shimin never had nightmares any more. Since then, Qin Shubao and Yuchi Jingde became Door Gods in Chinese folk culture.</p>
