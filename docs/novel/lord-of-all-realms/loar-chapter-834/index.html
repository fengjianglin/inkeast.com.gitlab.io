 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Luo Hui suddenly came to a stop on his golden spider.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His gaze swept back and forth between Nie Tian and the girls, a hesitant look appearing in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian grinned at him, but didn’t say a word.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Mu Biqiong had killed Fang Yingying at the Silver Beetle nests, terrifying all of the Heavenly Witchcraft Sect disciples that had been gathered there.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Luo Hui had ordered everyone to leave the Silicon Silver behind and evacuate, which had allowed them to escape Fang Yingying’s fate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, however, there wasn’t a single Heavenly Witchcraft Sect disciple beside him, and from the look of it, he had just gone through a fierce battle, and barely survived.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Fine cuts could be seen on his golden spider’s legs, as if it had suffered serious injuries as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">There were also noticeable bloodstains on Luo Hui’s garments.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Chai Longge noticed the anomaly, and thus asked in a low voice, “Do you know him? That guy’s one of the Heavenly Witchcraft Sect’s chosen ones. He’s not someone you want to cross.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“We’ve met before,” Nie Tian said with a plain tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Chai Longge frowned. “You, you didn’t provoke him, did you? The Heavenly Witchcraft Sect is a powerful sect, and that guy’s mount, that golden spider, is a famous spirit vermin of the Heavenly Witchcraft Sect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian smiled. “Provoke him? Sort of.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing these words, both Chai Longge and Chai Fengwu grew worried.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, to their surprise, after a moment of hesitation, Luo Hui steered clear of Nie Tian and the girls’ location, circling to a distant Fortune Well, where he sat down in silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He didn’t say a single word the entire time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“He seems to have sustained injuries,” Yin Yanan said, somewhat surprised. “That golden spider of his is indeed beyond ordinary. And his sect sent quite a large number of people here. I wonder who killed all of the others and made him look so bedraggled.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After watching Luo Hui leave without saying a word, Chai Fengwu from the Martial Spirit Sect asked with a confused expression, “Why does he seem to be afraid of you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Chai Longge noticed the anomaly too.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even he didn’t have confidence that he would be able to defeat Luo Hui and his golden spider in battle, and thus was rather apprehensive about him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, there seemed to be some history between Luo Hui and Nie Tian and the girls, which actually made him walk away voluntarily. Clearly, he wanted to avoid conflicts with the three of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a moment of pondering, Chai Longge said inwardly,&nbsp;</span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“Can it be because Luo Hui has sustained serious injuries?”</span></em></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">From the beginning, he had considered Nie Tian and the girls as ordinary Qi warriors who weren’t special at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“That guy has sustained injuries,” Nie Tian said casually. “It’s only natural that he wants to avoid getting into new trouble.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Chai Fengwu nodded and said sincerely, “You’d better not provoke him as long as he doesn’t make a move against you. That golden spider of his is among the top five most powerful spirit vermin in the Heavenly Witchcraft Sect. That spirit vermin alone can handle a Soul realm Qi warrior. So you’d better be very careful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian smiled and thanked her for her warning.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Soon, more cultivators, outsiders, and Ancientbeasts arrived in droves.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Almost all of the forty-nine Fortune Wells were claimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Humans took up a large part of those who had come to claim the Fortune Wells, then it was the outsiders, including Demons, Phantasms, and Fiends. The Ancientbeasts had the smallest numbers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Surprisingly, no conflicts broke out after their arrival.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Perhaps that was because there were still vacant Fortune Wells.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The newcomers seemed to be familiar with the Fortune Wells’ special features, and knew that the size of the wells didn’t really matter.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">By the time the wells worked wonders, the larger wells wouldn’t necessarily spew the kinds of energies they would need.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They could only wait and see.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian had practiced cultivation wholeheartedly during this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had a feeling that he could break through into the middle Worldly realm at any moment now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">On this day, as his soul awareness roamed inside the second fragmentary star mark and learned everything about Starchain, the ancient magical symbols that recorded Starchain gradually faded away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The first fragmentary star mark had recorded three secret magics: Starstrike, Starshift, and Starfall.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The second fragmentary star mark carried the profound knowledge of Starchain and star souls.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, as the ancient magical symbols that recorded Starchain vanished, new magical symbols gradually revealed themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The new magical symbols seemed to record another secret magic from the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace, yet they were currently scattered in a disorderly fashion. Nie Tian would have to analyze and realign them first.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He thus summoned his soul power to analyze the disorderly magical symbols. However, his soul power ran low at an alarming rate as he realigned them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, a large number of outsiders, Ancientbeasts, and human Qi warriors were gathered by the Fortune Wells.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If he wanted to recover his soul power, he only had one thing he could turn to: soul crystals.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, since soul crystals were extremely rare and valuable, all living beings yearned for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If he took his soul crystals out and started recovering soul power with them, he was afraid that that would bring out the greedy nature in the outsiders, Ancientbeasts, and his own kind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After pondering the matter for some time, Nie Tian eventually stopped working on the second fragmentary star mark.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Instead, he used his star souls to channel faint soul power from the stars that filled the entire sky, slowly recovering his soul power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">During this process, the Flame Dragon Armor sent him a message. “Master, I’ve finished processing your Blood Essence. I feel like I’ve been reborn.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian was thrilled to hear this wonderful news.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Battles could break out over the Fortune Wells at any moment. It might happen after the Fortune Wells worked their wonders, or even before that, when all of the Fortune Wells had been claimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Mo Qinglei from the Heavenly Thunder Sect and a few others looked rather powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As confident as Nie Tian had always been, he didn’t think he would be able to defend his Fortune Well against them without external help.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Flame Dragon Armor’s message made him realize that he would be able to use this suit of armor to boost his battle prowess again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This was great news, especially since he had lost his Flame Star, and had very few spiritual tools left that he could use in battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, through a soul communication with the Flame Dragon Armor, he learned that after the ten drops of his Blood Essence had fused into the Blood Core, the shriveled Blood Core had become full of vigor once again. Even Bloodline Crystal Chains that were unique to flame dragons came to form within it, which meant the Flame Dragon Armor would be able to unleash the flame dragon’s bloodline talents now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The might of the Flame Dragon Armor would rise to a whole new level because of this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Flame Dragon Armor was a Spirit Channeling grade treasure to start with. Now that it had awakened the flame dragon's’ bloodline talents, it actually had hope at making an advancement in its grade, and entering the Immortal grade.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This knowledge further thrilled Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A few more days passed, and all of the Fortune Wells were claimed by powerful experts of different races.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, according to Chai Longge, it would still be some time before the Fortune Wells would work their wonders again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a bitter expression, Chai Longge said to Nie Tian, “I’m afraid it’ll be very troublesome this time. It was very rare that all of the Fortune Wells were claimed the previous times. I heard that only one time were all forty-nine Fortune Wells divided among experts of different races.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“And then...” He went on and explained in a very low voice that fierce conflicts had broken out over the Fortune Wells even before they had become active.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The weaker ones had either given up their Fortune Wells or died defending them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">An icy light flashed across Nie Tian’s narrowed eyes as he said, “So that means we need to be very careful from now on. It’s very likely that newcomers will try to take our Fortune Wells, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Chai Longge fixed him with a sympathetic look and said with a bitter smile, “I’m afraid it’s going to be very likely that they’ll target your Fortune Well. After all, your cultivation base... is only at the middle Worldly realm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He turned to look at Mu Biqiong. “And you too.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian looked around, and discovered that almost all of the outsiders, Ancientbeasts, and Qi warriors he could see were either at the Profound realm or its equivalent grade.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Compared to these people, he and Mu Biqiong looked like two lambs waiting to be slaughtered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A few hours later, a group of people arrived in a formidable array.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At their forefront was a high-spirited young Qi warrior dressed in the Earth Spirit Sect’s garments. He was short, but very robust.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Behind him were a number of Earth Spirit Sect disciples, who were none other than the Qi warriors Nie Tian had encountered in the destroyed Stone Golem city.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The eyes of the man who Yin Yanan had previously injured lit up as soon as he saw Nie Tian and the girls.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Chai Longge’s expression flickered as he couldn’t help but exclaim, “Qiu Ji!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, he took a sideways glance at Nie Tian and the girls. A worried look filled his eyes as he sighed. “Trouble has come for you. He’s the Earth Spirit Sect’s future sectmaster. He was at the middle Profound realm before entering the Shatter Battlefield. He must have derived decisive enlightenment from Lord Myriad Gravity’s legacies, and successfully broken through into the late Profound realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Even though the Earth Spirit Sect isn’t as powerful as my sect, the Martial Spirit Sect, Qiu Ji is their future sectmaster...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Chai Longge shook his head with a sympathetic expression, as if he wanted to help, but was unable to do so.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Chai Fengwu pondered in silence for a few seconds before saying, “I think you’d better leave this place now. Even we didn’t expect that Qiu Ji would have gained such great fortune from the land where Lord Myriad Gravity perished. We thought they would be stranded there, and wouldn’t have the time to come to the Fortune Wells.</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, he shot a fierce look at Nie Tian and the girls, and shouted, “Get the hell over here now!”</span></p>
