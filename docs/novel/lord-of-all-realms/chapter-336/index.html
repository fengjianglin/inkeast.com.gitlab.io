 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Shi Hui had been friends with Qiu Yang and the other three for many years. He had even purchased two of those rings of holding for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He knew their rings of holding so well that, with a quick glance from afar, he was able to tell that the four rings of holding Nie Tian was holding indeed belonged to Qiu Yang and the other three.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Every Qi warrior would consider their ring of holding to be as important as their own life, so they would never give their ring of holding to another person, not even people who they were very close to.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The only circumstance where a cultivator’s ring of holding would appear in another person’s hand would be if the owner had already died.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The fact that Nie Tian was holding Qiu Yang and the other three’s rings of holding meant that they were truly dead.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Shi Hui was flabbergasted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">During recent days, numerous Hunters had been attracted to the Void Illusion Mountain Range by the alleged appearance of a Spirit Channeling grade treasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This meant that there shouldn’t be many powerful Hunters left in this region at this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even if there were, considering the combined strengths of Qiu Yang and the other three, they should have been very hard to kill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Normally speaking, at the same cultivation level, a Hunter’s battle prowess was usually inferior to that of a formal member of the Wild Fire, Blood Skull, or Dark Moon, and the battle prowess of a formal member of these three major forces was inferior to that of a guest elder.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This was a requirement one must meet if he or she wished to become a guest elder.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Shi Hui knew perfectly clearly that the reason why the Blood Skull had acknowledged Qiu Yang and the other three’s identities as their guest elders was different from why they had acknowledged Shi Nan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They were competent and well-trained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even if they had encountered late Greater Heaven stage Hunters who roamed this region, they would have had a good chance of winning.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Not to mention that very few Hunters who roamed in this region close to Ash City could actually reach the late Greater Heaven stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A series of thoughts flashed across Shi Hui’s mind, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t come up with a reasonable explanation as to how Qiu Yang and the other three had died, and why would Nie Tian have their rings of holding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It was Xue Long who gave voice to his speculation first after a moment of bewilderment. “You ran into him, didn’t you, Hua Tian?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Of course, by “him”, Xue Long was referring to Li Langfeng, who had left to make an attempt to break through into the Worldly realm in another location.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In his eyes, only Li Langfeng would be willing to help Nie Tian and have the ability to kill Qiu Yang and the others single-handedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He assumed that Li Langfeng had discovered that Nie Tian was in an unfavorable situation, and thus halted his effort to break through into the Worldly realm to help Nie Tian get rid of Qiu Yang and the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian smiled and didn’t deny it, since he knew if he told Xue Long that he had killed Qiu Yang and the others by himself, it would be too shocking and Xue Long probably wouldn’t believe him. After all, he was only at the middle Heaven stage, and it wouldn’t make sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Therefore, he didn’t explain, but tacitly agreed that it had been Li Langfeng who had annihilated Qiu Yang and the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After getting a positive response, Xue Long nodded gently before he once again laid his eyes on Shi Hui and said with an increasingly relieved tone, “Alright. Like you said, from now on, Qiu Yang and the others won’t interfere with our battle anymore. Don’t you imagine that you can take Hua Tian from me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“That being the case, we might as well drop everything else and continue our battle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Numerous expressions flashed across Shi Hui’s face as he stood silently in his original place, as if he was still racking his brains for an answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian, however, seemed free from any restraint as he sat down in a location more than two hundred meters from the two, where he took out spirit stones and started cultivating. As he channeled power from his spirit stones, he examined Shi Hui with strange looks in his eyes from time to time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">For some reason, Shi Hui felt very uncomfortable under Nie Tian’s roving gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had a strange feeling that Nie Tian was a threat to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He understood that his feeling didn’t make sense. Rationally speaking, Nie Tian was only at the middle Heaven stage, so he couldn’t possibly pose any threat to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even still, whenever Nie Tian looked at him, he felt somewhat uneasy. It even made him suspect whether he had become overly nervous after having fought Xue Long for so long.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">What he didn’t know was that Nie Tian was actually pondering whether or not he should summon the Flame Dragon Armor and use it along with every powerful means at his disposal to kill Shi Hui with Xue Long’s help.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had a feeling that Xue Long had already figured out his real identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If that was the case, he actually wouldn’t need to hide anything from Xue Long anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He didn’t think it would be a big deal if he used the Flame Dragon Armor and Fragmentary Star Incantation in front of Xue Long. After all, they were already old news to many people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The only thing that worried him was that he might fail to kill Shi Hui with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If Shi Hui didn’t die, the news that he was Nie Tian would soon spread out across the entire Realm of Split Void, and Ning Yang would also learn about it within a short time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Their upcoming plans would be jeopardized.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a thorough consideration, he decided to stay put for the time being and keep a close watch on the battle between Xue Long and Shi Hui.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">When an opportunity presented itself where he was confident enough that he would be able to kill Shi Hui with a single strike, he would summon both the Flame Dragon Armor and the Fragmentary Star Incantation and annihilate Shi Hui in this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That was the reason why he constantly checked Shi Hui with strange looks in his eyes as he practiced cultivation on the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His occasional gaze was like a fish bone stuck in Shi Hui’s throat, which made him feel very uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The way Nie Tian had been looking at him was none other than the way a lion looked at its prey, ready to lunge forward and kill it at any moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a grim expression, Shi Hui remained silent for a few seconds. That was when he suddenly remembered Xue Long’s question for Nie Tian: “You ran into him, didn’t you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though Shi Hui didn’t know that Xue Long was referring to Li Langfeng by “him”, he believed that this man, who Xue Long was talking about, had killed Qiu Yang and the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Considering the man had been able to kill those four, his strength must have been beyond ordinary.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Adding in the fact that he didn’t know where the man was at this moment, Shi Hui decided not to take any risks by staying here any longer. “Well, I’ve got some business to tend to. I’ve benefited tremendously from our battle, Brother Xue. We’ll have many more opportunities to meet in the future. Let’s continue our battle next time we meet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, his eyebrows suddenly furrowed, as he sensed with his psychic awareness that a life aura was rapidly approaching.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It added to his determination to leave as soon as possible. Before Xue Long could say anything, he unleashed clusters of blazing flames. Wreathed in the flames, he dashed off towards the Void Illusion Mountain Range, leaving a trail of fire behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At that time, Xue Long also detected the approaching life aura. “Someone’s here!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a brief scan with his Heaven Eyes, Nie Tian perceived who the person was. With a frown, he thought to himself, “How come it’s her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Moments later, Pei Qiqi appeared in a tight, ocean-blue suit. Her jade-like forehead was covered in sparkling sweat beads while a few spatial light blades hovered around her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After seeing that Xue Long and Nie Tian were both fine, she let out a sigh of relief. “I’m not late, am I?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Having been marching to this location at a fast speed, she had consumed a significant amount of her spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, she was covered in nice-smelling sweat, and her cheeks were slightly flushed. It gave her a different but still gorgeous look.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As she panted softly, her ample chest rose and fell. Together with her slender physique, they made her look especially charming and radiant. Looking at her, Nie Tian couldn’t help but drown in her beauty.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“A member of the Blood Skull was very close to Shi Hui. Gu Yu ferreted him out and learned that he had secretly informed Shi Hui of the fact that you and Uncle Xue were coming to this region.” As she tried to calm her breathing, Pei Qiqi continued, “According to that man, Shi Hui had four helpers with him. I was afraid that you wouldn’t be able to handle them all, so I came to check on you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a meaningful smile, Xue Long teased Nie Tian, “Miss Pei is truly concerned about your well-being.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had lived in Shatter City for many years now, and he knew something about Pei Qiqi’s personality. He knew that, aside from her junior martial brother, Li Ye, Pei Qiqi had never truly cared about another person.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even Cai Yuan had never truly entered Pei Qiqi’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She had only treated him with respect since he was the young lord of the Blood Skull, but she had never opened her heart to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Xue Long was well-aware that Pei Qiqi hadn’t hastened over here because she was worried about him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After hearing Xue Long’s teasing words, Pei Qiqi said with an expressionless face, “A dear friend of my masters’ asked me to take care of Hua Tian. He’s a person I respect a lot. Since he put Hua Tian in my hands, it’s only right I do my best to protect Hua Tian. It’s not what you think, Uncle Xue.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Hahaha! How do I dare think?” Xue Long said with a laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Looking at Pei Qiqi, who was still panting softly, Nie Tian felt deeply touched. He said with all seriousness, “Thank you for your concern, senior martial sister.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">For some reason, he had gradually developed subtle feelings towards Pei Qiqi.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Last time, when Pei Qiqi had learned that he had gone on a trip to the Void Illusion Mountain Range with Hu Han, she had decisively followed them into the Void Illusion Mountain Range, hoping to bring him back safely.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">By doing this, she had put herself in danger, and ended up surrounded by Ma Jiu from the Dark Moon and his men.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This time, she came right after she had learned that Shi Hui might have come for Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though he knew that Pei Qiqi might have done it for Hua Mu’s sake, he, who had grown up loved by only Nie Qian and Nie Donghai, still felt very moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I’m only protecting you because of Mr. Hua,” Pei Qiqi said indifferently.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Sincerity filled Nie Tian’s face as he said, “Anyhow. Now that you’ve come for me, I want to thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Alright, that’s enough.” Clearly, Pei Qiqi wasn’t comfortable with the strange atmosphere. “Did Shi Hui come or not?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a smile, Xue Long answered, “He just left, right before you showed up. Don’t worry. We’re fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Pei Qiqi was confused. “What happened?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Xue Long pointed at Nie Tian and said, “You can ask him. I fought Shi Hui long and hard, and I need time to recover, so I’ll leave you two to it. Hahaha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, he took the initiative and walked away from Pei Qiqi and Nie Tian. He sat down in a location several hundred meters away and started to recuperate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Obviously, those were also words of ridicule. Pei Qiqi bit her lower lip as she intended to explain. However, seeing that Xue Long had already walked out quite far, she swallowed her words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian, however, was calm as ever. As Pei Qiqi turned to approach him, he said, “Shi Hui, Qiu Yang and three others came a few days ago. I was their target. Perhaps he still hates me for seriously injuring Shi Nan in the Blood Fighting Pit. So after he learned that Uncle Xue and I came this way, they tracked us down...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He briefly explained what had happened during the past few days, but he intentionally did not explain how Qiu Yang and the other three had died.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, certain things couldn’t be avoided. After all, the deaths of Qiu Yang and the other three were the key factor that had resulted in Shi Hui leaving. Pei Qiqi looked deeply at him and asked directly, “How in the world did Qiu Yang and the others die?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“If I said I killed them, would you believe me?” Nie Tian asked with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Pei Qiqi nodded. “Yeah.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A shocked expression stretched across Nie Tian’s face. “You actually believe that?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I’d never believe that if it were someone else.” Pei Qiqi suddenly lowered her voice. “However, since it’s from the mouth of a guy who rose from amongst numerous talented cultivators and won two fragmentary star marks within the Heaven Gate, owns the Flame Dragon Armor, and has many secrets, no matter how ridiculous it sounds, I will believe it.</span></p>
