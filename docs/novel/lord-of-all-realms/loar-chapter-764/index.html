<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Standing on an ancient starship that was berthed right outside the hemispherical continent, Yuna, the Phantasm expert, said, gazing forward, “This is it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Beside her was berthed a starship that was filled with Demons, Blackscales, and Birdmen. A young, high-tier Demon with a face as beautiful as a female’s was standing at the prow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though he looked very young, he gave off a very ancient feeling, as if life had tempered him for millennia.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All of the other Demons, Blackscales, and Birdmen kept a considerable distance from him, as if to show their respect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Eyebrows furrowed, he said in a gentle voice, “Yuna, you should be able to tell that this continent is wreathed in flesh auras of powerful Ancientspirits and experts of our races. According to ancient records, we were on the losing side of the ultimate war that broke out here. Many grand patriarchs of our races died during the war.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yuna was graceful and curvaceous like a tempting female serpent. Every inch of her exuded a mature and intoxicating quality.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nodding slightly, she said, “That’s right. But you have to know, Terry, that the Ancientspirits weren’t the winners either. After the war, the entire domain was destroyed, with every single realm reduced to fragments.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Soon after we evacuated from here, the Ancientspirits also left here for good.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“If it were up to me, I’d say neither side won. It’s just that we were in such a hurry to evacuate that we failed to take the corpses of our dead grand patriarchs away with us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The eighth grade Demon expert, who she referred to as Terry, then said, “Why is this continent still relatively intact? And why are the flesh auras of our deceased grand patriarchs and powerful Ancientspirits still gathered around it after so many years?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yuna pursed her lips into a smile and said, “We came to find the answer, didn’t we?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">While the two of them talked, the other outsiders listened in complete silence. No one dared to make a sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The outsiders attached great importance to hierarchy. Higher-tier outsiders had absolute authority over lower-tier ones.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yuna and Terry were both eighth grade experts, only one step away from entering the ninth grade. Once they made that step, they would become grand patriarchs of their own races, and enjoy an unchallenged and lofty status throughout their races.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The two of them exchanged a glance, and Yuna asked, “You go first, or should I?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Let me check out the situation first.” With a faint smile, Terry jumped off the Demons’ ancient starship and flew towards the atmosphere of mixed auras in a manner as if he were strolling idly in his courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">…</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">On the floating continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After pushing the stone gate open, Nie Tian wasn’t in a hurry to go anywhere. Instead, he just gazed up into the sky with a grim expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even separated by a great distance, he was sensing heavy pressure from the two eighth grade outsiders’ torrential flesh auras.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He knew perfectly well that outsiders were now gathered right outside this floating continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Right now, he was worried that the atmosphere of mixed auras would not only fail to stop the outsiders from entering, but even be used to strengthen them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yue Yanxi’s voice echoed out, “Nie Tian, will the Vitality-returning Celestial Stone work on outsiders?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian took a deep breath. “I don’t know. There are two eighth grade experts among the outsiders who have come.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yue Yanxi’s expression instantly grew less intense. “Just two?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a moment of hesitation, he said with confidence, “Let me talk to Guan Pu and Jian Gao! We can let them take shelter in this palace for the time being, along with their sect members. They need to recover their strength as soon as possible so that we’ll be able to fight the outsiders together when they swarm in here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Guan Fu was at the middle Void domain and Jian Gao was at the early Void domain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Jian Gao hadn’t sustained any injuries recently. He had just been drained of his spiritual power by the Vitality-returning Celestial Stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Guan Fu, on the other hand, had sustained serious injuries when they had come to this continent. However, since he was at the middle Void domain, he would still be a strong force after getting his spiritual power back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Most importantly, the Divine Flame Sect didn’t have any feuds with the Jian Clan or the Guan Clan. Yue Yanxi had been rather close to the two of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He hadn’t thought about dealing with them before the outsiders had come along. But now that two eighth grade outsiders might enter at any moment, he had to make good use of the Guan Clan and Jian Clan’s forces.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian nodded. “Alright. Go ahead and communicate with them.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His original plan was to drain everyone’s spiritual power with the Ultimates Reverse Grand Spell Formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Afterwards, he would take care of the eyesores from the Bliss Mountain Sect and the Thousandsword Mountain Sect first, and then talk to the people from the Guan Clan and Jian Clan. That way his words would carry more weight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, now that outsiders were here, he would have to make changes to his plan, instead of dealing with them as he pleased.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Fiery light burned in the depths of Yue Yanxi’s narrowed eyes as he established a connection with Guan Fu and Jian Tong right away. “The Ultimates Reverse Grand Spell Formation doesn’t seem to have taken their soul power from them.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the region filled with vigorous wood power, the members of the Jian Clan and the Guan Clan were sitting in silence. Everyone seemed to be in low spirits.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They had long since stopped wasting time recovering spiritual power with spirit stones.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That was because no matter how fast they channeled spiritual power into their spiritual seas, they would lose it even faster due to the effect of the Ultimates Reverse Grand Spell Formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Therefore, they only sat in silence and waited for Nie Tian to come and find them, and see what he would have to say to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Jian Gao’s eyes lit up as he instantly jerked his head in the palace’s direction and said, “It’s Yue Yanxi from the Divine Flame Sect! Yue Yanxi said we’ll be allowed to take shelter in that palace with all of our members!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“On what condition?” Guan Fu asked weakly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had sustained heavy injuries when he had escaped from the Thousandsword Mountain Sect experts’ blockade. Now that he had lost all of his spiritual power, he even failed to receive Yue Yanxi’s soul message at the first moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“None,” Jian Gao said, looking up into the sky. “Outsiders have arrived. Their leaders are two eighth grade experts. Yue Yanxi and that Nie Tian don’t know whether the grand spell formation left by the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace will work on outsiders, so they thought of us.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“They harbor deep hatred towards those from the Thousandsword Mountain Sect and the Bliss Mountain Sect, so they’ll never try to have their forces join them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Now, they’re hoping to add our strength to theirs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Guan Fu’s spirit lifted as he said, “That’s good!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He jerked his head towards the Jian Clan and Guan Clan members and said with a serious tone, “You’ve got to remember not to hold a grudge towards that Nie Tian. Even though he didn’t take us in before, and we lost all of our spiritual power to the Vitality-returning Celestial Stone because of it, this is his territory after all, and we’re guests.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Originally, the members of the two clans had seemed to hold a grudge towards Nie Tian, but they nodded somewhat reluctantly after hearing these words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With an envious expression, Guan Pu said, “Yue Yanxi is a smart man. I wonder how he managed to establish a connection with the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace. With such a powerful connection, the Divine Flame Sect will definitely become a stronger force in the Domain of Heaven’s Boundaries. Now that we have an opportunity to do the same, we’d better do everything we can to seize it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, they got on air-transportation spiritual tools and sailed towards the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though every Qi warrior on this continent had lost all of their spiritual power due to the influence of the Vitality-returning Celestial Stone, they could still use air-transportation spiritual tools that were powered by spirit stones.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Therefore, even though the Guan Clan and Jian Clan members didn’t have a shred of power in their spiritual seas, they had no problem flying on their air-transportation spiritual tools.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as they moved out, Jiang Feng from the Bliss Mountain Sect noticed their movement. “Those people from the Jian Clan and the Guan Clan are returning to the palace that was built by the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace. What are they doing? Taking the initiative to surrender to that Nie Tian kid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“What should we do, Elder Jiang?” Tian Ziping said with a desperate expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“You stay here,” Jiang Feng said. “I’ll fly over there on an air-transportation spiritual tool and see whether I can come to some sort of terms with that kid. After all, our sect doesn’t have any irredeemable feuds with the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace. We only had conflicts with the Divine Flame Sect over some issues in the Domain of Heaven’s Boundaries.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, Jiang Feng also headed towards the palace on an air-transportation spiritual tool.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Ke Jinpeng, who had made many attempts and failed to escape from this continent, also noticed the anomaly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a moment of hesitation, he said, gritting his teeth, “I’ll go and try to talk to that Nie Tian. You stay here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He knew that their only chance of survival now lay with Nie Tian. Therefore, he decided to make a final attempt to see whether it was possible for Nie Tian to forgive them.</span></p>
