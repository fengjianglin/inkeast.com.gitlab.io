 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the forest of sky-reaching trees, Nie Tian held Dong Li in an awkward position as they slowly moved forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At first, Dong Li buried her head in Nie Tian’s chest, fearing that the enormous trees would attack her again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, as Nie Tian walked deeper into the forest, she found that the trees were not attacking her anymore, and thus gradually relaxed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even still, she silently clenched her jaw as she stuck close to Nie Tian’s chest and listened to his vigorous heartbeat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The position made her very bashful and uncomfortable. She was constantly guarding against Nie Tian, fearing that he would take the opportunity to do unspeakable things to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She couldn’t help but recall their close contact in the dense forest in the Realm of Split Void and over the lake in the Realm of Dark Underworld. Images flashed in front of her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Gradually, she realized that she actually didn’t oppose close contact with Nie Tian, which deeply shocked and abashed her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She even blamed herself for it inwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Being so close to Nie Tian, not only was she able to hear his heartbeat, but she was also able to smell his aura, which only strong males would have.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Listening to his heartbeat and smelling his aura, Dong Li couldn’t help but feel unprecedentedly secure, as if as long as they remained in this position, nothing would ever happen to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As for Nie Tian, who was marching forward, he quickly adjusted himself after being carried away briefly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As he pondered what had just happened, he gradually realized that the reason why the ancient trees had stopped attacking Dong Li was probably because she had been submerged in the special aura he emanated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The aura he released into his surroundings originated from his flesh and blood, which carried a bit of the aura of his bloodline.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It was none other than this special aura that had allowed him to be free from the trees’ attacks, which had the same effect for Dong Li when she stayed close enough to him.</span></p>
 <p><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“Life Bloodline and the Fruit of Life...”</span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">&nbsp;Nie Tian was increasingly convinced that there were certain profound connections between the two.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His bloodline was the reason why he had successfully found this place and not been attacked by the enormous trees.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Looking up at the hundred-meter-tall trees, he felt very secure and relaxed. As he walked deeper into the forest, the light-green wood power aura in the air grew increasingly pure and rich.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Wisps of pure wood power continued to pour into his spiritual sea, forming more liquidized wood power at the bottom of his vortex of wood power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He started to have a feeling that as long as he stayed in this magical place, even if he didn’t do anything, the level of development of his vortex of wood power and the level of refinement of his wood power would rise to the point where he would be ready for his next breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It wasn’t an intangible rumor that the wood power here was as thick as water. It was solid truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Just like that, Nie Tian carried Dong Li closer and closer towards the heart of the forest, neither of them saying a word.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">From time to time, Nie Tian would glance around, and discover that long, thin roots stretched from the bottoms of the trees towards the heart of the forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After marching for a few hours, Nie Tian arrived at the heart of the forest with Dong Li clinging to him, where he discovered that the roots of the ancient trees were actually stretching into a shallow pond, which was filled with murky, green water.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the middle of the pond grew a short tree that was about a man’s height with green leaves.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The small tree had only the girth of a grown man’s arm. Its trunk was covered in complicated and mysterious patterns, which glittered with faint, green light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In its fresh, green foliage hung four fist-sized fruits.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The fruits were translucent and sparkling like emeralds, with green light rippling in them, as if they were filled with the most profound power in heaven and earth — life power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Arriving by the edge of the shallow pond, Nie Tian finally came to a stop, his eyes seized by the small tree and the four fruits on it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, he sensed with great clarity that the green aura in his heart wanted to rush out of his body, each and every crystal-like chain within it shining with dazzling light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The green aura followed his meridians straight into his right palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As it did, his right palm began to change. The palm prints on his right palm began to flicker with faint, green light, just like the patterns on the trunk of the short tree.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The green aura rushed about within his palm, though it didn’t seem to be able to fly out through his fingertips.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, a strong, mysterious yearning stemmed from the green aura and seemed to be urging Nie Tian to collect those four emerald-like fruits.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian took deep breaths to calm himself as he said to Dong Li, “I-I think this is the place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing his words, Dong Li, whose head was still buried in Nie Tian’s chest, lifted her head and started to glance around cautiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She soon turned around and discovered the mysterious, short tree Nie Tian was facing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Her gaze switched back and forth between the shallow pond, the small tree in it, and the four fruits hanging in the small trees.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the next moment, Dong Li’s charming body, which was still curled up in Nie Tian’s arms, trembled violently with excitement. “Fruits of Life! There are four of them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Eyes on the short tree, Nie Tian said, “If those are the Fruits of Life, then that’s a Tree of Life! Do you know anything about Trees of Life?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Song Li shook her head and said, with her eyes also on the short tree, “I don’t know. I just know that Fruits of Life grow on Trees of Life. I don’t know anything about what they are and why they exist.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, she started shouting, “Nie Tian! There are four Fruits of Life here! &nbsp;I’ll just take one. After I take it back to the patriarch of my clan, my status in the Dong clan will become rock steady! From then on, no matter what our patriarch awards me, those people in my clan won’t ever dare to talk behind my back again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The fact was that the patriarch of the Dong Clan had adored her since she had been little. Her black phoenix had been captured by him and given to her as a gift.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, every clan had their rules. Even as the patriarch, he couldn’t favor Dong Li too much and pour the Dong Clan’s resources in her direction just because he liked her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Therefore, in order for Dong Li to rise above others in the Dong Clan, she would have to prove her strength and resourcefulness to her clansmen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This was a rule set by the Dong Clan’s ancestors. Even the patriarch had to live by it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, it would be completely different if Dong Li could bring back a Fruit of Life and use it to extend their patriarch’s lifespan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Fruits of Life were legendary items throughout the entire Domain of the Falling Stars. By bringing back a Fruit of Life, Dong Li would prove her capability and make a great contribution to her clan. Her patriarch would be free to shower her with gifts, and the others wouldn’t have anything to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian’s eyes lit up. “Four Fruits of Life!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li would take one, which meant that other than the two he planned to give Wu Ji and Hua Mu to solve their lifespan problem, he would still have one left.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these thoughts in mind, he couldn’t wait anymore, and prepared to collect them right away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li had calmed down after her moment of excitement, and said, “Be careful. Let’s see if there are any special deployments around here. The most amazing treasures usually come with the most deadly threats. You saw yourself how those huge trees turned into killing machines.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She had heard so many stories regarding precious treasures that were the essence of heaven and earth. Every single one of them were closely related with deaths.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Places that produced rare treasures were either overseen by vicious creatures, sealed by mysterious spell formations, or in disorderly spatial regions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She was worried that danger would appear and devour them as soon as Nie Tian went to collect those Fruits of Life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing her words, Nie Tian grew more meticulous and vigilant against danger that could appear at any moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though he was only one step away from entering the pond, he didn’t take that step forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After measuring the distance between him and the tree with his eyes, he pondered briefly and said, “I’ll jump over to the Tree of Life and collect the Fruits of Life while I’m in the air.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, he started to form a chaotic magnetic field around him for protection purposes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, as soon as he summoned his various types of power to form the chaotic magnetic field, he seemed to anger something in this mysterious place.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The moment his special aura was masked by his forming chaotic magnetic field, the ancient trees around the shallow pond started attacking him, as if they had gone mad.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Thousands of branches, which looked like sharp blades, and vines that looked like long whips started storming towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The aura from those branches terrified Nie Tian. Looking at the incoming storm of branches, he felt that there was no way that he could defend against them, and that he would be killed in the next moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li saw the problem and thus hastily yelled, “Wrong move! Don’t do anything! Lose your defenses, just like you did before!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian was instantly enlightened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Before the branches could reach him, he canceled the chaotic magnetic field around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The moment his chaotic magnetic field was lifted, the branches that were raining towards him froze in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A dozen of them were only a few inches from his neck, while another one had almost pierced into Dong Li’s forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian and Dong Li were surrounded by countless frozen branches, as if they were trapped by thousands of floating wooden spears. With one wrong move, they would be impaled and killed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The two of them stiffened in fear. Looking at the sharp branches that were only inches away from their skin, they didn’t dare to move a hair.</span></p>
