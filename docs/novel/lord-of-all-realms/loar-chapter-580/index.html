 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Armes gripped the long, black saber tightly with both hands, as if he were worried that something would happen to the extremely precious weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Seeing him holding the saber with great caution, Nie Tian’s expression changed slightly, as he started to feel a strong sense of danger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Before Nie Tian could give the saber a closer look, Pei Qiqi, who had disappeared a few days ago, suddenly appeared out of nowhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The moment she appeared, she called out to Nie Tian, as if she were facing formidable foes, “Nie Tian! Watch out for that saber! I can see fine spatial fissures slithering around its blade! It seems that even the space around it can’t withstand its might! You need to go back into your spell formation right now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing these words, Nie Tian examined the saber with rapt attention, and confirmed Pei Qiqi’s statement.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">There were indeed very fine and subtle fissures around the blade of the long, pitch-black saber. They contracted and snapped open from time to time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At the same time, upon hearing Pei Qiqi’s words, the chosen ones from the Domain of the Falling Stars unleashed their psychic awareness to examine the saber’s wonders.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, the moment they did, they each let out a muffled groan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as their psychic awareness made contact with the long saber, severe, twisting pain came from their souls.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It was as if their souls were suddenly seized by some violent force, which was going to rip their souls from their bodies and imprison them in the Nethersoul Saber.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They struggled to suppress their souls’ unusual movements, not daring to give the saber another glance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Gasping with astonishment, Nie Tian exclaimed, “Get in here now, all of you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In a split second, all of the chosen ones and the other Greater Heaven stage young Qi warriors dashed into the Wood Thriving Formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Pei Qiqi also rapidly backed to Nie Tian’s side upon hearing his urging words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a thought, Nie Tian adjusted one of the tree branches, and the Wood Thriving Formation unleashed a green ward that quickly spread, enveloping everyone inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Armes laughed sinisterly, as if he didn’t seem concerned with Nie Tian’s actions at all, and he didn’t do anything to stop them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It seemed that he was completely confident that, even though Nie Tian and the others were hiding behind the Wood Thriving Formation, they weren’t going to survive a strike from the unmatched saber in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“It won’t work. This saber of Lord Basto’s isn’t something you can defend against!” With these words, he gripped the hilt with great force as he infused every bit of his soul power and bloodline power into the long, pitch-black saber.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon seeing this, the outsiders who stood beside Armes all swiftly backed away from him, fear appearing in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In a split second, there was not a single person standing between Nie Tian and Armes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Armes’ hands, which he used to grip the long saber, were instantly wreathed in wisps of cyan aura, which were the condensation of Armes’ internal power that was now madly infusing into the saber in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His arms were originally exceptionally thick and muscular, but at this moment, they were shriveling at a speed that could be seen with the naked eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Not only that, but even his whole body began to shrivel, as if every bit of his flesh power was being infused into the long saber.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At the same time, wisps of blood flowed slowly from the corners of his eyes, his nose, and his ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">These were signs of him overdrawing his soul power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">An overwhelming aura that could shatter heaven and earth and annihilate all living beings rapidly built up within the Nethersoul Saber.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the next moment, sharp shrieks of discarnate souls echoed out in every young Qi warrior’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even the Wood Thriving Formation couldn’t isolate the waves of ear-piercing shrieks. Hiding in the spell formation, the chosen ones covered their ears with their hands and groaned in agony.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even still, wisps of blood could be seen flowing through their fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Just a soul attack by the long saber made the Greater Heaven stage Qi warriors feel as if their souls were going to be torn to pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">One by one, they dropped to the ground and sat in the lotus position. They kept their hands over their ears as they went all-out to summon their psychic power to defend their souls.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even Dong Baijie and Dong Li did the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian and Pei Qiqi were the only ones who were still standing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, from the look on Nie Tian’s face, it appeared that he was also in great pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Before the actual battle even began, the nine fragmentary stars in his soul had shone with dazzling light, filling every corner of his soul with soul power and protecting him from the soul attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He eventually warded off the discarnate souls’ mad shrieks at the expense of a large amount of his soul power from the nine fragmentary stars in his soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Bleeding from his nose, mouth, eyes, and ears, Armes let out a hysterical roar and lunged directly towards Nie Tian, bringing the saber down with two hands, as if he were going to split the whole island in two. “Nie Tian! If you can survive a slash from this saber, I’ll immediately turn around and march out of here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">On the blade of the Nethersoul Saber, patterns that looked like countless fine veins suddenly blossomed with blinding light, and a long, cyan blade light quickly came to form.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The blade light was so wide that it looked like a river of dazzling light, from which the shadows of tens of thousands of vicious discarnate souls could be seen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They seemed to be confined in the blade light, where they bore their fangs at each other and built up their endless thirst for blood and desire for killing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">CRACKLE!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the enormous, cyan blade light slashed down from the air, the space around it crackled, creating flying sparks that quickly converged on the blade light, further boosting its might.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BOOM!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The wide blade light finally slammed onto the ward of the Wood Thriving Formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In a split second, every tree and plant within ten kilometers withered and died.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Afterwards, the mysterious tree patterns that were swimming within the green ward lost their supply of wood power, and thus suddenly left the ward and flew back into the seventy-two tree branches.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The ward, which had withstood the unrelenting attacks of dozens of outsiders for hours, shattered under the crushing force of the blade light!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The moment the Wood Thriving Formation gave, the Qi warriors under it started to experience even more intense, sharp shrieks of discarnate souls.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They all started to scream as they covered their ears and exerted all their power to defend against the soul attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the blade light continued to come down, Pei Qiqi called out,</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Nie Tian! I can help you reduce the might of this slash, but only by a bit!” With these words, Pei Qiqi sat down on the ground and wove her hands in the air, forming a profound hand seal. In the next moment, her fingertips became translucent, and countless fine spatial blades burst forth in all directions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The spatial blades seemed to contain the unfathomable power from that mysterious outsider expert.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, a spatial magic that she had recently derived but hadn’t completely mastered was unleashed. “Space Freeze!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As she uttered these words, the fluctuating space over everyone’s heads seemed to be suddenly frozen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">For a moment, everyone could no longer hear the ear-piercing shrieks. They felt as if both time and space had frozen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They could no longer feel the flow of the wind, nor could they see the withered plants around them sway. They even felt that their hearts had stopped, and their blood had ceased flowing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They felt as if they had suddenly been submerged in a giant drop of pine gum, and they were like the insects within it. No one was able to move a finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Also subject to such influences was the broad blade light of the Nethersoul Saber.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Other than Armes, who was bringing the saber down towards Nie Tian, the other outsiders all gasped with astonishment and fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At the same time, their expressions seemed to be frozen, not a single muscle on their faces moving.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Apparently, even though they were standing quite far from Pei Qiqi, the moment she cast that strange spatial magic, none of them could escape its influence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If she wanted to, she could probably slaughter them all with her spatial blades without meeting any resistance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, Pei Qiqi didn’t seem to have enough strength left to do so.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">CRACKLE! CRACKLE!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Crackling sounds came from the broad, cyan blade light, as if the frozen space were like a piece of ice fissuring under great pressure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">POOH!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Pei Qiqi coughed up a mouthful of blood and fainted, her face pale as paper.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Armes shot Pei Qiqi a quick glance, and then refocused on pressing the saber down towards Nie Tian with both hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, the cyan blade light once again went down towards Nie Tian as the Nethersoul Saber started moving again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BOOM!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">One cluster of crimson flame after another rose from the Flame Dragon Armor on Nie Tian, rapidly turning him into a burning man.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Crackling burning sounds echoed out around him as he summoned his Flame Star. He took a step forward as he gathered his various types of power and rage in the same way he would cast a Rage Punch.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, he no longer held anything back. He emptied his flame power, wood power, star power, and flesh power into his Flame Star, along with the raging flame power from the Blood Core of the Flame Dragon Armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As that happened, the resounding furious roar of a titan echoed from the few spatial rifts in the colorful mist that floated over the black lake, which should have been the passage between this place and the outsiders’ realms.</span></p>

 <p>5. The sword of integrity: Qi Xing Long Yuan&nbsp;</p>
 <p><img src="https://cdn.wuxiaworld.com/uploads/alcohol-sword-immortal/lord-of-all-realms/images/l2jghy3a.ujk.png" style="width: 300px" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil"></p>
 <p>Legend has it that this sword was the joint work of two swordmakers, Ou Yezi and Gan Jiang. In order to make it, they brought stream water from Cishan Mountain to the seven ponds around the sword-making fireplace. Because the seven ponds were shaped like seven stars of the Big Dipper, the sword was named Qi Xing (seven stars). If you look down the sword, it looks ethereal and profound, as if you are in a high position overlooking a valley where a huge dragon lives, which is why the sword was named Long Yuan (an abyss where a dragon lives).</p>
 <p>According to <em>the Annals of Wu and Yue</em>, another factor that made this sword famous was a fisherman whose name is unknown. He saved Wu Zixu’s life. In order to express his gratitude to the fisherman, who refused to tell his name, Wu gave him the sword, Qi Xing Long Yuan. The fisherman sighed and said, “I saved your life because you are a honest official of the country, not because I wanted your reward. Now that you think I am a man longing for profits, I have to show my nobleness with this sword.” With these words, he committed suicide with the sword. That was why Qi Xing Long Yuan was considered a sword of integrity.</p>
 <p>Called Long Yuan before the Tang dynasty, it adopted another name, Qi Xing Long Quan (quan means fountain), because of the naming taboo of Emperor Gaozu, who was the founder of Tang dynasty whose personal name was Li Yuan.</p>
