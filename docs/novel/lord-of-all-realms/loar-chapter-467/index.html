 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BOOM!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The black phoenix rammed into an invisible ward. Dong Li and Nie Tian’s dashing momentum was instantly stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhao Shanling, who was originally sitting at the bottom of the crater, blurred into action, and in a split second, he was floating in midair.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Staring at Dong Li from afar, he asked, looking rather confused, “How did you find me, girl?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In fact, he had noticed her and Nie Tian as soon as they had come out of the spatial tunnel created by Zhen Huilan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, since their cultivation bases were incredibly low, he hadn’t attached any importance to them. After all, many Tool Sect elders had come to search in this area and failed to find any traces of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a mere glance, he had refocused on his battle against Qi Bailu, not caring what Dong Li and Nie Tian said to each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Only when Zhen Huilan and Qin Yi had come and learned about his hiding place from her had he finally realized that he had been put in an unfavorable situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That was when he had paid serious attention to Dong Li and wondered how she had been able to locate him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The fact that he had never seen her come to this area, and yet she had pointed out his hiding place with great precision, confused him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He didn’t know that Nie Tian, who was beside her, was actually the one who had found him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Why would I tell you?” With these words, Dong Li, who had already summoned her cyan awl, started using it to repeatedly bombard the invisible spatial energy ward. After discovering that her efforts were fruitless, she commanded the black phoenix to take them to another location, hoping to break free from there.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian was being carried the whole time, observing everything around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BANG! BANG! BANG!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Every time the black phoenix tried to break free from another location, they would ram into an invisible ward. After failing to escape after numerous attempts, Dong Li started to look anxious and insecure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, the numerous waves of spatial energy Zhen Huilan had created with the flutter of her folding fan were spreading towards Zhao Shanling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Amidst the spatial energy fluctuations were raging flames, which seemed to be flickering with the profound truths of fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a grim expression, Qin Yi let out an angry roar. In the next moment, he seemed to turn into a giant clad in a suit of golden armor, throwing a fist strike directly towards Zhao Shanling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Fierce, golden light and golden lightning bolts exploded from within the enormous fist, which was bearing down with the force of tens of thousands of pounds, enveloping the area where Zhao Shaling was floating.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Looking at the giant, golden fist and the fierce, golden lightning, Nie Tian marveled at the profound might of metal power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">SHEW! SHEW! SHEW!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The sky-filling golden light and lightning bolts interacted in midair, morphing into thick lightning bolts that eventually interwove into a gigantic net of golden lightning.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As Qin Yi’s fist continued to fall, the net of golden lightning smashed down towards Zhao Shanling with the momentum of a mountain falling from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Seeing that both Zhen Huilan and Qin Yi had revealed their full strength the moment he showed himself, Zhao Shanling’s expression flickered slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, the majority of his mind and soul were still focused on manipulating the Death Reign to fight Qi Bailu.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He was aware that now that he had been discovered, many powerful experts from the Tool Sect, including Wu Langxie, would swarm towards his location. Therefore, he made a decision at this crucial moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He instantly ended his battle against Qi Bailu, which was taking place hundreds of thousands kilometers away, and controlled the Death Reign to return to him using his mind and soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At that very moment, the enormous net of golden lightning enveloped his floating body. Immediately afterwards, Qin Yi’s giant golden fist smashed down on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BANG!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon the incomparably strong impact, Zhao Shanling’s body shattered, and pieces of him shot in every direction like bits of broken glass.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His broken body passed through the grid of the huge net of golden lightning bolts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian was flabbergasted. “What?! He just died like that?!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li’s expression turned especially grim. “If only it were that easy.... He’s a master of spatial magics. How could he be so easily killed? Back in the day, that man was notoriously deadly in the Realm of Unbounded Desolation. Even his own master died because of him. He would never be so fragile and unable to withstand a single blow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian’s pupils suddenly shrunk as he watched Zhao Shanling’s shattered body that looked like broken glass gather to a single point after shooting through the lightning net.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the blink of an eye, Zhao Shanling returned to human form, unscathed and expression as calm as ever.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Shaking his head, he said, “You’re being too sloppy by coming for me with just the two of you. Didn’t think I would kill you, did you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, he turned to Qin Yi and said with a cold snort, “I’m actually a man who treasures old ties. After all, my junior martial sister and I learned from the same master. Even though she has some misunderstandings about me, I can’t bear to kill her with my own hands. But who the hell do you think you are? This is between me and my sect. Who gave you the right to meddle with our internal affairs?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, he cast out a crimson, metal cauldron with a casual fling of his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The crimson cauldron had three legs and was covered in elegant and simple patterns. Raging lava spewed out of its mouth unceasingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">One stream of fierce lava after another shot up and converged on Qin Yi’s huge, golden fist like numerous long, crimson rivers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A glittering, golden glove seemed to exist at the center of the immeasurably large, golden fist, which appeared to be Qin Yi’s spiritual tool.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, as the rivers of boiling lava sprayed on the golden fist, which was formed by Qin Yi’s pure spiritual power, the huge fist was instantly ignited and started to shrink.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The normal-sized golden glove in the middle of it also instantly grew dim and lifeless.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qin Yi let out a muffled groan as his expression flickered dramatically, yet his eyes shone brightly with golden light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After neutralizing the golden fist with its burning lava, the crimson cauldron started floating towards Qin Yi.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhao Shanling laughed madly. “Even though there seems to be a fine line between the late Profound realm and the early Soul realm, you should know how big the gap really is. I’ve already achieved my goal on this trip. I can leave or stay as I want. I admit that there are quite a few people with cultivation bases higher than mine in the Domain of the Falling Stars, but, since master has died, the next person who can trap me hasn’t been born yet!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">FIZZ! FIZZ!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, a spatial portal slowly opened behind Zhao Shanling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Countless rays of light could be seen flashing across within it, as if they were paths to different spaces where endless and unknown danger was lurking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Gazing at the spatial portal created by Zhao Shanling, Zhen Huilan’s expression flickered slightly, as if she knew that Zhao Shanling’s statement was true.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As a master of spatial magics herself, she was well-aware of the meaning of the appearance of that portal, which even she wouldn’t dare to step into rashly. Zhao Shanling was planning to leave through it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">There were very few masters of spatial magics throughout the entire Domain of the Falling Stars. Zhen Huilan had only ever known one person who was equally as skilled in spatial magics as Zhao Shanling - her master.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Unfortunately, her master had already died.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As for cultivators who weren’t skilled in spatial magics, even if their cultivation bases were higher than Zhao Shanling’s, they wouldn’t be able to stop him from leaving unless they had shattered the barriers in their cultivation and joined the ranks of the three domains.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, not a single person in the Domain of the Falling Stars had managed to enter the Void domain, the Saint Domain, or the God Domain yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That meant even if Wu Langxie and Qi Bailu were here, the lot of them wouldn’t be able to kill Zhao Shanling or trap him in the Realm of Unbounded Desolation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With such thoughts on her mind, Zhen Huilan couldn’t help but feel deeply helpless and worried about the future of their sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">By the time Xia Yi from the Flame God Sect had refined the earthflame essence he had gathered and broken through into the late Soul realm, he would be able to overtake every powerful expert in the Tool Sect one-on-one. Even if Qi Bailu and Wu Langxie teamed up, it would still be hard to say if they would be able to stop Xia Yi and his ally, Zhao Shanling, who possessed the Death Reign...</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhen Huilan didn’t dare to further her thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">WHOOSH! WHOOSH!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">One river of burning lava after another shot out from within the crimson cauldron and arrived before Qin Yi in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Sighing inwardly, Zhen Huilan cast out her folding fan, forming multiple spatial energy wards to stop the incoming rivers of raging lava. Then, she said to Qin Yi in a low voice, “Wu Langxie and my eldest martial brother will be here soon. I believe the traitor’s vengeful trip to the Realm of Unbounded Desolation is coming to an end, but I doubt that we’ll be able to kill him, even together.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“So you mean...?” Qin Yi asked with a grim expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Don’t go all-out to attack him anymore.” Zhen Huilan said helplessly. “Stall him and wait for the arrival of Wu Langxie and my eldest martial brother.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">SHEW!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">An incomparably thick bolt of lightning suddenly appeared in the distant sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With loud rumbles, it shot directly towards Nie Tian and Dong Li’s location at an alarming speed, and in a brief moment, shattered the invisible spatial energy ward Zhao Shanling had created. Then, as the lightning cleared, Zhu Bin emerged.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Seeing that the ward was down, Dong Li was overjoyed, and immediately flew away with Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Let’s go!” Dong Li blurted. “A battle at such a level isn’t something we can take part in. It’s gonna be too dangerous for us if we stay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian, who was being carried farther and farther away, frowned as he gazed at Zhao Shanling, who was still laughing madly, as if there was no one in this world he would fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhao Shanling had committed unforgivable crimes by plunging the people in the Realm of Unbounded Desolation into misery and suffering and even killing his own master. However, due to his unmatched expertise in spatial magics, Soul realm cultivation base, and the Death Reign at his disposal, no one seemed to be able to subdue him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The wild arrogance and rampancy on display gave Nie Tian a very deep impression, and left him in a shocked state for a long while.</span></p>
