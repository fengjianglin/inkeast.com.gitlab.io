 <p>Hey guys, I'm excited to let you know that <a href="https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/physicians-odyssey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Physician's Odyssey</a> is now out of sneak peek and available for everyone to read, with 60 chapters to start! &nbsp;This is a modern wuxia novel that is part of our big 2019 kickoff to more genres.&nbsp; Authored by Smoking Pipe Bro and translated by Wuxiaworld veteran Thyaeria (who is also working with us on The Great Ruler and Tales of Demons &amp; Gods), this Zongheng novel brings us the story of the brilliant physician Su Tao.&nbsp; Su Tao is a medical genius, but just wants to maintain...</p>

<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Every Son of the Stars of the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace would have a chance at competing for the position of the Lord of the Stars. All those who had been chosen to be Sons of the Stars had extremely outstanding cultivation talent and potential.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Every generation of Sons of the Stars would eventually produce a Lord of the Stars, and perhaps one or two God domain experts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">No matter how weak a Son of the Stars turned out to be, as long as he didn’t die prematurely, the cultivation and tempering he received from the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace would allow him to grow into a Saint domain expert, at least.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Of course, different Saint domain experts’ strengths varied greatly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A Saint domain Son of the Stars would be much more powerful than a Saint domain expert like Jing Feiyang, Quan Zixuan, or Qu Mingde, even though their cultivation bases were the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As for Nie Tian, the newborn seventh Son of the Stars, his name had spread far and wide recently. Even the outsiders had heard about him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, what had made the outsiders really apprehensive about him was the fact that he was a hybrid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Being a hybrid meant that his limitations as a human, such as feeble bodies and short lifespans, had probably been made up for.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Therefore, as such a special Son of the Stars, his name was already high on the outsiders’ list of most wanted humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If the newly-arrived Demon grand patriarch could catch or kill Nie Tian, his prestige among his people would definitely soar. He might even win the favor of their grand monarchs, allowing his clan to rise to prominence, and gain the eligibility to move into the First Demon Domain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Thump! Thump! Thump!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Three large purple balls separated themselves from the Demon’s abdomen and fell onto the sand like giant watermelons.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon landing, the balls of flesh split, releasing dozens of demonic bugs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Disguised by the raging Demon qi, they rapidly drilled into the sand and crawled towards Nie Tian soundlessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The newly-arrived Demon grand patriarch was named Feimos, and was also at the middle ninth grade. His people had given him the nickname “The Controller”.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All of the Demons who had been given nicknames were grand patriarchs or grand monarchs that carried ancient bloodlines.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Feimos the Controller himself came from an ancient Demon clan, which was famous for raising and controlling demonic bugs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had fed a large number of demonic bugs with his own flesh and blood, and enveloped them in those lumps that grew on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Standing on the Star Boat, Nie Tian became instantly alarmed, his hair standing on end. “Something is wrong!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as Feimos the Controller had locked him down, he had sensed great danger, feeling that something extremely ferocious had fixed its bloodthirsty eyes on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">No matter how hard he had tried to hide himself with his bloodline talent, he hadn’t been able to escape that thing’s detection.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Now, he realized that danger was spreading towards him like waves, yet he didn’t know exactly what it was.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BOOM!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Raging flesh power suddenly burst forth from within his meridians, bones, internal organs, and muscles, instantly putting him in the Life Strengthening state.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His heart raced as his senses grew increasingly keen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The ten drops of Blood Essence in his heart also blossomed with sparkling, crimson light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He was ready for battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Moments later, he looked down at the sand, his expression flickering. “There’s something in the sand!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BANG! BANG! BANG!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dozens of demonic bugs crawled out of the sand and flew towards him like black lightning bolts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Unlike the ones that had chased after the ninth grade ice phoenix, these bugs looked as if they had been forged from black steel, their smooth shells giving off an ice-cold luster.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The bugs had sharp teeth and tender antennae on their heads that seemed to allow them to capture even the slightest flesh power fluctuations.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With the help of his bloodline power, Nie Tian could tell that each and every one of them carried shockingly strong flesh power within them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I can’t believe that most of those demonic bugs are at the seventh grade! And there are eighth grade ones among them too, which seem to have even developed their own intelligence!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Looking into the demonic bugs’ compound eyes, Nie Tian suddenly saw the ugly soul shadow of Feimos the Controller in them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A shudder ran through Nie Tian as he instantly realized that these demonic bugs were actually Feimos’s pets, which had avoided the human experts and come after him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Low-tier demonic creatures controlled by high-tier Demons...” A train of thought flashed across his mind in the time it takes a spark to fly off of a piece of flint.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Flame Dragon’s Cry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Furious flame power was summoned from within the Flame Dragon Armor, and after mixing with flame power from his flame power core, it morphed into an enormous flame dragon that floated in midair.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Exuding raging flames, the flame dragon plummeted towards the demonic bugs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At the same time, the Star Boat tipped its prow towards the incoming demonic bugs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As numerous Star Stone were drained of their power and cracked, a beam of starlight shot straight out of the Star Boat’s pointy prow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The flame dragon and the Star Boat rained flames and starlight on the demonic bugs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Hit by flames and starlight, the seventh grade demonic bugs wobbled in the air before falling onto the sand like rocks, but they didn’t die.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The eighth grade ones, however, managed to remain in the air, even though their solid shells split, giving rise to loud sounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian looked with rapt attention, and discovered that as mighty as the starlight was, it didn’t seem to inflict much damage on the demonic bugs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Instead, the flame dragon he had released with Flame Dragon’s Cry seemed to damage and scare them more.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All of a sudden, he realized the reason behind this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The flames seemed to be vested with wisps of the Divine Flame within his flame power core.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Divine Flame he had harnessed in the Domain of Flame’s End had clearly vested the flame dragon with new power. One touch of its flames, and the demonic bugs would catch fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As this happened, the flame power that rose from underneath the desert suddenly converged on the demonic bugs, fueling the flames that were burning them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Many demonic bugs that had fallen onto the sand were instantly engulfed in fierce flames. With sharp screeches, they gradually burned to ashes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After that, as the flames flew away from the ashes, not only had they not grown weaker, but they had grown stronger instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“It appears that the wisps of flame power from the Divine Flame are channeling power from underneath the desert, making them even more destructive!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A smile appeared on Nie Tian’s face as he realized that he was also able to control the flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Therefore, under the guidance of his soul awareness, more crimson flames left the demonic bugs they had burned to ashes, and pounced on living ones.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BZZZ!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The flame spark that agreed with his attribute perfectly suddenly flew out of his flame power core into the sand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The earthy-yellow desert had already turned blackish-violet under the effect of Hazlitt’s bloodline talent, but at this point, it seemed to be suddenly ignited by the flame spark. The entire desert started to burn fiercely.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, the flame spark flew around, as if to gather the flame power that would strengthen it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In an incredible fashion, the flames’ might suddenly multiplied as they burned the remaining demonic bugs. Even the eighth grade bugs had their solid shells burned away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The flesh and blood underneath their shells seemed to be very vulnerable, as they were reduced to ashes moments after being engulfed by flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At the same time, the blackish-violet desert gradually turned crimson.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As this happened, wisps of flesh aura rose from underneath the sand, along with raging flame power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The flesh aura was blackish-purple, which was what Hazlitt the Flame Maniac had used to channel and manipulate the flame power of this desert.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Now that the flame spark had expelled every last bit of his aura from the desert, he could no longer make use of its power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The flame spark now took its place as the new master of the flame power that was buried in this vast desert.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian’s eyes lit up as he suddenly realized what was going on. “The flame spark came from the Divine Flame. The Divine Flame’s unique cultivation method is to plant flame sparks into developing realms, gradually turning them into flame realms. &nbsp;As they grow into flame realms, the flame sparks within them will grow with them. The flame sparks will absorb nourishment from their host realms to strengthen themselves, and wait for the Divine Flame’s return to rejoin it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“This desert seems to be the ideal place to help the flame spark grow. No wonder it flew out on its own to strengthen itself with the flame power held by the desert!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">HOWL!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Hazlitt’s howls once again echoed out from the depths of the area enveloped in rolling Demon qi. Clearly, he was enraged.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“The Flame Maniac’s bloodline talent has failed!” The ninth grade ice phoenix exclaimed as she got rid of the demonic bugs that were chasing after her, and flew gracefully back to Hazlitt.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Bloodline magic: Freeze of A Thousand Icebergs!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Numerous cone-shaped pieces of ice came to form, glittering in midair</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Like icicles from icebergs that were more than ten thousand years old, they were sharp and crystal-clear, and exuded the profound truths of frost power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Close to a thousand ice cones worked their wonders at the same time, and countless rays of icy light interwove in midair, forming a web of sparkling light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It suddenly descended, trapping Hazlitt the Flame Maniac. A layer of hard ice rapidly spread on his giant body, which made cracking sounds as he moved about.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Due to the formation of the layer of ice, his blood flow also became slow and obstructed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Because of this, he could no longer use many of his bloodline talents and magics.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At the same time, the ninth grade dragon slammed Hazlitt with his enormous claws, which looked like anchors that had expanded a hundred times over.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The layer of ice over Hazlitt the Flame Maniac shattered as he was knocked out of the sky and crashed heavily into the desert.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The dragon that was close to a thousand meters long then swooped down on Hazlitt. The devastating crash created a huge crater, inside of which the two of them immediately started clawing and biting each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As large as Hazlitt was, the dragon was much larger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Under the dragon’s furious attacks with his enormous teeth and claws, pieces of flesh were ripped off of Hazlitt’s body, causing a lot of bleeding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With every chunk of flesh that was torn from Hazlitt’s body, he shrank down a bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This indicated that Hazlitt was losing his strength at an alarming speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Struggling in the crater, Hazlitt cried out painfully in the Demon’s language, “Feimos!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Quan Zixuan from the Thousandsword Mountain Sect suddenly discovered that his spiritual swords could finally cut into Hazlitt’s body now, and thus went all-out to attack him with his numerous flying swords.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Hazlitt’s demonized body continued to shrink.</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Ignoring Feimos, Hazlitt took the opportunity to dash into the activated spatial tunnel before the dragon could organize his next round of attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">RUMBLE!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The spatial tunnel fluctuated, as the sounds of flesh splitting open came from it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Seeing the unfavorable situation, Feimos shed more lumps, which split and unleashed hundreds of thousands of small bugs in all directions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He bellowed a few words in the Demon’s language before rapidly disappearing into the spatial tunnel as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Destroy the portal!”</span></p>
