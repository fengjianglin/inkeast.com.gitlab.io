 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">WHOOSH! WHOOSH!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian and Dong Li appeared out of nowhere in midair and started plummeting towards the earth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dark spiritual power exploded from within Dong Li, and her black phoenix flew out from the top of her head in the next moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The black phoenix spread its wings and grabbed her, stopping her from crashing into the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After stabilizing herself, Dong Li immediately communicated with the black phoenix through her thoughts, and then shot towards the falling Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Just before he was going to hit the ground, Dong Li caught him. Then, the two of them landed smoothly with the help of the black phoenix.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Standing on the ground, Dong Li looked up into the sky, still badly shaken.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian’s eyes also glittered with bright light as he gazed into the sky. After recovering, he took out one of the three wooden boxes and handed it to Dong Li, saying, “This is yours. You deserve it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li didn’t stand on ceremony. Instead, she grabbed the wooden box without any hesitation and stuffed it into her ring of holding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She took a deep breath, and her ample chest trembled slightly. After a moment of silence, she said with her eyes narrowed, “We’re finally out of that damn place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian nodded. “Yeah, we’re quite lucky.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li smiled heartily as she finally set her heart at ease. Heedless of the manners a lady should have, she dropped to the ground and flattened. Looking up at the innumerable stars in the sky, she said, “Lucky can’t even begin to describe it. Trips with you are always full of surprises and horror. Before coming to the Realm of Unbounded Desolation, I’d never imagined we would have so many strange encounters.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though Nie Tian was brimming with spiritual power, he was rather exhausted mentally after the intense adventure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He followed Dong Li and lay down shoulder to shoulder next to her, saying, “When we were shot into the sky by the mysterious force from the pond, did you look down from midair?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, he spared a wisp of thought to examine his vortex of wood power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the magical place, he had channeled copious amounts of wood power from the spiritual energy ball he had formed into his vortex of wood power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, even though he had already left that place where wood power was as thick as water, his vortex of wood power was still spinning madly, forming drops of liquidized wood power that gathered into a lake at the bottom of his vortex of wood power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The green lake of concentrated wood essence exuded thriving life force, while a few spots on the lake’s surface glistened with green light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the vortex of wood power continued to spin, the glistening spots in the lake seemed to be rearranging to trigger some sort of change.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Those green glistening spots were formed by the fragmented will of the Titan, with some sort of profound magic imbued within them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Now, as the vortex of wood power continued to spin at a fast speed, the originally disorderly green spots started to realign into a certain formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian had a feeling that once those green spots finished reintegrating, he would be able to unveil the mysteries within them with his psychic awareness.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, he wasn’t sure how long this process would take, just as he wasn’t sure how long it would take for the dormant green aura to finish refining the power it had absorbed from the Fruit of Life and complete its transcendence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Gazing into the starlit sky, Dong Li felt as if she had been reborn.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Recalling the vague shape of the magical land she had seen when they had been shot into the sky, she said, “I did. The way I see it, that continent looked like a giant lying supine, just like we are now. The forest we went through was at the giant’s chest, and the shallow pond where the Tree of Life grew was one of the giant’s eyes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Not only did that giant give life to the Tree of Life, but he was also guarding it.” With these words, she turned her head to look at Nie Tian, who was lying right next to her. Charming light rippled in her watery eyes as she said, “I believe that even if other people could somehow find and enter that magical place, they still wouldn’t be able to collect those Fruits of Life and get out of there alive. Only you can.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">When she had reached out to touch one of the Fruits of Life, a formidable aura of flesh and blood burst forth from underneath them and almost instantly crushed her internal organs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That was when the owner of the eye hadn’t even moved a finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Judging by the formidable might of the aura unleashed by that giant, even the most powerful Soul realm experts in the Domain of the Falling Stars probably wouldn’t be able to snatch those Fruits of Life by force, much less her and Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She had miraculously survived and ended up with one Fruit of Life due to something mysterious on Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“That continent did look like a giant...” Nie Tian’s eyes couldn’t help but slide to Dong Li’s perky breasts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“There are so many mysteries in heaven and earth. Who would have thought that the rumor that has existed in the Realm of Unbounded Desolation for so long is actually real? Who would have also thought that magical place was on a giant’s supine body?” With these words, Dong Li shot a glance at Nie Tian, noticing his lustful gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, having just escaped death and gained a Fruit of Life, she decided to let this one go. “When we were falling from midair, I looked down and noticed that we are in a location close to the Bone Sect, but quite far from the creek we left from.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing her words, Nie Tian turned his head to glance around, and saw nothing but volcanoes that seemed to have gone extinct many many years ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li continued, “The entrance to that magical place must be constantly floating about, instead of staying in one location. &nbsp;No wonder wood power experts from around the Domain of the Falling Stars have sensed the existence of that magical place in different locations.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Her eyes glittered brightly as she turn her head to look at Nie Tian again. “But in the end, they weren’t as amazing as you are...</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Perhaps they were able to detect the few wisps of pure wood power that leaked out from the entrance, but none of them could locate the entrance accurately, since the entrance was constantly on the move. By the time they came close to it, it had already floated to another location.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I’m just luckier than most people.” Nie Tian tried to muddle through the topic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li snorted coldly. “Fine. Don’t talk about it if you don’t want to, but don’t use your good luck nonsense on me again.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, Nie Tian was struck by a feeling that the connection between him and his nine Heaven Eyes, which hadn’t entered the magical land with him, was reestablished.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He tried to guide them with his thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though the Heaven Eyes had lost considerable amounts of psychic and soul power, they gradually flew towards him from a remote location.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As they approached, fragmentary stars flashed in the depths of his pupils, filling the Heaven Eyes with copious soul and psychic power. Once again, they were able to help Nie Tian keep a close watch on everything in his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Who knows how many days we were gone for and what the situation is now in the Realm of Unbounded Desolation?” Lying there, deeply relaxed, he started operating the Fragmentary Star Incantation internally to absorb the starlight that was falling from the heavens.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Who cares. Neither the feud between the Tool Sect and Zhao Shanling, nor those earthflame essence gatherers from the Flame God Sect, are our problem.” Dong Li sounded unburdened. “The turbulent situation in the Realm of Unbounded Desolation might still last for some time, but I think it will come to an end after those from the Flame God Sect have gathered all the earthflame essence they need.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“The Tool Sect’s headquarters is protected by a grand spell formation. As powerful as Zhao Shanling’s Death Reign is, I doubt it can breach it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Even if it does, it will be a war between Zhao Shanling and the Tool Sect. It won’t affect many others. Perhaps only some of the equipment forgers who are attending the assessment assembly will be dragged into the mess and killed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian’s eyebrows furrowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Who are you worried about?” Dong Li asked with a meaningful smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“That fool Li Ye is attending the Tool Sect’s assessment assembly, isn’t he?” Nie Tian said in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Li Ye?” Dong Li nodded. “Sure. Since the Death Reign is floating towards the Tool Sect’s headquarters, it will inevitably pass many volcanoes that the Tool Sect has provided for equipment forgers like Li Ye. But powerful experts from the Tool Sect will definitely try to intercept it to stop it from massacring those innocent people. Even if it turns out that the Tool Sect can’t stop the Death Reign, they’ll most likely tell the equipment forgers to return to Desolate City and leave via the inter-realm teleportation portal there.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Meanwhile, the defeated Tool Sect members would probably fall back to their headquarters and hole up behind their grand spell formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“However, I have a feeling that the reason why Zhao Shanling has returned and unleashed the Death Reign is because he wants to keep all of the powerful Tool Sect experts busy so that those people from the Flame God Sect will be able to gather earthflame essence uninterrupted. The turbulent situation is not going to last forever.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Anyway, we don’t need to worry too much.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Also, considering our unimpressive cultivation bases, I don’t think it will matter if we run into powerful experts from the Flame God Sect or Zhao Shanling. They probably won’t even spare us a glance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian and Dong Li lay on the ground next to each other. Looking up at the starry sky, they chatted idly, enjoying the rare moment of peace.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Deep into the night...</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">One of Nie Tian’s Heaven Eyes caught sight of two familiar figures dashing near the Bone Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He sprang to his feet and blurted, “How come they’re here?”</span></p>
