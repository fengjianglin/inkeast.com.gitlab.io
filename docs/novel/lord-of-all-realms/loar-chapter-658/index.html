 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The reason why Zhao Shanling had repeatedly agreed to help Nie Tian in the Domain of the Falling Stars was that he had hoped to use his puppet to achieve his goal in this unique realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Who would have known that the appearance of the Bone Blood Demon would trigger some restrictive spell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Now that he had lost this secret weapon, he instantly lost hope and wanted to get out of this place as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After all, the situation was different from the last time he had been here.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">There hadn’t been another soul in this place the last time he had come here. Even if he lost all of his spiritual power here, as long as he still had the ability to move, he would still be able to leave safely.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">But this time, not only were there people here, but they also seemed to have made thorough preparations for their operation, which made him very apprehensive.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The deep voice of a man came closer and closer. “Over there! They must be reinforcements from the Trisword Sect! I can’t believe that the Trisword Sect is so perseverant. They clearly didn’t make preparations as well as us, but they still send more teams here to fight us for Master Voidspirit’s legacies!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhao Shanling spun around and rushed towards the cluster of black light as soon as he heard the man.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, since he had lost all of his spiritual power, and had to rely on his fleshly strength now, his speed was far slower than his usual speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meanwhile, Nie Tian didn’t move in the slightest. Instead, he made an attempt to form Heaven Eyes with the power within the fragmentary stars in his soul, hoping to get ahold of the strength of the incoming group.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, for some reason, his Heaven Eyes wouldn’t form in this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Not only that, but he also discovered that he couldn’t even send his psychic awareness out of his mind to examine those people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It was as if his own fleshly body had become an shell that would isolate all psychic and soul fluctuations.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That was when he realized that not only would people lose all of their spiritual power soon after entering this special realm, but they also wouldn’t be able to use their psychic or soul power here.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That meant even the most powerful Qi warriors would descend to become commoners in this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">No wonder Zhao Shanling had turned around and sped off the moment he had realized that the Bone Blood Demon would trigger restrictions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After charging a significant distance towards the exit, Zhao Shanling noticed that Nie Tian was still standing there. Face twisting with anxiety, he shouted, “Why aren’t you moving, Nie Tian!? If you have a death wish, then don’t blame me for leaving you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, Zhao Shanling turned back and fled by himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Three figures arrived before Nie Tian, all of whom were rather young. There were two males and one female, all dressed in similar cyan battle garments.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A middle-aged man arrived shortly after the three of them, panting heavily as he did.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">From the look of it, the middle-aged man’s cultivation base was the highest, but since he had lost all of his spiritual power, he didn’t seem built to travel by solely relying on his fleshly body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Since Nie Tian couldn’t use his psychic awareness, he decided to explore a new path by trying to examine these people with his flesh power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the next moment, his eyes lit up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He, who carried a unique bloodline, quickly detected the copious amount of flesh power within the three youngsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though they all looked rather young, and their cultivation bases were unimpressive, they seemed to practice certain body refinement incantations.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The vigor of their fleshly bodies was far superior to that of their senior’s. If they were in the space disruption zone or any other realm, that middle-aged man’s battle prowess would be far higher than those youngsters combined.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">From what Nie Tian could tell, the intensity of those youngsters’ fleshly bodies was roughly at the same level as fourth grade spirit beasts or outsiders, which meant their battle prowess was still limited. Considering his vigorous flesh power, killing them would be as easy as turning his hand over. (Idiom: require no effort at all)</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The immensity of his flesh power compared to theirs was like a boundless ocean to a few puddles.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a cunning laugh, Nie Tian called out, “No so quickly, Senior Zhao. Watch me take care of them for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing these words, Zhao Shanling, who was already rather far from Nie Tian, jerked his head back, his eyes filled with doubt.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A tall, burly young man, who seemed to practice metal-related body refinement incantations, said, “Hmm? They’re not people from the Trisword Sect.” He had faint, golden skin, which made his muscles look very pronounced. He stood there unwavering like a piece of solid gold, as if nothing could shake him in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian suspected that the man had submerged and refined himself with a special liquid metal, which made his body much tougher than most Qi warriors, though his tough body would still not be able to withstand a single blow from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">WHOOSH!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian suddenly activated his flesh power, changing his aura entirely. It was as if he had rivers of flesh power surging inside of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As that happened, Nie Tian felt as if he was instantly given unlimited force, with which he could tear huge spirit beasts to pieces with his bare hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He lunged forward and violently slapped the man’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">CRACK! CRACK!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Every single one of the man’s bones shattered. Like a deflated balloon, the man collapsed to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhao Shanling, who was hesitating to trust Nie Tian, gasped with astonishment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Senior martial brother!” The other young man and woman screamed in grief upon seeing the man being annihilated by Nie Tian with a single strike.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The middle-aged man, who was standing behind them, was shocked to his core. He turned around and fled without saying a word.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a low chuckle, Nie Tian further activated his flesh power. Like an unchained beast, he charged a hundred meters to the man in the blink of an eye and drove his fist, which was wreathed in flesh aura, through the man’s back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the man’s corpse fell the ground, Nie Tian shook his head and muttered, “As long as you lose protection from your spiritual power, no matter how high your cultivation base is, you’re nothing but insects in my eyes.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The young woman’s voice trembled as she asked, “W-who are you? We, the Bliss Mountain Sect, discovered Master Voidspirit’s legacies. We’ve prepared for this operation for more than a hundred years, and have sent seven teams here already, we being the seventh team.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“We’ll even forgive you for what you’ve done if you get out now. Otherwise, you shall feel the full extent of our wrath!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Threatening in manner but cowardly at heart, the woman’s hand secretly reached into her cuff, as if she was trying to send messages to her friends.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian snorted disdainfully. “The Bliss Mountain Sect? I’ve never heard of it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">WHOOSH!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He once again blurred into action. He leaped into the air and swooped down on the young woman like an eagle on its prey.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Rise!” The young woman exclaimed as she hastily took out an animal bone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as she did, a faint, yellowish fleshly aura rose from the bone, forming a ward over her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Hmm. She can actually summon flesh power from that bone from a sixth grade spirit beast. But how much residual flesh power can there be in a single bone?” With curled lips and a cold smile, Nie Tian bombarded the layer of yellowish aura with his fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BOOM!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The faint yellow ward burst instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian stretched out his hands, and ten streaks of flesh aura shot out of his ten fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">POOH! POOH! POOH!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Like sharp blades, the ten streaks of flesh aura left ten bloody holes in the young woman’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She wobbled briefly before crashing heavily to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Without pausing for a moment, Nie Tian pounced on the last person, flesh aura rapidly gathering on his fingertips.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Don’t kill him yet!” Zhao Shanling shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Seeing that Nie Tian had killed three of them without breaking a sweat, Zhao Shanling finally felt relieved and started walking back towards Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The young man’s face was filled with horror as he said with a slight stutter, “You, you actually dare to…! We’ve already taken control of this heaven and earth created by Master Voidspirit. Don’t you imagine that you can leave alive!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BOOM!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The belt he was wearing around his waist was made of animal bones, all of which burst forth with rich flesh aura at this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Wisps of flesh aura rapidly came together, forming a misty, black ward that enveloped him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BZZZ!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, the black ward was instantly cut open by Nie Tian’s sharp, blade-like hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a few streaks of flesh aura, Nie Tian pierced through the man’s spiritual sea and severed the meridians in his limbs without effort.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Unable to move his legs or arms, and with his spiritual sea shattered, the man fell on his back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhao Shanling took his time to walk to him. Coming to a stop by the man, who was in agony, he slowly crouched down and took out a dagger, which he drove it into the man’s abdomen and started twisting, making him let out miserable wails.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I’ll ask you some questions. If you answer truthfully, I’ll give you a quick death.” With these words, Zhao Shanling took out a brown medicinal pill and stuffed it down the man’s throat. Then, he turned to Nie Tian and said, “The Bone Softening Pill will render him completely powerless. He won’t even have the strength to bite his own tongue to kill himself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Glaring at Zhao Shanling, the man said with a powerless voice, “You dare to kill disciples of the Bliss Mountain Sect! You’ll die for this!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Hahaha!” Zhao Shanling turned the dagger with a gruesome smile and said unhurriedly, “If you don’t cooperate, I’ll kill you by slicing a thousand pieces from you. You don’t know what I’m capable of yet, but it doesn’t matter. I have plenty of time. I’ll let you taste all of my torture methods.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, a few steel needles that were half a meter long appeared in Zhao Shanling’s hand. With a smile, he shoved them into the man’s body one after another.</span></p>
