 <p><span>Nie Tian was just about to say something when he found that Dong Baijie had already been dragged out of the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace by a mysterious force and was nowhere to be seen.</span></p>
 <p><span>SHEW!</span></p>
 <p><span>By that time, the piece of flesh that carried Dong Baijie’s Heaven Gate pattern had reached Nie Tian’s side and the hexagram inside of it immediately flew into the back of his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span>After receiving the hexagram, Nie Tian briefly examined it with his psychic power and saw that there were also numerous ancient symbols floating within it, just like the first part of the Fragmentary Star Incantation.</span></p>
 <p><span>All the ancient symbols were aligned in a perfect order, making it very easy and pleasant to read.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Middle part of the Fragmentary Star Incantation!” Nie Tian’s expression flickered. A hint of smile appeared at the corner of his mouth, and he no longer felt the pain from the numerous wounds covering his body.</span></p>
 <p><span>In order to obtain the first and middle part of the incantation, he had used up all of the three life-saving talismans and three Ice Blast Pearls that his master had given him.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, he had a feeling in his heart that compared to the incantation, all those were nothing.</span></p>
 <p><span>Due to Dong Baijie’s voluntary withdrawal, the Heaven stage area returned to peace.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian dropped to the ground, took out several pieces of spirit beast meat from his bracelet of holding and started munching in silence.</span></p>
 <p><span>While eating, the close to a dozen piercing wounds on his body still had blood flowing out of them.</span></p>
 <p><span>To prevent himself from bleeding out and dying, he had to treat the wounds and stop the bleeding as quickly as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span>He tried to draw spiritual power from his dantian’s spiritual sea and use it to heal his wounds.</span></p>
 <p><span>All of a sudden, he sensed that wisps of wood power that contained a thriving life aura swirled out of the vortex of wood power in his spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p><span>Not only that, unusually strong heartbeats echoed out from within his chest, as a valiant life force was suddenly born within his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span>The vigorous wood power and the life force infused into Nie Tian’s blood and flesh at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span>The two kinds of power that were somewhat similar to each other flowed rapidly within his blood vessels and meridians, before they soon converged on the bloody holes.</span></p>
 <p><span>In the next moment, all the puncture wounds stopped bleeding.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What!?” Flabbergasted, he looked down at a bloody hole on his arm, and saw that not only had it stopped bleeding, but there were even muscle fibers wiggling inside of the wound.</span></p>
 <p><span>Like a spacial rift that was about to close up, the messy wounds were healing and shrinking at a slow speed.</span></p>
 <p><span>As a matter of fact, since Nie Tian could see it with his eyes, the healing process was actually very fast.</span></p>
 <p><span>For commoners, if their flesh had been punctured, it would usually take weeks or even months to heal the wound.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, with the help of the wood power from his spiritual sea and the life force that originated from his heart, his wounds were healing at a speed that was many times faster than a normal person’s rate. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Those two kinds of power have sped up the healing of my wounds!” Nie Tian’s eyes lit up and his face was filled with excitement as he came to realize that his bloodline power, which wasn’t fully awakened yet, was much more mysterious and powerful than he had expected!</span></p>
 <p><span>Before long, he could no longer sense any pain from the wounds on his limbs and abdomen.</span></p>
 <p><span>FIZZ! FIZZ!</span></p>
 <p><span>It was at that moment that more starlight streamed out of the vast and boundless starry river in the ceiling of the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span>Dong Baijie’s withdrawal and the fact that he had left the middle part of the Fragmentary Star Incantation to Nie Tian seemed to have triggered a certain restrictive spell of the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span>Upon seeing more starlight falling out of the heavens, Nie Tian instantly grew excited, as he knew that he could channel it into his soul, along with the mysterious power it carried.</span></p>
 <p><span>Without any hesitation, he assumed the lotus position and used the secret magic that he had learned to attract the falling starlight.</span></p>
 <p><span>Soon, countless rays of starlight converged on him and streamed through the top of his head into his soul.</span></p>
 <p><span>A fourth fragmentary star gradually took shape within his soul.</span></p>
 <p><span>At that moment, Tang Yang’s voice rang out from within the Greater Heaven stage area. “You win, Ning Yang!” Face covered in blood, he cut the Heaven Gate pattern off of the back of his hand. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Soon after he cast the piece of flesh that carried his Heaven Gate pattern to the man he called Ning Yang, he was seized by a mysterious force and dragged out of the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span>As a result, Ning Yang, Su Lin’s martial uncle, was now the only one standing in the Greater Heaven stage area.</span></p>
 <p><span>After Tang Yang’s Heaven Gate pattern merged with his own, a hexagram imprinting gradually took shape in his Heaven Gate pattern, which stored the final part of the Fragmentary Star Incantation.</span></p>
 <p><span>Apparently, Ning Yang had also gone through a bloodbath to finally obtain the complete final part. Therefore, he looked somewhat weary at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span>Suddenly, he turned his head and caught sight of Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span>“It’s not Su Lin!!” After going blank for a moment, he frowned and carefully looked Nie Tian up and down.</span></p>
 <p><span>“It’s nor Dong Baijie, Wu Ling, or Xuan Ke...” Ning Yang was increasingly confused.</span></p>
 <p><span>After all, he had assumed that Su Lin would be the one to obtain the first part of the incantation. He had never doubted that.</span></p>
 <p><span>Although he wasn’t sure that Su Lin would be able to loot the middle part of the incantation from Dong Baijie, who he had assumed to be the winner of the Heave stage area, he had never expected that any other Lesser Heaven stage youngster had what it took to snatch the first part from Su Lin’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, looking at the unfamiliar young man sitting by himself in the Heaven stage area while no one could be seen in the Lesser Heaven stage, he had to accept the fact that he had obtained the first and middle part of the Fragmentary Star Incantation.</span></p>
 <p><span>He still couldn’t figure out how Nie Tian had achieved it.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, caught in confusion and frustration, he suddenly discovered the starlight that had been pouring out of the starry river above his head.</span></p>
 <p><span>He, who was currently in a bad shape, sat down on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span>He only briefly scanned the symbols within the hexagram with his psychic awareness before he understood the method to attract the starlight.</span></p>
 <p><span>Originally, all the starlight that fell out of the ceiling answered Nie Tian’s call and flowed towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, since Ning Yang started casting the newly-obtained spell, two thirds of the starlight started converging onto him.</span></p>
 <p><span>The drop in the amount of starlight Nie Tian received immediately drew his attention. His eyes snapped open and he looked over at the distant Ning Yang. His eyebrows furrowed.</span></p>
 <p><span>From the look of it, Ning Yang, who had forced Tang Yang to withdraw from the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace, was currently in a better condition than Dong Baijie back when he had finished his fights.</span></p>
 <p><span>Moreover, Ning Yang’s cultivation base was at the peak of the Greater Heaven stage!</span></p>
 <p><span>On the other hand, Nie Tian had already used up all the life-saving talismans and Ice Blast Pearls.</span></p>
 <p><span>With a cultivation base so significantly inferior, as audacious as he had been, Nie Tian didn’t dare go on a suicide mission by crossing the seven-colored river after seeing that Ning Yang’s condition wasn’t very bad.</span></p>
 <p><span>He was fairly certain that if he did cross the river, the chances of the Heaven Palace sect from the Realm of Mystic Heaven eventually collecting all three parts of the Fragmentary Star Incantation were quite high.</span></p>
 <p><span>With those thoughts in mind, he no longer looked at Ning Yang, but rather focused on attracting the starlight towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span>An unknown period of time passed.</span></p>
 <p><span>By the time that another fragmentary star was formed in his soul and started to shine brightly, he could no longer feel the existence of more starlight.</span></p>
 <p><span>He looked up and saw that the starry river was still profound and boundless.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was just that no more starlight fell out of it.</span></p>
 <p><span>He didn’t know why, but he had a feeling that a mysterious connection had been formed between the vast starry river and the four fragmentary stars in his soul.</span></p>
