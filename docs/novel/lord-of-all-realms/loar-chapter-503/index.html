<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The moment Dong Li caught sight of the Flame Star in Nie Tian’s hand, the smiles and excitement disappeared from her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">No matter how Nie Tian masked his face, the Flame Star wouldn’t lie. Therefore, she instantly saw through Nie Tian’s disguise.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, Nie Tian was still covered in countless spirit vermin, giving him a terrifying look. It was as if he were currently in tremendous pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li’s eyes suddenly reddened as her gorgeous face grew distorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Without much thought, she started summoning her black phoenix, hoping to kill Jin Lin within the shortest time possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, just as she was seized by rage and about to attack, Dong Baijie placed his hand on her shoulder. He shook his head and said, “Don’t!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Eyes filled with fury, she turned to look at her elder brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Baijie shook his head again and continued with a low voice, “Take a look around you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li, who was consumed by her anger, listened to her brother and glanced around with rapt attention. Immediately afterwards, she discovered the Poison Sect disciple’s corpses that were scattered around.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Apparently, they had all died at Nie Tian and Pei Qiqi’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In a casual manner, Dong Baijie pointed at Nie Tian and said with a faint smile, “Now look at him. He seems to be in a dangerous state, but those spirit vermin aren’t truly harming him at all. That cyan gecko has been struggling, wishing to escape, yet it’s tightly bound down by Nie Tian’s flesh. He’s not as miserable as he seems to be, and we don’t want to throw away our neutral relationship with the Poison Sect yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li calmed down as she also noticed the anomalies. Calling off the summoning of her black phoenix, she stared coldly at Jin Lin.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It seemed that as soon as the situation took a turn for the worse for Nie Tian, she would make her move, completely ignoring the relationship between the Dong Clan and the Poison Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qin Yan from the Water Moon Chamber of Commerce also took a glance at Nie Tian and Pei Qiqi. Her eyes widened as she quickly saw through Nie Tian’s disguise.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Since her great grandfather, Qin Yi, was close friends with Zhen Huilan, she had met Pei Qiqi in person a few times. Furthermore, she had learned from Dong Li that Nie Tian had earlier chosen to enter this dimension with Pei Qiqi instead of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Because of this, Dong Li had grumbled for quite a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though Nie Tian had assumed a different appearance, he was with Pei Qiqi and holding the Flame Star, which she was no stranger to. Because of this, she saw through to the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After glancing around and obtaining an overall understanding of the situation, she was increasingly taken aback. “I can’t believe that they’ve killed so many Poison Sect disciples with just the two of them!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After all, the scattered Poison Sect disciple’s corpses wouldn't lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Hmm?!" His attacks having missed, Nie Tian also noticed the approaching people from the Realm of a Hundred Battles as he watched Jin Lin slowly fall from midair.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He knew perfectly well that the Flame Star in his hand had probably already given away his real identity to Dong Li, Dong Baijie, and Qin Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Surprised by the arrival of the people from the Dong Clan and the Water Moon Chamber of Commerce, he temporarily put his attack on hold.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As surprised as Nie Tian was, Zhang Jiu from the Poison Sect exclaimed to himself, “The Dong Clan and the Water Moon Chamber of Commerce!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, he quickly called out to Dong Baijie and Qin Yan, “These two bastards have snuck up on and killed many members of my sect! If you can help us get rid of them, we’d be happy to share the mysteries of this floating continent with you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhang Jiu shouted these words as he ran from Pei Qiqi’s Ethereal Swords. The wounds he had briefly addressed earlier had burst open, and large amounts of blood spilled from them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Pei Qiqi, however, didn’t pay any attention to the arrival of the members of the Dong Clan and Water Moon Chamber of Commerce. She continued to rain her unending attacks on Sha Cheng, while multitasking by controlling her Ethereal Swords to chase after Zhang Jiu.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Baijie shook his head with a smile and said, “You wanna join forces with us? Sorry, members of my clan don’t join forces with losers. You had so many members on your team when you came for just the two of them, yet more than half of your team has ended up dead. You don’t deserve to be our allies. I suggest that you get out of here as soon as possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Reluctant to give up yet, Zhang Jiu turned to look at Qin Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qin Yan, who was a graceful beauty, pursed her lips into a smile as she shook her head at him, saying, “Don’t you know about my great grandfather’s friendship with Master Zhen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing these words, Zhang Jiu finally dropped the idea of acquiring assistance from them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Glancing at those from the Dong Clan and the Water Moon Chamber of Commerce, he realized that it wouldn’t be a wise choice to fight Nie Tian and Pei Qiqi to the death.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a moment of hesitation, he called out, gritting his teeth, “Let’s get out of here and report the situation back to Elder Lu Bai first!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Hard-pressed by Pei Qiqi’s unending attacks, Sha Cheng had long since given up on the idea of fighting to the death. Therefore, the moment he heard Zhang Jiu’s words, he dashed towards the edge of the floating continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After issuing the order, Zhang Jiu shot a nasty glance at Dong Baijie and Qin Yan and then also sped towards the edge of the continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Only Jin Lin seemed reluctant to leave after hearing Zhang Jiu’s exclamation. “It’s just the two of them, and none of their seniors are around. Why don’t we finish them off now?! I don’t believe that these people from the Dong Clan and the Water Moon Chamber of Commerce dare to make our entire sect their enemy!” He intended to fight to the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“If you’re so eager to die, be my guest.” With these words, Zhang Jiu sped away, not sparing Jin Lin another glance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Sha Cheng adopted the same attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Seeing Zhang Jiu and Sha Cheng dashing into the distance, Jin Lin let out angry roars, yet didn’t have any other feasible options.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With just his own strength, there was no way he could beat Pei Qiqi and Nie Tian together. Watching Zhang Jiu and Sha Cheng fading into the distance, he reluctantly sped after them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“You’re not going anywhere,” Pei Qiqi said coldly as she chased after Jin Lin.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian realized what she intended to do, and thus planned to dash over and cooperate with her to kill Jin Lin. However, Pei Qiqi’s voice rang out. “I’ll kill him myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The moment she uttered these words, a net that glowed with silver light suddenly flew out of her ring of holding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Every intersection of the net shone with dazzling, mysterious light and emanated subtle but powerful spatial fluctuations, as if every intersection was a small spatial joint that was connected to unknown dimensions and realms.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Furthermore, a strong gravitational force seemed to be born from within the unstable spatial joints, as if the mere contact with the net would suck the object into some turbulent space.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The name of the net was Thousand Prisons. It was forged by Zhen Huilan and given to Pei Qiqi as a gift. She hadn’t used it until now because her cultivation base hadn’t allowed her to use it, but since she had achieved a series of breakthroughs before this trip and recently derived some enlightenment from the outsider’s bloodline power, she was finally able to unleash the Thousand Prisons.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as the Thousand Prisons flew out, it instantly spread out. Blocking out the sky, it flew after Jin Lin like it had locked onto him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian’s expression flickered as he looked up at the wondrous Thousand Prisons.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">For some reason, even though he knew that it was pursuing Jin Lin and not him, he couldn’t help but feel slightly afraid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This spiritual tool, which he had never seen Pei Qiqi use before, was apparently more mysterious and mighty than the Ethereal Swords that she normally used.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Watching the Thousand Prisons fly after Jin Lin, he seemed to know that Jin Lin would die beyond the shadow of a doubt.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these thoughts in mind, he stopped worrying for Pei Qiqi, but rather came to a stop and started to drain the numerous spirit vermin on him of their flesh power and life force with his bloodline talent, Life Drain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A faint smile appeared on his face as his cold gazed landed on the cyan gecko that belonged to Jin Lin.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the next moment, several wisps of flesh power drilled into its body, causing the life-spirit vermin to struggle even harder and let out even more frequent miserable screeches.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The gecko, which was biting into his neck, rapidly shriveled and lost all its life force.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As that happened, Jin Lin’s scream echoed out from the distance. Apparently, he had suffered a severe backlash from the death of the cyan gecko, and Pei Qiqi took advantage of the opportunity to inflict another strong blow on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Increasingly relaxed, Nie Tian focused on absorbing flesh power from the numerous spirit vermin on him, watching them fall to the ground one after another as he did.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Off to the side, the Greater Heaven stage members of the Dong Clan and the Water Moon Chamber of Commerce watched him without making a sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After remaining silent for quite some time, Qin Yan turned to those who had come with her and said, “Alright, let’s spread out and search. See if we can find anything noteworthy or anyone else on this continent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though the Greater Heaven members of the Water Moon Chamber of Commerce had many questions in their hearts, they followed her instructions and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a grin, Dong Baijie turned to Dong Kang and said, “Why don’t you take a look around, cousin? Little Li and I got things covered here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Sure.” Dong Kang, who was at the late Greater Heaven stage, was an extended member of the Dong Clan. Even though his cultivation base was slightly higher than Dong Baijie’s and Dong Li’s, he knew perfectly well that his status in the clan was far from being as high as that of the brother-sister pair. Thus, he left as he was bid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Seeing that Dong Baijie, Dong Li, and Qin Yan were the only ones left in this area, Nie Tian finally cleared his throat and said, “I didn’t expect to see you guys so soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Baijie laughed wildly as he said, “That was quite impressive. It’s hard to believe that just the two of you managed to kill so many Poison Sect disciples.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“That was all thanks to Senior Martial Sister Pei’s extraordinary battle skills,” Nie Tian said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qin Yan stepped to Dong Li’s side as she bumped her in the shoulder and said in a low and taunting voice, “Why are you not talking now that that ‘bastard’ is right before you? Just now, I saw that you were so worried about him that you were actually going to rip off your friendly mask and attack those from the Poison Sect. That was so not like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian took a quick glance at Dong Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She, who had restored her actual appearance, possessed unmatched beauty, as if her watery bright eyes could easily capture any man’s soul.</span></p>
