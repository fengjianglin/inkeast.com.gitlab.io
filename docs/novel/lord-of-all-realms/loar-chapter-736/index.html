<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Together, there were more than twenty Greater Heaven stage and Worldly realm cultivators from the three parties. Many of their air-transportation spiritual tools were damaged.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All of them were injured to different extents. Some seemed to be in critical condition, as they lay in their air-transportation spiritual tools like dying men.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Conspicuous wounds could also be seen in Yin Yanan’s exposed tanned skin.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Xing Beichen from the Trisword Sect was the only one at the early Profound realm. His face grew icy as soon as he saw Nie Tian. “It’s him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Chu Bowen and the others also had unpleasant expressions, as if none of them wanted to see Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Ignoring them, Nie Tian turned to Qiao Yunxi and asked, “What happened?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qiao Yunxi’s aura was rather weak, and the light in her eyes was also dimmer than before.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian could sense significant spiritual power consumption from her, and thus knew they must have gone through a fierce battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“What happened to the crystal between your eyebrows?!” Qiao Yunxi exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, Yin Yanan also noticed the change, her gem-like eyes fixed on the spot between Nie Tian’s eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The two of them had cursed Nie Tian when they had parted ways, saying that he would definitely be possessed by the Phantasm soul and become its puppet.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Who would have thought now that they met again, not only was he not possessed by the Phantasm soul, but the prismatic crystal between his eyebrows was also somehow gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian smiled and said with an easy tone, “Oh, you’re talking about that Phantasm soul, right? I took care of it. It won’t be a problem anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qiao Yunxi was shocked. “How did you do that?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Hahaha.” Nie Tian laughed, but didn’t say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Let’s get out of here and not waste anymore time on this man,” Chu Bowen from the Chu Clan said with a grim face. “Those Stonemen are still pursuing us. They’ll catch up to us if we stay here for too long.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian was taken aback. “Stonemen?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“We got in contact with the others soon after parting ways with you, but...” Qiao Yunxi said with a bitter expression. “They turned out to be in a worse state than us. They ran into outsiders. Senior Wei Yu from the Trisword Sect was killed by Demons. Senior Chu Xuanji was also badly wounded. Their Profound realm and Soul realm members fought the outsiders with their lives to cover us while we escaped.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qiao Yunxi went on and briefly explained what had happened after their separation with Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">From her, Nie Tian learned that it had been more than a month since their parting.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">During this time, the girls had reestablished contact with the others from the three parties.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, by the time they had met up with Xing Beichen, Chu Bowen, and the others, they had been on the run from the outsiders.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As it turned out, the members of three parties had been resting on a floating meteor when Demons and Stonemen had suddenly showed up and started killing them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Before that, Wei Yu had been seriously injured by Nie Tian and lost much of his vital energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Therefore, he had lacked battle prowess during his battle against the outsiders, and ended up being bombarded to death.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Chu Xuanji, on the other hand, had led the other Soul realm and Profound realm experts into battle against the Demons and Stonemen, so that Xing Beichen, Chu Bowen, and their weaker members could evacuate safely.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Xing Beichen and Chu Bowen had managed to leave the battlefield with their weaker members, but the Stonemen had pursued them unyieldingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even after joining up with Qiao Yunxi and Yin Yanan, the Stonemen had caught up to them a few times, and they had lost some people in battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At the beginning, the Stonemen pursuers had been as strong as them, and they had been able to put up a fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">But later, sixth grade Stonemen had joined the pursuit, as they seemed to have withdrawn from their battle against Chu Xuanji and the other human experts, which had put them under tremendous pressure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Fortunately, they had been able to escape with the help of their air-transportation spiritual tools. Otherwise, they would have been wiped out by the Stonemen already.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After learning about what had happened, Nie Tian looked shocked. “I heard that people from your domain have connections with those outsiders. Why were they so eager to kill you upon encountering you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qiao Yunxi snorted coldly. “Our so-called connections are limited to spiritual material trade, which is very fragile and can be thrown away at any moment.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Why are you still wasting your breath with him?!” Chu Bowen asked with an unpleasant expression. “If it weren’t for him, we wouldn’t have been so easily defeated by the outsiders!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The disciples of the Trisword Sect and the Beast-controlling Sect also fixed Nie Tian with angry glares as they chimed in one after another.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“If he hadn’t badly injured Senior Wei Yu and killed Senior Hong Xian and most of our Soul realm experts, we wouldn’t have had to fear those Demons and Stonemen at all!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“That’s right! It’s all because of him that we’re in such a difficult situation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“He’s the one who caused this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Face icy, Nie Tian didn’t feel the need to explain. Instead, he said to Qiao Yunxi, “You can stay with me. And the others can fuck off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qiao Yunxi was the person from the Divine Flame Sect who had been charged with the task of bringing him to Yue Yanxi.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yue Yanxi had treated him well. Plus, Qiao Yunxi hadn’t truly offended him. Therefore, he wanted to keep her safe.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Didn’t you say that we should go on our separate ways?” Qiao Yunxi sounded still disgruntled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian smiled faintly. “I only parted ways with you because I needed to focus on taking care of the Phantasm soul. I don’t have a problem with you. You didn’t try to harm me or anything. Now that I’ve gotten rid of the Phantasm soul, I can keep you safe again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“What about them?” Qiao Yunxi asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian shot a cold look at Xing Beichen, Chu Bowen, and the others. “Their safety has nothing to do with me. They can live and die on their own.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qiao Yunxi fell silent, fiery light flowing in the depths of her eyes, as if she was pondering the matter.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She assumed that Nie Tian would still be able to merge with his Bone Blood Demon and display unmatched battle prowess.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">According to Xing Beichen and Chu Bowen, there weren’t any eighth grade experts among the Demons and Stonemen they had encountered. Considering the shocking battle prowess the Bone Blood Demon had displayed before, she was convinced that Nie Tian did have the ability to keep her safe.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, she didn’t know that Nie Tian was actually thinking of protecting her through another method.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Listen to me, disciples of the Beast-controlling Sect,” Yin Yanan suddenly called out. “We’ll take a break on this meteor. Do you best to recover your strength.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Riding the Frost Blood Python, she was the first to descend on the meteor Nie Tian was on, and started recovering with spirit stones and medicinal pills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though the disciples of the Beast-controlling Sect didn’t quite understand the reason behind this, they did as they were bid and also landed, and started treating their wounds and recovering their strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Chu Bowen was taken aback. “What are you doing, Sister Yanan?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Without even looking at Nie Tian, Yin Yanan said with a composed expression, “That bastard is here too. If the Stonemen pursue us to this meteor, he’ll have to do something. That puppet of his is more than capable of killing all of the Stonemen pursuers for us. We’ll just stick closely with him and see what he’ll do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The eyes of the disciples of the three parties lit up upon hearing her words, realizing that this was actually a good idea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A hint of a smile appeared on Qiao Yunxi’s face, as she also felt that Yin Yanan’s rascally approach might actually help them get rid of the pursuing Stonemen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They all assumed that Nie Tian’s Bone Blood Demon would still be able to display the same terrifying battle prowess as before.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Only Nie Tian knew that their assumption was wrong.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">One air-transportation spiritual tool after another landed on the meteor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The members of the three parties clamored as they either treated the injured or recovered with spirit stones and medicinal pills, none of them paying any attention to Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Have you forgotten that I said that I’ll kill you all?” Nie Tian suddenly asked with an icy tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Xing Beichen and the others’ expressions instantly flickered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It didn’t matter whether they were recovering or healing the injured, they all froze and fixed Nie Tian with vigilant gazes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Like an enrage female beast, Yin Yanan leapt in front of Nie Tian in the blink of an eye. Fury filling her face, she said, “Come on then! Kill me now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qiao Yunxi hastily rushed over and called out as she did, “Nie Tian! Don’t do it!” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Face ice-cold, Yin Yanan looked right into Nie Tian’s eyes. Even her well-built body trembled slightly with emotion. “I helped you twice when that Phantasm soul attempted to possess you. Let’s see whether you’re going to kill the person who saved you!” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Seeing her sticking her neck out, Nie Tian recalled when her soul awareness had flew into his mind to help him fight the Phantasm soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His heart grew soft.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He let out a sigh and asked with a somewhat reluctant expression, “How many Stonemen are chasing you, and what grade are they at?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His original plan was to only keep Qiao Yunxi by his side. With Life Stealth, he would be able to mask their flesh auras.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Stonemen weren’t skilled in soul magics. They could normally only scan their surroundings by detecting flesh auras.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As long as they hid in that hole and masked their flesh auras, the Stonemen wouldn’t be able to sense their presence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, now that Yin Yanan and the others were also staying with him, he had to think of another way.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The fact that he asked about the number and grade of the Stonemen pursuers was because he wanted to know whether they would be able to fight them with their current strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Most of them are at the fifth grade,” Qiao Yunxi hastily answered. &nbsp;“Only two or three are at the sixth grade. The only two seventh grade Stonemen experts are fighting Chu Xuanji and the other seniors. So you should be able to take them out with the help of your puppet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Three sixth grade Stonemen...” Nie Tian muttered to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Sixth grade outsiders were as powerful as Profound realm human experts. Even though the Bone Blood Demon only had ten percent of its strength left and couldn’t merge with him again, it wouldn’t be very difficult for it to kill them by just relying on its remaining strength and its solid body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Stonemen’s flesh aura was much more vigorous than that of humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">By killing them, the Bone Blood Demon would be able to refine their blood to replenish its flesh power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yin Yanan was at the late Worldly realm. Xing Beichen was at the early Profound realm. The others’ cultivation bases weren’t very low either. They would be able to handle the less powerful Stonemen to shoulder some of the pressure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As long as they could win this battle, the Bone Blood Demon would be able to recover strength with the dead Stonemen’s blood, while he would be able to absorb their remaining flesh power with Life Drain to satisfy his bloodline aura’s endless desire.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these thoughts in mind, he finally made a decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Alright, let’s wait for the Stonemen pursuers,” Nie Tian said loudly. “But I want to be clear on one thing: I won’t take any of their valuables after the battle, but I’ll take their bodies.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Deal!” Qiao Yunxi said decisively.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian shot a glance at Yin Yanan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yin Yanan let out a cold snort. “You’ll be our main battle force. Their corpses are yours as long as we win.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Good.”</span></p>
