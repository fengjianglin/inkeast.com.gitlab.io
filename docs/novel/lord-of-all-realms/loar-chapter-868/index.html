<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The ceiling of the spacious cave was riddled with holes that were the size of a baby’s arms. Strange vines that seemed to be made of muscle fibers grew out of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">On the end of the vines grew peculiar emerald berries that contained extremely rich flesh power and wood power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A faint green shield could be seen separating the top area of the cave from the fighting humans and outsiders below.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, both humans and outsiders turned to look at the green berries from time to time in the middle of their fierce battles.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Clearly, those berries were the reason why these humans and outsiders were engaged in fierce battles.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as Nie Tian entered this spacious part of the cave, his bloodline power became unusually active, as if the emerald berries that were the size of fists had a strong appeal to his unique bloodline.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Gazing at the berries, he unleashed his soul awareness to examine them, and rapidly found out that they seemed to have a similar medicinal efficacy as Fruits of Life, but less powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Back in the day, he had obtained several Fruits of Life in the Realm of Unbounded Desolation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had accidentally absorbed the power of one Fruit of Life, which had accelerated the upgrade of his bloodline.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Later, he had given the rest of the Fruits of Life to Hua Mu and Wu Ji so that they could gain extra years and solve the lifespan problem they had faced.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If these berries contained similar flesh auras to Fruits of Life, this meant they would also be very helpful for the development of his bloodline.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meanwhile, since they contained mysterious life force and could help extend lifespans, they were very valuable to both outsiders and humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Through obtaining more life power, outsiders could upgrade their bloodlines, and awaken new bloodline talents.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had derived this enlightenment from the Frost Blood Python and coexisting flowers’ strong desire for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As for humans, these berries that contained life power were even more valuable to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Unlike outsiders, humans’ lifespans were significantly shorter. If they could extend their lifespans with these berries, then they wouldn’t have to walk their paths of cultivation worrying day and night that they would die of old age because they didn’t make breakthroughs fast enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Perhaps this was the reason why these humans and outsiders were fighting each other to the death.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yin Yanan gave a sarcastic chuckle. “There are quite a few familiar faces here.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Froste, Pergson, Gutas, Luo Hui from the Heavenly Witchcraft Sect, and that young man who tried to set us up...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian had been intrigued by the change of his bloodline aura, and thus had focused on the emerald berries on the ceiling of the cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Only after hearing her words did he take a close look at the fighting crowd, and discover that there were indeed quite a few acquaintances among them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Aside from Luo Hui from the Heavenly Witchcraft Sect and the young man who had killed his companions and tried to pulled the same scheme on them, he also saw Chai Longge and Chai Fengwu.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As for outsiders, he saw Froste, Pergson, and Gutas, as well as the Fiend who had escaped from them earlier, Billy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">What surprised Nie Tian the most was that he even saw a few other familiar faces: Sylon the Fiend, Armes the Phantasm, and Tago the Demon...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Years ago, he had traveled through one of six spatial rifts in the Realm of Split Void to a mysterious dimension composed of two paralleled continents. He had fought the three of them on two islands there.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They had also joined an invasion of the Domain of the Falling Stars led by Basto, but had fled upon hearing of Basto’s death.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had never expected that he would meet them again in the Shatter Battlefield after so many years.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“It’s you!” Armes called out, while he and Froste were teaming up against a few human Qi warriors.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this point, Armes had already upgraded from the fourth grade to the fifth grade, his battle prowess improving significantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon seeing Nie Tian, he instantly left his opponents and dashed towards Nie Tian, his eyes reddening with hatred.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Bloodline magic! Soul Burning Seals!” With his soul power and Blood Essence, he formed clusters of ghostly flames, which floated directly towards Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Years ago, he had only been able to unleash three clusters of ghostly flames, but now he was able to unleash eight of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The soul power within each of the eight clusters of ghostly flames was also much more intense than when he had first met and fought Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian’s image appeared in the prismatic crystal between Armes’s eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He locked Nie Tian down at the first possible moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Armes! Get back here!!” Froste shouted with an anxious look on his face. “You can’t handle him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Outsiders had a strict hierarchy among their numerous clans. Froste’s clan was much loftier and more powerful than Armes’. This time, like many other Phantasms, Armes had come as a regular team member, who had to take orders from Froste.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing his words, Armes instantly grew vigilant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He knew Froste wouldn’t have said that without a good reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Soul Burning Seals again...” Nie Tian’s face split into a grin as he jumped into the spacious cave and unleashed Starchains.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">One after another, Starchains that could only be detected by soul power flew out of Nie Tian’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Carrying profound power from his star souls, they slammed into the Soul Burning Seals Armes had formed with his Blood Essence. In the next moment, all eight of them exploded like glorious fireworks and vanished into thin air.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Armes’ expression flickered drastically.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had never expected Nie Tian to have become so powerful after just a few years.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Now that he had entered the fifth grade, his strength was roughly equal to that of a Worldly realm human cultivator. When he had first seen Nie Tian, he had been convinced that he was at the Worldly realm, judging from the tainted energies around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Normally, it would take human cultivators less time to progress in their cultivation than outsiders.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Plus, he knew that Nie Tian was a disciple of the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace. Given their profound reserve power, it wasn’t surprising at all that he had advanced to the Worldly realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">What surprised him was that the amount of tainted energies gathered around Nie Tian soared as he leapt towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The amount of tainted energies around someone was determined by his or her strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Therefore, he sensed danger as soon as he saw tainted energies building up around Nie Tian at an alarming rate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All of a sudden, Nie Tian activated Life Strengthening, and flashed to Armes in a split second with a Starshift.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He clenched his fist and unleashed Titan’s Wrath.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Raging flesh power instantly bore down on Armes, along with devastating flame power and pure spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BOOM!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Armes’ body immediately blew up like a ripe watermelon that was dropped to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Mangled flesh filling the air, Armes died an instant, violent death.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian shook his head and muttered, “A fifth grade Phantasm like you is far too weak for me now...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">To unleash this furious strike, he had only summoned a small amount of flesh power, flame power, and pure spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In his eyes, such a strike could only be viewed as a warm-up procedure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, Armes, whom he had fought in a well-matched battle years ago, actually exploded after taking such a strike.</span></p>
 <p><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“My bloodline has upgraded six times, allowing me to awaken six bloodline talents. So by comparing our bloodline power alone, I’m already stronger than him. Then, I summoned different powers to unleash Titan’s Wrath. With such power, killing the fifth grade Armes was indeed as easy as blowing away a speck of dust.”&nbsp;</span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">(Idiom: very little effort)</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these thoughts in mind, he grinned and flashed to Sylon the Fiend and Tago the Demon successively, where he unleashed Titan’s Wrath two more times.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BANG! BANG!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Sylon and Tago also exploded instantly without even putting up a fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian shook his head repeatedly as he sighed and muttered, “Weak, far too weak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Back when we first met on that island, any of you could put me in great trouble. But now you’ve become so fragile that you can’t handle a single strike from me. Killing you is so easy that I don’t even enjoy it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, he went on and activated a few more short-range Starshifts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As he flashed back and forth between places, several outsiders who he found familiar exploded one by one.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Gutas’ eyebrows knotted as he watched Tago, who was also a Demon, being reduced to bits of flying flesh. Then, he called out to Froste, “Froste, that man has become even stronger than when we last saw him!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Not long ago, he had been invited to a joint attack targeting Nie Tian. Back then, Nie Tian’s bloodline had been at the fifth grade.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even if he had unleashed his bloodline power, it wouldn’t have been so overwhelmingly powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Not to mention, Nie Tian hadn’t used a shred of his bloodline power to fight them back then. All he had used was the Bone Blood Demon, the Spirit Pearl, and his spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“He’s not a normal human, but a hybrid!” Froste said with a very grim expression. “It’s just that I can’t seem to identify the bloodline he carries.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A few outsiders close to him heard him, their expression flickering drastically. “A hybrid!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">These outsiders from ancient clans had long since heard that several formidable human sects like the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace had attempted to make hybrids of humans and outsiders for a very long time now. Their purpose was to steal the outsiders’ powerful bloodline power in order to solve the humans’ lifespan problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Therefore, the existence of hybrids in those powerful human sects was already no secret.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, most of the hybrids turned out to be failures, and even less accomplished than normal humans. Those who actually gained long lifespans and tough bodies were as rare as phoenix feathers and qilin horns.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Who would have thought they would actually run into a successful hybrid in a cave in the Bloody Grave Mountain Range?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“This is a bit tricky now,” Froste muttered softly in the outsiders’ language, but didn’t seem very worried. “But being powerful is a very complicated thing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, he gave Pergson a sideways glance and asked, “How about you go take care of him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Pergson the Bonebrute was fighting the young man who had planned to set up Nie Tian and the girls. He had gained control of the situation, as his death power had already infiltrated into the fan-wielding young man’s flesh and blood, making him struggle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing Froste’s words, Pergson ended his battle against the young man in an unhurried fashion. Then, he laid his eyes on Nie Tian and said in the outsiders’ language, “Sure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the human language, he said to Nie Tian, “You’ll be no match for me here. Although, I’ve got to admit that you’re a good fighter. In fact, you might have a chance at beating me if I didn’t have my Bone Shatterer. But as long as I have it, you’d better run.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Pergson was well-aware that Nie Tian’s Bone Blood Demon would be limited to a large extent if they were to fight in this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">First of all, the Bone Blood Demon was too large to move about freely in the cave. Secondly, its vigorous flesh power would make it suffer from a tremendous amount of tainted energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Besides, his Bone Shatterer had an innate subduing effect on the Bone Blood Demon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Therefore, his confidence was well-founded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Go help him, Han Sen!” A resounding voice suddenly echoed out. It was a man in golden garments, who was now gazing coldly at the young man who practiced lightning power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">From the look of it, he wasn’t fond of the young man either, but considering the situation, all the humans had to band together.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Han Sen he referred to was none other than the vicious young man who had been fighting Pergson and failing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, he was driving death power out of himself in silence, hoping that Nie Tian would take care of Pergson for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He was clearly unhappy to do as he was told, but he still dragged his reluctant steps towards Nie Tian, while muttering, “Why always me...”</span></p>
