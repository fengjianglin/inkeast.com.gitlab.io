<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li, who had been curled up in a fancy chair, suddenly sprang to her feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the somewhat dimly-lit room, her eyes gradually lit up like two gems under a harsh light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She hadn’t put on any makeup, yet she still looked radiant and charming.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Where did he go?” Han Mu asked with a grim expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“He went towards the east with a young woman just now,” The man answered respectfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a moment of pondering, Dong Li waved her hand, gesturing for the man to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The man bowed again and rapidly backed out of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Miss, young master seems to attach great importance to Nie Tian. He not only gave him those Star Stones, but also a mask which had been in his collection for years.” Han Mu weighed over his selection of words as he continued, “I know he ruined your plans in the Void Illusion Mountain Range, but young master made it clear that we should not seek trouble with him...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li let out a cold snort and blurted coldly, “These are different times! Back when we were in the Realm of Split Void, the three major spatial rifts were still yet to be sealed. &nbsp;He was the key to that. Every sect in the Realm of Flame Heaven, the Realm of Mystic Heaven, and the Realm of a Thousand Devastations had placed all of their hopes in him, since he was the one with all the fragmentary star marks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“But the spatial rifts are all sealed now. He’s not as valuable as he was before.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Furthermore, no one has seen Ning Yang anywhere, yet Ning Yang’s fragmentary star mark ended up in Nie Tian’s hands. He might have killed Ning Yang for it, who knows?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Originally, if he behaved obediently and joined the Heaven Palace Sect, he would have been under the Heaven Palace Sect’s protection. Even if he came to the Realm of a Hundred Battles, our clan would have to give face to the Heaven Palace Sect and keep our hands off him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“However, he happened to turn the Heaven Palace Sect down!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a brief pause, Dong Li raised her voice. “Now that he doesn’t have the Heaven Palace Sect to back him, why should we be afraid of him or the puny Cloudsoaring Sect?!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Sure, he might have already merged those three fragmentary star marks with his flesh and blood, and we won’t be able to strip them away from him. But if we can capture him alive and imprison him in the Dong Clan, I’m sure we’ll come up with ways to force him to write down the profound knowledge recorded in them for us.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Secret powerful magics are recorded in those fragmentary star marks. If our clan can gain those legacies secretly, given a little time, we might soon rise to prominence, and become the most powerful Qi warrior force in the Domain of the Falling Stars. We may even stand up to the Heaven Palace Sect as equals!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing her words, Han Mu was slightly swayed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Aside from all that, he dared to sabotage my operations in the Realm of Split Void. Now that he’s come to my turf, how can I let him off so easy?” The thought of how Nie Tian had humiliated her in the Realm of Split Void made Dong Li fume with anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As a member of the Dong Clan, she couldn’t do whatever she liked in the Dong Clan’s territory. Therefore, she could only go to the Realm of Split Void, where the environment was much more violent and unruly, so that she could temper herself with an identity as a Hunter.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Every senior in the Dong Clan had secretly kept close watch on her behavior in the Realm of Split Void.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Whether or not she could rise to a lofty position in the Dong Clan in the future had depended on her resourcefulness.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At first, she had done well in the Realm of Split Void. She had continuously accumulated fame and fortune. Even the subordinates she had brought with her had become stronger and stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, Nie Tian had come along, ruined her operations in the dense forest in the Void Illusion Mountain Range, and made her suffer great losses.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Later, as she had mobilized the other Hunter organizations to hunt Nie Tian down, she had suffered more defeats. Word of her repeated failures soon found its way to the seniors in her clan. Those who had placed huge hopes in her had felt deeply disappointed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even her own father came to talk to her in private, blaming her for not handling the situation well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In her eyes, this was all because of Nie Tian!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Now that Nie Tian actually dared to come to the Realm of a Hundred Battles, and even appear in the Dong Clan’s territory, she would never let the opportunity slip away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“What’s your plan, Miss?” Han Mu asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I’ve just entered the Greater Heaven stage and obtained a spiritual tool that suits me. It’s about time I stretched my legs.” Dong Li stepped towards a desk and started making adjustments to her appearance under Han Mu’s gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Moments later, she turned around with an ordinary-looking face, as if she had become someone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“We witnessed what Nie Tian was capable of in the Realm of Split Void.” Han Mu said with a prudent attitude. “I don’t think you should go by yourself. It won’t be safe.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“This is the Dong Clan. I have all the resources I need,” Dong Li said confidently. “As long as I can find him and get close to him, I will be able to capture him alive without attracting others’ attention.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian had no idea that the mask he had received as a gift from Dong Baijie had already exposed his identity, let alone the fact that Dong Li had already locked onto him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Since he and Luo Xin left the Dong Clan, the two of them had been marching at a fast pace.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Considering there was a large amount of human activity within a 50 kilometer radius around the Dong Clan, not many spirit beasts could be seen in the area.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, as they marched out of that safe circle into the boundless heaven and earth, they went deeper and deeper into the spirit beasts’ feeding area.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They would constantly come across bloodstained skeletons along their way, which had apparently belonged to humans. Dried blood could also be seen on the ground every now and then.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">When spirit beasts attacked and killed human Qi warriors, they would usually eat all of their flesh and pick the bones clean.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, when humans slaughtered spirit beasts, they would gather everything, including the spirit beasts’ flesh, bones and even internal organs, because every part of the powerful spirit beasts in this region could be used as rare spiritual materials.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As they marched deeper into the wild, Nie Tian finally understood why people said the Realm of a Hundred Battles was a paradise for spirit beasts, and that the four forces, including the Dong Clan, had only explored one tenth of the total land.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The reason was that there were simply too many spirit beasts in the Realm of a Hundred Battles, and a large proportion of them were high grade, powerful ones.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They encountered several groups of human Qi warriors along their way. What they saw and heard were usually the images and sounds of Qi warriors being slaughtered by spirit beasts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They seldom witnessed humans killing spirit beasts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Bent on getting to the forest of stone needles as soon as possible, Nie Tian unleashed his seven Heaven Eyes and used them to scan his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Every one or two kilometers, they would capture images of spirit beasts. However, those spirit beasts were very different from the ones in the Realm of Split Void.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The majority of the spirit beasts in the Realm of Split Void had died after their spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth had been tainted. Those that had survived had preferred to travel alone, rather than in herds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, most of the time, Nie Tian discovered here via his Heaven Eyes that spirit beasts of the same species tended to travel in groups.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Since they foraged together, once they encountered human Qi warriors, they would usually outnumber them, and thus have upper hand from the beginning. Humans usually ended up being the losing and fleeing side.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Fortunately, thanks to his Heaven Eyes, Nie Tian was able to avoid them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Therefore, Luo Xin followed him, and their journey turned out to be rather smooth and peaceful. They managed to arrive in the forest of stone needles without running into any powerful spirit beast herds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon their arrival, Nie Tian scanned the vicinity via his Heaven Eyes, and noticed that the so-called forest of stone needles was located in a mountain valley.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The strangely-shaped stone needles were actually huge rocks that had fallen from the lofty mountain peaks on the perimeter of the valley due to frequent earthquakes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Stone needles that were easily dozens of meters high almost filled the entire mountain valley. Noticeable bloodstains could be seen on some of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian scanned the vicinity via his Heaven Eyes, and soon noticed that a team of Qi warriors was in a corner of the mountain valley.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They seemed to have just survived a fierce battle against a powerful spirit beast, and luckily, they turned out to be the winning side.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, they were cutting the spirit beast’s corpse up with sharp knives.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, not much excitement and elation could be seen on their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Someone was even sobbing, standing next to the body of a man who seemed to have been on their team.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I’ve detected a group of people. Let’s go and ask them.” With these words, Nie Tian led Luo Xin directly towards the group’s location.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Having traveled together for so long, Luo Xin had long since gotten used to Nie Tian issuing orders.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The fact that they hadn’t encountered any herds of powerful spirit beasts under Nie Tian’s guidance made Luo Xin realize that Nie Tian must have some unique way of steering clear of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She was curious about his method, yet she enjoyed having Nie Tian make the decisions so that she wouldn’t need to worry about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It wasn’t long before the two of them arrived at the group’s location.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon seeing Nie Tian and Luo Xin’s sudden appearance from behind huge, pointy stones, the six survivors were instantly alarmed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The four of them who had been harvesting parts from the spirit beast also stopped their work, and quietly turned the knives they were using to cut the spirit beast towards Luo Xin and Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A tall, middle Greater Heaven stage Qi warrior let out a cold harrumph as he berated the sobbing young woman, “Would you stop already?! You knew very well that any of us could die out here. I made sure you knew that before you came on board! Now Little Yi died today. I might die tomorrow. The same goes for you!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“We’re not from those powerful Qi warrior sects with long histories. Since we chose the path of cultivation, we have no one but ourselves to depend on!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">From the look of it, the pitiful young woman and the passed Little Yi had been a couple.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After being berated by the man, she struggled to hold her tears back, but her shoulders couldn’t stop trembling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“How can we help you?” The middle Greater Heaven stage man took a glance at Nie Tian and Luo Xin. Seeing that Luo Xin, the stronger of the two, was only at the early Greater Heaven stage, he put his mind at ease and said with a slow pace, “Spirit beasts can be found everywhere in the Realm of a Hundred Battles. Anyone is welcome to hunt and kill them, as long as they can.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“However, if you two want to snatch the spoils from our hands, you don’t seem to be strong enough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The atmosphere in the Realm of a Hundred Battles was much friendlier than the Realm of Split Void.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That was because spirit beasts were the overlords here.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Once human Qi warriors left the Dong Clan’s, Gu Clan’s, Cao Clan’s, and Pill Pavilion Sect’s territories, they would instantly become the weaker side.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">For this reason, most of the exploration teams that came out into the wild wouldn’t start fighting each other the moment they met like in the Realm of Split Void.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">On the contrary, most teams would be friendly with each other when they met in dangerous regions dominated by powerful spirit beasts. On many occasions, they would even join hands and deal with spirit beasts together.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Of course, nothing was for sure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Sometime, people who had high opinions of their own strength would lay murderous hands on their own kind in desolate and uninhabited regions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Luo Xin took one step forward and said sincerely, “Don’t get us wrong. We can see that you lost a friend to kill this spirit beast. We don’t intend to take your spoils. We only came because we heard your battle and wanted to see if you needed help. We didn’t expect that your battle would already be over when we got here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing her words, the man who seemed to be the leader eased his tension and said with a sad look in his eyes, “That’s very kind of you. But thanks. Our battle is finished.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Luo Xin continued with a bitter expression, “We are from the Cloudsoaring Sect in the Realm of Flame Heaven. Some of our members marched to this area several months ago. They were seen in this forest about two weeks ago. One of them might have already been killed by spirit beasts. Someone found his most important spiritual tool. Have you seen them in the vicinity?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“A team from the Cloudsoaring Sect, from the Realm of Flame Heaven?” The man thought for a moment. “Was a girl named Jiang Lingzhu on the team?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Luo Xin’s eyes lit up. “Yeah, she was! Did you meet them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The man nodded. “As a matter of fact, we did. What a coincidence!”&nbsp;</span></p>
