 <p><span>Yuan Feng and Yun Song saw Nie Tian the moment he appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span>“It’s you?!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Yun Song was stunned, and for a moment, he thought he was mistaken. After all, Nie Tian had parted with the group for a long time, and they all believed he should have died already.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What happened?” Nie Tian asked in confusion. “How come you aren’t in the volcanic region with Zheng Bin from the Mystic Mist sect? What are you doing here?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Upon hearing his words, Yuan Feng’s face dropped instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span>Yun Song gave a wry smile. “We originally planned to go to the volcano area, but that ship has sailed. We ran into disciples from the Ghost sect and Blood sect right before we got out of the desert. They blocked our way forwards and killed several of us, so we could only split up and run.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Now, we only want to go to return to the Secret Dimension Gate, sit out this trial, and get out of this hellhole at the first possible moment!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian’s expression flickered. “A lot of you were killed? How many people did the Ghost sect and Blood sect have?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Nine. There were just nine of them.” Yun Song’s eyes were brimming with fear. “But that witch Yu Tong broke into the Lesser Heaven stage in the middle of the battle! She cast numerous secret magics of the Blood sect. No one could contend against her! She single-handedly dealt with An Ying, Jiang Lingzhu, and my cousin at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Then a guy named Mo Xi from the Ghost sect swooped in, taking advantage of the opportunity to kill many of the rest of us. We could only flee.</span></p>
 <p><span>“It’s over. The trial in the Green Illusion dimension is over! I just hope that people on the outside will realize what the Ghost sect and the Blood sect have done, and get in here as soon as possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian was shocked. “Yu Tong had a breakthrough during the battle?” </span></p>
 <p><span>“Cut the crap!” Yuan Feng snorted coldly, looking at Nie Tian with an unfriendly expression. “Hand over your spirit stones. We need to recover our spiritual power as soon as possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“That’s right!” Yun Song yelled, flaunting his cousin’s power. “Hand them over and we’ll let you live, at least as long as we’re here in the Green Illusion dimension!” </span></p>
 <p><span>Surprised, Nie Tian subconsciously looked down at the cloth pouch at his waist before saying with a strange smile, “We’re in such a dangerous situation, and you still want to rob my spirit stones? Are you sure?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Yes, we are!” Yun Song said coldly. “Do you really think we would have let you off if we hadn’t run into the Ghost sect disciples in the glacier area early on? Days ago, when we joined the group with the Spiritual Treasure sect and the Cloudsoaring sect, you dared to made things difficult for us. Do you think you would still be able to leave safe and sound after meeting us here?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Yuan Feng began to walk toward Nie Tian. “There may be disciples from the Blood sect and Ghost sect chasing after us,” he said. “I don’t want to waste my energy on you. The trial is over. If you’re lucky enough to get out of the Green Illusion dimension alive, I’ll kill you outside.</span></p>
 <p><span>“For now, I’ll let you live a bit longer. Now, be a good lad and hand over your pouch!”</span></p>
 <p><span>After a narrow escape from the Blood sect and Ghost sect, Yuan Feng had fled at full speed for quite some time, causing a substantial consumption of his spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p><span>He also wasn’t sure whether the Blood sect and Ghost sect had sent someone after them.</span></p>
 <p><span>In that situation, he wasn’t willing to waste his last remaining strength on Nie Tian, so he just asked Nie Tian to hand over his spirit stones.</span></p>
 <p><span>After all, in his eyes, Nie Tian was just a nobody with a poor cultivation base from the Nie clan.</span></p>
 <p><span>Considering Yuan Feng’s status and power, as long as he wished to, he could kill Nie Tian any time in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian took the pouch from his waist and held it in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span>Looking over quietly at Yuan Feng for a moment, he said, “According to your words, even if I give you the spirit stones, you’ll still kill me after the Green Illusion dimension’s trial ends?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“That’s right! You’re lucky enough that I’m gonna let you live for a while longer.” Yuan Feng didn’t even try to conceal his intentions.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian nodded, and grinning, dropped the cloth pouch by his feet.</span></p>
 <p><span>With a glance at the pouch, he took one step back, indicating that Yuan Feng and Yun Song should come and get it.</span></p>
 <p><span>“You’re in luck!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Without the slightest hesitation, Yun Song leaped to Nie Tian’s side, and bent over to fetch the pouch.</span></p>
 <p><span>At that moment, a strong killing intent emanated from Nie Tian’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Watch out!” Yuan Feng called out.</span></p>
 <p><span>Just as Yun Song reached downwards, beams of light suddenly shot out from Nie Tian’s fingertips.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I knew you’d do that!” Yun Song snorted, as if he had been prepared for the attack, and immediately straightened up.</span></p>
 <p><span>Instead of grabbing the pouch, he unleashed his internal flame power, clenching his fist and punching towards the five light beams.</span></p>
 <p><span>One after another, numerous clusters of flame shot out of his fist, submerging Nie Tian’s light beams.</span></p>
 <p><span>BANG! BANG!</span></p>
 <p><span>With a loud clash, the light beams and the flame clusters exploded and vanished together into the air.</span></p>
 <p><span>After neutralizing Nie Tian’s attack, Yun Song’s face suddenly turned grim. “Spiritual power breakaway. You have actually broken through to the seventh level of Qi Refining!” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Back when he fought Nie Tian in front of the Spiritual Treasure Pavilion, Nie Tian was only at the fourth level.</span></p>
 <p><span>And that was how long ago?</span></p>
 <p><span>After their battle in Black Cloud City, he was well aware of Nie Tian’s fierce temperament, and the fact that he would never give in.</span></p>
 <p><span>But after all, he knew that Nie Tian’s cultivation base was poor, so even though he knew that Nie Tian would unleash murderous attacks, he wasn’t afraid in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p><span>Completely contrary to what he had expected, Nie Tian had reached the seventh level, and possessed the ability to release his spiritual power out of his body!</span></p>
 <p><span>If he hadn’t been prepared, Nie Tian’s five finger blast probably would have doomed him!</span></p>
 <p><span>Right as he was rejoicing that he was smart enough to have anticipated Nie Tian’s attack, Yuan Feng called out to him again, and immediately began to rush over. “Yun Song! Get back here!! He’s now at the eighth level!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Too late,” Nie Tian said with a cold smile, unleashing his formidable psychic power to attack Yun Song.</span></p>
 <p><span>Having savored the sweet taste of killing Du Kun, he realized that his unusually strong psychic power was a perfect weapon!</span></p>
 <p><span>From his point of view, he was single-handedly fighting Yun Song and Yuan Feng. If he couldn’t use special tactics to finish one off, once the two of them flanked him, he wouldn’t necessarily come out victorious.</span></p>
 <p><span>Ever since Yuan Feng clearly stated that he would spare no effort to kill him at the first possible moment even if he got out of the Green Illusion dimension alive, he had made up his mind to kill them.</span></p>
 <p><span>He had to kill both Yuan Feng and Yun Song while in the Green Illusion dimension, otherwise, they would bring him endless trouble in the future!</span></p>
 <p><span>Furthermore, with the disciples of the Ghost sect and the Blood sect in the picture, he could easily find excuses for the trial takers’ deaths: killed by the Ghost sect and Blood sect!</span></p>
 <p><span>Having figured out an excuse, he brought out his trump card without the slightest scruple.</span></p>
 <p><span>Facing the unexpected psychic attack, Yun Song felt as if he were being possessed by a demon.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Ahhhh!!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Feeling the intolerable stabbing pain in his head, he held his head, wailing in anguish.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian took advantage of the opportunity and reached out his hand with the speed of lightning. Clenching Yun Song’s neck, he then tightened his grip.</span></p>
 <p><span>CRUNCH!</span></p>
 <p><span>The sound of bone cracking rang out from within Yun Song’s neck, and simultaneously, his head drooped down in an unnatural way.</span></p>
 <p><span>Yuan Feng opened his eyes so wide that they almost bled. “You! You killed him! You actually killed him!!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Everyone who participated in the Green Illusion dimension trial had to abide by the rules and regulations set by the four sects, which included no killing between trial takers.</span></p>
 <p><span>Even though Yuan Feng held a grudge against Nie Tian, back when he demanded that An Ying hand him over, he only wished to disable him; he didn’t have even the slightest intention of killing him.</span></p>
 <p><span>He had never expected him to unleash murderous attacks towards Yun Song in the Green Illusion dimension.</span></p>
 <p><span>After all, if he ever got out of the Green Illusion dimension and revealed this matter to others, Nie Tian would inevitably be executed by the four sects!</span></p>
 <p><span>“If I don’t kill him in the Green Illusion dimension, I probably won’t have another chance after returning to Black Cloud City.” Nie Tian’s face was cold and grim. “If I see him causing me trouble in Black Cloud City after we get out, I’ll regret that decision every day. So, in order to have no regrets in the future, I can only kill him in the Green Illusion dimension.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“You’ll be executed by the four sects!” yelled Yuan Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span>“No, I won’t.” Nie Tian grinned cruelly. “I’ve also planned for your death... As long as you’re dead, no one will ever know the truth. I’ll tell them that you two were killed by the Ghost sect and the Blood sect, and that I had nothing to do with it.”</span></p>
