<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian glanced over the other so-called chosen ones.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon meeting his eyes, all of them looked awkward and hesitant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a cunning smile, Nie Tian laid his eyes on the Flame God Sect’s core disciple and said, “Yang Kan, I bet you know what I want. Quit hiding your earthflame essence and earthflame crystal strings. I only want enough to match the value of the Golden Chariot. I’m not a greedy person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Fuming with anger, Yang Kan blurted, “Hide?! The Flame Dragon Armor already took all of the earthflame crystal strings and earthflame essence my sectmaster bestowed upon me before we came here! Where do I get more to give you!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Oh, is that so? How about I give the Golden Chariot to you, and you go scouting on that island?” Nie Tian proposed, smiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yang Kan’s expression froze.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Considering his awkward situation, that he was now stuck between the Greater Heaven stage and the Worldly realm, he wasn’t even as powerful as he had been when he had been at the late Greater Heaven stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That was why he had taken the initiative to leave after seeing Nie Tian massacre all those men to protect Dong Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Now that he was at this undefined stage, and his strength had regressed, he knew that he would have an eighty or ninety percent chance of dying on that island if he so daringly went there.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After an extended, painful contemplation, he summoned the six crimson stone columns from within his ring of holding. Eyes filled with flaming hatred, he gritted the words, “Here. You practice fire-attribute incantations. You should know how valuable they are to you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At the same time, a jade slip few out of Yang Kan’s hand and landed in Nie Tian’s, which recorded the instructions for the six crimson stone columns.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Eyes narrowed, Nie Tian sent a wisp of psychic awareness into it, and immediately learned that he would need to infuse them with earthflame essence and earthflame crystal strings, then refine another crimson crystal ball that would carry the jade slip inside. All these things done, he would be able to use the six crimson stone columns at will.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I believe this should be enough for me and Lu Jian both, right?” Yang Kan’s words were filled with anger and hatred.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He was right. The six crimson stone columns and the jade slip he had given out were even more valuable than the Golden Chariot.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, he was thinking that, once he entered the Worldly realm, he would be able to take everything back from Nie Tian, including the Flame Dragon Armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After figuring out the profound use of the six crimson stone columns, Nie Tian seemed to be in a good mood. “Not bad,” he said. “Okay, Lu Jian won’t need to pay anymore.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, he cast a glance at Zhang Jiu from the Poison Sect and, with a cold snort, he said, “All I want from you is a piece of information.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhang Jiu had originally been torn about what to give Nie Tian, but upon hearing Nie Tian’s words, he instantly felt relieved, and hastily asked, “About what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Is Pei Qiqi still alive, and where is she now?” &nbsp;Nie Tian asked, exuding intense killing intent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“That bitch...” As soon as he uttered these words, Zhang Jiu realized that he had used the wrong words, and thus hastily added, “Miss Pei should be fine. She rushed to the end of our segment in the swirling band soon after her arrival. Even though the colorful mist at the end stopped other Greater Heaven stage cultivators from entering, it didn’t seem to work on her. She went into it without meeting any resistance, and I’ve no idea where she went after that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“How do I know that you’re telling the truth?” Nie Tian confronted him with a stern look in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhang Jiu hastily swore that, if any of his statements were proven to be false, he should have his flesh torn and his bones crushed. (Idiom: die the most cruel death)</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The other Poison Sect disciples chimed in, saying that Pei Qiqi must be fine.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Staring coldly and silently at them for a while, Nie Tian finally nodded and let them off.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He didn’t think Zhang Jiu was lying, but he had a feeling that, if he was telling the truth, considering Pei Qiqi’s strength and temperament, she should have killed Zhang Jiu and his men already.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meanwhile, he had always suspected what had made Pei Qiqi leave him so suddenly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“You gave up a million spirit stones just for some information on Pei Qiqi?!” While he was absorbed in thought, Dong Li snorted coldly, her eyes filled with grudges.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Clearly, she was very unhappy about the fact that Nie Tian had just given up on demanding huge remuneration over nothing but some information on Pei Qiqi.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Keh! Keh!” Nie Tian cleared his throat, pretending that he hadn’t seen the anger in her eyes. He turned to face the members of the Thunder Mountain Sect and Heaven Expanse Sect, and said, “It’s your turn now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though only five remained of the joint team of the Thunder Mountain Sect and Heaven Expanse Sect, all of the survivors were elites. Liao Yan from the Thunder Mountain Sect and Yu Yang from the Heaven Expanse Sect were their respective sect’s core disciples.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They hadn’t been there to witness Nie Tian slaughter their sectmates while guarding the eighth grade black phoenix, but they had later learned about Nie Tian’s doings.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Both groups bore bitter hatred toward Nie Tian, though they knew they couldn’t do anything to him now, considering his formidable strength and the fact that he had the Yin Sect, the Yang Sect, and those from the Realm of a Hundred Battles at his back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Furthermore, since they were now facing a great threat from the outsiders, they knew they had to unite with all of the other forces to fight the outsiders. Therefore, they didn’t dare to confront Nie Tian and ruin that alliance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As Nie Tian laid his eyes on them, Liao Yan and Yu Yang were clearly struggling to suppress their anger. “What do you want?” Liao Yan asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Spiritual materials of fire, wood, and star attributes.” Nie Tian answered casually, not worried that they would have an outburst at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had never had any favorable impressions towards the Heaven Expanse Sect or the Thunder Mountain Sect, which were the two major sects in the Realm of Earth Sieve. He still remembered what their disciples had said right before entering the Heaven Gate in the Realm of Flame Heaven.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Furthermore, the Realm of Earth Sieve had never given up the idea of invading the Realm of Flame Heaven.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Liao Yan shook his head and said, “We don’t have the spiritual materials you want.” Then, with a angry and reluctant expression on his face, he took out a glassware from with his ring of holding, which contained a shriveled, gray heart inside, and added, “This heart belonged to a powerful Fiend. He was long dead when we found him, but his heart still contains deadly toxins.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I believe it’s more than enough as remuneration for your service from both the Thunder Mountain Sect and Heaven Expanse Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Two of my junior martial brothers were poisoned to death gouging this heart out of the Fiend’s chest and putting it into the sealed glassware. I originally planned to trade it for valuables from powerful Poison Sect experts after returning to the Domain of the Falling Stars. It’s yours now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The eyes of Zhang Jiu, who was from the Poison Sect, couldn’t widen more upon seeing the heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He knew that Fiends were extremely poisonous beings, and that a Fiend’s heart was their source of power, which made it the most poisonous part of the Fiend.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If some powerful expert from the Poison Sect could refine the toxins within it for their use or derive enlightenment from the profound mysteries of it, that person would surely benefit significantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Not only Zhang Jiu, but all the other Poison Sect disciples appeared incomparably excited upon seeing the Fiend’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Liao Yan snorted and reminded Nie Tian, “You should know that this heart isn’t something Zhang Jiu or his people can afford. Plus, since we haven’t assessed the grade of the owner of this heart, we can’t determine its exact value for now. You’d better keep it safe and not try to examine it yourself. Otherwise, you might get yourself killed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As he said these words, Nie Tian saw wisps of green mist rising from the shriveled heart, which was sealed within the glassware.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The wisps of green mist were like fine tentacles swaying within the glassware, which was filled with a faint, green mist. It was as if the slightest leakage of the green mist would doom everyone present.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He sent a wisp of his psychic awareness into the glassware in an attempt to learn its mysteries.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, the moment his psychic awareness flew into the glassware and made contact with the poisonous mist, it was instantly devoured.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I can’t believe that the poisonous mist actually devoured my psychic awareness!” Nie Tian’s expression flickered. He stared closely at the heart and started to believe that it was something that could kill people very easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">No longer daring to conduct any more examinations, he quickly stored the glassware in his ring of holding and said, “Alright, that’s it for the Thunder Mountain Sect and Heaven Expanse Sect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The only forces that hadn’t given their remuneration were the Yin Sect, the Yang Sect, the Ice Pavilion Sect, and those from the Realm of a Hundred Battles.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing his words, Ye Qin and Chen Hao smiled bitterly, exchanged a glance, and were going to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, Nie Tian waved his hand and said, “It’s alright. You don’t need to give me anything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Ye Qin’s and Chen Hao’s eyes lit up as they hastily bowed slightly towards him to show their gratitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li rolled her eyes at him. “What about us? Hmm?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Baijie also looked at him with a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian gave a dry smile. “S-sure, you don’t need to pay me either.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li snorted, smiling. “That’s more like it.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Xuan Ke from the Ice Pavilion Sect hesitate briefly before saying, “Umm...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian glanced at him and, with a wave of his hand, said, “Forget it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing these words, all of the Ice Pavilion Sect disciples hastily expressed their gratitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Xuan Ke nodded at Nie Tian and said, “The Ice Pavilion Sect won’t forget about this, and neither will I.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Alright, everyone, I’ll be off now. Just wait for my good news.” With a thought, Nie Tian sent the Golden Chariot whistling towards the distant island where powerful outsiders were possibly gathered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Everyone watched him fly away with complicated looks in their eyes.</span></p>

Like Mencius, Tao lost his father as a young child. He and his mother lived a humble life, but his&nbsp;mother taught him to treat friends generously and not to&nbsp;put too much value on&nbsp;money. According to<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><em style="font-style: italic; line-height: inherit">A New Account of the Tales of the World</em> (《世说新语》), a scholar named Fan Kui once passed through Tao’s hometown and asked for night’s lodging at their home. Fan was well-known in government and Tao wanted to make his acquaintance, but didn’t have enough food to treat all his servants and horses. At this time, Tao’s mother told Tao to take in the entourage, and cut off her long hair and sold it for money to buy food, tore down several wood pillars from their house to chop into firewood, and even cut up their grass mats to feed Fan’s horses. Fan was deeply moved by their hospitality and also impressed by Tao’s talents. Later, Fan recommended him to the local government, and Tao became an official.</p>

As a low-ranked official, Tao was assigned to take charge of the fisheries. Once, he sent a jar of salted fish to his mother, but to his surprise, his mother returned it with a letter saying: “You are an official, sending me public property will do me no good, but just worry me.” Tao was ashamed, and was determined to be an upright official.</p>
