<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span>From the look of it, being a highborn outsider, Groete knew about the Fragmentary Star Incantation, and that was why when he saw the starlight raining down onto Nie Tian, he looked somewhat scared.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Blood sect had been enveloped in the dense demon Qi for so long that all the Blood sect survivors had almost forgot what the starry sky looked like. They weren’t even sure if the moon, the sun, and the stars still existed.</span></p>
 <p><span>Seeing the starlight falling from the heavens, penetrating and dispelling the demon Qi, every disciple of the Blood sect had a feeling that the starlight that had poured onto Nie Tian was their hope to get out of the difficult situation.</span></p>
 <p><span>In their eyes, the starlight was the light of hope!</span></p>
 <p><span>“Nie Tian!” Li Jing suddenly put a sizable distance between Sarah and herself. Wreathed in a rich bloody aura, she looked at Nie Tian, eyes filled with shock.</span></p>
 <p><span>She was the only Qi warrior in the Blood sect who had reached the Profound realm, so her understanding of the starlight was much better than all the other Blood sect members.</span></p>
 <p><span>As strong and resourceful as she was, when the Blood sect had been engulfed by the dense demon Qi, she found herself at the end of her wits.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, the starlight pouring down from the heavens at this very moment carried a mysterious power that could cleanse the demon Qi.</span></p>
 <p><span>This power was completely new to her, and it went beyond even her understanding.</span></p>
 <p><span>Furthermore, she didn’t think it was Wu Ji who had passed this miraculous incantation to Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span>If he had such a powerful incantation at his disposal, the Cloudsoaring sect wouldn’t be in a similar situation as the Blood sect, struggling to stay afloat.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Spirit Channeling grade treasure, mysterious incantation... Is he really Wu Ji’s disciple?” Li Jing couldn’t help but wonder.</span></p>
 <p><span>FIZZ! FIZZ!</span></p>
 <p><span>As soon as the flood of starlight shone on the dense demon Qi, the demon Qi dissipated as rapidly as if it had been set on fire.</span></p>
 <p><span>Moments later, a ten-meter range, with Nie Tian being the center, was demon Qi-free.</span></p>
 <p><span>Having lost his chaotic magnetic field, Nie Tian stood in the center of the starlight-lit area, a confused expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span>On the other hand, Groete had already quietly gotten away from Nie Tian as soon as his purple light ball exploded and the starlight started cleansing the demon Qi.</span></p>
 <p><span>At that moment, Groete was hiding away within another cluster of dense demon Qi, looking deeply at Nie Tian with his purple, devilish eyes, as if he was trying to see through all the secrets in Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span>What he didn’t know was that after destroying the purple light ball with the rage punch, Nie Tian was actually in a terrible state.</span></p>
 <p><span>The rage punch had almost drained all of his power.</span></p>
 <p><span>WHOOSH!</span></p>
 <p><span>All of a sudden, a ball of flame whizzed over, dragging a long, burning tail, and stopped one meter in front of Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span>After the flames gradually went out, the Flame Dragon Armor showed itself.</span></p>
 <p><span>CRUNCH! CRUNCH!</span></p>
 <p><span>The sounds of heavy things crashing into the ground rang out from behind Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span>Along with those sounds came the screams of low-tier outsiders and blood-spurting sounds.</span></p>
 <p><span>By destroying the purple light ball and channeling starlight from the heavens, Nie Tian had bought the Bone Blood Demon enough time to break through the blockade.</span></p>
 <p><span>Seconds later, the Bone Blood Demon, whose body had turned red from the bloodbath, arrived by Nie Tian’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span>Emanating a dreadful, bloody aura, the Bone Blood Demon stood back to back with Nie Tian. It constantly swung its gigantic bony hands, tearing the incoming roaring low-tier outsiders into shreds.</span></p>
 <p><span>Before long, the bodies of the dead low-tier outsiders piled up into a hill in front of the Bone Blood Demon.</span></p>
 <p><span>More and more purple blood kept streaming out of the mangled bodies and soon the ground was covered in it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Your highness!” Sarah called out to Groete. As she turned her curvaceous body, numerous thorns grew out of her, and then she whizzed towards Li Jing.</span></p>
 <p><span>The blood-colored lotus Li Jing sat on seemed as if it was made of blood crystal, inside of which blood shadows constantly flashed about.</span></p>
 <p><span>She felt greatly relieved after seeing that the Bone Blood Demon had reached Nie Tian’s side and was now cutting down wave after wave of low-tier outsiders to keep him safe.</span></p>
 <p><span>At that moment, the voices of Feng Luo, Hong Can, Li Fan, and Zou Yi rang out from afar.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Sectmaster!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Senior Li!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“We’re here!”</span></p>
 <p><span>After spending some time to replenish their power with spirit stones, they finally made it to the central square of the Blood sect.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Your highness!” Sarah’s voice echoed out again. It seemed she didn’t dare to tell Groete what to do, so she just called out his name.</span></p>
 <p><span>She also feared that she might irritate him and make him act rashly by advising him.</span></p>
 <p><span>She only wanted to inform him that now that Feng Luo and the others had arrived, according to her assessment of the situation, their operation to sack the Blood sect was already destined to fail.</span></p>
 <p><span>Furthermore, she had witnessed Groete awaken his own bloodline power and cast the Eternal Night spell, but fail to kill Nie Tian before the Bone Blood Demon rushed to his side.</span></p>
 <p><span>As a high-tier outsider herself, she had a perfect idea of how consuming the demonizing process could be.</span></p>
 <p><span>She knew that Groete must have lost a significant amount of his vital energy and needed to recuperate as soon as possible. In his current condition, he couldn’t fight another battle.</span></p>
 <p><span>On the other hand, the Bone Blood Demon had slaughtered more than two hundred low-tier outsiders by now, and it had accumulated its flesh power to a terrifying level.</span></p>
 <p><span>Even she lacked the confidence to overtake the Bone Blood Demon at this point. And that was not to mention the fact that she would need to get through Li Jing first.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, the most unbearable thing for her was that the demon Qi in the area was rapidly dissipating due to the starlight Nie Tian had brought down from the heavens.</span></p>
 <p><span>All these unfavorable factors had made Sarah realize that if they continued to fight, they would become the losing side.</span></p>
 <p><span>That was why she had warned Groete of the situation twice...</span></p>
 <p><span>Meanwhile, Groete didn’t lose his clear mind. With one sharp screech, he commanded all the remaining low-tier outsiders to attack the Blood sect disciples as well as Hong Can and the others who had just arrived. Then he shouted in their language, “Retreat!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Upon hearing his order, the other five high-tier outsiders, including Sarah, immediately pulled back and dashed to his side.</span></p>
 <p><span>They formed a circle around Groete before they leapt into the air and flew away in the dense demon Qi.</span></p>
 <p><span>After receiving Groete’s order, all the low-tier outsiders let out mad roars as they charged toward the human Qi warriors.</span></p>
 <p><span>After all, in the eyes of Groete and Sarah, the low-tier outsiders were nothing more than expendable tools that they could sacrifice to buy enough time for them to retreat.</span></p>
 <p><span>By the time they were quite some distance from the Blood sect, Groete let out another screech.</span></p>
 <p><span>Only then did the frenzied low-tier outsiders stopped attacking and flee in all directions.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Chase after them! Kill as many as you can!” Sitting on top of her blood-colored lotus, Li Jing gave the order, commanding those who were strong enough to resist the demon Qi to hunt down the fleeing low-tier outsiders.</span></p>
 <p><span>Now that their commanders were gone, Li Jing was confident that they would be able to finish off the remaining two hundred outsider minions. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>As the other Blood sect experts chased after the fleeing low-tier outsiders, Li Jing remained in place.</span></p>
 <p><span>Neither did she chase after the low-tier outsiders, nor did she go after Groete and the high-tier outsiders.</span></p>
 <p><span>The reason was that Nie Tian didn’t make a move either, and the Bone Blood Demon was standing right next to him like a faithful guard.</span></p>
 <p><span>She knew in her heart that the Bone Blood Demon was what had caused the high-tier outsiders to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span>WHOOSH!</span></p>
 <p><span>The scarlet lotus traveled through the dissipating demon Qi to the cleansed, lit-up area where Nie Tian was standing.</span></p>
 <p><span>Upon arriving at the purged area, the bloody aura that had been wreathing Li Jing immediately dissipated, and only then did Nie Tian get a clear view of her face.</span></p>
 <p><span>Floating in front of him was a woman in her thirties. The way she wore her makeup and the way she dressed made her look especially elegant.</span></p>
 <p><span>She was wearing a long, rose-red dress and her curvaceous thighs were crossed as she sat atop the blood-colored lotus. Since she had canceled the spell, her scarlet pupils had resumed their original, black color.</span></p>
 <p><span>Grabbing the lower part of her dress with one hand, she rose to her feet in a slow, graceful fashion.</span></p>
 <p><span>The blood-colored lotus gradually descended and, when it was half a meter from the ground, she gently stepped down from the lotus.</span></p>
 <p><span>With a wave of her hand, the lotus that seemed to be made of blood jade rapidly shrunk to the size of a fist and flew into the ring on her left ring finger.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Sectmaster!” Feng Luo from the Blood sect wanted to explain how the Bone Blood Demon had awakened and why they had been delayed.</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Jing gently raised her left hand.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luo immediately sealed his lips and bowed in a respectful way before turning around and joining the others in hunting down the fleeing low-tier outsiders.</span></p>
 <p><span>At that moment, Li Fan from the Cloudsoaring sect quietly stepped into the starlight-lit area where Nie Tian was the standing.</span></p>
 <p><span>With a serious and reverent look in his eyes, Li Fan looked at Li Jing from behind.</span></p>
 <p><span>The elegant woman in front of her was among the few Qi warriors who stood on top of the cultivation pyramid in the Realm of Flame Heaven.</span></p>
 <p><span>He had heard many rumors about her and knew that not only was she cruel and merciless, she was also famous for her moodiness. Even the slightest disagreement might make her go berserk and start killing.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, it was thanks to her bold decisions that the Blood sect had prospered during the recent years.</span></p>
 <p><span>The fact that she remained in place instead of venting her anger upon the fleeing minions had somehow made Li Fan worry.</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Fan wondered what her next move would be. After all, she had never been one to follow the rules.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Senior...” As soon as Li Fan uttered the first word, he found his own voice a bit funny. After laboring to calm himself, he cleared his throat and said, “Nie Tian is my martial granduncle’s disciple. Even though he somehow controlled the Bone Blood Demon your sect put heart and soul into, he played an important role in raising the siege of your sect.</span></p>
 <p><span>“He’s still young and unseasoned. I hope you can give face to my martial granduncle and go easy on him,” Li Fan pleaded.</span></p>
 <p><span>“You think I was going to punish him?” said Li Jing, not even turning her head back.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Oh? So what do you intend to do with him then?” Li Fan said, puzzled.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Now that he has awakened the Bone Blood Demon and become the master of our sect’s most valuable Blood Demon, he’s a member of the Blood sect.” Staring into Nie Tian’s eyes, Li Jing continued, “You can tell Wu Ji later that he’s no longer a member of the Cloudsoaring sect.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“What?! You can’t mean that!” Li Fan stood aghast.</span>&nbsp;</p>
