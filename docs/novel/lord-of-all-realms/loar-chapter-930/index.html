 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Inside a cabin, Jing Feiyang looked at Nie Tian, who had just returned, and said in a soft voice, “It was the White Rose’s people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a profound magic, he concealed the divine seals he had unleashed, and used them to track Old Shadow Eccentric. Eventually, he saw him meet up with those who were dressed in white robes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Jing Rou’s expression flickered with astonishment. “The White Rose?! She’s also at the early Saint domain, isn’t she?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Jing Feiyang nodded. “It’s indeed a bit tricky now. It’s hard to believe that even the White Rose was bought to do this job.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Who’s the White Rose?” Nie Tian asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“The White Rose is the nickname of a female Qi warrior from the Domain of Endless Snow,” Jing Feiyang explained. “In fact, she was Patriarch Snowy Peak’s martial sister in the Heavenly Ice Sect. She should have been the current sectmaster of the Heavenly Ice Sect. However, Patriarch Snowy Peak seemed to have set her up during some internal strife, and had her expelled from their sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“So she and some of her faithful followers went wandering in the starry river among different powerful domains, and started leading the lives of Hunters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Any Qi warrior would have to rely on all kinds of precious materials to progress in their cultivation. After being expelled from the Heavenly Ice Sect, which used to be her strong backer, she could only ambush ancient starships that travel between different domains and plunder their valuables to support her own cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Soon, the White Rose became one of the most famous Hunters among the domains in this region.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“However, the White Rose and her subordinates usually adopt mild measures. Normally speaking, as long as their target starships give up their cultivation resources, they will show them a way out, instead of slaughtering them all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“The White Rose also has Void domain experts among her subordinates. It seems that the reason why she paid Old Shadow Eccentric to do this job for her, instead of sending one of her own, is because she’s also afraid of your backer, the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Brow furrowed, Nie Tian muttered, “The early Saint domain... It’s hard to believe someone with such a high cultivation base would want to lead the life of a Hunter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“She had no choice,” Jing Feiyang said. “She hadn’t entered the Saint domain when she first descended to the rank of Hunter. She was only at the middle Void domain back then. At that time, the Domain of Endless Snow, the Domain of Heaven Python, the Domain of Vast Darkness, and the Domain of Heaven’s Boundaries all had powerful sects who didn’t want to ruin their relationship with Patriarch Snowy Peak by accepting her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Back then, she wasn’t powerful enough to defy any of these sects.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“When she lowered herself to become a Hunter and entered the Saint domain with the help of the cultivation resources she had plundered, she was finally strong enough to set up her own sect in the Domain of Heaven’s Boundaries. However, she had also offended too many people due to her line of business.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Under such circumstances, if she actually established her own sect in the Domain of Heaven’s Boundaries, which is the weakest of the four domains, it would have become a clear target for her enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Therefore, she could only remain a Hunter, wander the space between different domains, and make a living by looting cultivation resources.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Jing Feiyang seemed to be empathetic as he talked about her, as if he felt genuinely sorry for what she had gone through.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Luckily for us, it was the White Rose’s people, not the Bloody Despair Brotherhood,” Duan Shihu said, looking somewhat relieved. “Back in my hunting days, I only roamed the surroundings of the Domain of Heaven Python. I never dared to hunt in areas between domains. The White Rose has a good name among the Hunters. Back in the day, when I was pursued by the Divine Seal Sect, I even thought of joining her cause.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“But the Bloody Despair Brotherhood is a whole other story.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian just stood there and listened as the three of them explained about the Hunters. From them, he learned that there were two major Hunter forces in this vicinity: the White Rose and the Bloody Despair Brotherhood.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The White Rose’s people had certain moral principles. Normally, they wouldn’t take lives after getting the resources they wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, that wasn’t the case with the Bloody Despair Brotherhood.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Not only would they loot all of their targets’ valuables, but they would also kill every single one of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They were cruel and evil people, who were bereft of any moral principles. It was said that they had even made deals with outsiders, including selling the remains of their own kind to Bonebrutes, in exchange for spiritual materials that could be used to build personal domains.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The human domains in this region had a certain tolerance for the White Rose and her people, but they were all deeply disgusted by the Bloody Despair Brotherhood.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The three major sects in the Domain of Heaven Python had joined the powerful sects from their neighboring domains in the encircling of the Bloody Despair Brotherhood.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, they had repeatedly failed to trap their leader in their operations, resulting in retaliations that were even more ruthless.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even among the Hunter organizations, the Bloody Despair Brotherhood had a bad name, and was spit on by other organizations.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As they spoke, their ancient starship continued to sail at full speed through the domain that had been destroyed by the Divine Flame, with the Domain of Endless Snow as their destination.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A few days passed...</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Jing Feiyang, who was sitting in the lotus position, meditating and refining his true soul, suddenly opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His soul messages were instantly sent to the cabins Nie Tian, Duan Shihu, and Jing Rou were in, and three of them hastily came to the main cabin.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Bad news," Jing Feiyang said with a grim face. “The Bloody Despair Brotherhood’s people are here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Jing Rou hastily summoned that prismatic crystal of hers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Reflected in it was the area in front of their ancient starship, where three ancient starships that were slightly smaller than theirs were berthed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Blood-red banners hung high on all three of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Numerous skulls could be seen strapped on either side of the starships. The majority of them belonged to humans, while a few belonged to outsiders and large Ancientbeasts. Many of them still had blood and shreds of flesh on them. A mere glance at them would make people’s hair stand on end.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At the same time, the three ancient starships exuded a strong bloody aura, as if they were enormous beasts that hunted in the starry river.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">One figure after another quickly flashed into appearance on their decks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Some of them summoned their air-transportation spiritual tools. Like shoals of bloodthirsty fish, they flew towards Nie Tian’s ancient starship with sinister smiles on their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“It’s them alright,” Duan Shihu said with strong killing intent on his face. “Since it’s them, a peaceful ending won’t be an option. Either they die, or we do!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Being the former leader of a Hunter organization himself, he understood the Bloody Despair Brotherhood’s way of doing things too well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as he was convinced that the incomers were from the Bloody Despair Brotherhood, he realized that this would be completely different from their previous encounter with Old Shadow Eccentric and the White Rose’s people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Father!” Jing Rou exclaimed softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Eyes narrowed, Jing Feiyang said to Jing Rou, “Their leader is now on the middle starship. He probably doesn’t know that I’m here. Accelerate! Fly to them with the fastest speed possible!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Without saying a word, Jing Rou sent numerous spirit stones flying out of her palm to fill the power hub at the heart of the starship.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Magical symbols of different colors that carried spell formations that would help the ancient starship further accelerate flew out and slammed into the exterior of the starship.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Immediately afterwards, the ancient starship gave rise to deafening rumbles, unleashing dazzling spiritual light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BOOOOM!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A pillar of spiritual power shot out of the sharp prow of the starship. Countless divine seals could be seen shining like stars within it, improving its might severalfold, as it shot hundreds of meters into the distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Hahaha! Karma has finally come for the Divine Seal Sect!” A loud voice resounded through the space. “Back in the day, you joined in the encircling of our brothers. Many of them died at the hands of your sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“But today, the future of the Divine Seal Sect will die at my hands!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the resonant voice spread in all directions, the three berthed ancient starships suddenly split up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The thousands of skulls of different races suddenly shot out simultaneously like cannonballs. Like a sea of skulls, they crashed into the exterior of Nie Tian’s ancient starship.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The ancient starship that had been forged from refined divine metal started to shake upon taking the repeated blows.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A layer of glowing spiritual power that enveloped the ancient starship burst, sending numerous divine seals falling into the depths of the starry river like dying sparks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The members of the Bloody Despair Brotherhood, who had come on their air-transportation spiritual tools, took the opportunity to climb onto the starship, laughing wildly as they did.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With blood-stained spiritual tools clutched in their hands, they hoped to enter the cabins through the entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“These fools must have a death wish.” As Jing Feiyang let out a cold harrumph, countless divine seals flew whooshing out of the main cabin.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Many incoming members of the Bloody Despair Brotherhood were hit by the divine seals. Their bodies exploded like ripe watermelons that had hit the ground, reduced to mists of blood and flesh that filled the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Jing Feiyang!!” As the resonant voice echoed out once again, a man walked furiously out of of the middle ancient starship.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Wreathed in blood-colored light, the man exuded a flesh aura that was extremely vigorous. It was just that his flesh aura seemed very impure, as if there was no way it could ever be purified.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At the same time, strong spiritual power spread out with him as the center, forming a peculiar domain that reeked with a foul, bloody smell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Bloody images kept flashing across his domain, which, like a slaughterhouse, was filled with killing and atrocities.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">More than ten thousand meters from their location, a group of white-garbed Qi warriors and Old Shadow Eccentric were gazing towards them from afar, their expressions flickering. “The Bloody Despair Brotherhood!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They were none other than the White Rose’s people, who had been charged with the task of bringing Nie Tian in alive.</span></p>
