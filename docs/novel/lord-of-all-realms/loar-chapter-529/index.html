<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All of a sudden, one emerald green tree branch after another flew out of Nie Tian’s ring of holding and pierced into the ground around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as they formed a certain formation, emerald green light rose from them, forming a hemispherical ward around Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the meantime, the mysterious tree patterns that carried the profound truths of wood power flew out of the tree branches.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They joined the semi-transparent green ward and roamed about in it, vesting it with a resilient and tough force.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As Hong He’s hand slammed down towards the the mysterious green ward, numerous roaming tree patterns quickly gathered towards the top of the ward.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BANG!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A vigorous force burst forth from the contact point as golden light splashed in all directions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Hong He was instantly sent staggering a few step backwards by the intense counter-force.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Shock and confusion filled his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">FIZZ! FIZZ!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Tiny green sparks fell from between his trembling fingers as the formidable force from the green ward gradually wore off.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“You think your spiritual tool can save you?!” With intense killing intent in his eyes, Hong He summoned a streak of fierce psychic power and shot it at the green ward.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BOOM!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the next moment, his mind was shaken violently as the streak of psychic power he had wished to kill Nie Tian with dissipated into thin air.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">WHOOSH!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After neutralizing the golden lightning bolts, Dong Li dashed over, summoning the cyan awl back to her hand as she did. Then, with a swift slash with it, she formed multiple beams of cyan light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Hong He, who was going to launch another attack, hastily prepared for engagement.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He and Dong Li constantly shifted about in midair as they exchanged attacks, filling the sky with cyan and golden sparks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Sitting among the seventy-two tree branches, Nie Tian’s eyes were still closed as he focused on the transcendence and upgrade of his spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meanwhile, he was actually keeping a close watch on everything that was happening around him through his Heaven Eyes, including the Heaven Palace Sect’s imposition, Dong Li’s compromise, Hong He’s return, and their current fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, since he was in the middle of his breakthrough, he couldn’t mete out justice for Dong Li at such a critical moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The only thing he could do was spare sliver of his mind to form a protective ward around him with the seventy-two tree branches so that Hong He wouldn’t be able to threaten Dong Li with his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In fact, he hadn’t been sure how the tree branch magic would work out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, the result had proved that the tree branches, which had absorbed all of the mysterious tree patterns from that Floragrims’ ancestral land, had incredible power and uses.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With the help of the floating tree patterns, the green ward successfully fended off Hong He’s attempt to kill him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After seeing that Dong Li had dashed over and gotten into a fierce fight with Hong He, he felt slightly relieved.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He was well-aware that, even though Dong Li was at the middle Greater Heaven stage, which was lower than Hong He’s cultivation base, her actual battle prowess would probably be higher than Hong He’s, since the Dong Clan had put in an almost limitless amount of resources to help her grow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As long as Hong He could no longer use him to threaten Dong Li, she would be fine.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">While the two of them were engaged in a heated battle in midair, Nie Tian forced himself to calm down and focus completely on his spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, the eighth vortex of spiritual power had already fully formed in his spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">What he needed to do now was finish the expansion and refinement of his vortexes of flame power, wood power, and star power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Only after expanding and refining all of the vortexes in his spiritual sea to their limits would he be able to finish the breakthrough, given that he had already found the right enlightenment and entered the right state of mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Considering he had recently finished the expansion and refinement of his vortexes of flame power and wood power, he only needed to concentrate on upgrading his vortex of star power now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">One Star Stone after another lost their splendor and turned into ordinary stones in his palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Countless wisps of star power flew into his vortex of star power. As the vortex spun at an increasingly high speed, the star power condensed into glittering drops of stardew which then joined the lake at the bottom of the vortex.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Time passed slowly...</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the lake of stardew slowly rose and expanded, it gradually reached its limit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He was finally able to spare some of his attention to observe the battle between Dong Li and Hong He.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li seem to have become one with her black phoenix as she attacked Hong He. In one moment, she charged into the sky. In the next, she spread her arms and swooped down from the sky, like an eagle swooping down on its prey.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The late Greater Heaven stage Hong He was well-versed in wielding metal power. At this moment, he was countering Dong Li’s attacks with the Heaven Palace Sect’s secret incantations, holding a shiny, golden sword in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Cross Slash!” Every time Hong He swung his golden sword in the air, a shining, golden cross would appear before him and shoot towards Dong Li at lightning speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li, on the other hand, would fend it off with her bone shield, while launching counterattacks with her cyan awl. She didn’t seem to be under much pressure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Seeing this, Nie Tian felt more relieved, and refocused on his breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meanwhile...</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Soon after Hong He had parted with the team, Huang Hu had also split up with Su Lin. After failing to discover any precious materials in that area, he also started moving stealthily towards the location where Dong Li and Nie Tian were.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Having known Hong He for years, Huang Hu had a good idea as to what kind of person Hong He was. The moment he had proposed to split up and search, he had realized that he had set his mind on Dong Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Unlike Hong He, Huang Hu didn’t have a strong interest in women, though he was very greedy when it came to valuables and treasures.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Su Lin had been satisfied after getting the Earthshatter Beast’s eye from Dong Li. However, what Huang Hu had wanted was to kill Nie Tian and Dong Li both, and pillage all of their belongings.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">While he felt frustrated about his fruitless search, it suddenly occurred to him that, since Hong He had gone to force Dong Li to be with him, he could probably go to demand valuables from Dong Li and Nie Tian as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meanwhile, it had already been some time since Hong He had parted with him and Su Lin, so he imagined that Hong He might have already gotten what he wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If he went over now, not only would he not interrupt Hong He’s business, but Hong He might have killed Dong Li and Nie Tian already. He might just get there in time to split the spoils.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As he approached, he caught sight of Dong Li stretching her well-built body in the air before swooping down with the strength of her black phoenix.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">One streak of cyan light after another shot down with her, clashing with Hong He’s golden crosses.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Surprised, Huang Hu muttered, “It’s not over yet? As outstanding as Dong Li’s cultivation talent might be, her cultivation base was still clearly lower than Hong He’s. Normally speaking, Hong He should have prevailed by now. Is Dong Li really as powerful as people say she is? So much so that she’s even capable of beating opponents with higher cultivation bases?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these thoughts, Huang Hu picked up his pace.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At the same time, Nie Tian finally finished his breakthrough and successfully entered the middle Greater Heaven stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The moment his eyes snapped open, he shrewdly sensed that Huang Hu was rapidly approaching.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He grinned somewhat sinisterly, his eyes brimming with a thirst for blood. “The Heaven Palace sect!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a swing of his arm, he summoned a tree branch to his hand, and all the others into his ring of holding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A chaotic magnetic field instantly enveloped him and expanded to cover a five meter range around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Now that he had entered the middle Greater Heaven stage, the speed at which his chaotic magnetic field expanded and the intensity of its twisting force were both greatly enhanced.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His chaotic magnetic field was powered by the different types of power he practiced. Since all of those powers had become more refined after his breakthrough, it was natural that the might of his chaotic magnetic field had risen to a new level. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Starshift!” With a thought, he vanished from where he was sitting.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Hong He, who had failed to subdue Dong Li after so many exchanges, looked rather edgy. He hadn’t expect that the gorgeous Dong Li was actually such a tough bird.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though her cultivation base was lower, her battle prowess proved to not be inferior to his in the slightest. Meanwhile, she was able to fly about with the help of her black phoenix, which made her even harder to handle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BANG! BANG! BANG!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His golden lightning clashed with Dong Li’s cyan spiritual power in the air, filling the sky with dazzling light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, he was swinging his sword wreathed in golden lightning to cast more Cross Slashes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All of a sudden, the vortexes of spiritual power in his spiritual sea suddenly stopped spinning under the influence of some magnetic force, which caused the golden lightning around his sword to flicker.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the next moment, he felt as if all of his internal organs had suddenly been twisted. His face turned pale with shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He hastily calmed himself, then attempted to stop the great changes inside of him and restore functionality to the vortexes within his spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">PUFF!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A slightly chilly tree branch that carried rich wood power suddenly pierced into his back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Gasping, he turned around. Upon seeing Nie Tian’s brutal smile, he was scared out of his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Just as he was about to raise his sword, the tree branch blossomed with blinding light, sending a streak of rich wood power into him, where it rapidly turned into a small, green bud.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It grew at an alarming speed as it madly drained Hong He’s flesh power, along with his life force.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Before he could do anything, the expanding branches and thorns penetrated his five yin organs and six yang organs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Do you know who killed Ning Yang?” Nie Tian asked with a brutal smile.</span></p>

 <p>Tale: Sai Weng lived on the border and he raised horses for a living. One day, he lost one of his prized horses. After hearing of the misfortune, his neighbor felt sorry for him and came to comfort him. But Sai Weng simply asked, “How could we know it is not a good thing for me?”After a while, the lost horse returned and with another beautiful horse. The neighbor came over again and congratulated Sai Weng on his good fortune. But Sai Weng simply asked, “How could we know it is not a bad thing for me?” One day, his son went out for a ride with the new horse. He was violently thrown from the horse and broke his leg. The neighbors once again expressed their condolences to Sai Weng, but Sai Weng simply said, “How could we know it is not a good thing for me?” One year later, the Emperor’s army arrived at the village to recruit all able-bodied men to fight in the war. Because of his injury, Sai Weng’s son could not go off to war, and was spared from certain death.</p>
 <p>The proverb can be read to have multiple implications when it comes to the concept of luck and furtune. The end of the story seems to suggest that that with every misfortune comes with a silver lining or a blessing in disguise. But within the story is also the sense that with what at first appears to be good luck can come misfortune. However, this proverb is more commonly said when bad luck turns to good than when good luck turns to bad.</p>
