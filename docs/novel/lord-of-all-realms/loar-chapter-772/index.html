<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Mu Biqiong jumped into the Star Boat and sat down in a corner that was the farthest from Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She threw Nie Tian a disgusted look, her face ice-cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian took a glance at her, but didn’t say anything. He started the Star Boat and flew away from the place where the Bliss Mountain Sect disciples were gathered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The reason why he had demanded that Mu Biqiong stay here was because he planned to use her as a hostage when he went to negotiate with the Bliss Mountain Sect later.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">No one else among the Bliss Mountain Sect disciples was a better choice than her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If he had demanded Jiang Feng, Yao Zhilan, or someone else, after the Ultimates Reverse Grand Spell Formation was deactivated and they were free of the Vitality-returning Celestial Stone’s influence, they would be able to rapidly recover their spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If he were to keep any of those people by his side after Yue Yanxi and the other experts left, it would be like having a wolf by his side, and he would face a great threat from their presence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As for the other weaker disciples of the Bliss Mountain Sect, it wouldn’t be meaningful if he held any of them hostage. Jiang Feng wouldn’t care about their lives at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meanwhile, even though Mu Biqiong was at the Worldly realm, Nie Tian was confident that he would be able to overtake her even after she recovered her full strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Furthermore, she was the Bliss Mountain Sect’s Holy Daughter. The Bliss Mountain Sect had placed high hopes in her and poured countless cultivation resources her way. Therefore, they wouldn’t allow anything to happen to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">WHOOSH!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Bone Blood Demon also shot up into the sky and flew right under the Star Boat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Facing forward and with his back facing Mu Biqiong, Nie Tian was lost in thought. He pondered whether he should return to the Domain of the Falling Stars or stay here and practice cultivation after the grand spell formation was reversed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Eyebrows furrowed, Mu Biqiong looked silently at him from behind. After a while, she finally couldn’t help but say, “You already have Qiao Yunxi and Yin Yanan. Why did you still demand that I stay here with you? You should know that I’m not like them. I won’t give you what you want!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Taken aback, Nie Tian turned around and asked with a confused smile, “What are you talking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Mu Biqiong, who was wearing a veil, sat with her slender legs crossed, anger filling her deep, icy eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Mu Biqiong snorted disdainfully. “Save it. I’ve met far too many men like you. You think you can have any woman you like by relying on your extraordinary background, don’t you? I don’t know what those two were thinking, but I’m not like them. You’d better drop the idea and leave me alone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A confused expression filled Nie Tian’s face. “What idea?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He thought about it briefly, and then suddenly realized that she had misunderstood his intentions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Were you not thinking...?” Mu Biqiong said with an icy expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Rubbing his chin, Nie Tian ran his snaky gaze up and down her. With a meaningful smile, he said, “You’re right. I am thinking of it. I’ve heard that the Bliss Mountain Sect’s Holy Daughter has unearthly good looks, which is too appealing to men like me.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Now that I have you in the palm of my hand, of course I’ll take good advantage of the situation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He never had a positive feeling towards Mu Biqiong. He even detested her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That was because she seemed to be the one who had been responsible for the search for Master Voidspirit’s legacies. It was under her instructions that the Bliss Mountain Sect had chosen a large number of youngsters and had them practice body refining incantations.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Those youngsters had been nothing but chess pieces to them. It wouldn’t have mattered whether they succeeded in Master Voidspirit’s domain or not, they would have been exterminated after the mission either way.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The woman was catty, cruel, and treated human lives like dirt. She had attacked and killed quite a few Divine Flame Sect disciples who had waited for Nie Tian’s arrival. Qiao Yunxi was the only one who had managed to escape with the help of the Flame Bird.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She was by no means a nice person.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Therefore, after realizing what she was assuming, not only did Nie Tian not explain his actual intentions, but he even played along and teased her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A disdainful look filled Mu Biqiong’s eyes as she said, “All you have is your status as a disciple of the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace and that powerful puppet. You can only rely on external help. Do you still take yourself as some kind of hero? It seems to me that you just have a powerful background. You’d be nothing without the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace to back you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian laughed wildly. “You got that right. I can only rely on those things. What are you gonna do about it?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The disgusted look in Mu Biqiong’s eyes grew even more intense as she finally closed her eyes and ignored Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian gave a smile and stopped teasing her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Shortly afterwards, the Star Boat berthed in front of the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yue Yanxi, Guan Fu, and Jian Tong were still communicating in low voices by the open stone gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As they saw Nie Tian return with Mu Biqiong, their expressions grew strange. Apparently, they misunderstood Nie Tian as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian cleared his throat, signaling for Mu Biqiong to get off first.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With an icy face, Mu Biqiong slowly rose to her feet. Even though she was sitting in the lotus position, her slender, beautiful legs invited the imagination.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Eyes narrowed, Nie Tian discovered that this woman was actually very tall, only a bit shorter than him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He still hadn’t even seen her face to this day, which made him rather expectant. He even had an urge to rip her veil off and take a look at her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">WHOOSH!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Mu Biqiong jumped off the Star Boat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian put the Star Boat back into his ring of holding and said to her, “You may wait here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, he walked through the stone gate and entered the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Why did you bring that girl back here, Nie Tian?” Yue Yanxi asked confusedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qiao Yunxi stuck out her neck to take a look at Mu Biqiong, and then said with a cold face, “She killed a lot of our people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Eyebrows slightly furrowed, Yue Yanxi said, “I know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I’m only keeping her here so that I’ll be able to demand things from the Bliss Mountain Sect.” With a brief explanation, Nie Tian sent his soul awareness into the palace walls and reversed the Ultimates Reverse Grand Spell Formation that covered this entire continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The palace then shone with dazzlingly bright light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Soon, everyone noticed the subtle changes in the energy flow in the depths of the heavens and the earth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The feeling of a strange force channeling spiritual power from their spiritual seas gradually vanished.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">One after another, the people that had holed up inside the palace walked out to breathe the air and sense the changes that were taking place in this heaven and earth. Their eyebrows rose as they discovered that the spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth had become even richer than when they had first come.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After pondering the matter briefly, they realized that the Vitality-returning Celestial Stone must be releasing the spiritual power it had absorbed from the Thousandsword Mountain Sect and Bliss Mountain Sect disciples to nourish this heaven and earth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a moment of silence, Nie Tian said, “The Bliss Mountain Sect’s ancient golden starship is leaving soon. What’s your plan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“We’re leaving too, Nie Tian,” Yue Yanxi said with a serious expression. “I know that this place has many secrets, and deriving enlightenment from the five elemental regions will help us greatly with our cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“But in the end, this place belongs to you, and you’ll make it your base.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“If we mastered the secret magics and incantations that are branded in those blessed regions, they would disappear completely. We have numerous incantations and ancient records in our headquarters, so we can do without the ones here.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I suppose you can leave them to people who are more important to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian nodded and said, “So do you want to leave on your own, or through that teleportation portal, Senior Yue?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Only the people from the Domain of the Falling Stars knew about the Domain of the Falling Stars. Since Guan Fu and Jian Tong didn’t know about it, he was intentionally vague about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He meant that he would allow the Divine Flame Sect disciples to teleport to the Domain of the Falling Stars through the teleportation portal in the palace. Then, they would be able to return to the Domain of Heaven’s Boundaries through the teleportation portals the Lei Clan had set up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yue Yanxi waved his hand and said, “No, we’re good. We’ll leave on our own. There might still be other secrets in this forbidden region. We don’t intend to return to the Domain of Heaven’s Boundaries right away. We’re hoping to do a bit more exploration and see if we can come to some discoveries.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Guan Fu chimed in, “We’re planning to do the same thing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian nodded. “Alright, if that’s what you want.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He also wanted to spend some time alone. Instead of returning to the Domain of the Falling Stars, he intended to stay and practice cultivation in this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yin Yanan from the Beast-controlling Sect seemed rather hesitant and embarrassed as she said, “Well… Nie Tian, could I stay here for a while? Don’t worry. I won’t touch a blade of grass here, and I’ll try not to derive any enlightenment. I just want to stay until my Frost Blood Python is finished with the upgrade of its bloodline.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After pondering the matter for a few seconds, Nie Tian nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“You’d better not try anything and draw doom on your sect, kid.” Yue Yanxi warned her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yin Yanan snorted weakly and said, “I know what to do and what not to do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, the Ultimates Reverse Grand Spell Formation was finally fully reversed, and the Bliss Mountain Sect’s ancient golden starship soared up into the heavens, giving rise to loud rumbles.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They didn’t even recover their spiritual power first. It appeared that they knew that a long night was fraught with dreams, (idiom: a long delay means trouble) and were afraid that Nie Tian would go back on his word.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This time, the golden starship didn’t run into much resistance in the atmosphere of mixed auras, and sailed through it successfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The members of the Divine Flame Sect, the Guan Clan, and the Jian Clan had already recovered a significant amount of their spiritual power in the palace. Furthermore, since they all had huge stacks of spirit stones in their possession, they weren’t afraid that they wouldn’t be able to replenish their spiritual seas after leaving here.</span></p>
