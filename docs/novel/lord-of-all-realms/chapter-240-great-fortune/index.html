 <p><span>They didn’t have any other encounters on their way back to Shatter City, and they arrived home at sunset.</span></p>
 <p><span>In their residence...</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Ye had many wooden shelves in his spacious room, on which numerous scrolls regarding equipment forging were placed, along with a number of bizzare-looking spiritual materials.</span></p>
 <p><span>This was the first time that Nie Tian had visited Li Ye’s room.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Alright. Let’s divide our plunder,” Li Ye said, smiling.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian nodded before taking all the Space Spirit Jades he had mined out of his bracelet of holding and placing them on the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span>There were 320 of them. According to their original agreement, Nie Tian should split them three ways with Pei Qiqi and Li Ye.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, now that he had given the crystallized Space Spirit Jade away to Pei Qiqi, Pei Qiqi had agreed to give up her share of the Space Spirit Jades.</span></p>
 <p><span>Therefore, he counted out 110 Space Spirit Jades and separated them from the rest before giving Li Ye a look, showing that they belonged to Li Ye now.</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Ye didn’t say any pleasantries. Instead, he laughed broadly as he put them away.</span></p>
 <p><span>He had only mined a few dozen Space Spirit Jades himself, but by bringing Nie Tian with them, he had almost tripled his gains, which was far more than he had expected.</span></p>
 <p><span>Thus, he was in a very good mood.</span></p>
 <p><span>Afterwards, Nie Tian took out three bracelets of holding and one ring of holding, which belonged to Yang Ling and three other Wild Fire members.</span></p>
 <p><span>Pei Qiqi had already cracked the restrictive spell on the ring using her spatial magics on their way back to Shatter City.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian sent a wisp of his psychic awareness into the ring of holding and summoned out every spiritual material within it.</span></p>
 <p><span>One item after another, all the valuable belongings that he had looted from the three other Wild Fire members also flew out of the three bracelets of holding.</span></p>
 <p><span>It wasn’t long before numerous spiritual materials were piled up in Li Ye’s spacious room.</span></p>
 <p><span>Standing off to the side, Pei Qiqi didn’t show a shred of impatience as she watched Nie Tian go through all the items.</span></p>
 <p><span>After all, she had changed the way she saw Nie Tian after what they had gone through together in the Void Illusion Mountain Range, along with the fact that Nie Tian had readily given the crystallized Space Spirit Jade to her. That was why she was willing to take on the responsibility to help Nie Tian trade in materials for himself.</span></p>
 <p><span>Upon seeing that it was going to take Nie Tian some time to sort through the numerous items, she took the initiative to crouch down and help him with them.</span></p>
 <p><span>She shot a glance at Li Ye, who was fondling a Space Spirit Jade with a foolish smile on his face, before blurting, “Come here and help us.” </span></p>
 <p><span>“Alright.” Li Ye put the jade down and joined them.</span></p>
 <p><span>After a short while, the three of them had sorted and counted everything from within the ring of holding and three bracelets of holding.</span></p>
 <p><span>Altogether, there were 1,200 spirit stones, five spirit jades, fifty pieces of fire-attributed spiritual materials that were similar to Flame Crystals, and six wood-attributed spiritual materials. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>There were also 16 bottles of medicinal pills, most of which were healing medicines, with only a couple serving the purpose of restoring flesh power and psychic power.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian only kept the flesh power and psychic power-restoring pills for himself and put the others in a different pile.</span></p>
 <p><span>Other than the spiritual materials and medicinal pills, there were about a dozen spiritual incantations. However, none of them were very advanced, so they were of little value to Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span>There were also three sets of Medium grade spiritual armor and six Medium grade spiritual tools.</span></p>
 <p><span>Since each and every one of them required a certain cultivation attribute to utilize, they were of no use to Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span>Looking at the pile of items that Nie Tian had set aside, Pei Qiqi said, “Keep what you need and &nbsp;give the rest to me. I’ll sell them for you and return the spirit stones I get to you in a few days.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“1,200 spirit stones and five spirit jades...” Nie Tian’s eyes shone with excitement as he stared at the spirit stones and spirit jades.</span></p>
 <p><span>Although he hadn’t been holding on to his last spirit stone before he had gone to the Void Illusion Mountain Range with Li Ye and Pei Qiqi, he had been in need of more spirit stones.</span></p>
 <p><span>Other than the three spirit jades that Hua Mu had left him, which he would only use to help himself break through into the Heaven stage, he didn’t have enough spirit stones to cultivate with.</span></p>
 <p><span>There were only three months left in his identity medallion. Once that time ran up, he would be immediately thrown out of Shatter City by members of the Blood Skull.</span></p>
 <p><span>He had never imagined that their trip to the Void Illusion Mountain Range would turn out to be so fruitful.</span></p>
 <p><span>The spirit stones and spirit jades he had obtained from killing the four experts alone were enough to last him a long time in Shatter City.</span></p>
 <p><span>Let alone the spiritual armor, spell scrolls, and spiritual tools, which could also be traded for a substantial amount of spirit stones.</span></p>
 <p><span>He had a feeling that this trip to the Void Illusion Mountain Range had completely turned his unfavorable situation around.</span></p>
 <p><span>Seeing that Nie Tian seemed to be daydreaming, Pei Qiqi grew somewhat impatient and couldn’t help but urge, “Alright, pick up the pace and separate what you’re keeping from what you aren’t.” </span></p>
 <p><span>“Okay, okay.” With a broad smile on his face, Nie Tian rapidly put away the spirit stones, spirit jades, a few bottles of medicinal pills, and spiritual materials that had fire and wood attributes. Then, he shoved the rest to Pei Qiqi, along with the three bracelets of holding.</span></p>
 <p><span>Yang Ling’s ring of holding, which now only had the Golden Stone Rhino’s skinned body inside, was quite precious. Considering his current cultivation base, he didn’t plan to wear it for the time being. Therefore, he decided to put it away, in case an occasion might come up where he could use it.</span></p>
 <p><span>He assumed that he wouldn’t make much use of the extra bracelets of holding, so he handed them to Pei Qiqi as well.</span></p>
 <p><span>“This is it?” Pei Qiqi asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian nodded and said, “Thank you for going through all the trouble to do this for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Yeah.” Pei Qiqi didn’t say much, but went ahead and stored everything that Nie Tian presented to her into the three bracelets of holding. Then, she said, “According to my estimation, I believe these things are worth about 5,000 spirit stones, more or less.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian’s expression flickered.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I’ll come back to you in seven days and bring you your spirit stones,” said Pei Qiqi.</span></p>
 <p><span>Just as Nie Tian was about to express his gratitude again, Pei Qiqi added, “Do you need any special spiritual materials or things that you need in your cultivation? If there’s anything you need, I can use the spirit stones I get from selling this stuff to buy them for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian pondered for a moment and said, “If that’s the case, then please find me some spiritual materials with fire and wood attributes. If you can find spiritual materials that contain star power, buy me some of those, too. Many thanks!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Star power?” Shock could be seen in Pei Qiqi’s eyes as she spoke after going blank for a brief moment, “It’s easy to find spiritual materials with the fire and wood attributes in Shatter City. However, spiritual materials that contain star power are very rare here. People can only find very few occasionally falling out of spatial rifts in the Void Illusion Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p><span>“So not only will it be hard to find them, but their price will also be rather high.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Well... for the sake of the crystallized Space Spirit Jade, I’ll do my best to search for them, but I can’t guarantee that I’ll be able to find them for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian nodded. “I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span>At that moment, Li Ye jumped in and said, “Senior martial sister, Hua Tian doesn’t know anything about spatial magics, so there’s no point for him to keep the Space Spirit Jades. Why don’t you buy them from him?” </span></p>
 <p><span>Upon hearing his words, Nie Tian looked down at the pile of Space Spirit Jades and said to Pei Qiqi, “He’s right. I have no use for them.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Pei Qiqi’s eyebrow rose as she looked at the pile of Space Spirit Jades with a longing gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span>Very few people had mastered spatial magics, just as there were very few spiritual materials that contained spatial energy.</span></p>
 <p><span>The reason why she had organized this trip to the Void Illusion Mountain Range was because Space Spirit Jades were essential for her, since an enormous amount were needed for her to forge spatial tools, as well as study and research spatial spell formations.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I’ll give you 3,000 spirit stones for these Space Spirit Jades.” After a brief moment of hesitation, she continued, “But I don’t have that many spirit stones on hand. I’ll need to sell my loot from the Void Illusion Mountain Range first, and then pay you in full.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Sure, that’s not a problem,” Nie Tian said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Good. It’s settled then. I’ll take all the Space Spirit Jades with me.” Pei Qiqi placed her milky-white hand on the pile of Space Spirit Jades, and in the next moment, they all flew into her ring of holding.</span></p>
 <p><span>After that, she nodded gently at Nie Tian before stepping lightly and gracefully out of Li Ye’s room.</span></p>
 <p><span>As soon as Pei Qiqi left, Li Ye patted Nie Tian’s shoulder and said with a broad smile on his face, “Well...? I treat you well, don’t I?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Hahaha, yeah, thank you!” Nie Tian replied. “Be my guest. If there’s anything you want, just go ahead and take it.”</span></p>
 <p><span>He thought Li Ye wanted to take advantage of his good mood and ask something for himself.</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Ye shook his head. “Hahaha, I appreciate the gesture, but I’m good. I’ve lived in Shatter City for years. Throughout the years, I’ve accumulated fortune of a sort. These things are far from enough to interest me. You just need to remember that you owe me one.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Okay, I’ll keep that in mind,” Nie Tian said without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Good,” Li Ye said. “You can go back to your room now, and I won’t need you to work for me these days, so just focus on your cultivation.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian was indeed very eager to practice cultivation. He said, “Great. I’ll see you later.” </span></p>
 <p><span>“Yeah, go. Don’t forget that you owe me one.”</span></p>
