<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian’s tough stance deeply surprised Zong Zheng from the Ice Pavilion Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qian Buhui, Gu Yuan, and Cao Mou also had awkward expressions on their faces, not knowing what to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As far as they saw it, it wasn’t that hard to accept if Xia Yi was only borrowing the Flame Dragon Armor so that he could defeat Basto. They didn’t understand why Nie Tian was being so stubborn.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, they also knew that if Nie Tian hadn’t come to the Realm of a Hundred Battles with Zhao Shanling, they wouldn’t have been able to turn the situation around by themselves. Therefore, they were all in Nie Tian’s debt.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The other two Soul realm experts from the Spirit Condor remained silent the whole time, as if Hua Mu could speak for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Wangling didn’t utter a word either.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Only Zhao Shanling expressed his approval of Nie Tian’s decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Hua Mu pondered in silence for some time before breaking the ice by laughing and saying, “Good, if that’s your decision, then we’ll respect it. I doubt that Xia Yi and the Heaven Palace Sect will try anything on you before the war against the outsiders ends. Even if they want to seek trouble with you, they’ll probably do it after the trouble with the outsiders is over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“The reason Xia Yi dares to threaten me is that he assumes that he’s the only one who’ll be able to contend against Basto.” Nie Tian gave a cold harrumph as he laid his eyes on the corpses of the several seventh grade outsiders. With a soft voice, he said, “Seniors, I have a favor to ask.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Just name it,” Dong Wangling said.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I wonder if you can give the corpses of these seventh grade outsiders to me,” Nie Tian said.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Reluctance appeared on Zong Zheng and Qian Buhui’s faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Like seventh grade spirit beasts, these seventh grade outsiders’ corpses could be put to great use.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Considering these experts’ cultivation bases and strength, they would be able to extract many precious materials from these corpses, which they could use to either forge spiritual tools or refine medicinal pills. Either way, their strength would benefit greatly from them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Compared to seventh grade spirit beasts, seventh grade outsiders were much more difficult to find, so they all seemed somewhat reluctant to give them up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Hua Mu was the first to state his stance. “We’ll give you whichever outsider corpses the Spirit Condor should get.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Wangling chimed in, “Whichever the Dong Clan should get is yours to take too!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I’ll only need their corpses. You can still have their storage rings.” Nie Tian explained. “Their corpses will be put to a very important use. For this, I’m willing to promise you one thing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“What is it?” Zong Zheng asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“One day, I’ll help you walk out of the Domain of the Falling Stars to a wider heaven and earth,” Nie Tian said.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing these words, every Soul realm expert’s eyes widened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“What makes you think that you’ll be able to help us walk out of the Domain of the Falling Stars?” Cao Mou asked hastily.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zong Zheng, Qian Buhui, and the others also breathed heavily as strong desire brimmed their eyes, as if they had cultivated their whole lives for this very purpose.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“He does have such an ability,” Zhao Shanling said with an expressionless face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Hua Mu took a deep look at Nie Tian and asked, “Has your master resolved that star map?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhao Shanling and Hua Mu’s words made the other Soul realm experts’ eyes light up. All of the Dong Clan members that were gathered in this place exchanged awed glances with one another.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Before Zong Zheng could ask about the details, Hua Mu said, “Now is not the time to discuss the details. You only need to know that Nie Tian will be able to get you out of the Domain of the Falling Stars in the foreseeable future. The Spirit Condor can guarantee that Nie Tian’s promise is well-based.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Alright!” Zong Zheng exclaimed. “I’m willing to give up the seventh grade outsider corpse that belongs to me. Consider it my ticket to the ship that’ll take me out of the Domain of the Falling Stars.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Same with me!” Qian Buhui also said excitedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The other Soul realm experts then took turns to express that they were also willing to give Nie Tian the outsider corpses that should have belonged to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a solemn expression, Hua Mu said, “I’ll go talk to the Heaven Palace Sect, Nie Tian. You can be assured that Xia Yi won’t dare to try to seek trouble with the Realm of Flame Heaven anytime soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Many thanks!” Nie Tian said.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Hua Mu smiled heartily. “You don’t need to thank me. If you hadn’t found me that Fruit of Life, perhaps I wouldn’t be standing here now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zong Zheng gasped with astonishment, then gazed at Nie Tian with a completely different look in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Hua Mu had kept this matter a secret. Until now, the other two Soul realm experts from the Spirit Condor were the only ones who knew about it. Even Zong Zheng, who was their ally in the Realm of Endless Ice, knew nothing of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Since the Spirit Condor and the Ice Pavilion Sect were both based in the Realm of Endless Ice, Zong Zheng had known Hua Mu from long ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He knew that Hua Mu was running out of lifespan. For many years, he had roamed different realms and used the Spirit Condor’s resources to look for magical items that could slow his aging.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, when he had heard that Hua Mu had shattered the Spirit God Sect’s grand spell formation and slaughtered their disciples for what they had done to Zhen Huilan, he had realized that Hua Mu’s lifespan problem must have been solved.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, he hadn’t known how Hua Mu had solved it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Only now did he realize that the reason why Hua Mu was still alive was because Nie Tian had found him a Fruit of Life. He finally understood why Hua Mu and the Spirit Condor had supported Nie Tian at every chance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian looked at Dong Wangling and asked, “Senior Dong, would you please find me a secluded location where I can go into secluded cultivation for a few days?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Of course, come with me.” With these words, Dong Wangling strode away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He made a grabbing motion in the air, and a few resilient belts of pure spiritual power shot out and wrapped themselves around the floating seventh grade outsider corpses. Then, he pulled them away like floating balloons.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">FIZZ! FIZZ! FIZZ!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As he came close, the teleportation portal in the Dong Clan started rotating and set to a specific location.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian took a look at Zhao Shanling. “Please remember our deals, Senior Zhao.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, he turned to Hua Mu and said, “Uncle Hua, I hope you can keep an eye on my master for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Hua Mu nodded with an assuring look in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhao Shanling snorted with a smile and said, “Don’t worry. Since I gave you my word, nothing will change it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His heart finally put at ease, Nie Tian followed Dong Wangling into the teleportation portal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li wanted to catch up to Nie Tian, but Dong Baijie shook his head at her, signaling for her not to do so. She then wanted to speak, but also stopped on second thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">There were too many Soul realm patriarchs here. In their presence, Dong Li and Dong Baijie were juniors of juniors. It wasn’t their place to speak their opinion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She had wanted to defend Nie Tian on a few occasions, but Dong Baijie had stopped her with stern looks every time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Watching Nie Tian follow the patriarch of her clan to his personal cultivation location, she felt somewhat anxious. She wanted to stay by Nie Tian’s side as he cultivated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Nie Tian needs some time to gather his thoughts and plan his next move,” Dong Baijie said in a low voice. “Right now, he doesn’t need you to be by his side. Since our patriarch is going with him, nothing will happen to him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Alright...” Dong Li said, nodding reluctantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“It’s time for us to head to the Realm of Mystic Heaven, everyone,” Hua Mu said.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Everyone nodded. “Alright."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Afterward, they had the Dong Clan members set up the teleportation portal, and then entered it somewhat anxiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Only Zhao Shanling remained here.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Senior Zhao, aren’t you…?” Dong Qianqi, the clanmaster of the Dong Clan, asked in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“What happens in the Realm of Mystic Heaven has nothing to do with me,” Zhao Shanling said with an expressionless face. “Now that the outsiders are gathered in one realm, they must have learned that someone has sealed the spatial rifts in the Realm of Flame Heaven and the Realm of a Hundred Battles. The spatial rift in the Realm of Mystic Heaven must be heavily guarded right now. I wouldn’t do such a stupid thing as going there now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Besides, I’ve already gotten what I wanted from my senior martial brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“The final battle between the humans and the outsiders in the Realm of Mystic Heaven won’t concern me in the slightest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these irresponsible words, Zhao Shanling ignored the strange looks in the Dong Clan members’ eyes and disappeared into a spatial rift behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Perhaps he was the only person who wouldn’t be affected if the Domain of the Falling Stars fell into the outsiders’ hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Given his cultivation base and profound mastery of spatial magics, he would be able to escape to a remote space whenever he wanted to.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">…</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Inside a spacious, closed room, shock filled Nie Tian’s face as he looked around at a large number of extremely pure spirit jades.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Wangling smiled proudly and said, “We’re in an underground stone room that I built in the heart of a rich spirit jade vein. The spirit jades you’re looking at are all tens of thousands of years old. Even though spirit crystals haven’t come to form yet, this is still a good place for Qi warriors under the Void domain to cultivate in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Good doesn’t describe it!” Nie Tian marveled. “Aside from the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace’s grand hall, which I visited during the Heaven Gate trial, I’ve never been to another place where the spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth is this rich.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Compared to this room, the cultivation rooms in the Blood Skull’s headquarters were not even worth mentioning.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All that Nie Tian did was stand there, but he could still sense wisps of pure spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth flooding into his spiritual sea and entering his nine vortexes of spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He believed that by cultivating in this room, the efficiency at which he expanded and refined his vortexes of spiritual power would improve ten-fold.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">No wonder Dong Li would progress in her cultivation every time she finished an adventure and returned to the Dong Clan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The reserve power of ancient clans like the Dong Clan was indeed shocking. They had the ability to help their members rapidly accumulate strength and make breakthroughs soon after they achieved the right mental state.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If his master Wu Ji had a cultivation room like this one, perhaps he would have accumulated enough spiritual power to break through into the Soul realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a moment of pondering, Dong Wangling said, “I won’t ask you how you plan to deal with those outsider corpses, Nie Tian. You’re welcome to use this cultivation room for as long as you like. Our clan owes you this much. Dong Li told me how she obtained the Fruit of Life when she gave it to me.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“If it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t have gained these extra years of lifespan. Even though, unlike your master, I still had some lifespan to spare, any human would appreciate some extra years. After all, our lifespans are rather limited.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I also heard that you helped Dong Li gain the corpse of an eighth grade black phoenix, and brought most of our clan members back from that dimension.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Even though Zhao Shanling played a very important role in ending the crisis in the Realm of a Hundred Battles, it was you who persuaded him to come to our aid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“We’ll remember what you’ve done for our clan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I only did what I thought was right,” Nie Tian said modestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Alright, I’ll leave you to it,” Dong Wangling said, smiling. “I still have to go to the Realm of Mystic Heaven. I’ve got to give the Heaven Palace Sect face. Who knows whether their patriarch can advance to the Void domain or not. Even though the odds are against him, if he somehow succeeds, and finds fault with our clan in the future, it’ll be very troublesome for us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, he left through the teleportation portal, which only led to the Dong Clan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as he vanished in the portal, Nie Tian summoned the Bone Blood Demon and had it drain the blood of all of the seventh grade outsider corpses.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Bone Blood Demon had possessed middle Soul realm battle prowess before Nie Tian had taken it to the Realm of Flame Heaven.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the Realm of Flame Heaven, it had absorbed and refined a copious amount of blood from numerous fourth and fifth grade outsiders.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This time, it had once again massacred a large number of fourth, fifth, and sixth grade outsiders around the Dong Clan, the Gu Clan, the Cao Clan, and the Pill Pavilion Sect, and refined their blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If it went on and refined the blood of these seventh grade outsiders, would its strength rise to a new level?</span></p>

 <p>Jiaotu (椒図, pinyin: Jiāotú), the ninth son of the dragon, is the guardian of households. In an ancient legend the Dragon King tried to enter the house of his son Jiaotu, which turned out to be extremely difficult. Only after a long time and many attempts, did he finally succeed. Jiaotu is often seen on front doors protecting the house from burglars, etc.</p>

 <p>Alright, this is it, all nine sons of the dragon. I actually learn a lot about them, things I didn't know before, while I looked for materials about them. Hope you like them.</p>
