<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Lei Tianqi didn’t go with Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He only briefly explained the situation to him before sending him on his way. He told him that the Lei Clan and the Divine Flame Sect had together established a total of seven inter-realm teleportation portals between the Domain of Heaven’s Boundaries and the Domain of the Falling Stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yue Yanxi was currently in the region where the fourth teleportation portal was located.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Following Lei Tianqi’s instructions, Nie Tian teleported three times, and finally arrived in the region where Yue Yanxi was waiting for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It was the region that was both marked out on the star map in the Spirit Pearl and designated as the fourth set of spatial coordinates in the teleportation portal in the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">SHEW!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian suddenly appeared in a teleportation portal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He looked around and found himself inside a spacious sealed cave surrounded by dark brown rocky walls, with a faint lightning ward over them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Lei Tianqi had long since told him what to do. He looked up at the dome of the cave, located a fine rift in the lightning ward, and made a vigorous leap.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">FZZZ!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The lightning ward instantly split up, as did the rocks behind it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He went through without meeting any obstructions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the next moment, he found himself standing on a meteor that seemed to be floating in the depths of the starry river.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">There wasn’t even a shred of spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth around him. There were only distant shining stars and countless meteors that floated wherever he looked at.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Very close to one another, they filled up this entire region.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If an enormous ancient starship were to sail into this region, it would definitely hit these floating meteors.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All of the meteors seemed extremely solid; even ancient starships might not be able to survive collisions with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian finally realized why Qi warriors from the Domain of Heaven’s Boundaries hadn’t been able to sail through this region to the Domain of the Falling Stars over the past thousands of years.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Hmm?” As he looked back, Nie Tian realized that the rift he had just flown through was completely healed again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, he was surprised to notice that about a dozen ice-cold human corpses were floating in places not far from him, all of whom were dressed in Divine Flame Sect garments.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He also noticed several air-transportation spiritual tools, which appeared to have been pierced by sharp weapons. Some had crashed into floating meteors, while others were floating in the dark ice-cold space with the dead Divine Flame Sect disciples.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“What the hell?!” His expression flickered as he unleashed his soul awareness to examine his surroundings, but failed to sense any flesh auras or soul fluctuations.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Who killed these people from the Divine Flame Sect?! What happened here?!” With these questions, he blurred into action and flashed back and forth among the floating corpses to examine their cultivation bases.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Soon, he came to a conclusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All of these Worldly realm and Profound realm Divine Flame Sect disciples must have been waiting for him in this place. Now, they were all dead, their air-transportation spiritual tools destroyed and their rings of holding taken away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They must have encountered powerful enemies while they had been waiting for him. Then, they had been killed while they had split up to flee.</span></p>
 <p><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“As one of the eight major powers in the Domain of Heaven’s Boundaries, the Divine Flame Sect actually had their disciples ambushed by others. Those who did this must be from a sect that is equally powerful.</span></em></p>
 <p><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“Can it be that the fact that the Divine Flame Sect discovered something in this region has somehow leaked?</span></em></p>
 <p><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“It’ll be very troublesome if that’s the case!”</span></em></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He frowned as he realized that his trip to this region might not be a pleasant one.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, Yue Yanxi and the other powerful experts from the Divine Flame Sect might be exploring this mysterious region in further locations.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Those dead disciples must have been charged with the mission of waiting for him and bringing him to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, even Yue Yanxi probably didn’t know that these disciples had already been attacked and wiped out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Without people from the Divine Flame Sect to show him the way, he had absolutely no idea where to go.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Furthermore, since someone had killed the Divine Flame Sect disciples in this region, they might still be in the vicinity. If he were to move around randomly, he might very well be discovered...</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Eyebrows knitted, Nie Tian hastily unleashed his Heaven Eyes to conduct an extensive scan of his surroundings, fearing that someone might still be nearby.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He decided to terminate this trip and return to Domain of the Falling Stars through the teleportation portal he had come from if he were to discover anyone who wasn’t from the Divine Flame Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Standing on the meteor where the teleportation portal was hidden, he continued to scan his surroundings with his Heaven Eyes. Soon, he discovered more dead Divine Flame Sect disciples and their air-transportation spiritual tools in further locations.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It seemed that everyone that had been waiting for him in this place had been killed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, the killers didn’t seem to have discovered the secret teleportation portal, which was somewhat surprising.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If they had discovered this teleportation portal, they would have been able to follow the vine to get the melon (idiom: track someone down by following clues), and descend upon the Thunder Mountain Sect after three transits.</span></p>
 <p><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“Lei Tianqi must have established a restrictive spell to hide this teleportation portal after setting it up. Lei Tianqi is at the early Void domain. Only cultivators at his level or higher will be able to sense the existence of his spell. Since the teleportation portal hasn’t been discovered, there’s only one possibility: there weren’t any Void domain experts among those who came here and killed the Divine Flame Sect disciples.”</span></em></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian didn’t dare to make any rash moves. Standing on the meteor, he pondered his choices and waited, prepared to leave at any moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Moments passed...</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A soaring firebird suddenly entered Nie Tian’s view. The bird was wreathed in fierce flames as it charged directly towards him like a crashing meteor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A small figure of a female could be seen on the bird’s back, as if she had become one with her mount.</span></p>
 <p><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“Such fierce flame power... She must be from the Divine Flame Sect.”&nbsp;</span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian felt slightly relieved.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the blazing bird approached the meteor he was standing on, he took a close look at it, and discovered that it was actually an air-transportation spiritual tool.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It seemed to be made from the skeleton of a bird. Each and every crimson bone was releasing raging flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The small figure on it was surrounded by crimson flames, and thus couldn’t be seen clearly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">SHEW!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the spiritual tool flew closer, the small figure suddenly jumped off it. She turned out to be a young woman who was small, but extremely shapely. Brandishing a fire-wreathed long whip, she attacked Nie Tian without the slightest hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The whip seemed to be made from a tail of an Earth Flame Beast. Hearing its whoosh, Nie Tian felt like an enraged Earth Flame Beast was roaring and charging at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even the soul awareness he unleashed to examine the long whip seemed to be burned, as he experienced a stabbing pain in his true soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The girl struck out with the whip a few times, and a huge blazing net came to form, which seemed to be able to turn anyone into ashes, along with their souls.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Wait!” Nie Tian shouted as he summoned the Flame Star, gathered strength, and slashed it towards the incoming blazing net.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Fiery light instantly came out of the Flame Star, extending the saber by several meters, as it approached the blazing net.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">FIZZ! FIZZ!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The moment his spiritual power made contact with the blazing net, a surge of fierce, unruly flame power bombarded the Flame Star, as if it had finally found a vent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian’s expression flickered as he watched flames crawl up the Flame Star and his saber-bearing arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His sleeve was instantly burned to ashes. The terrifying flame power then made reckless attempts to infiltrate his skin through his pores, as if it were hoping to burn him to ashes as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Frowning, he hastily summoned power from his spiritual core to contend against the invading flame power, and was barely able to stop those flames from entering his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even so, his arm was burned and became as red as steel from a furnace.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Shaking his arm, he bolted backwards to put some distance between him and the girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">CRACKLE! CRACKLE!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the girl struck the meteors that were even tougher than metal with her long whip, they crumbled and turned into flying dust.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, the girl flipped her wrist again, and her whip thrashed towards him again like a roaring Earth Flame Beast.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“If you’re from the Divine Flame Sect, you should know that I’m the one you’ve been waiting for!” Nie Tian shouted at the top of his lungs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The girl suddenly went blank, her life-claiming whip freezing in midair. Then, she exclaimed in her soft voice, “Tell me your name then!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“My name is Nie Tian!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Nie Tian!” The girl muttered, the blazing long whip in her hand going out instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Afterwards, she jumped back onto her fire bird’s back and said with a cold face, “Get up now! I’ll take you out of here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Take me out of here?” Nie Tian asked, his brow furrowed in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The girl gave Nie Tian a nasty look and said with an urgent tone, “That bitch from the Bliss Mountain Sect must still be looking for me in this area. I can’t stay here for too long.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“If it’s not safe here, why don’t we return through that teleportation portal and seek help from the Lei Clan?” Nie Tian suggested.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In Nie Tian’s opinion, compared to going to Yue Yanxi and the others, returning through the unexposed teleportation portal would be a safer choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Nonsense! I’ll never seek help from subordinate forces like the Lei Clan!” The girl said with a decisiveness that could sever nails and chop iron.</span></p>

 <p>Can you make grass grow by pulling it? Can you bake a cake faster by turning up the temperature in the oven? In nature, things happen in their own way and at their own pace. Trying to make things happen faster than they do naturally often leads to disasters. The grass gets pulled out and dies. The cake gets burnt and has to be thrown away.</p>
 <p>A river rarely takes a straight course, meandering instead through the natural shape of the landscape, keeping to the lowest points, moving around mountains and hills. But the water keeps flowing powerfully and eventually reaches the sea.</p>
 <p>Like nature, our own achievements can take time, and this is no bad thing. For example, I have seen for myself the results of fast tracking students through the grades and promoting them to university courses at a young age. The adults they become are often socially underdeveloped and less able to function skillfully in the complex real world: they have, in a sense, been ruined by speed. Let's learn a lesson from nature, and do things well, in their own time.</p>
