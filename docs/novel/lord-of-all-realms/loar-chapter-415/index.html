 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, many of the Qi warriors from the other clans, who were at the middle or late Greater Heaven stage, suddenly fell to the ground with blood coming out of their ears and eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even worse, some early Greater Heaven stage cultivators, who hadn’t spent much time forging their soul sea and thus didn’t possess significant psychic power, were caught off-guard. With their souls pierced, they died instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Mingxuan’s face turn pale with fright as he reminded everyone loudly, “Watch out! It’s the Phantasms’ psychic attack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, his reminder came a little late.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After yelling out these words, he looked over his shoulder and discovered that some early Greater Heaven stage members who weren’t skilled at using their psychic power had already collapsed to the ground upon the strong impact from the Phantasms’ psychic attack. With their souls riddled with holes or simply shattered, many died instant deaths.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even those with higher cultivation bases had fallen to the ground, where they hastily fetched medicinal pills with grim expressions to cure the injuries to their souls.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All of them had focused on protecting themselves from the corrosive phantasm Qi with their spiritual power shields, but had ignored the defense of their souls.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as the sharp screech echoed out, they all took serious blows. They were either killed or severely injured, their miserable wails filling the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Hmm?!" Dong Mingxuan couldn’t help but exclaim as he set his eyes on the Dong Clan’s Qi warriors, confusion appearing on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, the other Worldly realm experts who had been marching in the front, as well as Cao Qiushui, Qian Xin, Gu Haofeng, and Qin Yan, all noticed the Dong Clan members’ condition: none of them died or had blood coming out of their eyes and ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All of them seemed unharmed by the Phantasms’ psychic attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Each and every one of them cast their shocked and admiring gaze towards Dong Li, as they were all very grateful for her wise instructions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Our Miss is so awesome!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“We made the right decision by following her!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Without our Miss’ reminder, none of us would have been able to ward off the Phantasms’ psychic attack. We would either have been killed or severely injured!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Respect and admiration filled their eyes as they looked at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, under her subordinates’ gazes, Dong Li’s expression grew somewhat uneasy, as she secretly felt ashamed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Dong Li!!” Cao Qiushui couldn’t help but yell at her. “How come your men are the only ones who are unhurt? If you knew what was going to happen, why didn’t you remind us?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qian Xin and Gu Haofeng’s expressions also grew unpleasant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even Qin Yan’s expression grew grim as she stepped over and asked with her eyes fixed on Dong Li, “What’s that about, Li?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li hadn’t expected the change would take place so abruptly and catch everyone else off guard.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">By the time she realized she should have told everyone, it was already too late. People from the other clans or sects had already sustained different degrees of injuries.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Well... I wasn’t sure that the Phantasms would launch psychic attacks,” Dong Li said with a deeply embarrassed expression on her face. “I was going to let Han Mu inform you guys about my speculation after he finished informing my men. However, who would have known that the change would come so abruptly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“This is not the time to place blame!” Shen Zhong from the Pill Pavilion Sect called out. “Everyone, learn from your lesson and do your best to guard your souls! There’s something strange about this place. The moment that screech echoed out, the mountain walls on both sides seemed to have enhanced its might. I should taken some of the responsibility, as I failed to notice the anomaly and discover what the Phantasms were up to.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing his words, everyone shut their mouths and hastily gathered their psychic power to form defenses protecting their souls, lest more psychic attacks should come.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Just as they expected, soon after their defenses were raised, another screech rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Hearing the screech, the well-prepared crowd looked at the mountain walls on both sides of the valley as they summoned psychic power to defend their souls.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The sparsely vegetated mountain walls were once again covered in watery, cyan energy. Immediately afterwards, the might of the ear-piercing screech skyrocketed. Like tens of thousands of sharp arrows, they shot towards everyone’s souls.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, since everyone was prepared, they did their utmost to defend against them. Some of them let out muffled groans, but no one was seriously injured.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qian Xin let out a cold harrumph and called out, “Dong Li! Next time you discover any anomalies, let us know, alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Of course, I will!” Dong Li said, grievance filling her stomach. “I was going to remind you. It was just that it happened too fast.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“That’d better be it.” Qian Xin seemed very displeased. “We’re all from the Realm of a Hundred Battles, and we’ve worked with each other many times. &nbsp;I hope we can trust each other instead of harboring disloyalty! Please save your schemes for our enemies!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li seemed rather embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After the incident, everyone raised their guard and didn’t rush into the depths of the valley.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Everyone guarded their souls tightly, worrying that they would face more psychic attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, the Phantasms at the depths of the valley seemed to have discovered that their psychic attacks were no longer effective, and thus stopped attacking them with screeches.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With gritted teeth, Dong Li shot Nie Tian a nasty look and said, “Wu Tian, you come here and march by my side!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The two of them marched side by side after Dong Mingxuan. Behind them were Han Mu and the other Dong Clan members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“You got me good!” Dong Li said with a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Innocence filled Nie Tian’s face as he said, “What?! Without my reminder, at least two of your men would have died, and the others would have sustained serious injuries to their souls. There would be no way that they would be safe and well like they are now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“That’s not what I mean.” Dong Li seemed somewhat edgy. “Since you noticed the anomaly, you should have been more certain and clear about it. Everyone is suspicious about my intentions because of you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“That’s because I wasn’t completely certain myself!” Nie Tian explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Forget about it.” Dong Li was angry at Nie Tian’s ambiguity as well as her own indecision, which had led to the fact that she had only informed her own subordinates, and the others then raised suspicion and discontent towards her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“From now on, let me know as soon as you find any anomalies!” She said in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Okay..." Nie Tian coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At that moment, Shen Zhong, who was marching in the front, turned around and said to Qian Xin, who was marching behind him, “Keep an eye out for that kid beside Dong Li. There’s something unusual about him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qian Xin was taken aback. “That Wu Tian person?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Shen Zhong nodded vigorously. “He was the one who told Dong Li that those people from the Spirit God Sect had died from having their souls taken away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Also, did you notice that he was completely unaffected by both psychic attacks?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Dong Li’s other subordinates were also reminded in time. Every single one of them has a cultivation base higher than his, yet they all staggered and struggled to maintain a firm foothold.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Only Wu Tian was completely uninfluenced. That doesn’t make sense.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After hearing Shen Zhong’s analysis, Qian Xin, who was also from the Pill Pavilion Sect, realized that Nie Tian might have some secrets.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qin Yan from the Water Moon Chamber of Commerce also grew suspicious. Originally, she had been marching rather far from Dong Li. But now, she moved to a position closer to her, where she constantly snuck glances at Dong Li and Nie Tian, who were communicating in low voices.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She knew about Nie Tian’s actual identity, and she knew Dong Li very well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">From the details she had picked up, she suspected that Nie Tian, who was being berated by Dong Li, had been the one to have sensed the danger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“It must have been him!” Qin Yan muttered to herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">WHOOSH!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At that very moment, gray, misty souls rose from the top of the heads of the corpses, who had died from the Phantasms’ psychic attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the discarnate souls flew out, not only did they not dissipate into heaven and earth, but they also rapidly absorbed the faint phantasm Qi and quickly morphed into Specters, before beginning to attack their former clansmen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Two men, who seemed to have been close friends of one of the deceased, were taken by surprise while they were grieving over their friend’s death.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The dead man’s gray misty soul morphed into a wisp of cyan smoke and shot directly into their heads, where it ravaged their souls.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The two of them cried out as they used the psychic defenses they had formed to fight the Specter that used to be their friend.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Mingxuan realized what was happening and exclaimed, “Something is not right! The souls of the deceased are not disappearing. They must be influenced by the Phantasms’ magics!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Listen to me everyone! Destroy your dead friends’ discarnate souls as quickly as possible. Otherwise, their discarnate souls will absorb the phantasm Qi in this region and turn into Specters!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing these words, the people who were standing beside their deceased friends started destroying their friends’ discarnate souls, fighting off their grief.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">One gray, misty soul after another was rapidly bombarded and scattered before they could take advantage of the special environment and morph into Specters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a major scuffle, the two men, who had their souls invaded by the Specter, finally held on to their souls and survived the attack, their faces ghastly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though the discarnate souls of the deceased members had been destroyed one after another, everyone’s hearts grew increasingly heavy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Though protected by Qiu Liang’s fiery ring, they had already lost many people, and they hadn’t even marched through the valley yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">According to Cao Qiushui, this valley was only a defensive mechanism. The Phantasm relic was located in the lake behind it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Now, they truly felt the dreadfulness of the Phantasms.&nbsp;</span></p>
