<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian was deeply shaken. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had acquired Heavenly Wood Heal from the magical land where he had discovered a Tree of Life, or technically speaking, from that sleeping titan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had derived his knowledge of Heavenly Wood after spending a long period of time sorting through the broken message he had received from that titan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Heavenly Wood consisted of two magics, Heavenly Wood Heal and Heavenly Wood Thorns.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meanwhile, the seventy-two tree branches had become magical after he had duplicated the grand spell formation that had protected the Floragrim’s ancestral land and mysterious tree patterns had infused into them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Similar enormous trees grew in both these two magical places, as if they were somehow related.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">During his previous battles, he had accidentally enhanced the might of Heavenly Wood Thorns with the tree branches.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, he had never expected that the effect of Heavenly Wood Heal would be so greatly enhanced when he cast it within the unique spell formation formed by the tree branches.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Streams of rich and pure wood power continued to converge from his surroundings and infuse into him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As he examined himself with soul power from the fragmentary stars in his soul, he could see with absolute clarity that every torn muscle and cracked bone was healing at an eye-dazzling speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Within a few moments, all of his injuries were healed, both internal and external.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That was when he realized that rich wood power was still pouring into his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon seeing this, he didn’t stop his Heavenly Wood Heal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, he discovered that the rich wood power morphed into numerous wisps of green aura after entering his body and started converging on his ribs, which had sustained the most damage from his previous battle against Armes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As he continued to observe them with devoted attention, he saw, to his surprise, that his already healed ribs were actually turning from white to translucent and sparkling!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At the same time, his changing ribs seemed to be absorbing his flesh power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Soon, his ribs turned emerald green and translucent, very similar to the tree branches after being activated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had a very strong feeling that, after the change, his ribs had become incomparably tough and resilient.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian’s eyes snapped open, shock and disbelief written across his face. “What a way to refine my body!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had always considered Heavenly Wood Heal a powerful healing magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, now, after witnessing the grand changes his ribs had gone through, he realized that it could not only be used to heal injuries, but it was also a very profound body refinement magic!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Perhaps because his cultivation base had been too low before, or his body hadn’t been ready for such a revelation, the effect of Heavenly Wood Heal had been limited to healing injuries.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, now that he had entered the middle Greater Heaven stage, and had taken in copious amount of flesh power lately, subtle changes had occurred, which readied him for this new body refinement method!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a moment of disbelief, he felt overjoyed, and without hesitation, summoned his flesh power to cooperate with the rich wood power in refining more of his bones with this divine method.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He discovered that the bones that had been damaged during his battle against Armes seemed to be specially favored by Heavenly Wood Heal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The wisps of refining aura seemed to be unhappy about those previously weakened bones, and thus provided them with extra care, infusing them with power and refining them unceasingly.</span></p>
 <p><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“It seems that I might have to thank Armes for the damage he caused me!”&nbsp;</span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">he thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After another round of refinement, all of his previously damaged bones turned emerald green and translucent. At that moment, the changes seemed to come to a stop.</span></p>
 <p><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“Construction after destruction! Heavenly Wood Heal will only have optimal effects on damaged bones!</span></em></p>
 <p><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“Armes crushing my bones seemed to stir the Heavenly Wood Heal’s dissatisfaction with my fragile body. And it’s now taking it upon itself to refine my damaged bones with flesh power and wood power!”</span></em></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After coming to such a shocking conclusion, a vicious look appeared in Nie Tian’s eyes. “Armes! As powerful as you are, you will serve as a perfect whetstone for my body!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With this thought in mind, he summoned the seventy-two tree branches back to his ring of holding and rose to his feet, waiting for Armes’ arrival.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Not only did he not mask his aura with Life Stealth this time, but he even intentionally released a stronger aura into his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As he had expected, Armes found him within a short time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Decided to stop running, have you?” With these words, Armes walked casually into Nie Tian’s view, as if he were strolling in his own courtyard, Nie Tian’s image reflected in the prismatic crystal between his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian gazed deeply at him and also discovered his own image in the prismatic crystal between Armes’ eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as he did, he had a feeling as if Armes had locked him down, that no matter where he went, he would be able to locate him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian snorted. “I realize that you didn’t tell your other friends to help you surround me, so why would I still run?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Eyebrows furrowed, Armes said, “All those who came before me either haven’t awakened their core bloodline talents, like my never-do-well little brother, or come from weaker races, who have awakened their core bloodline talents, but still can’t withstand a single blow, like Stonemountain. None of them are presentable. Why would I want them to help me with a battle?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Good!” Grinning, Nie Tian suddenly flashed to right in front of Armes, but he didn’t summon his Flame Star or any other weapons.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Armes went blank briefly. Recalling that he had just suffered a serious blow from Nie Tian’s Rage Punch, he subconsciously wanted to unleash the core bloodline talent he had recently awakened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, he quickly noticed that Nie Tian wasn’t bearing any weapons in his hands. From the look of it, Nie Tian still wanted to fight him with his bare hands. Thus, he instantly changed his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“That fist strike of yours was pretty interesting,” he said. “Let’s see if you can hurt me with it this time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">To Nie Tian’s surprise, Armes put away his fine suit of armor before launching any attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In a split second, they were once again engaged in a fierce, close-up battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Their clashes created terrifying energy fluctuations, as if two vicious beasts were trying to tear each other to pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">What Nie Tian had expected happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Thanks to his exquisite battle skills, Armes quickly gained the upper hand, and continued to rain attacks on Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The only difference was that Nie Tian didn’t exert all means to defend himself this time. Instead, he continued exchanging attacks with Armes, heedless of the repeated heavy blows he was receiving from him, as if he had no fear of death.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Armes was gradually enraged by Nie Tian’s arrogance. After all, he had only dared to go through the unstable spatial rift because of his great confidence in his powerful spiritual armor and exceptional self-healing ability.&nbsp;</span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">&nbsp;“As a human, he actually dares to exchange attacks with me like this. Does he not know that humans have the weakest fleshly bodies of all races, and that their healing ability is far inferior to ours? What the hell is he thinking?”</span></em></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had healed most of his wounds soon after passing through that spatial rift.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He refused to believe that this human youngster would be able to heal himself faster than him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Their fierce battle went on for some time before Nie Tian realized that many of his bones were cracked, and his battle prowess started to drop significantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, he discovered that all of the bones that had been refined by Heavenly Wood Heal and become translucent and sparkling like emeralds remained perfectly fine.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After achieving his goal, Nie Tian laughed wildly, disregarding the blood flowing out of the corner of his mouth. “I dare you to come and get me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, he vanished again with a Starshift.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After Nie Tian left, Armes got down on one knee, panting heavily. Many of the wounds he had healed earlier had once again burst open, blood spilling from them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Staring furiously in the direction Nie Tian had left in, he took out a red item that looked very much like a heart, and started munching on it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Nie Tian!”</span></p>

 <p>In ancient times, many TCM physicians enjoyed high respect, and those with superb medical skills and respectable virtue earned the honorable title “Divine Doctors (神医).” They were even said to have real divine powers.</p>

His real name is said to be Qin Yueren, but &nbsp;people nicknamed him Bian Que after the mythical doctor Bian Que from the time of the Yellow Emperor. According to records, the Bian Que we talk about was a doctor of many specialties, conforming to the local needs wherever he traveled.</p>

It was there he encountered an old man who had stayed there for many years. Thankful for Bian Que's attentive service and politeness, the old man gave him a packet of medicine which he told Bian Que to boil in water. After taking this medicine, Bian Que gained the ability to see through the human body and thereby became an excellent <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostician" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(11, 0, 128); background: none" title="Diagnostician" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diagnostician</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(11, 0, 128); background: none" title="X-ray" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X-ray</a>-like ability. He also excelled in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(11, 0, 128); background: none" title="Pulse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pulse</a> taking and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(11, 0, 128); background: none" title="Acupuncture" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acupuncture</a> therapy. He is ascribed the authorship of <em><a class="new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bian_Que_Neijing&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(165, 88, 88); background: none" title="Bian Que Neijing (page does not exist)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bian Que Neijing</a></em> (Internal Classic of Bian Que). <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Dynasty" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(11, 0, 128); background: none" title="Han Dynasty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Han Dynasty</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicians" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(11, 0, 128); background: none" title="Physicians" target="_blank" rel="noopener">physicians</a> claimed to have studied his works, which have since been lost. Tales state that he was a doctor of many disciplines, conforming to the local needs wherever he went. For example, in one city he was a children's doctor, and in another a female physician.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px">One famous legend tells of how once when Bian Que was in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Cai" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(11, 0, 128); background: none" title="State of Cai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of Cai</a>, he saw the lord of the state at the time and told him that he had a disease, which Bian Que claimed was only in his skin. The lord brushed this aside as at that time he felt no symptoms, and told his attendants that Bian Que was just trying to profit from the fears of others. Bian Que is said to have visited the lord many times thereafter, telling him each time how this sickness was becoming progressively worse, each time spreading into more of his body, from his skin to his blood and to his organs. The last time Bian Que went to see the lord, he looked in from afar, and rushed out of the palace. When an attendant of the lord asked him why he had done this, he replied that the disease was in the marrow and was incurable. The lord was said to have died soon after.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px">Another legend stated that once, while visiting the state of Guo, he saw people mourning on the streets. Upon inquiring what their grievances were, he got the reply that the heir apparent of the lord had died, and the lord was in mourning. Sensing something afoot, he is said to have gone to the palace to inquire about the circumstances of the death. After hearing of how the prince "died", he concluded that the prince had not really died, but was rather in a coma-like state. He set a single acupuncture needle in the Baihu point on the head, helping the prince to regain consciousness. Herbal medicine was boiled to help the prince sit up, and after Bian Que prescribed the prince with more herbal medicine, the prince healed fully within twenty days.</p>

 <p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; font-weight: 400; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-style: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px">However, his extraordinary ability incurred jealousy. It was said when Bian Que visited the state of Qin, he was murdered by an assassin sent by Qin’s imperial physician Li Xi.</p>
