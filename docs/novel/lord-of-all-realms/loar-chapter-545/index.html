 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Chen Hao followed Ye Qin’s gaze and looked at the empty, black sea before him. Confused, he said, “I don’t see anything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Xuan Ke from the Ice Pavilion Sect also shot a glance at the sea. After seeing no anomalies, he closed his eyes again and resumed his cultivation, not showing the least interest in talking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Ye Qin pointed at the location where she had seen the flickering spots earlier and said, “Over there. I saw something flicker at the sea’s surface and then quickly sink into the sea.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“The reflecting light might have dazzled your eyes,” Chen Hao muttered, turning his eyes away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After hearing his words, even Ye Qin started to question herself. She snuck a glance at Nie Tian, and discovered that he hadn’t moved at all this time, so she calmed herself and resumed her cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, as she did, she secretly kept an eye on the sea’s surface.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, Nie Tian was focused on exploring the world under the black sea, relying on his profound connection with his soul power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Soon, Nie Tian started to have a feeling that nothing but his soul power could light up the pitch darkness in the depths of the black sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His psychic power would dissipate immediately after falling into the black seawater, not allowing him to see anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even his soul power, which carried profound mysteries from the nine fragmentary stars in his soul, wouldn’t last very long in the mysterious, black seawater.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even floating still in one place, his clusters of soul power lost their power rather rapidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, as he controlled them to sink deeper into the sea, they would start losing their power at a much faster speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This reminded him of the time when he had tried to observe and learn the profound contents of the three fragmentary star marks with wisps of his soul power, which had also worn out very quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He also noticed that, as he continued to draw upon his soul power, the nine sparkling fragmentary stars in his soul shrunk noticeably.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Two fragmentary stars had been added to his seven original ones, and they had expanded significantly after he had revisited the fiery heaven and earth, where he had purged the Spirit Pearl and absorbed its soul power with the help of his Flame Dragon Armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even so, every time he consumed some soul power, the fragmentary stars in his soul would shrink slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Since he hadn’t advanced to the Worldly realm, and hadn’t transformed his psychic power into soul power, he wasn’t able to replenish his soul power through cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This made him realize that the soul power from the nine fragmentary stars in his soul was very precious and nonrenewable.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, he was so fascinated by what he had seen in the depths of the black sea, and was so curious to continue to explore it, that he eventually decided to conduct a deeper exploration with his precious soul power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the sparkling clusters of soul power sunk deeper into the pitch darkness, they kept sending images back to Nie Tian’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Soon, he came across a corpse that looked very familiar.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It was the corpse of a Profound realm human Qi warrior. With a closer look, he discovered that it was Lu Bai from the Poison Sect!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Lu Bai was the leader of the Poison Sect’s team in this dimension. Nie Tian wondered what had happened that had killed such a powerful expert and left his body in the depths of the black sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Just like the outsider experts’ corpses floating around it, Lu Bai’s corpse was also bereft of any residual power or aura of corruption.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Afterwards, Nie Tian summoned all of his clusters of soul power to the area where he had discovered Lu Bai’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After searching for a while, he found the corpses of a few more powerful human Qi warriors, Lu Jianfan from the Spirit God Sect being one of them. The others were mostly at the Worldly realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Lu Bai and Lu Jianfan were both Profound realm experts, yet they had both been killed and left in the depths of the black sea, which made Nie Tian wonder.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Just as he was about to conduct a thorough examination of them, the clusters of soul power flickered a few times and went out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, as his awareness returned, he opened his eyes. Face grim, he gazed at the dead, silent, and black sea, where not even a leaf could be seen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His heart was still shaken by the corpses of powerful human experts he had discovered. He started to wonder whether some mishap had occurred when the swirling band had carried them to this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Otherwise, why would their bodies have appeared in the depths of the black sea?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He was aware that the black sea covered a extremely vast area, and the area he had explored with the help of his soul power was only a drop in the bucket.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Could there be more dead human experts in other parts of the unfathomable sea?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Had they died fighting each other, from accidents, or at the hands of outsiders?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Questions exploded in Nie Tian’s head. As hard as he tried, he couldn’t come up with answers. He only felt that the black sea before him was now filled with unpredictable danger. Thus, he inwardly reminded himself that he shouldn’t fall into the black sea in the future, no matter what.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Since his soul power was far too precious, he decided to put the exploration of the black sea on hold now that he had come to a fairly good understanding of what was under there. Instead, he spent his time consuming spirit beast meat and cultivating with spirit stones.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Days passed before the Yin Sect, Yang Sect, and Ice Pavilion Sect disciples returned one after another with the Greater Heaven stage Qi warriors they had found.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">There were members of the Thunder Mountain Sect, the Heaven Expanse Sect, the Poison Sect, and the Flame God Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meanwhile, Nie Tian finally got in touch with Dong Li through his Sound Stone, learning that she had successfully entered the late Greater Heaven stage. After he informed her of the appearance of the outsiders, she and the others started rushing towards his location.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">On this day, Dong Baijie, who had been gone for a long time, came to the location where Nie Tian and the others were gathered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a single glance at him, Nie Tian’s eyes narrowed. He felt that Dong Baijie was somehow giving off an extremely intense bloody aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He instantly realized that Dong Baijie must have killed many opponents, and his strength must have improved significantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Baijie and Qian Xin had broken through to the late Greater Heaven stage before they had come to this continent through the faint, colorful mist. However, he hadn’t exuded such a dangerous aura back then.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian wondered what Dong Baijie had encountered to have made him so formidable.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon arriving, Dong Baijie called out with a grin, “Nie Tian!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He walked straight towards Nie Tian, grabbed a bottle of alcohol out of his inner pocket, and said, smiling, “Nice. I see that you’ve broken through into the middle Greater Heaven stage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Have you heard about our encounter with the outsiders?” Nie Tian asked, frowning slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Baijie nodded, smiling. “Yeah, the Ice Pavilion Sect disciple who found me told me about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Did you gain a great fortune or something?” Nie Tian was curious.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Hahah! How did you know?” Dong Baijie asked, overjoyed. “This continent is blessed with many treasures, and I got quite lucky.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though he spared the details, Nie Tian was certain that he must have discovered some treasures that allowed his strength to improve so greatly over such a short time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Shortly afterwards, Yang Kan from the Flame God Sect and Lu Jian from the Spirit God Sect appeared, exhaustion filling their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After quickly glancing over the crowd, they briefly greeted the few Greater Heaven stage Qi warriors they knew, then found a place to sit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yang Kan would gaze across the crowd at Nie Tian with a complicated look in his eyes every once in a while. However, he also seemed to understand that he wasn’t in a place where he could contend against Nie Tian, and thus struggled to restrain himself from making any rash moves.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meanwhile, Nie Tian didn’t want to create any more trouble than they already had, and thus ignored him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Another day passed, and Dong Li, Qin Yan, Qian Xin, and the others from the Realm of a Hundred Battles arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li seemed to have communicated with her brother via her Sound Stone previously, since she didn’t seem surprised at all to see Dong Baijie in this place. She only nodded at him with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meanwhile, Dong Baijie seemed to have learned that his sister had found and refined an eighth grade black phoenix’s corpse, and that she had also entered the late Greater Heaven stage. Thus, he didn’t asked her about her encounters in front of the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Soon after the arrival of Dong Li and the others, Su Lin from the Heaven Palace Sect arrived with two other Greater Heaven stage Heaven Palace Sect disciples.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon seeing Nie Tian, Dong Li, and Dong Baijie, who was now wreathed in a formidable aura, the white-garbed Su Lin grew rather uneasy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a moment of hesitation, and before Dong Li could say anything, she took out the Earthshatter Beast’s eye and tossed it towards Dong Li without saying a word.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Smiling, Dong Li caught the Earthshatter Beast’s eye with one hand and taunted, “Why bother to take it from me in the first place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The expressions of the two Heaven Palace Sect disciples beside Su Lin turned cold upon hearing Dong Li’s sarcasm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“It’s time we put our petty differences aside.” Su Lin was surprisingly sensible about the bigger picture. Without mentioning the deaths of Guan Ye and her other sectmates, she said to everyone with a solemn expression, “Killing the outsiders is our primary task now. If we can’t do that, every one of us will die on this strange land!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“You don’t need me to tell you how brutally those outsiders will treat us once they capture us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as she started to talk, the clamoring crowd fell silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She was one of the Heaven Palace Sect’s core disciples. After Ning Yang’s death, she had already shown signs of taking his position as the most prominent of the Heaven Palace Sect’s younger generation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though her cultivation base wasn’t very impressive so far, with the whole Heaven Palace Sect at her back, she would become a bright star sooner or later.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She represented the Heaven Palace Sect, and the Heaven Palace Sect was the most powerful sect in the Domain of the Falling Stars. Even though the Heaven Palace Sect’s force had suffered losses and wasn’t currently in a good place, they were still revered by the people from the other sects.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Furthermore, her act of returning the Earthshatter Beast’s eye to resolve her conflict with Dong Li impressed everyone present.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Therefore, everyone listened attentively as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Since we’ve spent months searching this island for treasures, there isn’t much left to find.” Su Lin took her time addressing the crowd in a soft, clear voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“All of us have gathered good amounts of precious materials and spirit beast corpses. Many of you even gained treasures that we don’t have in the Domain of the Falling Stars. As long as we can return safely to the Domain of the Falling Stars with them, we’ll be able to trade them for copious amount of spirit stones, medicinal pills, or other resources.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“However, the great task we’re facing now is that we’ll have to kill the outsiders on that other island if we want to return to the Domain of the Falling Stars.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, she reached out with one hand and pointed at the distant island.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Does anyone know how many outsiders are on that island, and what grades they’re at?” &nbsp;She asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Everyone remained silent, giving each other sidelong looks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Well, if no one knows, my suggestion is that we send someone to that island and find out. If there aren’t many outsiders there, we can head over right away and kill them all. If they’re stronger than we are, we can set up defenses in this place and hold fast to them.” With these words, Su Lin’s gaze swept across the crowd as she raised her voice, “We can’t all just sit here and wait for death! We need to figure out our enemies’ situation and make decisions accordingly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At that moment, Ye Qin chimed in, “I agree with your proposal, but the issue is who will go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing these words, everyone’s gazes became evasive. Apparently, none of them wanted to go to that island, knowing that it might be roamed by powerful outsiders and fearing that it would be a place where they wouldn’t come out alive.</span></p>

 <strong>Mencius’ mother moves home three times (孟母三迁)</strong>

 <br>A virtuous mother values education, and the mother of fourth-century BCE philosopher Mencius’ was their prototype. According to The Biographies of Outstanding Women (《列女传》), written by Liu Xiang sometime in the first century BCE, Mencius was raised by his mother after his father’s early death. When Mencius was young, they lived near a graveyard, and his mother found him amusing himself by imitating professional mourners at funerals. Mencius’ mother thought this was a bad influence for her son, so they moved, this time, near a market. Then, Mencius began to mimic peddlers’ cries, which was not acceptable for his mother either, given the base status of merchants in early Confucian society. Their third home was near a slaughterhouse, and this time, Mencius imitated the butchers killing livestock. His mother didn’t give up, and finally, they found a neighborhood near a Confucian academy, and predictably, Mencius began to learn the rites of ceremony and courtesy, and grew up to be a learned sage.
 <p><br></p>This story is summarized into an idiom: 孟母三迁 (Mencius’ mother moves three times) or 孟母择邻 (Mencius’s mother choose her neighbors), referring to parents attaching great importance to their children’s educational environment.&nbsp;
