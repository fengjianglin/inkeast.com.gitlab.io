 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Surrounded by sky-filing golden lights, Xue Long went dumbstruck after seeing that Nie Tian had returned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">ZZZZZLA!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A beam of golden light swept across Xue Long’s waist, cutting off a piece of his flesh and leaving a bloody gash.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a pained cry, Xue Long refocused his attention on defending against the slithering golden light beams that had shot out of Ning Yang’s sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, he couldn’t help but check Nie Tian out from time to time with a both touched and worried look in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After all, he had never expected that Nie Tian would actually have the audacity to come back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Ning Yang was so powerful that even he was barely able to stay alive. He couldn’t even manage to escape from the blockade of Ning Yang’s golden sword lights.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He believed that there wasn’t a single person in the Realm of Split Void who had the same cultivation base as Ning Yang that would be worthy of being his opponent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian knew perfectly clearly how formidable Ning Yang was, and that he and Xue Long had only come together because of a deal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Not only that, but the Phantasm currently being held off by Li Langfeng was also a major threat to Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Once the Phantasm broke free from Li Langfeng’s blockade and came for Nie Tian, he would be killed beyond the shadow of a doubt.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Under such extreme circumstances, Nie Tian was obviously being irrational to come back to his aid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">On the other hand, the way Xue Long saw it, since Nie Tian was only at the Heaven stage, even though he had returned, he actually wouldn’t be able to do much to help. It would just be one more life lost.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Therefore, even though he was very touched, he felt that Nie Tian wasn’t being smart.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Xue Long’s face grew stern as he berated, “Why did you come back? I told you not to mind me. Why didn’t you listen? What’s the point of you coming back? Will you be able to help me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a sickly ecstatic look in his eyes, Ning Yang laughed broadly. “Great!!! Leave me those three fragmentary star marks and I’ll spare your lives! Otherwise, both of you will die here today!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian was surprisingly calm as he said, “Uncle Xue, it doesn’t matter what kind of deal you’ve made with the Spirit Condor. Since you’re here to help me accomplish a task, I can’t watch you die. Also, how come you’re so certain that I won’t be able to help you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">WHOOSH!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Flame Dragon Armor suddenly flew out of Nie Tian’s bracelet of holding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The crimson Flame Dragon Armor unleashed blazing flames, as if it had turned into a miniature sun, causing crackling sounds to echo out from the air around it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“A Spirit Channeling grade treasure! And it’s fire-attributed!” Xue Long was flabbergasted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Only then did he finally realize that this was probably the fire-attributed Spirit Channeling grade treasure that Shi Hui and his men had seen in the Void Illusion Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After all, aside from people from the Flame God Sect, not many people knew that the Flame Dragon Armor had been in Nie Tian’s possession.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though Xue Long had figured out Nie Tian’s real identity, he wasn’t aware that he was the owner of that Spirit Channeling grade treasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Ning Yang gave a cold harrumph and said, “As I expected, the Flame Dragon Armor is indeed in your hands!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As a core disciple and the lead searcher of the Heaven Palace Sect, Ning Yang naturally had access to more information than Xue Long did.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon seeing the Flame Dragon Armor, Ning Yang slightly restrained his disdain and assumed a much more serious attitude as he faced Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had heard some stories regarding the Flame Dragon Armor, and he knew that this Spirit Channeling grade treasure had never displayed its true might after it had been obtained by the Flame God Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The reason was that the Flame Dragon Armor they had seized hadn’t been complete.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The most important part of the Flame Dragon Armor was the Blood Core, which was its source of energy. The Flame God Sect had been searching for the Blood Core ever since they had obtained the Flame Dragon Armor, but their efforts had been fruitless.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, according to the information Ning Yang had obtained, the Flame Dragon Armor Nie Tian had just summoned out of his bracelet of holding should have merged with its Blood Core and become complete.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even its damaged parts seemed to be somehow repaired. This meant that the Flame Dragon Armor had become intact in Nie Tian’s hands, and it was now a Spirit Channeling grade treasure that was capable of inflicting tremendous damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Every Spirit Channeling grade treasure could be considered to be a weapon of massive destruction, not to mention this was the famous Flame Dragon Armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After summoning the Flame Dragon Armor, Nie Tian focused his attention on his firm will to kill Ning Yang, “Help me kill this man!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had faith that the Flame Dragon Armor’s soul would be able to read his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As Nie Tian had expected, the moment he made his intentions clear, the Flame Dragon Armor, which was burning fiercely like a sun, morphed into a gigantic flame dragon. Thundering ferociously, it swooped down towards Ning Yang, following the directions given by Nie Tian’s Heaven Eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">FIZZ! FIZZ!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Red flames were unleashed from within the slithering, gigantic flame dragon’s intangible body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Wherever the flame dragon flew, even the air seemed to be set ablaze. It was as if the terrifying heat had turned the area within a five-kilometer radius into a fiery dimension.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the flame dragon swam in the air, drops of lava dripped down from it’s blazing body from time to time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, the drops of lava didn’t fall to the ground. Instead, they floated in midair like numerous burning fire beads, as if they were completely free from the influence of gravity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Moments later, the air above Nie Tian’s head was filled with fire beads.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">PUFF!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a swing of his spiritual sword, Ning Yang sent out a golden light beam. As soon as it made contact with the floating fire beads, dazzlingly bright golden light shot out in every direction, along with sputtering sparks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, there were as many as several hundred light beams hovering around and trapping Xue Long, each of which contained sharp and profound metal power. They were swirling at a speed so fast that Xue Long couldn’t find any possible angle to escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As Ning Yang sent out more golden light beams and they continued to clash with the floating fire beads, more golden and fiery light blossomed and sputtered into the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In a brief moment, the area was overwhelmed by a splendid feast of fire and light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Golden and fiery light flashed across and rapidly filled the entire sky, making it a glorious scene.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, the fierce and frenzied energy the sputtering golden and fiery lights carried continued to cause damage to the area they were in.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the golden light beams sputtered on the desert ground, one sizable hole after another was created in the sandy ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the fiery lights fell to the the desert ground, the sandy ground turned scorching hot, as if it was raining lava and the sand was burning.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“The might of a Spirit Channeling grade treasure is indeed amazing!” Xue Long was overjoyed as he watched the golden light beams around him be destroyed by the countless fire beads. Finally, the trap was broken, and he charged out through a loophole in the swirling golden sword lights.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Standing outside the collapsing trap formed by the golden sword lights, covered in bloody wounds, Xue Long couldn’t stop panting. He hastily took out a handful of medicinal pills from within his ring of holding and stuffed them down his throat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Immediately afterwards, the numerous gashes on his badly mangled body stopped bleeding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a grim expression, Ning Yang let out a sharp cry, “Flame Dragon Armor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Holding his spiritual sword, which was glittering with golden bright light, he leapt into the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Under Nie Tian and Xue Long’s gazes, Ning Yang seemed to have merged with his golden spiritual sword and become one enormous broadsword. With an unstoppable momentum, it shot into the heavens.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In a split second, the incomparably sharp broadsword engaged in battle with the Flame Dragon Armor in flame dragon form in midair.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If they didn’t sense with their psychic awareness, but rather observed with their naked eyes, they wouldn’t be able to find any trace of the Flame Dragon Armor or Ning Yang. All they would see was an enormous golden broadsword fighting a gigantic flame dragon in midair.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even more fragmented golden lights and fire drops fell from midair.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The sky was filled with blazing flames and the earth was covered in holes. The fluctuations of spiritual power created by the midair clashes were so violent that they left Nie Tian in awe.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a shocked expression on his face, he marveled, “I can’t believe Ning Yang is so powerful!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Yeah, as the chosen one of the Heaven Palace Sect, he surely possesses unparalleled strength.” Xue Long said with a bitter smile. “Before our engagement, I didn’t expect him to be so powerful either.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">CRUNCH!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As they spoke, the golden broadsword hacked heavily down on the neck of the blazing flame dragon, giving rise to a loud, metallic, clanking sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the next moment, the Flame Dragon Armor resumed its original form.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Ning Yang’s figure also appeared, holding his normal-sized golden sword, which had hacked on the surface of the Flame Dragon Armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The sword strike didn’t leave any fissure or dent on the Flame Dragon Armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, the sharp metal power within the golden spiritual sword turned into tiny, golden light swords and flew into the Flame Dragon Armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“This is not good!” Xue Long’s expression flickered. “After all, your cultivation base is still too low, and you can’t wear this Spirit Channeling grade armor yet. Because of this, you can’t activate and display its full might.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian also sensed the unfavorable situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">No matter how high its grade, it was still a spiritual tool. Just like any other spiritual tool, it would only be able to display its ultimate power when it became one with its master.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This meant that only when he was able to wear the Flame Dragon Armor, and his cultivation base allowed him to have the Flame Dragon Armor follow his heart’s desire, would he be able to bring out its full might.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, he was facing two problems: one, his cultivation base was still too low; second, he still couldn’t wear the Flame Dragon Armor.</span></p>
