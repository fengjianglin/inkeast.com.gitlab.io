 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as Nie Tian’s right hand made contact with that Fruit of Life, a strong gravitational force was suddenly born between it and the green aura in his palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BANG!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The emerald-like Fruit of Life suddenly began to shine with dazzling light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li saw with great clarity that wisps of glowing light were flowing out of that Fruit of Life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Like water, they rapidly followed Nie Tian’s fingers into his palm and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The fist-sized Fruit of Life shriveled and became smaller at a speed that could be seen by the naked eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At the same time, the green aura in his palm started to exude an incomparably strong aura of life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian could sense with great clarity that the countless crystal-like chains that formed the green aura were channeling and absorbing the wisps of glowing light from the Fruit of Life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The innumerable green spots in the crystal-like chains, where lay the profound truths of life, started to shine like the stars in the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It seemed that the wisps of glowing light from the Fruit of Life were what the green aura had been yearning for. Now it was devouring them greedily.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Moments later, the Fruit of Life touched by Nie Tian’s right hand completely vanished under Nie Tian and Dong Li’s gazes, all of the life power it contained consumed by the green aura. Not a shred was left.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meanwhile, the green aura started to emanate an intoxicating light from his right palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, its thirst for life power didn’t seem to be relieved in the slightest now that it had consumed a Fruit of Life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">On the contrary, Nie Tian felt that it had become even more eager and excited, as if it was urging him to collect the other three Fruits of Life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At that moment, Dong Li seemed to realize what was happening, and thus hastily reminded him aloud, “Don’t! Don’t touch the Fruits of Life with your hand. Otherwise you’ll take away all of the life power in them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She didn’t know that what had taken away the life power of that Fruit of Life was actually the green aura in Nie Tian’s palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She just assumed that any living being with flesh and blood would absorb the life power within a Fruit of Life as soon as they touched one.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“That Fruit of Life will give you at least another hundred years of lifespan!” Dong Li exclaimed. “You’re still young, and far from facing a lifespan problem. These Fruits of Life are extremely precious. We need to secure the other three!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing her reminder, Nie Tian instantly became clear-headed, remembering that he had long since planned to give two Fruits of Life to Wu Ji and Hua Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li would also need one in order to stabilize her status in the Dong Clan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I see.” With a deep breath, he recovered and restrained himself from grabbing the other three Fruits of Life with his right hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It was also at this moment that he realized that the spiritual energy ball in his left hand had already gathered a significant amount of pure wood power from the vicinity, as well as fragmented will from the Titan underneath him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meanwhile, as he practiced the Qi Refining Incantation, both the wood power and the fragmented will were rapidly infused into his spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I’ve got some boxes.” Dong Li slowly approached Nie Tian as she looked carefully at the enormous eye in the pond underneath.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, she took out three wooden boxes from within her ring of holding and handed them to Nie Tian. “These three wooden boxes are made of trees that were thousands of years old. They should be able to hold Fruits of Life. You just need to open the box, place it under the Fruit of Life, and then sever the stem with its lid. Just like that, you should be able to collect the rest of the Fruits of Life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the daughter of the Dong Clan’s clanmaster, she had all kinds of wares and treasures in her ring of holding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At such a critical moment, even though she was also within arm’s reach of the Fruits of Life, she didn’t dare to collect them herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The overwhelming aura of flesh and blood that the huge eye had unleashed earlier had deeply scared her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She had also realized that there must be something very special about Nie Tian that had not only allowed him to find this place and be free from the ancient trees’ attacks, but also given him the ability to silence the overwhelming attacks of the huge eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As arrogant as she was, she had to admit that she had nothing to do with the tremendous fortune they were facing now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Therefore, she realized that perhaps she was fated to witness Nie Tian reap a fortune so vastly great that people would probably not believe her even if she were to tell anyone about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian grabbed the three wooden boxes as he continued to gather the rich wood power and fragmented will of the Titan into the spiritual energy ball in his left hand. “I’ll give it a shot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With his right hand, he opened a wooden box and placed it under one of the Fruits of Life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As his right hand approached that Fruit of Life, the green aura in his palm once again grew restless, as if its desire was driving it crazy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian knew that once his right hand touched that Fruit of Life, the green aura would immediately suck away every last shred of life power within it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Therefore, he operated with great caution, making sure his right hand didn’t make any contact with the Fruit of Life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After the Fruit of Life was in the wooden box, he snapped the lid shut with a flick of his finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With that, the slender stem connecting the Fruit of Life and the Tree of Life was instantly severed, and the box was sealed with the Fruit of Life in it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“It worked!” Dong Li exclaimed, as if she was even more excited than Nie Tian. “Go on! Get the other two!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After boxing that Fruit of Life, Nie Tian could feel that the green aura in his palm was growing anxious and upset.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Ignoring it, Nie Tian rapidly boxed the other two Fruits of Life with the same method.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Realizing that all of the remaining Fruits of Life had been sealed away in wooden boxes, the green aura seemed to be incomparably restless and yearning.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a moment of silent pondering, Nie Tian threw the three wooden boxes that stored the Fruits of Life into his bracelet of holding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as the boxes flew into his bracelet of holding, all their aura was cut off.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a while, unable to sense the aura of the Fruits of Life, the green aura stopped rattling in his right palm and swam back into his heart, as if it had finally given up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as the green aura went back to his heart, Nie Tian realized that the green spots in those crystal-like chains had also calmed down.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The green aura coiled up and became silent, as if it had entered another dormant period.</span></p>
 <p><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“The life power of one Fruit of Life caused that green aura to lie dormant again...”</span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">&nbsp;Nie Tian, who had gone through similar experiences before, shuddered as he immediately realized that the dormant green aura had started digesting the power of that Fruit of Life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It meant that the green aura had entered another transcending process. Once the process was finished, it would grant him a brand-new bloodline talent!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Seeing that Nie Tian had put the three wooden boxes away into his bracelet of holding, Dong Li hastily reminded him, “Remember! One of those Fruits of Life is mine! You’re going to give me one after we’re out of here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I know....” Nie Tian nodded and stopped thinking about the Fruits of Life. Instead, he looked down at his left hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At that moment, rich wood power and fragmented will from the Titan were still converging on the spiritual energy ball in his left hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Seeing that he was looking at his hand with a grave expression, Dong Li stopped talking, and watched him in silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Moments later, Nie Tian discovered that no more wisps of fragmented will were flying into the spiritual energy ball in his left hand, which meant that he had gathered all of the Titan’s fragmented will into that spiritual energy ball.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, he assumed the lotus position in midair and concentrated on operating the Qi Refining Incantation in order to refine and absorb all of the wood power and the Titan’s fragmented will within the spiritual energy ball.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Eyes wide, Dong Li watched him from the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After an unknown period of time, when the spiritual energy ball was refined and vanished, the force that had been holding him up in the air suddenly grew stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The two of them were pushed into the heavens, and shot towards the depths of the green clouds where powerful spatial fluctuations existed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Beams of light interwove into a web on the surface of the giant eye where the Tree of Life grew, as if the eye were behind what was happening and watching them as they flew away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After Nie Tian and Dong Li vanished from this mysterious dimension, a long, echoing sigh rang out from the depths of the earth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Ripples once again spread out across the shallow pond. As the pond became murky and green again, peace was restored to this heaven and earth.</span></p>
