<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Seeing the unfavorable situation, Yang Kan and Lu Jian no longer dared to stay, and left in a hurry.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Standing in place, Nie Tian let out a cold harrumph and watched them speed away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, he dragged the three Heaven Expanse Sect and Thunder Mountain Sect disciples’ badly mangled bodies to the place where he had scattered the others, and then took their rings of holding, along with Guan Ye’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Afterwards, he sat in the midst of the corpses and started recovering with spirit stones.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A long time passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a thought, he formed another spiritual energy ball in his palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The new spiritual energy ball was still grayish-brown, with shadows flashing about in it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">During the process, he could sense with great clarity that, as soon as a few wisps of ripping power from the gray mist were channeled down from the air into the spiritual energy ball in his palm, the spiritual energy ball grew unstable, as if it had been infused with terror.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a fling of his hand, the spiritual energy ball shot out of his hand and exploded, forming a field of ripping power before him, which seemed as if could rip all living beings into shreds.</span></p>
 <p><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“The gray mist seems to have been somehow formed by all sorts of energies of heaven and earth when the top continent exploded.”&nbsp;</span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian’s mind drifted away as he gazed up at the mysterious, gray mist that filled the entire sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">According to Dong Li, anyone who had entered the gray mist, voluntarily or not, had never come out again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It didn’t matter whether the person was at the Greater Heaven stage, the Worldly realm, or even the Soul realm. Once they entered, there was no coming back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The only reason they had passed it and set foot on the bottom continent was because the enormous vortex served like a ladder that connected to the bottom continent in a unfathomable way.&nbsp;</span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“How many secrets of this place are still waiting to be uncovered?”</span></em></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Eyebrows furrowed, Nie Tian wracked his mind, but still failed to figure out what had happened in this dimension after the final war between the intelligent beings from the top continent and the gigantic creatures from the bottom continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a while, he looked over his shoulder, and discovered that Dong Li was still sitting beside the gigantic black phoenix’s head. Wisps of dark spiritual power were flying back and forth between her and the eighth grade black phoenix.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Time flew, and another day passed...</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">On this day, Nie Tian killed two other Heaven Palace Sect disciples.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The two of them had probably been summoned to this location by Su Lin and Guan Ye. They had arrived soon after Yang Kan and Lu Jian left. Nie Tian launched lightning quick attacks and added their corpses to the ones around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Sitting back in the midst the scattered corpses, Nie Tian calmed himself and recovered power with spiritual materials of different attributes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A few hours later, a group of people entered the detection range of Nie Tian’s Heaven Eyes. Nie Tian examined them with rapt attention, but quickly resumed his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The newcomers were Qin Yan, Feng Ying, Cao Qiushui, Gu Haofeng, and Qian Xin from the Realm of a Hundred Battles.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, Dong Baijie wasn’t with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian hadn’t seen them since they had walked into the colorful mist.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He remembered that more than a dozen people had entered the colorful mist before him and Dong Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">For some reason, there were only five of them who were traveling together now. He wondered what had happened to the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The five of them scanned their surroundings with their psychic awarenesses as they marched through the rubble-strewn area. It wasn’t very long before they found their way to Nie Tian’s location.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At first, they moved stealthily, doing their utmost to hide their traces.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, as they got closer and discovered that it was Nie Tian, they no longer hid, and dashed towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Nie Tian!” Qin Yan exclaimed, shock filling her gracefully beautiful face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The other four were also deeply shaken after seeing Nie Tian sitting in the midst of more than a dozen scattered corpses.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The corpses were dressed in different sects’ garments and mangled to different degrees. Clearly, they were from different sects. They gasped with astonishment as they discovered Guan Ye from the Heaven Palace Sect among the dead.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">For a moment, they went completely blank, wondering what had happened here.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Moments later, Gu Haofeng snapped out of his daze, and with a sarcastic laugh, he said, “You’re quite lucky.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He assumed that people from different forces had engaged in a chaotic battle in this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian just happened to be the lucky survivor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After hearing Gu Haofeng’s words, the other four realized what he meant, and thought his speculation might be very close to what had happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian, however, wasn’t interested in explaining. He opened his eyes and took a glance at them before resuming his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Look at that huge black phoenix!” Qian Xin from the Pill Pavilion Sect measured the black phoenix’s corpse with his eyes before his gaze landed on Dong Li, who was sitting by the black phoenix’s head, and said with an envious expression, “This black phoenix must be of a very high grade. After absorbing its residual power, Dong Li will definitely gain a strong boost in her strength and cultivation. I guess I was wrong... Dong Li is the truly lucky one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Everyone’s attention quickly fell on the black phoenix and Dong Li, who they envied very much.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qin Yan took a circle around the black phoenix’s corpse, and discovered the formation of tree branches in the vicinity. Quickly, she realized that Nie Tian was using the tree branches he had obtained from the floating continent to protect Dong Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She walked back to Nie Tian’s side, took a glance at the corpses on the ground, and said, “What happened here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Nothing,” Nie Tian responded coldly, not even looking up at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, Gu Haofeng said with a grim face, “Others may find their way to this place too. Let’s regroup here and move out again after Dong Li is finished.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Battles await if we choose to stay,” Cao Qiushui said with a very grim face. “We’ve already lost too many people in this damned place. We might be the only ones from the Realm of a Hundred Battles who are still alive now. But since different sects have lost people fighting for this black phoenix’s corpse, I don’t think they’ll just give up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing his words, everyone fell silent, their faces grim.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">From the look of it, this recent period of time hadn’t been easy for them, and they had probably suffered great losses.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Otherwise, these youngsters wouldn’t have been so worried and grim after seeing the eighth grade black phoenix.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Something must have happened that had hurt their confidence in their strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Sitting in silence, Nie Tian took out another spirit stone and started absorbing its spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He closed his eyes, and was apparently not in the mood to talk. The others were discouraged by his attitude and gave up on the idea of asking about the situation. Instead, they sat down in a circle and started chatting with each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">From their conversation, Nie Tian soon learned that, after coming to this continent, they had encountered people from the Thunder Mountain Sect, the Heaven Expanse Sect, and the Heaven Palace Sect. Fights had broken out over precious spiritual materials, during which they had lost many people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Fortunately, the few leaders had gotten in contact with each other via Sound Stones and joined up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, many of those who had come with them had been killed in battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After some time, Nie Tian saw through his Heaven Eyes that Dong Li had stopped absorbing power from the black phoenix’s corpse.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Her black phoenix beast spirit had also surfaced from the eighth grade black phoenix’s corpse and slowly flew back into Dong Li, dragging glorious light with it as it did.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as her beast spirit returned to her, Dong Li’s eyes snapped open.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After glancing over the crowd and the corpses scattered around, she seemed somewhat relieved, and then once again closed her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Terrifyingly intense energy fluctuations suddenly exploded from within her and spread into her surroundings. She took out a number of spirit jades, and with a deep breath, started her advancement to the late Greater Heaven stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The five people from the Realm of a Hundred Battles clamored over the incredible fortune Dong Li had so luckily seized, envy filling their faces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Dong Li is going to make a breakthrough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“That black phoenix’s corpse must have provided her with great help. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have been ready for a breakthrough in cultivation right after refining its power!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“She’s so lucky!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">…</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A few hours later, Xuan Ke came back with six other Ice Pavilion Sect disciples.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">By the time they paced to Nie Tian, Nie Tian had already fully recovered his spiritual power. His eyes snapped open as he gazed coldly at him and asked, “Changed your mind, have you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Xuan Ke had left with three subordinates, but now he had returned with three more, one of which was at the late Greater Heaven stage, the same stage as Xuan Ke, and the others at the middle Greater Heaven stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian assumed that, now that Xuan Ke had gathered enough people, he had come back for the black phoenix’s corpse.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Xuan Ke shook his head and said, “I gave you my word that we won’t want anything to do with that eighth grade black phoenix anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhao Le laughed somewhat unnaturally as he said with a surprisingly flattering attitude, “Well, we ran into Yang Kan and Lu Jian on our way back here. How can we still dare to have such a thought after learning what you’ve done here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Wang Rong nodded as she chimed in, bitterness filling the corner of her mouth, “You’ve killed so many people, including Guan Ye. You even scared Yang Kan away. We definitely will live by our pact.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“We’ve come back to you because of something else,” Luo Xue explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After hearing their words, the five from the Realm of a Hundred Battles were flabbergasted, as if they had been struck by lightning.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They all turned to stare blankly at Nie Tian, their mouths opening slightly, as if they wanted to say something, yet lost their words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">No matter how hard they tried, they couldn’t picture Nie Tian killing all these Qi warriors.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">No one at his cultivation stage should possess such battle prowess. Some of the dead were even at higher stages than him!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">How was this possible!?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the story goes, there was once a kind and good-hearted cowherd named Niulang. His parents died when he was little, so he lived with his brother and sister-in-law. However, his sister-in-law disliked him so much that living with her became unbearable, so he left home with only an old ox to keep him company.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niulang built a small cottage and tried to make a life for himself. Even though he was often tired and hungry, he always found time to take care of his old ox.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One day, the ox suddenly began to speak. It said that it used to be the star Taurus, but was punished when it stole some seeds of grain to give to men. Because it had disobeyed the rule of the Heavenly Palace, it was sent to earth in the form of an ox.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Near Niulang's cottage was a sacred pond where young goddesses bathed. The ox took Niulang there and told him that the most beautiful girl in the universe, Zhinu, would go there. If Niulang hid her clothes, she would stay and be his wife.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhinu was renowned not only for her beauty but for her skills as a weaver and seamstress as well. She was also the granddaughter of the Jade Emperor.</span></p>

When they had taken off their robes and gone into the pond, Niulang went and stole Zhinu's clothes. This scared the other goddesses who ran away and left Zhinu alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niulang returned to give her clothes back.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the old ox was about to die, it told Niulang that its hide could help a man fly up to heaven. It told him to preserve its hide properly. Niulang and Zhinu lived happily for many years, and were blessed with twins, a son whom they called Brother Gold and a daughter called Sister Jade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their happiness was cut short, though, when the Jade Emperor found out that his granddaughter had married a mortal. He ordered the Empress to fetch Zhinu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niulang came home one day and saw his children crying. All they could tell him was that an old woman had come to take their mother away. He realised what had happened and immediately went to take the hide of the old ox.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Empress became angry when she saw Niulang and his children. She slashed across the sky with her hairpin and a raging river flowed in the heavens. This created Tian He, or the Heavenly River, which separated the lovers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niulang and his children could only weep bitterly. Moved by their sorrow, the Jade Emperor turned them into stars and allowed them to meet once each year via a bridge made from magpies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Today, if you look at the night sky, you can find the stars Altair and Vega. Niulang is Altair and Zhinu is Vega. The Heavenly River that keeps them apart is the Milky Way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the east side of the Milky Way, Altair is the middle of the three-star formation. The stars on either side of Altair are said to be his son and daughter. To the south-east is the constellation Taurus, which is in the shape of a bull. Vega, to the west of the Milky Way, is surrounded by stars that form the shape of a loom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every year, the two stars of Altair and Vega are closest together on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On this day, the Chinese gaze to the sky to look for Vega and Altair shining in the Milky Way, while a third star forms a symbolic bridge between the two stars. It was said that if it rains on this day that it was caused by a river sweeping away the magpie bridge or that the rain is the tears of the separated couple. Based on the legend of a flock of magpies forming a bridge to reunite the couple, a pair of magpies came to symbolize conjugal happiness and faithfulness.</span></p>
