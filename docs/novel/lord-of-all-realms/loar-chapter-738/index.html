<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The agony in the Frost Blood Python was gradually replaced by serenity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yin Yanan, who had a profound soul connection with the Frost Blood Python, immediately noticed the change. With a soft exclamation, her furrowed eyebrows finally relaxed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Beast-controlling Sect had bred this hybrid python especially for her. Instead of a normal pet beast, it was more like a Dao Protector to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Frost Blood Python carried the mixed bloodlines of the Frost Python and the Blood Stripe Python. With its unlimited potential, it could even rise to the eighth or ninth grade some day.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It was because of Yin Yanan’s unique status in the Beast-controlling Sect that they had bestowed it upon her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Having lived and fought side by side with it for many years, she had long since considered it her best friend.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Furthermore, the Frost Blood Python had saved her from desperate situations more than a few times before.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Her feelings for the Frost Blood Python were hard to put into words. Therefore, it was even more painful for her to see it in agony than if she sustained injuries herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The fact that the Frost Blood Python had settled down and the pained look in its eyes was gone made her very happy. Even the gaze she used to look at Nie Tian became slightly warmer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Xing Beichen kept a close watch on every move Nie Tian made. His face was filled with astonishment as he saw the changes in the Frost Blood Python. He walked over and asked, “He’s taken care of those Bone-piercing Blood Thorns?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qiao Yunxi also looked rather shocked as she gazed at Nie Tian from afar.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian was still standing by the Frost Blood Python as the wisps of his flesh auras, which had become much thicker after draining the Bone-piercing Blood Thorns of their flesh power, slowly flew back to him through his palm that was placed on the Frost Blood Python.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">SHEW! SHEW! SHEW!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as they returned, the green aura in his heart sensed their presence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The green aura became ecstatic as it madly channeled them into Nie Tian’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As it devoured them, numerous blindingly bright cyan spots appeared within the translucent and sparkling Bloodline Crystal Chains that formed the green aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Each and every one of those cyan spots was branded with the profound truths of life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Normally, new cyan spots would only form within the green aura after receiving a huge amount of flesh power. When the number of cyan spots built up to a certain point, the green aura would enter dormancy and prepare for the next upgrade.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The flesh power he had absorbed from the Bone-piercing Blood Thorns was clearly not as rich as that of seventh grade outsiders.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even so, it achieved such great effects after being channeled into the green aura. A surprisingly large amount of cyan spots that carried the profound truths of life were created.</span></p>
 <p><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“Can this because Bone-devouring Leeches are an ancient species, and there’s something special about their flesh power?”&nbsp;</span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian thought to himself.&nbsp;</span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“If this is the case, then it means there’s more to inducing bloodline upgrades than simply gathering flesh power. Certain types of special flesh power can help me accelerate the upgrade of my bloodline and the awakening of my new bloodline talents!”</span></em></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He was overjoyed to come to such a realization.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had never expected that he would actually be able to derive a brand new method to accelerate his bloodline talent awakening while helping solve the Frost Blood Python’s problem with the Bone-piercing Blood Thorns.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">While he drifted away in his thoughts, Yin Yanan let out a sigh of relief and said, “Yeah, it seems to be fine now. It’s refining those strange thorns. Soon, they’ll be gone completely.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian examined the Frost Blood Python again and noticed that it had wrapped its flesh auras around the Bone-piercing Blood Thorns.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In a mysterious way, those flesh auras were slowly dissolving the Bone-piercing Blood Thorns. Like icy shards that were scorched by fire, they rapidly shrank and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Knowing that the Frost Blood Python was fine now, Nie Tian withdrew his hand and took a step back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yin Yanan’s bright eyes rippled with green waves as she bit her lower lip lightly. After a few seconds of hesitation, she said, “I guess you’re not a total jerk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, she took out huge pieces of spirit beast meat from within her ring of holding and cast them towards the Frost Blood Python.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Frost Blood Python opened its large mouth and swallowed them one by one. With these pieces of fifth and sixth grade spirit beast meat, it started to recover its strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“You don’t need to worry about the Stonemen pursuers anymore. Leave them to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Knowing that the Frost Blood Python had gotten rid of the Bone-piercing Blood Thorns, Yin Yanan became confident and domineering again. Gazing in the direction they had come from, she blurted, “I don’t believe they have any more Bone-piercing Blood Thorns that they can use! As long as they don’t, they’ll be no match for my Frost Blood Python!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Since you’re so confident, I’ll just sit back and relax,” Nie Tian said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“If I may ask, what kind of method did you use to help the Frost Blood Python get rid of those Bone-piercing Blood Thorns?” Xing Beichen from the Trisword Sect asked with a strange expression. “From what I know, even seventh and eighth grade outsiders would find them hard to get rid of once they drilled into their flesh and bones.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Cutting them out by force would only speed up the death of the wounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“So do you have some special approach?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Xing Beichen looked deeply at him, his eyebrows furrowed, as if he were very eager to know.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing his words, Yin Yanan also grew confused, and said, “Yeah, how did you do it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Sorry, I have nothing to say.” With these words, Nie Tian turned around and walked away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“That man must have something to do with the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace,” Yin Yanan said in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Xing Beichen’s expression instantly flickered. “The Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace!? No wonder. Only ancient powerful human sects like that, which dare to contend against outsider races, would know how to deal with Bone-piercing Blood Thorns.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His face grew grim as he added, “If he’s really from the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace, then... we’ll never be able to have our revenge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian had severely injured Wei Yu from the Trisword Sect. Because of that, he had been too weak to fight the outsiders, and eventually died in battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qi Jiuchuan from the Trisword Sect had also died at Nie Tian’s hands. Xing Beichuan had long since made up his mind that he would return to their sect’s ancient starship to report to their sect elders once they lost the pursuing outsiders.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If the powerful experts from the Trisword Sect came after Nie Tian, even with the Bone Blood Demon’s help, he wouldn’t possibly be able to escape the fate of death.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, if he was from the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace...</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yin Yanan also let out a deep sigh. “I only didn’t tell you about his identity earlier because I didn’t want to put pressure on you. After all, as sects from the Domain of Heaven’s Boundaries, we can’t afford to offend someone from the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Xing Beichen nodded blankly and said, “The thing is we kind of started the conflicts with him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Does that mean we’ll have to let everything go?” Yin Yanan asked, her face filled with grievances.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian had killed Hong Xian and many Soul realm experts from the Beast-controlling Sect. During the time she had traveled with him, not only hadn’t she had her revenge, but Nie Tian had even done things to her. She was reluctant to let all of these go.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Xing Beichen smiled bitterly. “What choice do we have?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meanwhile...</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qiao Yunxi said to Nie Tian, “I plan to return to the Divine Flame Sect through the teleportation portal the Lei Clan set up after we take care of the Stonemen. What about you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I plan to go to that portal as well,” Nie Tian answered. “But I’ll return to the Domain of the Falling Stars, not the Divine Flame Sect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qiao Yunxi shot a glance at Yin Yanan and said, “Yeah, that seems to be our best choice. They’re also going to leave for their ancient starships that are berthed by the edge of this forbidden region. They’re probably going to bring more powerful experts here through the teleportation portals in their ancient starships. I assume they’ll have Void domain experts come to this region, so it’s not a bad idea that you leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian’s expression flickered slightly. “Void domain experts?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At that very moment, the Stonemen finally arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Under their control, hundreds of thousands of rocks of various sizes came swarming towards Nie Tian and the others, filling their view.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A few dozen Stonemen could be seen in the middle of those floating rocks, communicating with each other. By the time they caught sight of the human juniors they had been pursuing, they grinned sinisterly, killing intent filling their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“These damned Stonemen, who do they think they are? If I don’t teach them a lesson, they’ll think they’re invincible!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yin Yanan bellowed as she jumped onto the Frost Blood Python, which was a few dozen meters long and also harbored deep hatred towards these Stonemen. Then, they flew right up into the void.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">WHOOSH!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The seventh grade Frost Blood Python opened its mouth and spat a mouthful of frosty mist out towards the Stonemen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Crackling sounds came from the frosty mist, which carried countless ice shards. Together, they seemed to freeze heaven and earth, and turn every Stoneman into ice sculptures.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as the flying rocks entered the frosty mist, they were frozen and became still in the void.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The frosty mist also carried wisps of explosive flesh auras, which seemed to be from the Frost Blood Python’s Blood Stripe Python bloodline.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as the flesh auras made contact with the rocks, they exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The two Stonemen at the forefront were also engulfed by the frosty mist. Their bodies that were as tough as metal also instantly froze. As the flesh auras touched them, they exploded into countless pieces of frozen flesh, dying miserable deaths.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon seeing this, the three sixth grade Stonemen stood aghast, not daring to believe their own eyes. “How come that python’s still so powerful?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They were well-aware of what Bone-piercing Blood Thorns could do. They had killed numerous seventh grade spirit beasts with them. They found it hard to believe that the Frost Blood Python had already gotten rid of the Bone-piercing Blood Thorns.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">One of the Stonemen gazed down. His expression flickered as he exclaimed, “Hmm?! That man!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That Stoneman was Stonemountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian had fought him on an island in the black sea on the bottom continent in a mysterious dimension.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Later, he had joined the invasion of the Domain of the Falling Stars. However, since his status among the Stonemen was rather high, he had been arranged to stay in the Realm of Split Void with Armes and the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After Basto, the Phantasm commander, had died in the Realm of Mystic Heaven, he and Armes had been the first to receive word of it, and had thus evacuated through the spatial rifts in the Realm of Split Void.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Never had he thought that he would run into Nie Tian in this forbidden region.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian grinned and called out, “Stonemountain! I can’t believe you didn’t die in the Domain of the Falling Stars!”</span></p>
