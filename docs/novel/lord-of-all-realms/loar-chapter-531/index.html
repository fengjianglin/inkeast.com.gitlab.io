<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All his life, Nie Tian hadn’t truly acknowledged many people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though Ning Yang had been his enemy, his heart would be filled with respect whenever he recalled his formidable strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Ning Yang’s death had been the result of the joint efforts of Li Langfeng, Xue Long, and even a Phantasm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As a madman who pursued ultimate power at the cost of his own life, Li Langfeng was also an outstanding fighter. Even still, he had been dwarfed by Ning Yang’s power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In fact, right up until Ning Yang’s death, he had been considered the brightest star and potential future sectmaster of the Heaven Palace Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had outshone all the other Heaven Palace Sect disciples at his cultivation stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In Nie Tian’s eyes, only those with strength like him deserved to be called chosen ones.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Compared to Ning Yang, Hong He and Huang Hu were nothing but a couple of clowns, completely unpresentable.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">SHEW!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li landed beside Nie Tian like a feather, her gaze switching back and forth between Nie Tian, who was covered in blood, and Huang Hu’s mangled corpse.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Ahh!” She exclaimed, deeply shocked. “You killed him within such a short time?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though she had believed that Nie Tian would eventually prevail, she hadn’t expected that he would have killed him so quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian casually dabbed at the blood on his neck with the corner of his garment. “Compared to Ning Yang, he’s far too weak. You go ahead and take his ring of holding. I’ll go look around and see if I can catch that Su Lin as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Since Su Lin had already gone beyond the detection range of his Heaven Eyes, Nie Tian couldn’t determine her current location.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Su Lin still had the Earthshatter Beast’s eye, the most precious part of the beast, and she had also taken part in threatening Dong Li to give it up. He naturally wouldn’t just let this go.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a moment of hesitation, Dong Li said, “Be careful. There must be other Heaven Palace Sect disciples that have come to this continent. Since Su Lin and these two have appeared in this area, it’s hard to say if there are other Heaven Palace Sect disciples in the vicinity. If you find out that Su Lin has already joined the others, you need to come back as quickly as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“It’s true that the Earthshatter Beast’s eye is very important, but you... you’re more important to me. I don’t want anything to happen to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, Dong Li bowed her head slightly, a rare bashful look appearing on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian smiled as he felt warmth in his heart, then he nodded and said, “Don’t worry. Nothing will happen to me as long as I don’t encounter a true chosen one as powerful as Ning Yang. Even if I run into Yang Kan from the Flame God Sect, I have confidence in beating him in a battle now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“But no one is as powerful as Ning Yang,” Dong Li said.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian laughed wildly. “My point exactly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Without even cleaning the blood on him, Nie Tian disappeared with a short-range Starshift.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as he disappeared, his nine Heaven Eyes fanned out and flew towards the direction Su Lin had left in at full speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">One scene after another was reflected in Nie Tian’s heart, yet Su Lin wasn’t in any of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He forgot all about the precious materials that might be lying around, but focused on finding Su Lin, getting the Earthshatter Beast’s eye back, and slaying her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had fought her during the Heaven Gate trial. Back then, he had beaten her and obtained the first fragmentary star mark.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Now, a few years later, even though she had achieved rapid growth in her cultivation with the help of the Heaven Palace Sect, she was still currently at the early Greater Heaven stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had defeated her when they had been at the same stage, not to mention his confidence in defeating her now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, what surprised him was that none of his Heaven Eyes were able to identity any trace of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It had only been about a quarter hour since Su Lin and her men had left from the location where the Earthshatter Beast’s corpse was. It was very unlikely that she had gone this far within such a short time. The only explanation would be that, instead of searching in the vicinity, she had marched toward some place at full speed right after splitting up with Hong He and Huang Hu.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It wasn’t long before Nie Tian walked out of the dense forest and approached the foot of the mountain peak with unmatched height.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It was the flat-topped mountain peak which he and Dong Li had seen right after setting foot on this vast continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It reached so high into the clouds that it seemed to be able to reach the continent above this one. However, it had somehow been severed with a clean, smooth cut.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Giant boulders were scattered at the foot of the mountain peak, which was a fairly open area.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">From the look of it, the boulders had rolled down the mountain peak when the mountain peak had been damaged. Their sizes varied from the size of hills to the size of fists.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All of a sudden, he discovered four Qi warriors who were dressed in white robes and wreathed in ice-cold aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">To his surprise, one of them was Xuan Ke, who he had met once in the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Back then, <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Xuan&nbsp;</span>Ke had been at the Lesser Heaven stage as well. However, a few years later, he was now a late Greater Heaven stage Qi warrior, who exuded a frosty and gruesome aura from head to foot.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He and the other three with him, two females and one male, seemed to be from the Ice Pavilion Sect in the Realm of Endless Ice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As Nie Tian bounced high into the sky off a large boulder to move forward, <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Xuan&nbsp;</span>Ke and the others instantly caught sight of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, Nie Tian, whose mind was set on finding Su Lin, kept bouncing off large boulders as he quickly moved in the direction Su Lin had left in.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Wang Rong, a female disciple of the Ice Pavilion Sect, exclaimed upon seeing Nie Tian, who was covered in blood from head to toe, “Who is that?! He has such strong killing intent!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Eyes narrowed, Zhao Le, a male disciple of the Ice Pavilion Sect, sensed attentively, and rapidly determined Nie Tian’s cultivation base. With an unimpressed expression, he said, “Middle Greater Heaven stage... He doesn’t seem to have any kind of sigil on him, so we can’t know which force he’s with.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a brief pause, Zhao Le looked at Xuan Ke and added, “But that guy is wreathed in a strong killing intent. Someone must have somehow angered him. The way I see it, we might as well go kill him and take whatever precious materials he has found.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In recent days, these people from the Ice Pavilion Sect had been doing the same despicable things the Heaven Palace Sect had.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Once they encountered groups of weak cultivators, or cultivators who traveled alone, they would kill them and take the precious spiritual materials they had gathered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">By doing that, they had gained quite a fortune recently. That was the reason why Zhao Le instantly came up with the evil idea as soon as he determined that Nie Tian’s cultivation base was mediocre and that he wasn’t one of the chosen ones from the other powerful sects.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing his suggestion, Wang Rong’s spirits soared as she chimed in, “Anyone who’s come to this place must have, more or less, gathered some valuable spiritual materials. After all, there are Premium grade materials everywhere. That man must have gathered some as well. Let’s go get him, Senior Martial Brother Xuan Ke, just like we did the other ones!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Luo Xue, the other female disciple, rolled up her sleeves for battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, as the team leader, Xuan Ke gazed at Nie Tian, who was covered in blood and whose eyes were brimming with a strong thirst for blood, and then fell silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“What do you say, Senior Martial Brother Xuan Ke!?” Wang Rong asked with an urgent tone. “He’s getter farther and farther away. If we don’t act now, he’ll soon be gone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Leave him alone,” Xuan Ke said coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing these words, all of the other three were deeply confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They knew very well that Xuan Ke wasn’t against killing and plundering the weak and alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Not only that, he had made his stance clear since the moment they had set foot on this continent, that they should pounce on those who traveled alone at first sight, not sparing a single one.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That person was only at the middle Greater Heaven stage, and he was by himself. Why on earth would Xuan Ke choose to stand down?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Eyebrows furrowed, Zhao Le chimed in, “Senior martial brother, considering the strength of us four, killing him will be a piece of cake. Don’t you think? He’s no Ning Yang. What do we have to be afraid of?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Xuan Ke let out a cold harrumph. “That guy is more dangerous than you think! We’ll follow him and see who he’s looking for, but don’t try to attack him. Remember, keep a safe distance from him so that he doesn’t discover us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The other three didn’t quite approve of Xuan He’s decision inwardly. They thought he had become too meticulous, and was acting a bit unlike himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">No matter which aspect they analyzed, they strongly believed that the four of them would be able to kill Nie Tian and take his valuables without breaking a sweat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Just do as I say!” Xuan Ke exclaimed with a cold tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The other three said no more, and under Xuan Ke’s leadership, they sped off in the direction that Nie Tian was moving in.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">While dashing at a fast speed, Xuan Ke kept his eyes on Nie Tian, who was already quite distant from them, a unsettling sense of danger gradually rising in his heart. Soon, the distance between them and Nie Tian grew longer, and Nie Tian disappeared from their sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Who is he exactly? Why do I feel such a sense of familiarity?”</span></p>
