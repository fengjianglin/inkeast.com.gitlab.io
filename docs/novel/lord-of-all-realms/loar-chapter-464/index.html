<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Seeing that Nie Tian had opened his eyes and awoken from his cultivation, Dong Li asked curiously, “Did your heart race earlier, Nie Tian?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian nodded. “Yeah, it did.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li frowned, her eyes filled with confusion. “This is odd… There must be a reason behind it. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have all experienced it at the same time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Yeah, perhaps something special happened just now. It’s just that we couldn’t tell what it was.” Nie Tian chimed in, though he knew in his heart that the sudden accelerated heartbeat Dong Li and the others had experienced just now had been caused by the transcendence of his bloodline.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Earlier, when new crystal-like chains had been created within the green aura in his heart, and his perception of life in his surroundings skyrocketed, he had detected the aura of four exceptionally vigorous lives within a 500 kilometer radius, as well as Dong Li and the others around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At that moment, all those who had been detected by him had experienced a sudden spike in their heartbeat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Since he didn’t intend to share the uniqueness of his bloodline power or any of this with anyone, he pondered hard with furrowed eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“Three of those four clusters of life aura were constantly on the move. They should have been Profound realm experts from the Tool Sect who are searching for Zhao Shanling. The fourth cluster of life aura was very subtle because it was isolated from the outside world by numerous spatial energy wards. I’m ninety percent sure that’s Zhao Shanling.</span></em></p>
 <p><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“He’s holed up underground in the Bonebrutes’ former headquarters, controlling the Death Reign from hundreds of thousands of kilometers away.</span></em></p>
 <p><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“Perhaps I should inform a Tool Sect elder of Zhao Shanling’s hiding place.”</span></em></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhao Shanling, who had returned from the space disruption zone, was the person behind the turmoil in the Realm of Unbounded Desolation. As long as the Tool Sect could find and attack him, he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on manipulating the Death Reign.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Death Reign’s destination was the Tool Sect’s headquarters, which meant it would have to pass the cluster of volcanoes where Li Ye and the other equipment forgers were forging spiritual tools for the assessment assembly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though he had no ties with the Tool Sect, he cared about Li Ye and Pei Qiqi’s safety.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Furthermore, Zhen Huilan must still be closely attached to the Tool Sect. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have joined the search for Zhao Shanling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had never met Zhen Huilan in person. Nevertheless, he had found shelter in her residence after he left the Realm of Flame Heaven due to her close relationship with Hua Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Not long ago, regarding Nie Tian’s relationship with the Blood Sect, she had not only indirectly saved Li Jing and Shen Xiu, but she had even allowed them to take Meng Qing’s Bone Giant with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a brief pondering, he decided to inform a Tool Sect expert of Zhao Shanling’s hiding place.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It was just that many powerful experts from the Tool Sect, including the Profound realm Zhen Huilan and the Soul realm Wu Langxie, had been searching hard for some time, but failed to find anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Moreover, both Zhen Huilan and Wu Langxie had been to the Bone Sect, which was fairly close to the Bonebrutes’ former headquarters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As powerful as they were, they had failed to perceive Zhao Shanling’s existence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If he simply showed up and pointed out to a Tool Sect expert that Zhao Shanling had been hiding underground in the Bonebrutes’ former headquarters this entire time, wouldn’t it raise questions?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Would they believe him? Would they ask him how he had obtained such knowledge afterwards?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With such thoughts, he frowned, torn with indecision.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At that moment, Dong Li’s raised voice caught his ears. As he turned to look, she seemed a bit angry. “What are you thinking about? Why don’t you answer my question?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Confusion spread across Nie Tian’s face as he asked, “What did you say?” Since he had been wracking his mind for a way to inform the Tool Sect of Zhao Shanling’s location without raising questions, he hadn’t heard the question Dong Li just asked him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I said: do you think this place is safe, and do we need to switch to another location?” Dong Li repeated her question, her charming eyebrows slightly furrowed. “I have a bad feeling about our previously accelerated heartbeats. I think danger might be lurking in the dark. I know you have a keen perception of your surroundings, so I wanted to ask for your opinion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“You’re right.” Nie Tian answered. “This location might not be very safe for us.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Having determined Zhao Shanling’s location, he felt that they were rather close to him. It would be safer if they moved to a location that was further away from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li’s eyes grew wide. “Really? Show us a direction that’s safe then!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even the middle Profound realm Li Jing was present, but she had decided to ask for Nie Tian’s opinion instead of Li Jing’s. This indicated what kind of position Nie Tian held in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Gazing at the concerned Dong Li, Nie Tian thought of an idea: he might as well hand this tough matter to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had long since known Dong Li as a thorny rose. The fact that she had been able to save Li Jing and Shen Xiu by framing people from the Bone Sect was enough evidence of her cunningness.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Furthermore, everyone knew the key to end the turmoil in the Realm of Unbounded Desolation lay with Zhao Shanling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Finding Zhao Shanling would be considered a major meritorious service. This was actually a good chance to distinguish himself and win attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, considering his special identity, unique bloodline, the fact that he had mysteriously gone missing with the Spirit Pearl in the Realm of Dark Underworld, and most important of all, his unpleasant history with Wu Ling, it wouldn’t necessarily be a good thing if he attract too many eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">On the other hand, Dong Li had helped him on many occasions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Back when he had been locked down by the Spirit Pearl in the Realm of Dark Underworld, Dong Li had followed his instructions without the slightest hesitation, and taken him away from the lake with the help of her black phoenix. Not long ago, she had set up members of the Bone Sect and saved Li Jing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Before he knew it, the relationship between him and this woman had already changed from being irreconcilable enemies to allies who fight side by side.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a thorough consideration, he decided to give this opportunity to determine the fate of the Realm of Unbounded Desolation to Dong Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With this decision in mind, Nie Tian called out to Li Jing, who was sitting not far from him, “Senior Li, Dong Li just received a message from a senior of her clan that says the location we’re in isn’t safe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing these words, Dong Li was confused at first, but nodded immediately afterwards to uphold Nie Tian’s statement.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian marveled at her intelligence inwardly, thinking she did make an excellent teammate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Surprised and confused, Li Jing rose to her feet in a graceful fashion and asked, “Where is safer then?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Pointing in a direction, Nie Tian said, “500 kilometers down that way. We’ll be much safer over there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Li Jing nodded and rapidly summoned her Blood Lotus. Then, she beckoned for Nie Tian to jump on board. “Come on. I’ll take you there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Shen Xiu, Feng Luo, and Yu Tong also fixed their gazes on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At that moment, Nie Tian shook his head and said with an apologetic tone, “You go first, Senior Li. Dong Li and I will come for you in a couple of days. That senior of hers is worried about her safety, and she’s on her way here. I’ll stay and keep Dong Li safe. Also, I have a friend in the Dong Clan. I want to ask about his situation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I see." Li Jing didn’t ask any questions. “Alright, we’re off then. Come and find us as soon as you’re finished.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I will,” Nie Tian promised.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, Li Jing beckoned for Shen Xiu, Feng Luo, and Yu Tong to jump onto the Blood Lotus.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After they were on board, Li Jing thought briefly before she turned to Dong Li and said, “Thank you for helping us. Please give my regards to your senior. If members of the Dong Clan ever come to the Realm of Flame Heaven, all they need to do is state their identity, and we’ll receive them with our highest standards.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li smiled gracefully. “Thanks, will do.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Take care.” With these words, the Blood Lotus rose into the air and sped off towards the distant horizon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After Li Jing and the others left, Dong Li pursed her lips into a smile and said, “I saw the way that girl named Yu Tong looked at you before they left. She seemed to be rather reluctant to leave. She has a pretty face, but she’s just a bit young and immature. Did you two ever...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“No,” Nie Tian denied.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“It’d be a wonder if you didn’t.” Dong Li rolled her eyes at him, but didn’t dwell on the matter. “Okay, now, tell me why you sent those people from the Blood Sect away and what you want with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As smart as she was, she had seen through Nie Tian’s little trick since Nie Tian’s first sentence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian was surprised. “You knew I sent them away on purpose? Does that mean Senior Li also knew?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li smiled. “Of course they did. They aren’t stupid. They just didn’t want to point it out.” With these words, she stretched, showing the perfect curves of her chest. Nie Tian couldn’t help but take a few glances at it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I don’t know them anyways,” said Dong Li. “Their leaving suits me fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She seemed to catch Nie Tian peeping at her chest, and thus deliberated slowed her stretching motion. When Nie Tian’s gaze was fully caught by her ample breasts, she abruptly recovered. Looking into Nie Tian’s eyes, she smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian, who had long since grown used to her taunting, didn’t seem embarrassed at all. Rather, he remained calm and composed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li seemed to have had her fun. Her watery eyes rippled with a charming light as she looked at Nie Tian with an anticipating expression on her smiling face. “Alright, tell me. What do you want with me?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I’m certain that Zhao Shanling is currently hiding under the bottom of huge crater in the Bonebrutes’ former headquarters,” Nie Tian brought out the truth with a solemn tone. “He has sealed himself up within multiple spatial energy wards so that no soul consciousness can reach him. But don’t ask me how I know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A shudder ran through Dong Li’s tender body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She didn’t utter a word, but various looks rapidly flashed across her eyes, as if she were pondering what she would do with such information.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Moments later, she opened her mouth. “Why are you telling me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She didn’t ask Nie Tian how he had learned about it, nor how certain he was.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This meant she had faith in Nie Tian’s judgment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though what Nie Tian said was far beyond her imagination, she didn’t question him in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian could feel her absolute trust. Touched, he said sincerely, “I’m only telling you because I trust you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li’s charming eyes glittered as she nodded gently, a hearty smile apearing at the corner of her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I know it’s better that I keep a low profile, so I figure you can give the information to the Tool Sect,” Nie Tian said.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Are you aware that once they find Zhao Shanling because of this piece of information, the situation in the Realm of Unbounded Desolation will be different? For the Tool Sect, whoever helps them find Zhao Shanling will be considered a hero who has saved them from a calamity.” Dong Li pointed out the importance of such information.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian smiled. “I owe you a lot, don’t I? Consider this as a favor returned to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li’s eyes lit up. “You fool. You have no idea how valuable this opportunity is!” She flashed to Nie Tian’s side, bringing a whiff of her scent to Nie Tian’ face, and kissed him lightly on the cheek, like a dragonfly touching the water’s surface.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Looking at the dumbstruck Nie Tian, she said, smiling, “I’ll take it, little brother.”</span></p>
