<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This was the first time Nie Tian had used the Flame Star.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After appearing behind Yuan Fengchun’s back and bringing out the Flame Star, Nie Tian infused it with his flame power, wood power, and star power. The Flame Star immediately began to shine with glorious, fiery light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The numerous tiny stars on its blade also seemed to suddenly light up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The various types of power flowed within the spell formations on the Flame Star at a very fast speed. Bolstered by the spell formations, the streams of power of different attributes rushed towards the tip of the blade like torrential rivers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">FIZZ!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A beam of dazzling, fiery light laced with starlight suddenly shot out from the tip of the Flame Star.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yuan Fengchun, who was still imposing his offer on An Rong, suddenly sensed the aura of death from behind him, and thus summoned earth power as quickly as he could.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">An earthy-yellow light shield instantly formed on his back. Not only that, but even his skin and flesh under his garments seemed to be infused with his earthy-yellow spiritual aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BANG!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The moment the mixed light unleashed by the Flame Star made contact with the earthy-yellow light shield, the light shield shattered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">PUFF!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Immediately afterwards, the Flame Star pierced into Yuan Fengchun’s back and infused the various types of spiritual power into his flesh and blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Ahhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yuan Fengchun let out an agonized shriek, and hastily attempted to summon more of his strength to defend against the various types of spiritual power that had invaded his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, enveloped by Nie Tian’s chaotic magnetic field, he was no longer capable of wielding his own strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He even began to experience an excruciating pain in his head, and he had to make great efforts to maintain a clear mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Assuming a firm grip on the Flame Star, his eyes filled with frigid coldness, Nie Tian once again summoned the various types of power within him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">CRACKLE! CRACKLE!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the Flame Star pierced deeper into Yuan Fengchun’s back, it broke a few bones.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meanwhile, Nie Tian madly drew from his burning rage and formed a Rage Punch with his unoccupied hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As Nie Tian’s fist bombarded Yuan Fengchun’s back with great force, Yuan Fengchun was sent flying towards where An Rong was standing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">An Rong, however, seemed to have been shocked into a daze.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Only at that moment did the Yuan Clan members realize what was happening, and charge madly towards Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Kill that man!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“He actually dares to make a move on our clanmaster!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Kill him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">When Nie Tian had quietly approached Yuan Fengchun from behind, none of the Yuan Clan members had been alarmed. After all, he had cloaked all of his spiritual and fleshy aura using Life Stealth, so in the eyes of those Yuan Clan members, he was nothing more than a mortal onlooker.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Normally, they wouldn’t raise their guard at all when a mortal approached them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Not to mention that the Yuan Clan was the most powerful clan in Black Cloud City now. Every man and woman in Black Cloud City had been exerting all measures to please the Yuan Clan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This had attributed to the Yuan Clan’s blind arrogance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They had never expected that anyone would dare to openly lay a murderous hand on their clanmaster in Black Cloud City.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">By the time they realized what was going on, Nie Tian had already driven his Flame Star into Yuan Fengchun’s back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Who are you?!” Enraged, every Yuan Clan member summoned their spiritual tools and assumed a stance that showed that they were determined to rip Nie Tian into pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Holding the Flame Star with one hand, Nie Tian didn’t spare Yuan Fengchun another glance, but rather expanded his chaotic magnetic field to a five-meter radius.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The first few Yuan Clan members who unwittingly charged into the chaotic magnetic field were all at the Heaven stage. Having their inner powers disrupted by the chaotic magnetic field, they couldn’t help but stagger about.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Like a blade that was designated for reaping lives, the Flame Star unleashed numerous beams of fiery light laced with frosty sparks of starlight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">PUFF! PUFF!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The few men who were the closest to Nie Tian were the first to have their chests penetrated by the Flame Star’s blade lights, and died instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon seeing this scene, the citizens of Black Cloud City seemed to have sensed danger, and all began shoving each other backwards to keep a longer distance from Nie Tian in a loud clamor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian still didn’t say a word. Holding his Flame Star, he repeatedly cast Starshifts to appear in different locations.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Every time he cast a Starshift and appeared in another location, he would slaughter a member of the Yuan Clan effortlessly with the same method he had used to sneak up on Yuan Fengchun.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yuan Fengchun was the only one in the Yuan Clan who could be considered a truly powerful expert.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As a matter of fact, they used to have another Greater Heaven stage expert in their clan. However, he had been crushed to death by a meteor right before the Heaven Gate had opened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At present, none of the Yuan Clan members or guest elders were experts with Greater Heaven stage or higher cultivation bases; Yuan Fengchun had been the only exception.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian had already lost count of how many Qi warriors with similar cultivation bases he had killed in the Realm of Split Void.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Furthermore, the strength of these Heaven stage Yuan Clan members couldn’t even match up to that of a Heaven stage Hunter, much less that of Heaven stage Dark Moon member.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Combining his unpredictable movement magics and the Flame Star together, Nie Tian was like a tiger that had grown wings.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though the Yuan Clan members and guest elders had formed a blockade, Nie Tian moved unpredictably around them, and rapidly reaped their lives with his Flame Star.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It wasn’t very long before the guest elders realized that it was a lost cause, and fled with their tails between their legs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even the formal members of the Yuan Clan gradually grew desperate, watching their brothers pierced through and killed by Nie Tian in such bizarre ways one by one.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though they still kept shouting threatening words, they backed further and further away from Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as they left Nie Tian’s sight, they rapidly turned around and scurried away at full speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It wasn’t long before they were all gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Lying around Nie Tian were more than twenty bodies, all of whom were elite members of the Yuan Clan at the Heaven stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After this encounter, even if the Yuan Clan wasn’t completely uprooted from Black Cloud City, it would be very hard for them to maintain a foothold here.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian didn’t run after the fleeing Yuan Clan members and guest elders. Instead, he glared at Yuan Fengchun, standing amongst the scattered corpses.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He knew Yuan Fengchun hadn’t died.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At that moment, Yuan Fengchun had already sat up. Blood was pouring out of the deep wound in his back, and his chest was painted red by the blood he had puked. His eyes were filled with hate as he stared back at Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Who are you?! What did the Yuan Clan ever do to you?!” Yuan Fengchun asked, gnashing his teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this point, only a handful of onlookers were still standing in the street, and they all seemed to be at the late Heaven stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Their eyes were filled with fear as they gazed at Nie Tian from a safe distance, as if they were prepared to turn around and run the moment Nie Tian pointed the Flame Star at them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">An Rong still hadn’t recovered from the shock. Completely dumbstruck, he stood in his original location and didn’t utter a word.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had never expected that some stranger would show up and basically annihilate the Yuan Clan that had lorded over Black Cloud City for more than half a year.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He couldn’t figure out who in the entire Realm of Flame Heaven would massacre members of the Yuan Clan like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As far as he knew, since the Grayvale Sect had almost been wiped out and Yuan Xian had become their last remaining force, all the sects had united against their common enemies during perilous times, and they had all shown great sympathy towards Yuan Xian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Under these circumstances, each sect would restrain their members from making any moves on the Yuan Clan, even if they had unsettled feuds between them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“You don’t recognize me, but I’ve heard so much about you.” As Nie Tian paced towards Yuan Fengchun, the Flame Star in his hand once again blossomed with glorious, fiery light and starlight. “Ever since I was old enough to remember things, I learned that you and Yun Meng from the Yun Clan ganged up on my grandfather and shattered his spiritual sea, which caused his cultivation base to decay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He spoke in a calm manner as he paced his way towards Yuan Fengchun.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Before, I wasn’t strong enough, so even though I hated your guts, I couldn’t do anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“However, when I entered the Green Illusion dimension, I finally had my first chance. So, I killed Yun Song from the Yun Clan and the rising star of your clan, Yuan Feng.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“What?!” Yuan Fengchun became agitated and puked another mouthful of blood. “It was you who killed Little Feng?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yuan Feng from the Grayvale Sect had been the most promising member of his generation in the Yuan Clan. However, he had died prematurely during the Green Illusion dimension trial.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">According to the Spiritual Treasure Sect, Yuan Feng had been killed by trial-takers from the Blood Sect and the Ghost Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Exactly. Both Yuan Feng and Yun Song died at my hands.” Nie Tian grinned and pulled off his mask, saying, “Before, I was weak, so I could only bury the truth deeply in my heart. However, times have changed. It feels so good to be able to spill it out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The moment he took off his mask, An Rong and An He shouted out his name, their faces filled with disbelief. “Nie Tian!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“It’s Nie Tian!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yuan Fengchun shrieked. “Nie Tian! You are Nie Tian?!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian nodded, saying, “Exactly. I’m Nie Donghai’s grandson. I’ve come here today to send you on your way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A beam of blindingly bright light flashed across Yuan Fengchun’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the next moment, his head was severed and pushed up into the air by the blood rushing out of his neck, though his eyes were still wide open.</span></p>
