<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span>The starlight that was pouring down from the ceiling of the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace wasn’t limitless.</span></p>
 <p><span>It wasn’t very long before the shiny, silver light stopped falling.</span></p>
 <p><span>At that time, Nie Tian was surprised to discover that there were three fragmentary stars in his soul.</span></p>
 <p><span>Within his soul, all three of them hung high in the sky, shining with bright light. Not only was the psychic power they contained incomparably pure and condensed, they also carried the profound might of stars.</span></p>
 <p><span>The existence of the three fragmentary stars made Nie Tian’s soul seem full of mysteries and even slightly resemble the vast starry river.</span></p>
 <p><span>When the starlight stopped falling, Nie Tian gradually awoke from his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span>At that time, his understandings of the first part of the Fragmentary Star Incantation was still limited to the method to attract starlight into his soul, and he was fairly certain that he would have to further explore its secrets in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span>As soon as he snapped open his eyes, he felt enlivened; both his spiritual power and flesh power had fully recovered.</span></p>
 <p><span>Furthermore, after the three fragmentary stars took form in his soul, his psychic power had also reached an unprecedentedly high level!</span></p>
 <p><span>He immediately looked towards the Heaven stage area and found that the fight between the two was already over.</span></p>
 <p><span>The losing party had been torn into pieces, scattered around on the floor, while his head was lying meters away from the rest of his body.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was a horrible scene.</span></p>
 <p><span>The winner, on the other hand, was sitting among the severed limbs, wreathed in a strong, bloody aura. Face pale, eyes narrowed, he was gathering the spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth to gradually restore his strength.</span></p>
 <p><span>“The fight is over...” Nie Tian immediately rose to his feet and sent a wisp of his psychic awareness into the ten floating energy balls around him.</span></p>
 <p><span>Without the slightest hesitation, he dashed towards the river of seven-colored light, as he had been waiting for this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span>At the same time, he used his psychic power to manipulate the ten energy balls to follow him and cross that river into the adjacent area.</span></p>
 <p><span>The moment he stepped into the seven-colored light river, he seemed to set off some hidden restrictive spell of the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span>All of a sudden, numerous beams of bright light, along with an examining and judging aura, shot out of the light river and enveloped him in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p><span>It seemed that the hexagram within the Heaven Gate pattern on Nie Tian’s hand had sensed the action of the restrictive spell, and immediately started to shine with dazzling starlight.</span></p>
 <p><span>Almost simultaneously, the examining aura in the seven-colored light disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian instantly felt a sense of relief and then steadily walked forward in the miraculous river that was filled with light and energy.</span></p>
 <p><span>The ten energy balls, which he had condensed with the spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth in the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace, followed him into seven-colored light river.</span></p>
 <p><span>Since the energy within those balls shared the same source as the energy in the light river, they weren’t rejected and no examining aura flew anywhere near them.</span></p>
 <p><span>One after another, all the energy balls slowly followed Nie Tian across the seven-colored river.</span></p>
 <p><span>Originally, the powerful expert sitting amongst his opponent’s severed limbs didn’t even notice Nie Tian, the only survivor from the Lesser Heaven stage area. Only when he sensed that someone had crossed the seven-colored light river did he look over and catch sight of Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span>Before that, he had focused all his attention on the Greater Heaven stage area, where he saw only two survivors: Su Lin’s martial uncle and Tang Yang from the Realm of Dark Underworld.</span></p>
 <p><span>At that time, their fight had reached a critical moment in which a winner was about to be born.</span></p>
 <p><span>Knowing that he wouldn’t be able to cross the restrictive river into the Lesser Heaven stage area even though he had already obtained the middle part of the Fragmentary Star Incantation, he had long since given up the idea of snatching the first part of the incantation.</span></p>
 <p><span>He knew that he would only be able to challenge the survivor of the Greater Heaven stage area and try his luck with obtaining the final part of the incantation with his Heaven stage strength.</span></p>
 <p><span>Since he was familiar with the rules within the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace, he had set his mind on the Greater Heaven stage expert from the Heaven Palace sect and completely ignored Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span>The final part of the Fragmentary Star Incantation had become his sole focus, so he was very surprised with Nie Tian’s arrival. &nbsp;As a matter of fact, he had expected that someone from the Lesser Heaven stage area might enter his area. However, he had expected that person to be Su Lin.</span></p>
 <p><span>He was very clear about the Heaven Palace sect’s scheme and was no stranger to Su Lin’s fame. That was why he was taken aback when the youngster standing in front of him was Nie Tian, a young man he didn’t know and had never even heard of.</span></p>
 <p><span>A wisp of the man’s psychic awareness swirled around Nie Tian and soon he drew a conclusion regarding his cultivation base. “Middle Lesser Heaven stage…” </span></p>
 <p><span>A slight sneer appear at the corner of the man’s mouth as he shook his head and thought to himself, “I can’t believe Su Lin was defeated by this kid. She must have sustained serious injuries when she fought Wu Ling or Xuan Ke. Or Wu Ling and Xuan Ke teamed up to fight Su Lin, and all three of them suffered severe injuries from their fight, which created a good opportunity for this kid.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Since the experts in the Heaven stage area had started fighting before Nie Tian and the other three, the man didn’t know how their fights went.</span></p>
 <p><span>Furthermore, he never heard of Nie Tian, but he knew Su Lin, Wu Ling, and Xuan Ke rather well and knew that the three of them were all chosen ones from their respective realms.</span></p>
 <p><span>Hence, he took it for granted that Nie Tian had swooped in at the perfect time, snatched the victory, and had then audaciously come to challenge him.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Where are you from, kid?” he asked with an indifferent tone.</span></p>
 <p><span>When he spoke, his eyes brimmed with greed and excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span>“The Realm of Flame Heaven,” Nie Tian answered.</span></p>
 <p><span>The man grinned while shaking his head. “The Realm of Flame Heaven? </span></p>
 <p><span>“Actually, this is good! I can’t cross the seven-colored light river to loot the first part of the Fragmentary Star Incantation even if I want to, but now you’ve come to my door! Who would have expected this?</span></p>
 <p><span>“Hahaha! It seems that today is my lucky day. It’s hard to say if I’ll be able to loot the final part of the Fragmentary Star Incantation, but I can safely say that the first part will soon belong to me!”</span></p>
 <p><span>With these words, he slowly rose to his feet.</span></p>
 <p><span>“My name is Dong Baijie, and I’m from the Realm of a Hundred Battles.” With a smile on his face, the man took the initiative to state his own name. “I wanna thank you in advance for bringing me the first part of the Fragmentary Star Incantation. With that in my hands, I only have one part to go.”</span></p>
 <p><span>A strong fighting spirit rippled out from within Dong Baijie. At the same time, an aura full of brutality and killing intent shot violently into the heavens from the top of his head, in the form of a column of thick, gray smoke.</span></p>
 <p><span>From within the thick smoke, not only did Nie Tian sense a strong psychic power, he also found the fluctuations of a special kind of spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p><span>It seemed to be an aggregation of the man’s psychic power, spiritual power, and thirst for blood!</span></p>
 <p><span>Since the Heaven stage area had just witnessed multiple brutal fights, scattered fighting spirits could be found in every corner of the bloody battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><span>At that moment, all those fighting spirits madly converged and infused into the smoke column that shot out of the top of Dong Baijie’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian originally was convinced that Dong Baijie was in a state of complete exhaustion, like a oil lamp that had run out of oil.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, his fighting spirit and battle prowess seemed to be soaring together with the column above his head!</span></p>
 <p><span>Having stepped out of the river of seven-colored light, Nie Tian said nothing, and without wasting a second, he placed his palms opposite to each other in an attempt to form the chaotic magnetic field as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span>HUFF! HUFF! HUFF!</span></p>
 <p><span>It was also at that time the ten energy balls followed Nie Tian across the seven-colored light river and arrived by his side.</span></p>
 <p><span>As he infused more and more of his psychic power, spiritual power, and flesh power into the magnetic field, it gradually expanded into his surroundings. Meanwhile, he quietly took the third talisman that his master had bestowed upon him out of his bracelet of holding.</span></p>
 <p><span>He was prepared to unleash the power within his master’s talisman at the first possible moment in case Dong Baijie planned to attack him with his psychic power.</span></p>
 <p><span>After all, his biggest weakness was that he didn’t know any psychic magic, and thus was quite vulnerable to psychic attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span>Since he had successfully shielded off the attack of Wu Ling’s evil psychic power with the talisman, he assumed that it would also protect him from Dong Baijie’s psychic attack. Only by maintaining a clear mind and undisturbed soul would he have the chance to obtain the middle part of the Fragmentary Star Incantation.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Give it to me!” Dong Baijie reached out his hand and asked Nie Tian to hand out the first part of the Fragmentary Star Incantation in an imposing manner. </span></p>
 <p><span>Without giving Nie Tian the time to think, the gray, thick smoke column morphed into a giant gray wolf, and lunged towards Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What are you waiting for!? Sever your own hand and get the hell out of the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace!”</span></p>
