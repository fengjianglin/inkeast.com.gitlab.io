<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Pei Qiqi’s injuries were much more serious than she had said they were.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the wisp of Nie Tian’s soul power roamed around inside of her, he grasped even the most subtle changes happening inside of her, with her spiritual sea being the only exception.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Numerous tiny, glowing blades of spatial energy were flowing around within her meridians and veins, inflicting damage on her fleshy body and life force.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian saw with great clarity that several of her veins were almost severed, and obvious fissures had appeared in some of her bones.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She was trying to suppress the blades of spatial energy with her own strength and heal her injuries with her spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, she didn’t possess a supernatural healing ability like Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It would probably take a very long time for her to heal herself without help from others.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Also, she couldn’t fight during the healing process. Otherwise, her injuries would worsen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a brief scan, Nie Tian started trying to infuse the wood power within his energy ball into her body, and use it to heal her damaged veins, meridians, and bones.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, for some reason, he seemed to be unable to channel the wood power from his energy ball into her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a few failed attempts, he eventually had to give up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He shook his head and said with an apologetic expression, “Sorry, it’s not working. Perhaps it’s because you don’t cultivate and practice wood power that I can’t seem to channel the wood power into you. I tried many times, and it turns out I can’t.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“It’s alright. I just thought it was worth a shot. I didn’t put much hope in it anyways.” Looking a bit tired, Pei Qiqi walked away and put some distance between Nie Tian and herself. “You can go back to practice cultivation. Don’t mind me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“B-but your injuries are actually quite serious...” Nie Tian sounded concerned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“It’s alright. I still can suppress them for now,” Pei Qiqi said with a seemingly unconcerned expression. “I’ll have plenty of time to heal myself after we get rid of all of the Poison Sect disciples that dare to come here for us. Stop worrying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian wished to help her, but since he didn’t know how, he could only nod back at her and resume his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A quarter hour later...</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Via his Heaven Eyes, Nie Tian noticed that a few Poison Sect Greater Heaven stage disciples had arrived one after another.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, they didn’t seem to be in a hurry to go into action, as they seemed to understand Pei Qiqi’s and his outstanding battle prowess, and thus decided to wait for more of their sectmates to arrive.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Hence, he continued to practice cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A while later, while he was absorbing spiritual power from spirit stones, a shudder suddenly ran through him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">To his shock, after months of reintegration, the broken will of the titan floating within his vortex of wood power finally completely realigned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The moment it did, a message rose from his spinning vortex of wood power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Heavenly Wood!” These words were reflected in his mind with great clarity, as if they were instantly branded into his memory and became a profound incantation at his command.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As he decoded the secret incantation granted to him by the titan, he discovered that it could be cast in two ways, thus giving rise to two different magics. “<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Heavenly</span> Wood consists of two magics: <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Heavenly</span> Wood Heal and <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Heavenly</span> Wood Thorns!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">One was <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Heavenly</span> Wood Heal, which would allow him to heal injuries and trauma within a short time. If he possessed enough liquidized wood power, he would even be able to reattach meridians or regenerate limbs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The other was <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Heavenly</span> Wood Thorns, which would allow him to send wood power into his enemies’ bodies, and then turn that wood power into sharp thorns.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The fierce thorns could grow and spread inside of his enemies, and even burst out of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian mulled over these two methods of casting <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Heavenly</span> Wood wholeheartedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A while later, he moved behind Pei Qiqi without getting her consent and said in a low voice, “Let me have another try on you, Senior Martial Sister Pei.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“What?!” Pei Qiqi was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Let me try to heal your injuries again.” Nie Tian seemed rather excited. “I believe I’ll succeed this time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Are you serious?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Of course!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, he pressed one hand on Pei Qiqi’s back and quietly cast the <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Heavenly</span> Wood Heal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as he did, he sensed that his vortex of wood power started to spin at a higher rate, and the glittering, liquidized wood power at the bottom of the vortex was rapidly vanishing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the meantime, the hand on Pei Qiqi’s back turned emerald-green and somewhat transparent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Within his transparent meridians, flickering, green spots could be seen flowing from his hand towards the center of Pei Qiqi’s back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Seeing that he was finally able to channel wood power into Pei Qiqi’s back, Nie Tian’s eyes lit up.&nbsp;</span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“Oh, it requires extremely concentrated, liquidized wood power to activate the&nbsp;</span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal"><em>Heavenly</em></span></span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic"><em>&nbsp;</em>Wood Heal!”</span></em></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The reason why he had failed to make use of the wood power in the energy ball earlier was because he hadn’t acquired the magic and he hadn’t personally processed and refined the wood power within the energy ball.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His ability to cast the <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Heavenly</span> Wood Heal was dependent on the liquidized wood power that he generated from round after round of refinement of wood power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Wisps of pure and nourishing wood power that were also laced with his aura flowed into Pei Qiqi’s back under his control.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, he realized that the tissue that had been damaged by the fierce blades of spatial energy was rapidly healing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the wisps of pure wood power spread inside Pei Qiqi, the few almost severed meridians were healed at an alarming rate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even the fissures on some of her bones were rapidly erased as the wood power reached them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Spirit aroused, Nie Tian continued to channel more of his wood power to the cause. Meanwhile, he could sense the liquidized wood power rapidly vanishing from the bottom of his vortex of wood power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Pei Qiqi’s straightened back trembled slightly, her eyes shining with a glorious light of excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The hand Nie Tian used to press on her back felt incomparably warm. She could feel warm currents flowing into her back before splitting into countless fine wisps that were fixing her damaged meridians, veins, and bones.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If she had relied on just her own strength to heal those injuries, it might have taken her more than a month.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, she could physically feel all of her injuries being healed at an extremely fast rate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With her back towards Nie Tian, her normally-cold but gorgeous face was now filled with joy. She had expected that Nie Tian was a man of many secrets, but she had never expected that he actually had the ability to heal her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Within seconds, she already felt that her injuries, which had bothered her for quite some time, had mostly been healed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She was aware that if Nie Tian wasn’t able to heal her, she would definitely suffer serious injuries when fighting more disciples of the Poison Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The large amount of small blades of spatial energy would have further ravaged her fleshy body and life force.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Just as she was carried away by these thoughts, Nie Tian’s voice echoed out by her ear, “More Poison Sect disciples are coming at us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She snapped back to reality and took the initiative to end the ongoing healing process. She turned around to look Nie Tian in the eye. A rare, faint smile appeared on her face, making her look more beautiful than a hundred blossoming flowers as she said, “I’m fine now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Sitting on the ground, Nie Tian looked up at her and the smile on her face, and he was temporarily bewildered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She was always cold and expressionless. Even if it was just a faint smile, it multiplied her singular beauty and bedazzled Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“How are you doing?” Pei Qiqi asked with a concerned tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian briefly examined himself, and discovered that he had already consumed more than half of his liquidized wood power reserve within such a short time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He shook his head and said, “I’m fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The energy ball that was still floating over his palm seemed to suddenly find out about his lack of wood power, and started pouring madly into his vortex of wood power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Within seconds, the energy ball completely disappeared. Meanwhile, Nie Tian’s vortex of wood power rotated at full speed, and the consumed liquidized wood power was rapidly replenished.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“This place agrees with me,” he said with a bright smile. “The special environment here allows me to recover the wood power I spent on you at a shocking speed. I’ll continue to help you with your injuries after we get rid of those Poison Sect disciples. You can fight without any scruples. I’ll heal your injuries afterwards. Don’t worry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Pei Qiqi nodded gently. “Okay, I will.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a fierce smile, Nie Tian rose to his feet and summoned his Flame Star. “A total of nine people are coming at us this time. Aside from the two who escaped from us earlier, there’s only one late Greater Heaven stage disciple among the seven newcomers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Good,” Pei Qiqi said in a composed manner. “Leave those two late Greater Heaven stage ones to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I’ve got a better plan,” Nie Tian said with a cunning and bloodthirsty grin. “Do you remember how we ambushed that Thunder Mountain Sect disciple to save Shi Qing? Since no Worldly realm or Profound realm experts can enter here, nor their soul awarenesses, there are many ways we can surprise them and take them out one by one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“You’ll lure them in while I surprise them from the dark. Let’s work together and turn this floating continent into the grave of all Poison Sect Greater Heaven stage disciples!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Let’s do it," Pei Qiqi sounded deeply intrigued.</span></p>

 <p>Part seven:</p>
 <h3><strong><span style="font-size: 18px">Imperial Chinese Violence</span></strong></h3>
 <p>In ancient times the imperial court subjected traitors and spies to "five horses split the body," a punishment intended to destroy a person not only on earth but in the afterlife. Officials who committed and egregious offense were sometimes dismembered alive and skinned to death. Another particularly nasty imperial punishment was "death by a thousand cuts."</p>
 <p>Emperors commonly killed their brothers, uncles, nephews and other relatives during their grab for power to eliminate rivals.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Families, friends and neighbors of the accused were often punished along with the accused himself.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ancient Chinese soldiers often presented the head of enemy soldiers killed in battle to Emperor or his ministers or generals. This was done not for religious or ritualistic reasons but simply to prove the soldiers had performed their duty and thus claim their pay. Sometimes prisoners of war were sacrificed. Other times they were deported to a different part of the kingdom.</p>
