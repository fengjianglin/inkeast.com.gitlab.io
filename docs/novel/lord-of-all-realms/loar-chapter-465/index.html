<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Rubbing his cheek where Dong Li’s lips had been, Nie Tian was dumbstruck.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He hadn’t expected that Dong Li would kiss him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li’s face blossomed into a bright smile. “You should look at your face. Now, you look even more like a fool.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Instead of backing away after initiating the kiss, she pressed herself close to Nie Tian and said with a flirtatious tone, “Alright, tell me: how do you propose I inform the people from the Tool Sect?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian snapped out of his daze and said, “I suppose some Tool Sect elders are still searching in the vicinity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“But as you know, I’m not good at finding people,” Dong Li said.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian nodded. “I’ll take care of that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Eyes narrowed, he got ahold of his bearings and sped towards the Bonebrutes’ former headquarters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Of the three clusters of life aura he had detected earlier, that one was the closest to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li followed along and said, “Try not to say anything from now on. I’ll do the talking so that the people from the Tool Sect don’t question your identity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“That’s what I was thinking,” Nie Tian said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He secretly commanded his nine Heaven Eyes to fly towards the direction where he and Dong Li were heading, hoping to find that Tool Sect expert he had detected earlier as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Two hours later, when one of his Heaven Eyes discovered that expert, Nie Tian immediately withdrew it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The other eight Heaven Eyes also vanished at lightning speed as soon as he withdrew his soul power from them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It wasn’t long before Qi Yin’s soul awareness, which he had unleashed to search for Zhao Shanling, caught the aura of Nie Tian and Dong Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qin Yi immediately flew towards the two of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Within seconds, he appeared in the air above Nie Tian and Dong Li’s heads. Surprised by the sight of Dong Li, he said, “Dong Li? How come you’re here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li looked up and discovered that it was Qin Yi. Overjoyed, she said, “Why are you here, Great Grandpa Qin?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qin Yi was from the Water Moon Chamber of Commerce, Qin Yan’s great grandfather. Since Dong Li was good friends with Qin Yan, and she had met him on many occasions before, she recognized him at once.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I asked a friend to forge me a spiritual tool here in the Realm of Unbounded Desolation. The equipment forging turned out to be a failure, but I came to learn about the return of Zhao Shanling and his Death Reign. Therefore, I’m helping the Tool Sect find that traitor.” With these words, Qin Yi descended from midair, and his gaze landed on Nie Tian. “Who’s this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Oh, he’s a friend of mine,” Dong Li answered without thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Looking deeply at Nie Tian, a flash of light flashed across Qin Yi’s eyes as he exclaimed, “Is this the Wu Tian who went to the Realm of Dark Underworld with you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though he was friends with Hua Mu, since Hua Mu had never told him about Nie Tian, he didn’t know that Wu Tian was actually Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, as one of the chiefs of the Water Moon Chamber of Commerce, he had learned about what had happened in the Realm of Dark Underworld not long ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After returning from the Water Moon Chamber of Commerce, Qin Yan had told him everything about their exploration trip to the Realm of Dark Underworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The only thing she had held back was the fact that Wu Tian was actually Nie Tian, because she had promised Dong Li that she would keep that a secret.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Therefore, Qin Yi only knew that a young man named Wu Tian, who was a subordinate of Dong Li, had played an important role in their exploration trip before he had eventually gone missing with a mysterious object forged by the Phantasms.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Later, when everyone on the exploration team had returned to the Realm of Dark Underworld, Dong Li was the only one who had stayed there for some reason. The entire Dong Clan had worried about her safety.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The moment Dong Li saw Qin Yi, she knew she wouldn’t be able to keep Nie Tian’s identity as Wu Tian from him, and thus said, “Yes, this is Wu Tian.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Many people from the Realm of a Hundred Battles had seen the mask Nie Tian was wearing, which had been given to him by Dong Baijie as a gift. A brief inspection, and Qin Yi would learn that the young man before him was the ‘Wu Tian’ who had been to the Realm of Dark Underworld with Dong Li and many others.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Knowing that she wouldn’t be able to withhold it from Qin Yi, she decided to admit to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, she was slightly worried, not sure if Qin Yan had kept the fact that Wu Tian was another identity of Nie Tian’s from Qin Yi.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Now that he’s still alive, what happened to the Phantasms’ mysterious object?” Qin Yi asked naturally.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li smiled bitterly. “It was already a miracle that he survived that formidable object, great grandpa. Are you telling me that you expected him to secure it while he came back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qin Yi thought for a while. Eyes narrowed, he checked Nie Tian’s cultivation base again, and then said with a nod, “You’re probably right. That’s a bit much to ask for a person at his cultivation level.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Confirming that Nie Tian was only at the early Greater Heaven stage, the same as Dong Li, he deemed he didn’t seem to have what it took to secure a formidable object forged by the Phantasms.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Afterwards, he said, “The Realm of Unbounded Desolation is under great turmoil now. Try not to wander around, and don’t return to Desolate City for now. You’ve always been a resourceful and smart kid. I trust that you know how to protect yourself during such times...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Before he could finish, Dong Li interrupted him with a wry smile on her face. “Alright, alright, great grandpa. I know that you want me to stay out of danger, but I came out here for a reason. I wanted to find an Tool Sect elder who was searching for Zhao Shanling. Of course, it was even better to run into you instead of someone else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“What do you mean?” Qin Yi seemed confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I know where Zhao Shanling is hiding!” Dong Li said with a decisiveness that could sever nails and chop iron.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qin Yi shook his head. “This is not something to joke about, kiddo. I know you’re mischievous and full of tricks, but this isn’t the time for jokes. Elders from the Tool Sect and many powerful experts who are close to the Tool Sect are turning over every stone in the Realm of Boundless Desolation in search of Zhao Shanling, but no one has found anything yet. How could you have found him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A wronged expression appeared on Dong Li’s face. “How would I dare joke about such a matter? Zhao Shanling is hiding underground in the Bonebrutes’s former headquarters. I’m sure of it! Great grandpa, I need you to trust me this time. Take some powerful experts from the Tool Sect there, and dig deep into the ground. I promise you that you’ll find Zhao Shanling there!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qin Yi frowned. “What makes you so sure?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li’s expression grew incomparably serious as she explained, “Wu Tian and I passed by that area quite a few times. We noticed that one of the craters seemed to have been touched by someone. I didn’t know what it was back then. But afterwards, I heard that Zhao Shanling had returned to the Realm of Boundless Desolation and holed up somewhere. That was when I suspected that the man who had disturbed the bottom of that crater was most likely Zhao Shanling!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian inwardly marveled at how skilled Dong Li was at lying.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She didn’t even blush in the slightest as she told the lie, as if she deeply believed what she was saying herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qin Yi snorted out a laugh. “That doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s Zhao Shanling. Even though almost no one goes to the Bonebrutes’ former headquarters now, it wouldn’t surprise me if someone other than Zhao Shanling went there to hide from their enemy. What makes you so sure it is Zhao Shanling?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A hint of hesitation appeared on Dong Li’s face as she said, “Well... You’re right. It may be someone else, but there’s a chance it may be him, right? Since you haven’t found any sign of him yet, you might as well go over there and try your luck, right? What if that person is Zhao Shanling?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a moment of pondering, Qin Yi nodded, saying, “Alright, I’ll notify someone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, he took out a Sound Stone and started communicating with Zhen Huilan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Moments later, intense spatial energy ripples appeared beside him, along with an expanding spot of light, creating an unfathomable spatial tunnel in the middle of nothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhen Huilan floated weightlessly out of the spatial tunnel, which didn’t disappear right away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“That was quick!” Qin Yi exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Is she the one who told you about the anomaly in a crater in the Bonebrutes’ former headquarters?” Zhen Huilan asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, staring at Dong Li, she let out a cold snort and said, “You must be the kid from the Dong Clan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Greetings, Master Zhen,” Dong Li said with great respect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Not long ago, Zhu Bin messaged me that Meng Qing from the Bone Sect might have something to do with Zhao Shanling,” Zhen Huilan said. “After we rushed over there, Mr. Wu ran through Meng Qing’s memories of the past year, but failed to discover anything about Zhao Shanling.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li felt a bit nervous under her penetrating gaze. “Umm... but I did hear those people from the Bone Sect talk about Zhao Shanling.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhen Huilan held her temper. “Fine, I’ll give you the benefit of doubt and trust you one more time. But you’re coming with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As a drowning man would clutch at a straw, even though she had already searched the Bonebrute’s former headquarters more than once and left empty-handed, she decided to go and search again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Of course, she had only searched with her soul awareness and spatial energy magics. She hadn’t tried actually digging into the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Furthermore, she had just received word that her senior martial brother Qi Bailu didn’t seem to be able to stop the Death Reign. Soon, he might be forced to withdraw to the Tool Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Under such circumstances, she couldn’t afford to pass up any information regarding Zhao Shanling’s whereabouts, truthful or false.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Let’s go,” Qin Yi said.</span></p>

 <p>Hey guys, happy Dragon Boat Festival! This is probably the third most important festival that comes after Spring Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival. So I've gathered some contents about this festival. Hope you'll find them interesting.</p>
 <p><strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Definition</span></strong></p>
 <p><span>The Duanwu Festival, also often known as the Dragon Boat Festival, is a traditional holiday originating in China, occurring near the summer solstice. It is also known as Zhongxiao Festival, commemorating fealty and filial piety. The festival now occurs on the 5th day of the 5th month of the traditional Chinese calendar, which is the source of the festival's alternative name, the Double Fifth Festival. The Chinese calendar is lunisolar, so the date of the festival varies from year to year on the Gregorian calendar. In 2017, it occurred on</span><span>May</span><span>&nbsp;30th</span><span>; and in 201</span><span>8</span><span>, on&nbsp;</span><span>June 18th</span><span>.</span></p>
 <p><strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Origin</span></strong></p>
 <p><span>The story best known in modern China holds that the festival commemorates the death of the poet and minister Qu Yuan (c. 340–278 BC) of the ancient state of Chu during the Warring States period of the Zhou Dynasty. A cadet member of the Chu royal house, Qu served in high offices. However, when the king decided to ally with the increasingly powerful state of Qin, Qu was banished for opposing the alliance and even accused of treason. During his exile, Qu Yuan wrote a great deal of poetry. Twenty-eight years later, Qin captured Ying, the Chu capital. In despair, Qu Yuan committed suicide by drowning himself in the Miluo River.</span></p>
 <p><span>It is said that the local people, who admired him, raced out in their boats to save him, or at least retrieve his body. This is said to have been the origin of dragon boat races. When his body could not be found, they dropped balls of sticky rice into the river so that the fish would eat them instead of Qu Yuan's body. This is said to be the origin of zongzi.</span></p>
 <p><strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Practices and activities</span></strong></p>
 <p><span>Dragon boat racing</span></p>
 <p><span>Dragon boat racing has a rich history of ancient ceremonial and ritualistic traditions, which originated in southern central China more than 2500 years ago. The legend starts with the story of Qu Yuan, who was a minister in one of the Warring State governments, Chu. He was slandered by jealous government officials and banished by king. Out of disappointment in the Chu monarch, he drowned himself into the Miluo river. The common people rushed to the water and tried to recover his body. In commemoration of Qu Yuan, people hold dragon boat races yearly on the day of his death according to the legend. They also scattered rice into the water to feed the fish, to prevent them from eating Qu Yuan's body, which is one of the origins of zongzi.</span><span><img src="https://cdn.wuxiaworld.com/uploads/alcohol-sword-immortal/lord-of-all-realms/images/4yk0igos.0n0.jpg" style="width: 300px" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil"></span></p>
 <p><span>Eating Zongzi</span></p>
 <p><span>A notable part of celebrating Duanwu is making and eating zongzi with other family members. People traditionally wrap zongzi in leaves of reed, lotus or banana which give a special aroma and flavor to the sticky rice and fillings. Choices of fillings vary depending on regions. Northern regions in China prefer sweet or dessert-styled zongzi, with bean paste, dates and nuts as fillings. Southern regions in China prefer savory zongzi, with a variety of fillings including marinated pork belly, sausage and salted duck eggs.</span></p>
 <p><span>Zongzi are considered as a symbol of luck, as the pronunciation of zong is very similar to the pronunciation of zhong (中). This character has a positive connotation, used in words such as 中奖 (winning a prize).</span><span><img src="https://cdn.wuxiaworld.com/uploads/alcohol-sword-immortal/lord-of-all-realms/images/j0tnskcy.due.jpg" style="width: 184px" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil"></span></p>
 <p><span>Drinking realgar wine</span></p>
 <p><span>Realgar wine or xionghuang wine is a Chinese alcoholic drink that is made from Chinese yellow wine dosed with powdered realgar, a yellow-orange arsenic sulfide mineral. Realgar is often used as a pesticide against mosquitoes and other insects during the hot summers, and as a common antidote against poison in ancient Asia.</span></p>
