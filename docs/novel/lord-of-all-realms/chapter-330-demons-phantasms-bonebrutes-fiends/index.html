<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span>Years and years ago, the Realm of Split Void had undergone heaven-changing and earth-overturning upheavals, and the spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth in this realm had been tainted. Because of this, every Qi warrior who lived in the Realm of Split Void had a fairly deep understanding of the special spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth they were surrounded by.</span></p>
 <p><span>One of the reasons Li Langfeng, who practiced the art of poison, had come to the Realm of Split Void was to stay away from trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span>The other reason was that he knew that the special green energy in the spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth here could speed up his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span>Perhaps this was why he had a better understanding of the tainted spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth in the Realm of Split Void than most people.</span></p>
 <p><span>After hearing Li Langfeng’s explanation, Nie Tian’s understanding of the tainted spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth in the Realm of Split Void also rose to a whole new level.</span></p>
 <p><span>According to Li Langfeng, the most common and basic energy in this world was spiritual Qi, which human Qi warriors could use to practice cultivation by channeling it into their spiritual seas in their dantian regions.</span></p>
 <p><span>Spiritual Qi existed in every major realm and dimension that was inhabited by a variety of races.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, the uniqueness of some realms and dimensions attributed to the change and mutation of their spiritual Qi.</span></p>
 <p><span>Simply put, since the Scarlet Flame Mountain Range, where the Spiritual Treasure Sect was located, was scorchingly hot year-round, and volcanoes erupted there from time to time, the spiritual Qi in that region turned out to be laced with copious amount of flame energy.</span></p>
 <p><span>If Qi warriors who practiced fire-attributed incantations practiced cultivation in the Spiritual Treasure Sect, they would be able to channel the mixed spiritual Qi into their spiritual seas, where they could sort the spiritual Qi and distribute flame energy into their vortexes of flame power and the plain spiritual energy into their vortexes of spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p><span>In this way, those Qi warriors’ cultivation speed could be greatly enhanced.</span></p>
 <p><span>Similarly, in frigidly cold regions, the spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth was usually laced with frost energy. These regions would be ideal locations for Qi warriors who practiced ice-attributed incantations to practice their cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span>In the same way, some regions had lightning bolts flash across the sky year-round, so the spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth in these regions would carry rich lightning energy. Qi warriors who practiced lightning-attributed incantations would be able to improve their strength in these regions rapidly.</span></p>
 <p><span>The same went for the heavens and earths where outsiders lived. Due to the special structures and features of their realms, the spiritual Qi gradually mutated and turned into demon Qi.</span></p>
 <p><span>Demons were able to refine energy from demon Qi, infuse it into their blood, and use it to strengthen their physical strength, as well as their bloodline power.</span></p>
 <p><span>The so-called tainted spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth in the Realm of Split Void had actually formed when different types of mutated Qi started to leak into this realm through some of the spatial rifts.</span></p>
 <p><span>Those types of Qi suited outsiders’ cultivation perfectly, but when they merged with the spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth in the Realm of Split Void, variation occurred.</span></p>
 <p><span>Such variation made the spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth in the Realm of Split Void unsuitable for human Qi warriors’ cultivation. If they forcibly allowed the tainted spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth inside of them, they would have their flesh and blood corroded.</span></p>
 <p><span>After hearing Li Langfeng’s lecture about the tainted spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth in the Realm of Split Void, Nie Tian finally understood what had happened here.</span></p>
 <p><span>“As far as I know, the spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth in the Realm of Split Void contains at least four types of Qi: demon Qi, phantasm Qi, death Qi, and toxic Qi.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Other than these, other types of mysterious energy that have been spread to this realm via spatial rifts can also be found in the tainted spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth. However, I don’t know much about them.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Langfeng took his time as he explained things to Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Demons cultivate with demon Qi; Phantasms cultivate with phantasm Qi; Bonebrutes cultivate with death Qi; Fiends cultivate with toxic Qi.</span></p>
 <p><span>“We refer to Demons, Phantasms, Bonebrutes, and Fiends as outsiders.</span></p>
 <p><span>“All of these four outsider races used to live in the Domain of the Falling Stars. As a matter of fact, without exception, the realms of the Domain of the Falling Stars used to be these outsiders’ homes.</span></p>
 <p><span>“For example, the Realm of Flame Heaven used to be a paradise for Demons, and was controlled by a powerful Demon clan.</span></p>
 <p><span>“The Realm of Dark Underworld, where I come from, used to belong to Phantasms. Fiends used to live in the Realm of Black Marsh. And the Realm of Unbounded Desolation used to be home to Bonebrutes.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Of course, back then, the Domain of the Falling Stars wasn’t called the Domain of the Falling Stars. It had a different name.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Furthermore, the Demons, Phantasms, Fiends, and Bonebrutes who used to live in those realms were only small branches. The majority of their people lived somewhere else in this vast universe.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Then, people from the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace and other powerful human Qi warriors came here, and after years of bloody warfare, they finally drove all the outsiders out of the Domain of the Falling Stars.</span></p>
 <p><span>“They purged the spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth using mysterious magics and techniques, and finally transformed the Domain of the Falling Stars into a paradise that suited humans.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Without holding anything back, Li Langfeng explained everything he knew to Nie Tian in great detail.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian listened attentively, and took his time to digest the newly-acquired information. Now, he finally had a fairly thorough understanding of the four major outsider races and the special Qi they cultivated.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Alright, let’s get back to work!”</span></p>
 <p><span>While Li Langfeng lectured Nie Tian about the different features of different Qi, he didn’t halt his refinement of the toxic Qi he had absorbed. Now that he was finished, he rose to his feet, backed up to put a sizeable distance between Nie Tian and himself, and beckoned for Nie Tian to form more spiritual energy balls.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian snapped out of his train of thought as he formed four more spiritual energy balls and cast them towards locations close to Li Langfeng.</span></p>
 <p><span>As he condensed those spiritual energy balls, he kept attempting to suppress the violent clash between the various types of frenzied energy within them.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, the result turned out to be next to nothing. The four spiritual energy balls still exploded soon after leaving his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span>Over the following few days, Li Langfeng continued to practice cultivation with Nie Tian’s help, and at the same time, told Nie Tian about the unique features of the different Qi that formed the spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth in the Realm of Split Void, along with stories about the outsider races.</span></p>
 <p><span>In the meantime, there wasn’t any noticeable progress in Nie Tian’s mastery of his spiritual energy balls, as he still couldn’t stop them from exploding within a very limited amount of time.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, as he formed those spiritual energy balls one by one, he paid close attention to the phantasm Qi, demon Qi, death Qi, and toxic Qi within them, and he gradually developed the ability to tell those four types of Qi apart from each other.</span></p>
 <p><span>The cyan light within the spiritual energy balls was phantasm Qi; the purple light was demon Qi, the gray light was death Qi, and the green light was toxic Qi.</span></p>
 <p><span>The four types of Qi were all extremely unstable, and they were the major types of Qi that constituted the spiritual energy balls.</span></p>
 <p><span>Other than them, there were also a variety of energies of unknown origins, but they only took up a very small proportion of the spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth in the Realm of Split Void.</span></p>
 <p><span>Each of the four types of Qi was very active and restless. Once they were concentrated and confined to a small spiritual energy ball, they would constantly clash with one another, and cause strong turbulence.</span></p>
 <p><span>Compared to these types of Qi that suited outsiders’ cultivation, spiritual Qi, which suited human Qi warriors’ cultivation, seemed especially calm and quiet.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, the proportion it took up in a spiritual energy ball was far less than the four types of foreign Qi, and thus it couldn’t bring peace to the spiritual energy ball.</span></p>
 <p><span>On this day, a bright idea suddenly occurred to Nie Tian. “If I increase the percentage of spiritual Qi in my spiritual energy balls, will it make them easier for me to control?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Therefore, as he continued to condense more spiritual energy balls later, he intentionally channeled his own spiritual power out of his spiritual sea and into his spiritual energy balls in order to increase the percentage of spiritual Qi in his spiritual energy balls.</span></p>
 <p><span>To his surprise, when copious amount of peaceful spiritual Qi poured into his spiritual energy balls, although the four types of foreign Qi still clashed with one another and the spiritual energy balls were still turbulent, he could use his psychic awareness to manipulate the spiritual energy he had put in there and try to separate the four types of foreign Qi, resulting in conspicuous changes.</span></p>
 <p><span>His spiritual energy spread out into thin layers. Like wards, they separated the four types of violent Qi, which greatly weakened the conflict between them.</span></p>
 <p><span>Furthermore, the more spiritual energy Nie Tian infused into his spiritual energy balls, the stabler they became.</span></p>
 <p><span>As a result, his spiritual energy balls became much stabler than before, and the time before they exploded became longer and more controllable.</span></p>
 <p><span>Although, by doing this, he might have to consume his own power, he would be able to control the spiritual energy balls more accurately, and in battle, he would be able to use them to attack enemies over a long distance without worrying that they would explode midway and cut their might in half.</span></p>
