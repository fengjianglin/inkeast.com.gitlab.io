 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the depths of the Void Illusion Mountain Range in the Realm of Split Void.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">People flew out of a spatial rift one after another. They all subconsciously surrounded themselves with spiritual power shields as they did so.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Nie Tian wasn’t mistaken! We’re finally back!” Cao Qiushui exclaimed excitedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After landing on the ground, they rapidly glanced around and realized that they had indeed returned to the Realm of Split Void.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Pei Qiqi flew out of the spatial rift after the others, and then stood in silence, waiting for Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Ye Qin unleashed her psychic awareness to scan the vicinity, and then said with her face filled with confusion, “This is strange. Why can’t I sense any signs of life here? What happened here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing her words, the others also scanned their surroundings, and soon realized that there was indeed not a single soul in this area.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">While they were deeply puzzled, Nie Tian flew out from the spatial rift and landed in the middle of the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Immediately afterwards, Pei Qiqi shrewdly discovered that the spatial rift, which was originally very stable, instantly started to fluctuate with glowing light, as if it had now become full of danger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She also believed that even if the other end of the spatial rift continued to exist on the island they had just come from, the outsiders wouldn’t be able to go through it and survive.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It seemed as if the appearance of this spatial rift had been designed for Nie Tian personally. Once he had gone through it, it instantly became turbulent and dangerous again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That was when she realized why Nie Tian had insisted on entering the spatial rift after everyone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had been aware that this would happen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Seeing that Nie Tian had also come out of the spatial rift, all the chosen ones expressed their gratitude towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“As long as I’m with the Ice Pavilion Sect, I’ll do everything within my power to make sure that you’re the Ice Pavilion Sect’s friend,” Xuan Ke said with all seriousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The other Ice Pavilion Sect disciples also bowed respectfully towards Nie Tian, sharing Xuan Ke’s attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Ye Qin and Chen Hao exchanged a glance, then also expressed that no matter what, no matter when, Nie Tian would always be the Yin Sect and the Yang Sect’s friend.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, Qian Xin from the Pill Pavilion Sect, Cao Qiushui from the Cao Clan, and Qin Yan from the Water Moon Chamber of Commerce expressed their gratitude one after another.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even Gu Haofeng from the Gu Clan, who had always considered Nie Tian as an unpleasant adversary, said after a moment of hesitation, “The Gu Clan owes you one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Baijie and Dong Li didn’t say much to thank Nie Tian. They just stood closely beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I hope that all of us will remember what Nie Tian has done for us, and keep what he has done to those from the Heaven Palace Sect and the Flame God Sect a secret,” Dong Li urged everyone with a serious expression. “Even though those people were despicable, and even death couldn’t atone for their deeds, their sects are still very powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Now, most of them are dead, and the rest may not make it back either.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“However, once they learn about what happened in that dimension, none of us will be able to escape their fury, especially Nie Tian!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Everyone nodded, showing that they understood, and that they would guard their mouths like a covered bottle. (Idiom: keep their mouths shut)</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, she turned to Nie Tian and said, “Nie Tian, now that we’re back in the Domain of the Falling Stars, I think you’d better make some alterations to your appearance and use a different identity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">These words seemed to wake him from his thoughts. He glanced bewilderingly over the crowd and said, “Um, you’re right.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though the ancient awareness had only allowed him a brief glimpse of the entire bottom continent before putting him through the spatial rift, it was enough to shake him deeply.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It allowed him to understand that the two islands he had been to, even including the black sea, were only the tip of an iceberg compared to the whole continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He wondered how long that boundless continent had existed, and how many mysteries were still waiting for him to uncover.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Everyone present had gained considerable amounts of spiritual materials from the two islands, many of which had gone extinct or never appeared in the Domain of the Falling Stars. It was very hard to put a price on them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It was safe to say that each and every one of them had gained a great fortune from their trip.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, what they had gained was only from two islands...</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Nie Tian, are you listening to me or not?” Dong Li sounded somewhat displeased.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Only then did he snap back to his senses. He cast these other thoughts out of his mind and nodded, saying, “I’m listening. I hear you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“For all we know, the outsiders are trying to go through that huge vortex to the top continent,” Qin Yan said with a grim face. “Perhaps it won’t be very long before they find those spatial rifts and march into the Domain of the Falling Stars through them. Now that we’re back, we need to inform our sects and clans as soon as possible. Hopefully, we’ll be able to figure out a way to close them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Seal those spatial rifts?” Xuan Ke shook his head. “The other sects still have people in there. They still need to go through those spatial rifts if they want to return. Besides, I doubt that we have experts who are capable of sealing those spatial rifts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Even so, we need to inform all the sects right away,” Qin Yan said.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Right.” Xuan Ke said, nodding, and then turned to Nie Tian. “It’s time to part ways.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All the other chosen ones were eager to inform their elders of what had happened, and thus they also all quickly bid their farewells to Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At that moment, a strong wave of soul fluctuations came from the distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Everyone’s expressions flickered as they jerked their heads in that direction. Soon, a scrawny Qi warrior in ragged garments entered their sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Li Langfeng!” Pei Qiqi exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian also looked deeply surprised to see him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meanwhile, Li Langfeng also seemed surprised to see the group of chosen ones in this place. He went blank briefly before asking, “Where did you come from?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li pointed at the spatial rift behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Li Langfeng’s eyes lit up. Like a flash of lightning, he shifted to the spatial rift, where he started examining it so closely that it seemed that he wanted to go through it very much.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian hastily called out, “Don’t go in!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The voice sounded familiar to Li Liangfeng, so he stopped and turned around to fix Nie Tian with a confused gaze. “You sound very familiar.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“It’s Hua Tian,” Nie Tian said with a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Li Langfeng’s eyes widened as he exclaimed, “I can’t believe it’s you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“What’s the situation in the Realm of Split Void now?” Nie Tian asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Since he had helped Li Langfeng break through into the Worldly realm, and in return, Li Langfeng had helped him kill Ning Yang, he assumed that Li Langfeng would tell him about the current situation once he stated his identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“That spatial rift is now very turbulent and dangerous.” Pei Qiqi said coldly. “You’ll get yourself killed if you enter it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li chimed in, “Even if you somehow survive the spatial rift, you’ll get kill in that damned dimension. We almost died there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Li Langfeng grew hesitant, then eventually gave up on the idea. Then, he said, “Only two people came back before you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Who?” Nie Tian asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Li Langfeng looked at Pei Qiqi and said, “Your master came back, covered in wounds, and she brought a kid named Wu Ling back with her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon learning that Zhen Huilan was still alive and back in the Realm of Split Void, Pei Qiqi felt greatly relieved.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I can’t believe that Wu Ling also survived.” Surprised, Nie Tian suspected that he must have only managed to escape from those from the Spirit God Sect and Flame God Sect by relying on some remarkable spiritual tool.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon further thought, it occurred to him that Wu Ling was Wu Langxie’s only son. It wouldn’t be more natural for him, a Soul realm expert, to give his son some life-saving means.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“However, serious blood was spilled after the return of Master Zhen and Wu Ling,” Li Langfeng went on in a plain tone, as if none of this concerned him. “Master Zhen came back with news that Yao Shou from the Spirit God Sect and Gongsun Pu from the Flame God Sect had turned on her and those from the Tool Sect, which resulted in Bai Yu’s death, and Master Zhen being seriously injured.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“That is what happened,” Nie Tian said.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Wu Langxie was infuriated by the news, and marched to the Realm of Dark Underworld, where he massacred disciples of the Spirit God Sect and Flame God Sect, including five of their Profound realm experts. The Flame God, Xia Yi, is still in the middle of his secluded cultivation. Since none of the Flame God Sect elders were able to contend against Wu Langxie, they shrank behind their grand spell formation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“What happened to the Spirit God Sect?” Dong Li asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“The Spirit God Sect isn’t any better,” Li Langfeng said, laying his eyes on Pei Qiqi. “Someone named Hua Mu started another massacre in the Spirit God Sect because of your master’s injuries. He single-handedly killed more than half of the Spirit God Sect’s Profound realm experts, along with dozens of their Worldly realm disciples.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“The killing is still going on in the Realm of Dark Underworld as we speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“That Hua Mu person even destroyed the Spirit God Sect’s grand spell formation, leaving their disciples nowhere to hide.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Like Xia Yi, the sectmaster of the Spirit God Sect was also in the middle of secluded cultivation, but he was forced to come out and fight Hua Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Many forces throughout the Domain of the Falling Stars are paying close attention to the battle between Hua Mu and the Spirit God Sect. Some of them have even sent people there to collect information.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Pei Qiqi’s expression flickered slightly. “I can’t believe that Mr. Hua would spill so much blood for my master!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian was also shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In his eyes, Hua Mu was a mysterious person who liked to keep a low profile.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had never expected that he would unleash his wrath upon the Spirit God Sect and slaughter so many of their disciples because of Zhen Huilan.</span></p>
 <p><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“It seems like that Fruit of Life has indeed solved Uncle Hua’s lifespan problem and relieved him from his burdens.</span></em></p>
 <p><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“I didn’t know that Uncle Hua was actually such a fierce character!”</span></em></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The chosen ones were also taken aback upon learning that bloody conflicts were taking place in the Realm of Dark Underworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a brief pause, Li Langfeng added, “However, many don’t think the conflict between Hua Mu and the Spirit God Sect will end in Hua Mu’s victory. He seems to have sustained some injuries when he breached the Spirit God Sect’s grand spell formation. He and the sectmaster of the Spirit God Sect are both at the middle Soul realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Now that he’s injured, it’s more likely that he’ll lose the battle against the sectmaster of the Spirit God Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Besides, Xia Yi might come out of his secluded cultivation soon. It’s believed that he’ll be at the peak Soul realm once he comes out. If that’s true, then even if Wu Langxie and Hua Mu join hands, they probably won’t be able to beat him.”</span></p>
