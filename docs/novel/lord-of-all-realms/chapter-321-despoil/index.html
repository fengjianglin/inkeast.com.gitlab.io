<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span>Shi Hui, a few guest elders of the Blood Skull, as well as a handful of Qi warriors wearing garments with fire patterns on them, were standing in a solemn manner under the slithering spatial rifts, as if they were waiting for something.</span></p>
 <p><span>ZZZZZLA!</span></p>
 <p><span>All of a sudden, clusters of blazing flames shot out of one of the spatial rifts and plummeted towards the earth, unleashing scorching auras.</span></p>
 <p><span>One after another, they crashed into the earth, melting away the ice and creating huge holes in the frigid-cold ground.</span></p>
 <p><span>Meanwhile, Shi Hui, the guest elders of the Blood Skull, and the people from the Wild Fire moved about swiftly and cautiously to avoid the plummeting clusters of flames, as if the mere contact with the flames would mean their doom.</span></p>
 <p><span>When the flames died out and huge holes were left in the icy ground, they would surge forward like a swarm of hornets and search the holes for something.</span></p>
 <p><span>WHOOSH!</span></p>
 <p><span>Shi Hui jumped out of one of the icy holes with a crimson, crystal-like gem in his hand, which was still shining with bright light.</span></p>
 <p><span>Upon a closer look, fine red lines could be seen within the gem, which were like flickering red lightning bolts.</span></p>
 <p><span>Face full of smiles, Shi Hui held the crimson gem in his splayed hand. A fascinated look filled his wide eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>From the look of it, his cultivation attribute was none other than fire, and the crimson gem would be extremely helpful to the improvement of his cultivation base.</span></p>
 <p><span>At the same time, he had animated conversations with the few Wild Fire members around him.</span></p>
 <p><span>Via his Heaven Eyes, Nie Tian obtained a clear view of what was happening within that area. Then, he came to a stop, turned to Pei Qiqi, who was traveling side by side with him, and said, “Shi Hui, a few guest elders of the Blood Skull, and a handful of Wild Fire members are collecting some kind of fire-attributed gems. Aren’t guest elders of the Blood Skull forbidden to have any contact or dealings with people from the Wild Fire or Dark Moon?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Pei Qiqi was taken aback. “You can see each and every move they make?!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What is this secret magic you practice anyways?” Instead of answering his question, Pei Qiqi showed great concern with his mystical magic. “From what I know, only when a cultivator reaches the Worldly realm and transforms their psychic power into soul power will they be able to capture every slightest move in his vicinity.</span></p>
 <p><span>“However, you’re only at the Heaven stage!”</span></p>
 <p><span>A wry smile appeared on Nie Tian’s face as he said, “All you need to know is that I know some extraordinary magics and techniques.”</span></p>
 <p><span>At that moment, Nie Tian suddenly felt another pulse from the Flame Dragon Armor, which felt so urgent that it seemed as if it was itching to charge out of his bracelet of holding immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian’s eyebrows knitted.</span></p>
 <p><span>Shi Hui was at the late Greater Heaven stage. Most of the few guest elders by his side were also at the Greater Heaven stage.</span></p>
 <p><span>Shi Hui and his men alone were formidable enough that he and Pei Qiqi wouldn’t stand a chance fighting them, much less when they were in the Wild Fire’s territory and numerous powerful Wild Fire experts could be roaming nearby.</span></p>
 <p><span>He attempted to get his worries through to the Flame Dragon Armor and tell it that it was a bad time.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, the Flame Dragon Armor seemed to ignore Nie Tian’s worries, and whizzed out of his bracelet of holding in spite of them.</span></p>
 <p><span>SHEW!</span></p>
 <p><span>The Flame Dragon Armor shot out, as if it had turned into a streak of splendid flames, and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p><span>BANG!</span></p>
 <p><span>“W-what was that?” Pei Qiqi didn’t catch a clear view of the Flame Dragon Armor. She just felt a incomparably fierce surge of blazing energy bursting forth from Nie Tian’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span>When she wanted to get a clear view of it, the Flame Dragon Armor had already vanished into the distance, leaving behind a long flaming tail.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian’s expression changed dramatically as he hastily turned to Pei Qiqi and blurted, “It’s time for us to part ways. Don’t you worry about my safety. I know many secret magics that I can use to avoid Shi Hui and the Wild Fire members. I’ve memorized the general direction you showed me. I’ll be able to find my way to my destination.”</span></p>
 <p><span>With these words, he cast a short-range Starshift and appeared in a location 300 meters away, before Pei Qiqi had the chance to ask any questions.</span></p>
 <p><span>With a flabbergasted expression on her face, Pei Qiqi watched him practically teleport to a distant location. Just as she was about to call Nie Tian, she saw Nie Tian’s figure shift again and disappear from her view.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Did he use this method to repeatedly escape from the Hunters’ blockades?”</span></p>
 <p><span>The truth suddenly dawned on Pei Qiqi. After witnessing some of Nie Tian’s mystical skills, Pei Qiqi finally realized that even though his cultivation base was low, if there were no mishaps, he would be able to survive the sorts of danger that existed in the Void Illusion Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Bastard!” Staring into the distance, she whispered a curse before turning around and going back the way they had come to get here.</span></p>
 <p><span>SHEW!</span></p>
 <p><span>After another short-rang Starshift, Nie Tian appeared in a location close to Shi Hui and his gang, putting a significant distance between Pei Qiqi and himself.</span></p>
 <p><span>After making sure Pei Qiqi didn’t follow him into trouble, he spied on them via his Heaven Eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Flame Dragon Armor flew to the area where Shi Hui and his gang were, like a streak of glorious fire.</span></p>
 <p><span>WHOOSH!</span></p>
 <p><span>The crimson crystal-like gem in Shi Hui’s splayed hand was suddenly attracted by an irresistible force and flew out of his palm.</span></p>
 <p><span>At that very moment, the Flame Dragon Armor whizzed through in the air above him and pulled the crimson, crystal-like gem away.</span></p>
 <p><span>The gem flew towards the Flame Dragon Armor like a piece of steel drawn to a giant magnet.</span></p>
 <p><span>Shi Hui, the guest elders of the Blood Skull, as well as the Wild Fire members were all flabbergasted at the scene. “What was that!?”</span></p>
 <p><span>In the next moment, Shi Hui snapped out of his daze and roared at the whizzing cluster of flames, “My Heaven Flame Crystal!” </span></p>
 <p><span>Wreathed in an enormous cluster of flames, the Flame Dragon Armor sailed through the air above them like a burning meteor. None of them were able to get a clear view of it.</span></p>
 <p><span>Just like that, the Flame Dragon Armor continued to whizz across in the air like a blazing bolt of lightning, intercepting and capturing the balls of flames that shot out of the spatial rifts.</span></p>
 <p><span>Three more gems, which Shi Hui referred to as Heaven Flame Crystals, were peeled away from the balls of flames, drawn and adhering to the surface of the Flame Dragon Armor before they could plummet to the earth.</span></p>
 <p><span>Looking at the whizzing cluster of flames, one of the Wild Fire Qi warriors shouted loudly with reddened eyes, “Spirit Channeling grade treasure! It must be a fire-attributed, Spirit Channeling grade treasure! A Spirit Channeling grade treasure has appeared in the Void Illusion Mountain Range!</span></p>
 <p><span>“This fire-attributed Spirit Channeling grade treasure has its own soul, and this is why it can take the initiative and snatch Heaven Flame Crystals from us!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Upon hearing these words, Shi Hui trembled involuntarily, greed filling his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>The eyes of a few others who also practiced fire-attributed incantations shone with the light of greed upon hearing that man’s statement. “Let’s go get that Spirit Channeling grade treasure!”</span></p>
 <p><span>In the next moment, each and every cultivator who practiced fire-attributed incantations cast their exquisite spells respectively as they attempted to attract the Flame Dragon Armor down from the heavens and take it for themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span>HUFF! HUFF! HUFF!</span></p>
 <p><span>One after another, numerous fireballs laced with their psychic awareness shot into the air, along with their various fire-attributed spiritual tools, and chased after the Flame Dragon Armor.</span></p>
 <p><span>Even so, the Flame Dragon Armor whizzed across the sky above them with lightning speed, and absorbed two more Heaven Flame Crystals.</span></p>
 <p><span>It wasn’t long before the spatial rift stopped spewing clusters of flames.</span></p>
 <p><span>After plundering all of the Heaven Flame Crystals, the Flame Dragon Armor seemed to have achieved its goal. After taking a brief moment to sense Nie Tian’s aura, it found its bearings and flew away.</span></p>
 <p><span>With greedy eyes, those people madly chased after the Flame Dragon Armor. </span></p>
 <p><span>“Go after it!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“It’s a Spirit Channeling grade treasure unearthed in the Void Illusion Mountain Range! Whoever gets it will obtain a fortune as large as the heavens!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“It must be unclaimed. Otherwise, the master of such a high-level treasure would have every right to show himself!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The way they saw it, whoever had the power to obtain and harness a Spirit Channeling grade treasure must be at the Profound realm or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span>Such a powerful figure would have every right to show himself and openly take those Heaven Flame Crystals for himself.</span></p>
 <p><span>The fact that such a master had not appeared so far meant that this Spirit Channeling grade treasure was very likely still unclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span>Since they all practiced fire-attributed incantations, it would be fairly easily for them to tame an unclaimed Spirit Channeling treasure and merge it with themselves, enhancing their battle prowess severalfold.</span></p>
 <p><span>SHEW!</span></p>
 <p><span>The Flame Dragon Armor whizzed to Nie Tian’s side and flew back into his bracelet of holding.</span></p>
 <p><span>At that moment, Nie Tian could hear constant roars and shouts coming from the direction the Flame Dragon Armor had returned from.</span></p>
 <p><span>“You’re such a trouble-magnet!” Nie Tian muttered.</span></p>
 <p><span>In a poised manner, he rapidly summoned his star power and cast a long-range Starshift.</span></p>
 <p><span>PUFF!</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian coughed up a mouthful of blood. With his head spinning, he watched everything around him shoot behind him with lightning speed.</span></p>
 <p><span>In the next moment, he disappeared from his original location like he had vaporized, albeit hurting all over.</span></p>
 <p><span>BANG!!!</span></p>
 <p><span>Immediately afterward, he appeared and fell to the ground by a valley creek, feeling very pained and light-headed.</span></p>
 <p><span>After a brief examination of his injuries, Nie Tian rapidly braced himself again. By the time his seven Heaven Eyes returned to his side, he once again sped away at his fastest possible speed.</span></p>
