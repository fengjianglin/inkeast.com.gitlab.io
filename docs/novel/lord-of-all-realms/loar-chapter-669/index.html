<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the space disruption zone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Three Qi warriors from the Bliss Mountain Sect were floating by the cluster of black light, frowning deeply.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A middle-aged woman withdrew her soul awareness and said, “Holy Daughter, the entrance to Master Voidspirit’s secret realm is closed. If there have been no mishaps, our people have entered the Voidspirit Pagoda.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Mu Biqiong nodded slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She was the Holy Daughter of the Bliss Mountain Sect. It was almost certain that she would become the Bliss Mountain Sect’s future leader. Even though she was still rather young, she had already entered the Worldly realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a graceful posture, Mu Biqiong was wearing a silk veil, which masked her deep, clear eyes that looked like frosty lake water.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The two Bliss Mountain Sect Qi warriors beside her were a couple. The woman’s name was Yao Zhilan, and the man’s name was Tian Ziping, both at the Soul realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though the couple’s cultivation bases were much higher than hers, they didn’t have a senior’s pride when they talked to her. Instead, they both seemed rather modest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This was because the two of them knew perfectly clearly that she was bound to become the sectmaster of the Bliss Mountain Sect one day, if she didn’t die prematurely.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Bliss Mountain Sect had poured all kinds of spiritual materials, incantations, and other resources into her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Thanks to her shockingly exceptional talent, she had entered the Worldly realm at the age of twenty.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She didn’t let the Bliss Mountain Sect down.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“The people from the Trisword Sect haven’t returned to the Domain of Heaven’s Boundaries either,” Tian Ziping said. “Can it be that they’re also in there now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yao Zhilan let out a disdainful smile. “The Trisword Sect? Qi Jiuchuan from the Trisword Sect did build himself a powerful puppet named Liang Hao. I heard that he replaced his bones and meridians with those from a Mountainsplit Beast. Even so, he only has one Liang Hao, but we’ve sent nearly a hundred juniors in there. How can one person contend against a hundred?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Tian Ziping seemed rather henpecked, as he agreed without any hesitation. “Good point. Everything seems to be going according to our plan. All we need to do is wait for Han Chigui to come out and escort Master Voidspirit’s legacies back to our domain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Your status in the sect will further improve after getting Master Voidspirit’s legacies, Holy Daughter,” Dong Li said, smiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I hope everything goes well,” Mu Biqiong said. Her voice was very pleasing to the ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Rest assured, Holy Daughter,” Tian Ziping said. “I’m sure they will.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">…</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Since Zhao Shanling had taken the Voidspirit Pagoda, terrifying rumbles were still coming from the depths of the black land.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With the Voidspirit Pagoda floating over his head, Zhao Shanling was madly channeling spatial power from the vicinity into himself, his aura rapidly building up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Every once in a while, he would stuff a medicinal pill into his mouth. Gradually, vigor returned to his eyes, as if the medicinal pills were helping him restore his soul power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian’s expression flickered as he watched the black land slowly split open, creating rifts everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It seemed as if it wouldn’t be long before this black continent crumbled and vanished.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, other than his star power, all of his other powers had returned to their peak state.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With the restrictive spell lifted, his psychic awareness could finally leave his body to scan his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Standing in place, he attempted to form Heaven Eyes, and succeeded. With nine Heaven Eyes, he gazed down at the earth and saw that the black continent was rumbling and cracking as far as he could see.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This special realm created by Master Voidspirit seemed to be on the verge of destruction now that Zhao Shanling had obtained the Voidspirit Pagoda.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">RUUUUMBLE!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As loud rumbles continued to echo from the depths of the earth, the aura of various attributes that rose from the earth was also gradually dissipating.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After some time, Zhao Shanling let out a deep breath and said, “Ready to go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I’ve long since been ready,” Nie Tian answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Alright then, let’s get out of here.” Not only had Zhao Shanling fully recovered his strength, but his battle prowess had also improved significantly due to his newly-acquired knowledge of spatial power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Not to mention that he had obtained a Spirit Channeling grade spatial spiritual tool: the Voidspirit Pagoda.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It was said that the reason why the Void Palace Sect had been able to dominate the Domain of the Falling Stars for many years was because they had possessed a Spirit Channeling grade spatial spiritual tool.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Furthermore, Zhao Shanling had said that once he obtained the Voidspirit Pagoda, even though he was still at the middle Soul realm, he would be able to defeat Xia Yi in battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With the Voidspirit Pagoda in his hands, as long as the patriarch of the Heaven Palace Sect hadn’t entered the Void domain, he would be invincible in the Domain of the Falling Stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Let’s go!” With these words, Zhao Shanling made a grabbing motion in the air, and Nie Tian was instantly pulled into his personal void realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the next moment, his void realm started floating towards the cluster of black light at an incredible speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The fact that Zhao Shanling was able to use his void realm again made Nie Tian realize that Zhao Shanling had recovered his peak battle prowess.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">SHEW! SHEW! SHEW!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In a couple of minutes, Zhao Shanling’s void realm carried the two of them across a very long distance and arrived by the cluster of black light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“This cluster of black light was sealed one-way since the moment I entered the Voidspirit Pagoda. No entries are allowed, only exits.” Zhao Shanling’s face then split into a grin. “I received the acknowledgment of the Voidspirit Pagoda’s soul as soon as I pushed its gate open. Like Master Voidspirit, I also practice spatial magics, so I was able to win the favor of the Voidspirit Pagoda’s soul.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these proud words, his void realm merged with the cluster of black light and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian’s head instantly started spinning, as if everything around him was being distorted. However, such strange feeling only lasted for a moment before everything returned to normal again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That was when he found himself floating in the space disruption zone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BOOM!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as the two of them flashed out of the cluster of black light, it shrank to the size of a grain of sand and rapidly sank downwards in the bottomless void.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Tian Ziping’s expression flickered drastically as he exclaimed, staring at Nie Tian and Zhao Shanling, “You’re not from our sect! Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Only at this moment did Nie Tian notice that three people were floating before him and Zhao Shanling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Their garments were identical to Han Chigui’s. Clearly, they were also from the Bliss Mountain Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhao Shanling let out a wild laugh. “The Bliss Mountain Sect… I didn’t expect that you’d not only send people in there, but also have people guarding the entrance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yao Zhilan’s face turned ice-cold as she said, “Have you taken Master Voidspirit’s legacies?! You two look very unfamiliar. Which sect are you from?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhao Shanling seemed somewhat impatient as he said, “Let’s cut the small talk. Both Han Chigui from your sect and Qi Jiuchuan from the Trisword Sect died at our hands, and I’ve already obtained Master Voidspirit’s legacies. If you want to take them away or avenge Han Chigui, why don’t you get on with it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Mu Biqiong was taken aback. “You killed everyone in there?!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Are you blind, little girl?” Zhao Shanling said with a taunting smile. “Since we’re the only ones that have come out alive, it goes without saying that all of the others are dead. Hey, Nie Tian, this girl is quite a beauty. I say her looks are just as good as Dong Li’s, and her cultivation talent must be very outstanding as well. At such a young age, she’s already at the early Worldly realm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhao Shanling completely ignored the icy look in Mu Biqiong’s eyes. He went on and said to Nie Tian, “She only seems to be in her early twenties, and she’s already entered the Worldly realm. She has a great future before her. &nbsp;If you’re interested, I can capture for you. She’ll make a good concubine. What do you say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Entering the early Worldly realm at her early twenties, such speed could never be seen throughout the Domain of the Falling Stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this point, Nie Tian himself was in his late twenties.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Most of the chosen ones in the Domain of the Falling Stars who had entered the late Greater Heaven stage were about his age, or even older than he was.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“You seem to be in a good mood, Senior Zhao,” Nie Tian said with a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhao Shanling had almost never joked with him before.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Now that he had obtained the Voidspirit Pagoda, not only was he overjoyed, but he even joked with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In his senses, the middle-aged woman’s aura was equally as profound as Xia Yi’s, if not more profound, which meant she was also a late Soul realm expert.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The middle-aged man beside her seemed slightly weaker. He was probably at the middle Soul realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Judging by their combined strength, they should be able to overtake Zhao Shanling with ease. However, Zhao Shanling didn’t seem afraid in the slightest. Instead, he behaved extremely arrogantly. It appeared the Voidspirit Pagoda had given him confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yao Zhilan burst into a flaming rage. “How dare you insult our Holy Daughter. You must have a death wish!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a flick of her sleeve, numerous drops of black water flew towards Zhao Shanling’s void realm with crushing momentum.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Each and every drop of black water seemed as heavy as a mountain. Nie Tian’s expression flickered as soon as they made contact with Zhao Shanling’s void realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He examined them with rapt attention and discovered that the multiple lays of spatial wards that formed Zhao Shanling’s void realm were shattering one after another as the drops of black water inched towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhao Shanling let out a cold harrumph and said with curled lips, “Blacklake Heavy Water... Each and every drop takes great effort to refine. If I hadn’t obtained the Voidspirit Pagoda, I might have had to tuck tail and escape, but now... let’s see who’s going to run.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">WHOOSH!</span></p>
