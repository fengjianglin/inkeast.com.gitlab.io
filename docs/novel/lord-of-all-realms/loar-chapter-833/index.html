<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The so-called Fortune Wells were a bunch of wells that were scattered in solid parts of the marshland.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They were all of different sizes, and were separated from each other by different distances.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Each and every one of them stood on a small piece of solid ground, so people wouldn’t need to worry about sinking in the marshland.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">By the time Nie Tian and the others arrived, six of the forty-nine Fortune Wells had already been claimed by six different people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Those six wells were all more than three meters wide, and the largest one seemed so deep that it looked like an unfathomable hole that led all the way to the earth’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Sitting by that well was an old man with gray hair. He was at the late Profound realm, and from the look of it, he had lived for a rather long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Chai Longge stopped his air-transportation spiritual tool in a place that was still a considerable distance from the old man.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With his unique bloodline power, Nie Tian examined the old man from afar, and shrewdly discovered that, similar to Wu Ji, he was having a problem with his lifespan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though the old man had lived for very long, his cultivation base had only reached the late Profound realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If he couldn’t break through into the Soul realm and gain more years, his path of cultivation would soon come to an end, along with his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The old man’s eyes were closed, and his flesh aura was very weak, yet the spiritual power fluctuations he emanated were exceptionally strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“A senior from my sect estimated that the Fortune Wells will spew all kinds of energies of heaven and earth this time. So the two of us came, hoping to improve our cultivation bases with the help of the wells.” With these words, Chai Longge lowered his voice. “It seems we’re early. Only six people beat us here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian gaze then swept over the other five Qi warriors, and discovered that they were all at the Profound realm too.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Some of them were rather old, while others were still quite a long way from reaching the end of their lifespans, judging from their flesh auras.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The six of them had occupied six of the largest Fortune Wells.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Three of them looked up and shot them a glance from afar, and then resumed their cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Mu Biqiong pondered for a while before saying in a soft voice, “If it’s uncertain what powers the wells will spew, and the people who come here practice different powers, what if the well they’ve occupied spews the kinds of power they don’t need?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Chai Longge smiled bitterly. “That depends.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian fixed him with a curious gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“They may swap wells with others. If they can find people with wells that provide the kinds of power they need, and reach a mutual understanding with them, then they can swap wells.” Chai Longge’s voice grew even lower as he pointed at the old man. “For example, he practices lightning power. The man beside him practices water power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“If each of their Fortune Wells happen to spew the kind of power the other person needs, then they can switch, since there are no conflicts of interest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Mu Biqiong then asked, “But what if that old man’s well spews flames while the well beside him spews lightning?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Chai Longge let out a low sigh. “Then, the stronger person will call the shot.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After hearing these words, Nie Tian realized that it wasn’t first come first served with these Fortune Wells. People couldn’t always keep the well they had occupied.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If the Martial Spirit Sect had learned that the Fortune Wells were going to become active soon, sects from other domains, outsiders, and even Ancientbeasts could have learned about it too.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It was very likely that fierce battles would break out when the Fortune Wells actually become active.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Many mishaps might occur, making it difficult to actually gain fortunes from these forty-nine Fortune Wells.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Chai Longge remained silent for a while before saying, “We’re rather early, since there are still quite a number of unclaimed wells. Go on. You pick first. But you’ll have to depend on yourselves to keep them from others who also want them. I suggest that you give them up if you find your enemy too strong for you. Otherwise...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian didn’t need him to finish his sentence to know how deadly those fights were going to be.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Fortunately, the three of them all had powerful backing or resources, and thus weren’t very worried.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yin Yanan let out a snort as she took the initiative to jump off the air-transportation spiritual tool.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She landed and sat down by a fairly large Fortune Well, demonstrating her claim over it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Afterwards, Mu Biqiong landed beside another relatively large Fortune Well, claiming it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian randomly chose a Fortune Well and also sat down.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Chai Longge and his sister also chose two Fortune Wells, which weren’t far from Nie Tian and the girls’.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After landing, Chai Longge said to Nie Tian and the girls, “The two of us practice metal power and water power. Let’s swap if your wells happen to spew the powers we need, and we’ll do the same for you. What do you say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian and the girls nodded in assent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian had long since realized that the incantations Mu Biqiong practiced were closely related to wood power, which might have a great deal to do with the demonic plant growing inside of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yin Yanan, on the other hand, practiced frost power, because her Frost Blood Python’s Frost Python bloodline allowed it to command ice and frost.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At the same time, the special body refining incantations she practiced agreed with the Frost Blood Python’s Blood Stripe Python bloodline, allowing her to absorb and refine spirit beast blood into herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Among the three of them, Nie Tian practiced the most powers, as he practiced flame power, wood power, and star power at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Chai Longge might be able to sense flame power and wood power from him, but he might not be able to tell that he also practiced star power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The fact that Chai Longge had invited the three of them to seek fortune from these Fortune Wells together was because he had realized that the three of them weren’t powerful enough to threaten them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Also, since none of them practiced metal power or water power, once the Fortune Wells became active, his and his sister’s chances at getting wells they needed would improve significantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Of course, this was based on one precondition: they would have to be able to hold on to their Fortune Wells.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Fortune Wells they had chosen were quite far from the early-arrivers’.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian stepped to the mouth of the Fortune Well he had chosen and gazed down. He discovered that it was dark and unfathomable, as if it led to the heart of the earth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He then sent a wisp of soul awareness into it, but failed to sense anything noteworthy even till his soul awareness reached the limit of his detection range.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After withdrawing his soul awareness, he shot a sideways glance at Mu Biqiong and Yin Yanan, and discovered that the two fierce women were also observing their Fortune Wells, but just like him, they didn’t seem to have found anything either.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Afterwards, Nie Tian settled down and sat down beside his well, where he took out spiritual materials and began practicing cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Soon, days passed, and newcomers arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Among them were human cultivators, Demons, Fiends, and even an Ancientbeast.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That Ancientbeast was a sixth grade Earth Flame Beast, whose strength was equal to that of a Profound realm human expert.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Many years ago, Nie Tian had witnessed an Earth Flame Beast charging out of the depths of the earth in the Scarlet Flame Mountain Range, and that sixth grade Earth Flame Beast had greatly shaken his young heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, after so many years, that kind of power could no longer cause any waves in Nie Tian’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After arriving, the huge Earth Flame Beast descended by one of the Fortune Wells and stayed there, its three flaming tails slithering like fiery snakes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">None of the humans and outsiders present paid any special attention to it, as if they didn’t find its arrival surprising at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Pergson, Froste, and Gutas weren’t among those who arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A few more days passed, and a young man arrived, riding a sixth grade Thunder Beast. He was dressed in eye-catching, colorful garments, and behaved in an unrestrained manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Five thunderballs could be seen on the young man’s chest. They seemed to have been embroidered on his robe, yet they rotated unceasingly, which was rather curious.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With an unruly look on his face, he glanced around, sitting astride his Thunder Beast, and soon noticed the late Profound realm old man, who was guarding the largest Fortune Well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He patted the Thunder Beast, and it flew over to the old man. Floating in the air, he said with a commanding tone, “Time to vacate this Fortune Well, old man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His cultivation base was only at the middle Profound realm, which was lower than the old man’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The old man opened his eyes. His expression flickered as he saw the five rotating thunderballs on the young man’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A shred of anger flashed across the old man’s eyes, but he rose to his feet and went to sit by a fairly distant Fortune Well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, he didn’t say a word the entire time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The young man grinned as he landed his sixth grade Thunder Beast by the largest Fortune Well. Then, gazing disdainfully at the old man, he said, “Now that’s the smart thing to do. If three or more of these Fortune Wells spew lightning, then I’ll grant you one.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Otherwise, the fortunes here won’t have anything to do with you this time. After all, I’ll need one, and my Thunder Beast will need one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The face of the old man, who was eager to extend his lifespan with the help of that fortune Well, grew gloomy after he heard these words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Eyebrows furrowed, Chai Longge fixed the young man with a measuring gaze as he explained his origin to Nie Tian, “He’s Mo Qinglei, the future sectmaster of the Heavenly Thunder Sect in the Domain of Endless Thunder.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“If the Fortune Wells you’ve claimed happen to spew lightning, you’d better back away voluntarily in order not to offend that guy. The current sectmaster of the Heavenly Thunder Sect is at the late Saint domain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Don’t you think his cultivation base is unimpressive. He actually has the Heavenly Thunder Sect’s powerful magical treasure at his disposal. The fact that he dares to behave so unscrupulously is because he can display battle prowess that far exceeds a normal Profound realm expert’s.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yin Yanan snorted a disdainful laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Mu Biqiong’s expression remained as calm as ever.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a sarcastic chuckle, Nie Tian said, “Thanks for the reminder.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Chai Longge had a confused look in his eyes as he saw Nie Tian and the girls’ attitude.</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, the Domain of Heaven’s Boundaries was only an elementary-grade domain, so he naturally didn’t reckon the three of them could actually contend against Mo Qinglei from the Heavenly Thunder Sect.</span></p>

 <p><strong>Four Basic Methods to Use A Talisman</strong></p>
 <p>A talisman is a physical object, it contains non-physical energy inside, just like how air is contained inside a balloon. When air is filled up inside, it will let the balloon gives off light. When air is released out of it, the air then get absorbed by the things around it. &nbsp;Try to imagine the talisman just like a balloon, and you will know how to make the best use of it.</p>
 <p>Tape – Tape the talisman at home, or near anywhere that needs the light to radiates and shine to influence the surrounding, or to protect the area.</p>
 <p>Carry – Same effect as above, but this one is next to you, and it help you no matter where you go!</p>
 <p>Burn – This will release the energy inside, and so if you burn it at the main entrance of your house, the house will absorb the power. Just like how you absorb medicine, then you get the effect kick in.</p>
 <p>Drink – Energy is released into a bowl, and then contained into water, which then you can drink to let it go into your system and there goes the effect inside you.</p>
