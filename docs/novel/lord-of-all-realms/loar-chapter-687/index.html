 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Many Soul realm experts that were close to Nie Tian found a secret room in Desolate City, where they gathered around him and asked about his talk with Yue Yanxi.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After they learned from Nie Tian that the Divine Flame Sect would keep the teleportation portals that connected their sect to the Domain of the Falling Stars, it occurred to many of them that they could take advantage of such a tie to start trading spiritual materials with the Divine Flame Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Domain of the Falling Stars was only a remote corner of the boundless starry river, where limited sorts of spiritual materials were produced. However, Qi warriors would need a variety of spiritual materials to achieve advancement in their cultivation, forge spiritual tools, and refine medicinal pills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They all hoped to trade their spiritual materials with the Divine Flame Sect for precious materials that were hard to find in the Domain of the Falling Stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It would require a large amount of rare spiritual materials for them to make a breakthrough into the Void domain. It was almost impossible for them to gather all the required materials within the Domain of the Falling Stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The patriarch of the Heaven Palace Sect had only dared to make this attempt to break through into the Void domain after his secret deal with the outsiders.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian was well-aware that the Heaven Palace Sect had made a secret deal with the Demons when the three spatial rifts had opened. Thanks to that deal, the patriarch of the Heaven Palace Sect had obtained the necessary rare materials to make a breakthrough into the Void domain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Hua Mu, Zong Zheng, Dong Wangling, and many other experts were at the middle Soul realm. Once they entered the late Soul realm, they would face the same problem of finding a large amount of rare materials necessary to facilitate their breakthroughs into the Void domain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This step was of paramount importance to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Over the past millennia, quite a few Qi warriors in the Domain of the Falling Stars had entered the late Soul realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, because the Domain of the Falling Stars lacked cultivation materials, many had spent hundreds of years searching for the necessary materials for their breakthroughs into the Void domain, before eventually running out of their lifespan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Back when they had won the battle of the Realm of a Hundred Battles, as Nie Tian had expressed that he would have the ability to take people out of the Domain of the Falling Stars, Zong Zheng and the other experts had given all of the seventh grade outsider corpses to him without the slightest hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">What they had desired the most was to leave the Domain of the Falling Stars for more advanced domains, where they could find rare spiritual materials.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though they had felt insecure and fearful after the Lei Clan had descended and showed off their strength, they had actually had some expectations.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They had thought if they remained obedient to the Lei Clan and the Divine Flame Sect, they might be able to get the materials they needed to break through into the Void domain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“To enter the Void domain, cultivators have to build their own domains. To do that, they’ll have to use all sorts of precious materials that agree with their cultivation attribute...” After Hua Mu, Zong Zheng, and the others finished explaining, Nie Tian fell silent, gradually starting to understand their concerns.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Only after a long time did he finally open his mouth. “Seniors, it’s still not an option to establish frequent communications between the Domain of the Falling Stars and the Divine Flame Sect. The Divine Flame Sect has informed me that if the Domain of the Falling Stars is exposed, it’d be very problematic for us. The reason why the Divine Flame Sect ordered the people from the Lei Clan to stay here is partially because they’re worried that they would leak information about the Domain of the Falling Stars if they returned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“The grand elder told me that he can only arrange for me to visit the Divine Flame Sect for the time being.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“How about this: after you enter the late Soul realm, I’ll talk to the Divine Flame Sect about trading for the spiritual materials you’ll need to enter the Void domain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Hua Mu nodded slowly. “The Divine Flame Sect made such arrangements for a good reason. We’re being too eager.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zong Zheng also calmed himself and said, “Yeah, there’ll still be some time before we enter the late Soul realm, not to mention the Void domain. Alright, we can put the matter of visiting the Domain of Heaven’s Boundaries aside for now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">While they talked, Qian Qiong from the Ice Pavilion Sect said in a low voice right outside the room, “Nie Tian, Zhao Luofeng has come to see you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Zhao Luofeng?” Nie Tian was taken aback. “Why is he here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Wangling curled his lips and said with a sarcastic tone, “It seems that he’s seen the trend. Times have changed, and now he wants to make friends with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Would you tell him that I’m busy and can’t see him now?” Nie Tian asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Sure,” Qian Qiong replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Afterwards, they resumed talking. Many experts suggested that Nie Tian should advance to the Worldly realm as soon as possible before their meeting finally came to an end.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the following days, Nie Tian stayed in Desolate City and caught up with his grandfather, his aunt, Wu Ji, and Dong Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">During this time, he got word to Lei Tianqi, the clanmaster of the Lei Clan, through Lei Zhenyu that he wanted the Lei Clan to return the Realm of Unbounded Desolation to the Tool Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Lei Clan agreed without asking any questions and instantly started to make preparations to move.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Lei Clan had taken the Realm of Unbounded Desolation not because of their own needs, but because they had thought it would be an ideal place for the Divine Flame Sect to set up a branch.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, since Yue Yanxi had expressed that the Divine Flame Sect had no intentions of controlling any part of the Domain of the Falling Stars, Lei Tianqi had known what to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The majority of the Lei Clan members practiced thunder power. The mountain range in the Realm of Earth Sieve, where the Thunder Mountain Sect sat, would be the ideal location for them to set up a base.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Also, since Yue Yanxi had ordered them to take orders from Nie Tian, Lei Tianqi agreed and started to arrange their move without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A few days passed...</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The inter-realm teleportation portal at the center of Desolate City was fully functional again, free of any restrictions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At the same time, Nie Tian received word from the Lei Clan that they, together with the Thunder Mountain Sect and the Heaven Expanse Sect, had cleansed the Spirit God Sect, the Poison Sect, and the Flame God Sect’s headquarters. With almost all of their powerful members killed or captured, the Spirit God Sect and the Poison Sect had basically been wiped out from the Domain of the Falling Stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Only the disciples of the Flame God Sect had holed up in some arcane realm, and thus escaped doom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This was because, after Xia Yi had stolen the Heaven Flame Beast’s eye, he had feared that the other sects would seek revenge, so he had sent most of his sect members into an arcane realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Later, after the Lei Clan had descended upon the Domain of the Falling Stars, Xia Yi had been uncertain about their attitude, and thus had ordered most of his sect members to remain in that arcane realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though the majority of the Flame God Sect disciples had survived the Lei Clan’s cleansing operation, the Lei Clan hadn’t given up on searching for the arcane realm where they were hiding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“The Flame God Sect...” Soon after receiving the news, Nie Tian’s expression flickered as an idea occurred to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Flame Dragon Armor had shown an extremely strong desire for earthflame essence, which contained a copious amount of flame power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Not only would the accumulation of flame power allow the Flame Dragon Armor to fully display its might, but it would also have a fantastic effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Enough flame power would allow the Flame Dragon Armor to send him into the mysterious land where titans were half-buried.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The rage punch, chaotic magnetic field, and spiritual energy ball techniques, which he had picked up there, had all turned out to be mighty and useful on many occasions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">During these years, whenever he had time to himself, he would try to revisit that mysterious land to learn more secret magics from those titan’s sky-reaching arms, yet he had never succeeded due to a lack of flame power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After all, every time he used the Flame Dragon Armor, it would require a very large amount of flame power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It would be next to nothing if he were to replenish its flame power with regular fire-attributed materials. Only earthflame essence or earthflame crystal strings would achieve some noticeable results.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Originally, the Realm of Unbounded Desolation had been an ideal place for the Flame Dragon Armor to absorb flame power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, after Xia Yi and Zhao Shanling’s previous joint operation, they had drained almost every active volcano of their earthflame essence. Thanks to this, Xia Yi had advanced to the late Soul realm shortly afterwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Now, the only volcano that still contained a copious amount of earthflame essence was the one where the Tool Sect’s headquarters were located.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Tool Sect’s livelihood depended on that earthflame essence. Once they lost it, they wouldn’t be able to forge equipment anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Other than the Realm of Unbounded Desolation, the Flame God Sect was the only other place where the Flame Dragon Armor could replenish its flame power throughout the entire Domain of the Falling Stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If it were before, Nie Tian would never have the audacity to go to the Flame God Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If he had, Xia Yi would have been overjoyed, as he would have been able to kill him and take the Flame Dragon Armor without much effort.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, times had changed. Xia Yi had died, and Nie Tian could be considered the monarch of the entire Domain of the Falling Stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After he expressed his intention of going to the Flame God Sect to absorb earthflame essence, the Lei Clan didn’t even ask a question before offering to have Lei Tianhong go with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, Nie Tian was worried that Lei Tianhong would discover the Flame Dragon Armor’s secrets, and thus declined their offer. Instead, he asked Zhen Huilan, who also practiced fire-attributed incantations, to go with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhen Huilan gladly agreed, and then teleported directly to the Realm of Dark Underworld with Nie Tian, Pei Qiqi, and Li Ye through the inter-realm teleportation portal in Desolate City.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As they flew to the Flame God Sect’s headquarters on Zhen Huilan’s Lightning Shuttle, Nie Tian glanced down from the air and saw Qi warriors from the Thunder Mountain Sect and the Heaven Expanse Sect evacuating from the Flame God Sect’s headquarters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Clearly, they had only received the order to leave recently.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Lei Ze, who was Lei Zhenyu’s grandson and Yu Wei’s fiancee, was among them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He didn’t even dare to meet Nie Tian’s eyes as he shrank into a lightning-wreathed air-transportation spiritual tool and urged his friends to drive away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian saw him from afar, but didn’t try to stop him from leaving.</span></p>
