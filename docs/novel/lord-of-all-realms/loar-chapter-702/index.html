 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li’s pleasant scent filled Nie Tian’s nose.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Before Nie Tian realized what was happening, the tip of Dong Li’s tongue had already found its way into his mouth, like a slippery spirit snake.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian then knew what to do. However, just as he held Dong Li tightly in his arms and kissed her vigorously, Dong Li put her hands on Nie Tian’s chest and separated herself from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li hammered her fist on Nie Tian’s chest and gave him a flirtatious look. “You’re so bad!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian’s hand still couldn’t stop sliding over her back and bottom. He gave her a taunting smile, and said, “What’s with the sudden passion?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The stone rooms in this palace seemed to be soundproof. No one would be able to hear anything they said once the door was shut.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even so, the Soul realm experts, as well as juniors like Dong Baijie, Qin Yan, and Xuan Ke, were just outside, examining the great hall for anything noteworthy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The fact that Dong Li had pulled him into one of the stone rooms and thrown herself at him gave him a strong stimulation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He almost lost himself in Dong Li’s sweet kisses and the warmth of her body. There was no way that he could stop voluntarily.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It was Dong Li who put a stop to it and put sense back in his head. She pointed outside and said in a low voice, “There are people outside.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a flirtatious grin, Nie Tian said, “What are you so afraid of? They won’t be able to see or hear anything.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“They’ll know if we spend too long in here.” Dong Li eyed him somewhat angrily. “The patriarch of my clan and my older brother are both out there. I don’t want them to find out and make fun of me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian laughed. “Are you kidding? They want me to seal the deal with you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li suddenly grew serious. “Nie Tian, my clan and I have been treating you well, right?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Yeah.” Nie Tian said, while running his hands across Dong Li’s curvy back and full bottom. “You want something, don’t you? Just tell me what is it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I want you to keep my clan’s interests at heart,” Dong Li said without any hesitation. “Now that the Poison Sect, the Spirit God Sect, and the Flame God Sect are gone, the Realm of Black Marsh and the Realm of Dark Underworld are currently unclaimed. Both those realms are vast and rich in cultivation resources. Many sects are drooling over them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing these words, Nie Tian realized what she was thinking, and thus asked, “So your clan is thinking about moving to one of those realms?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Who isn’t?” Dong Li responded with a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Eyes narrowed, Nie Tian asked, “What exactly do you want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“As you know, there are five powers in the Realm of a Hundred Battles: My clan, the Gu Clan, the Cao Clan, the Pill Pavilion Sect, and the Water Moon Chamber of Commerce. Even though the Realm of a Hundred Battles is a vast realm, many regions are still roamed by very powerful spirit beasts. The five powers only control a small part of the Realm of a Hundred Battles.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“However, my clan has to share such a small part with the other four powers. We have long since thought about moving, but never had the opportunity...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian suddenly felt a headache.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Many powers, including the Dong Clan, the Spirit Condor, the Ice Pavilion Sect, the Yin Sect, the Yang Sect, and the sects from the Realm of Flame Heaven, had especially close relationships with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All of them had provided him help or shelter as he grew to become the man he was today.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He wondered what he should do if they all reached out to him and demanded a part of those two unclaimed realms.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After all, he had never encountered similar problems before.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Every sect and clan in the Domain of the Falling Stars had seen one truth: he was now the owner of the Domain of the Falling Stars since the arrival of Yue Yanxi from the Divine Flame Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All of a sudden, he was put in a position so lofty that he could determine the ownership of the realms in the Domain of the Falling Stars, but then problems came along.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian pondered in silence for a while before saying slowly, “Considering our relationship, I definitely won’t forget about your clan. If it weren’t for our relationship, I wouldn’t have given a piece of the broken Heaven-shattering Crystal Cannon to your clan. It’s just that the other sects may also make similar demands, which will put me in a difficult position.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li sighed and said, “My clan has studied that Heaven-shattering Crystal Cannon with the Spirit Condor and the Tool Sect for more than six months now, and they still haven’t figured out a way to fix it. I know your dilemma. I’ll try not to put too much pressure on you, as long as you remember me and my clan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian nodded. “That’s for sure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With the matter settled, Nie Tian intended to resume his unfinished business with Dong Li. However, Dong Li’s face blushed as she pushed him off and said, “We can’t stay here for too long. They’ll know. We’ll have plenty of time for this in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, she pushed the door open.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Walking out, she said, “Come to think of it, it’s rather strange that I failed to push the main gate open, but I have no problem opening doors inside.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian followed her out of the room, saying, “You were invited in. It’s only natural that you won’t encounter any more restrictions in here.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">People were scattered in different parts of the spacious hall, examining this curious palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Hua Mu and Zhen Huilan were gathered by the large-scale teleportation portal and marveling at its profundity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zong Zheng and Dong Wangling were going from one stone room to another, hoping to find something that the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace had left behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Qin Yan, Cao Qiushui, and the other juniors were standing in the middle of the great hall, gazing up through the transparent dome into the boundless starry river.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As they noticed that Nie Tian and Dong Li had come out of the stone room, they all laid their eyes on them, meaningful smiles filling their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li avoided their gazes, while Nie Tian glanced around with a calm, confident expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, Li Langfeng’s voice echoed out from outside the palace. “Nie Tian, people from the Lei Clan are here, and they’re asking to see you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The whole palace was completely sealed. No one could see or hear anything from the outside, nor could their soul awareness penetrate these walls.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, people inside had no problem sensing sounds or movements from the outside. Even juniors like Nie Tian could hear everything with great clarity, not to mention the Soul realm experts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Li Langfeng’s exclamation caught everyone’s attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“The Lei Clan,” Hua Mu muttered, his eyebrows furrowed. “I wonder what they want.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Nie Tian, you’d better go meet them and see why they’re here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Okay.” With this word, Nie Tian walked towards the closed stone gate. He pushed it open and walked through it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as he did, he saw Lei Tianqi standing next to Li Langfeng, along with a few Lei Clan members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, Lei Tianqi was examining the magnificent palace with a disbelieving expression. Apparently, he was deeply shocked by it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon seeing Nie Tian, he hastily took a step forward and said in an excited voice, “This... This palace was left here by the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace, wasn’t it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian smiled. “That’s right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Lei Tianqi looked up at the grand palace again. “No wonder...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, he took a deep breath to calm himself before asking in a deep voice, “What’s inside, Nie Tian?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian smiled, but didn’t say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Lei Tianqi instantly realized something. He smiled somewhat embarrassedly and said, “Sorry. I’m being rude. I’m just very curious.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“What do you want me for?” Nie Tian asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Umm, grand elder sent word to us that they’ve discovered something in the region he told you about,” Lei Tianqi said. “And their discoveries have something to do with the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace. Grand elder wants me to ask you and see if you want to go there and take a look.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian’s eyes lit up. “Have something to do with the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace? Do you know what discoveries exactly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Well, grand elder didn’t tell me the details,” Lei Tianqi said, looking embarrassed. “As you know, our clan is only one of the Divine Flame Sect’s subordinate forces. They don’t tell us many things.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian nodded. “Will I be able to go there any time I want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Yeah, you can.” Lei Tianqi answered. “All you need to do is to use our teleportation portal in the Thunder Mountain Sect’s headquarters. You’ll get there after a few transits. However, grand elder has already asked me about your decision a few times, so it seems rather urgent. We’ve been looking for you everywhere, but didn’t have any clue about your whereabouts. It seems that it took you a long time to make your breakthrough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Considering Lei Tianqi’s cultivation base, it was only natural that he could see that Nie Tian had already entered the Worldly realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Therefore, he suspected that Nie Tian had conducted secluded cultivation somewhere during the time he had been missing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Alright,” Nie Tian said. “I’ll head to the Thunder Mountain Sect’s headquarters and go meet the grand elder as soon as possible.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“That’s good to hear!” Lei Tianqi said, secretly giving a sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yue Yanxi had sent word to him three times already during the past two weeks, instructing him to ask Nie Tian to go meet him. Therefore, he had been under great pressure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Now that Nie Tian had appeared, he could finally give Yue Yanxi a satisfactory reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“You may return to the Heavenly Thunder Mountain Range now, Clanmaster Lei,” Nie Tian said. “I’ll be there soon.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Lei Tianqi took another glance at the magnificent palace. In fact, he had hoped to stay and examine it. Yet now that Nie Tian had told him to leave, he could only do as he was bid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He was well-aware that Nie Tian still hadn’t completely forgiven his clan for what they had done.</span></p>

 <p>1. "To see things in the seed, that is genius."</p>
 <p>If I held in my hand a collection of seeds, I would have little idea what potential lay in each one, but to a botanist, that potential would be clear as she might see an oak tree, a sycamore, an apple tree or a rose bush.</p>
 <p>We cannot know the future, but we can, with experience, see that our present actions have consequences that ripple out into time and space and shape our lives well into the future. We can see, for example, that habitual negative thinking leads to pain, failure and frustration, whereas a clear vision of where we want to go usually leads to a better life.</p>
 <p>When I look back over my life, I can see a chain of causes and effects and the actions I took had certain results which have changed my life, sometimes forever. So be careful what you think and what you do because everything has a consequence and, like the botanist looking at her seeds, seeing the potential in nascent things is an important skill to acquire.</p>
