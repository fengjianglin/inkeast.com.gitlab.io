<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span>Nie Tian’s mind shook violently.</span></p>
 <p><span>The mysterious words in the Heaven Sparks were mostly randomly scattered and out of order. It seemed like it would need to be rearranged and lined up in order to learn their true meaning.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, among the mess of disordered words, a handful of words were perfectly lined up.</span></p>
 <p><span>They were written with the ancient symbols of the ancient Qi warriors.</span></p>
 <p><span>Those words read, “Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace Legacy, first part of Fragmentary Star Incantation.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace!” Nie Tian’s expression slightly flickered. He withdrew his mind and glanced around at the vast palace hall. Looking at the small stars that were shining on the ceiling, he suddenly came to realize something.</span></p>
 <p><span>This place must be the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace that those words were referring to, and all the comers were here for its legacies.</span></p>
 <p><span>Before now, his psychic power had been unable to enter the Heaven Sparks. Therefore, even though he had absorbed quite a few magical symbols from the dilapidated city, he hadn’t been able to study them.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was as if the fifteen Heaven Sparks had been covered in a invisible shield, blocking his psychic awareness from peeping into them.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, as soon as the detailed pattern entered the Heaven Sparks on his hands, the impeding shield seemed to suddenly lifted.</span></p>
 <p><span>From the look of it, only those who got into the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace would be able to send their psychic power into the Heaven Sparks, so as to learn the profound mysteries that hid within.</span></p>
 <p><span>Having understood how it worked, Nie Tian took a deep breath and once again concentrated on observing the numerous patterns on the distant walls.</span></p>
 <p><span>After the starlight had shone on them, each and every one of them had begun glittering with bright light.</span></p>
 <p><span>Every one of them became so clear and vivid that Nie Tian’s eyes could capture even the most subtle veins and lines.</span></p>
 <p><span>Some were patterns of the sun, moon, and stars; some were patterns of ravines and mountain ranges, while others were of veins of ancient trees. They all represented the various things in the world.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, it seemed not all of them could be absorbed and drawn in by his psychic power.</span></p>
 <p><span>As his gaze shifted from one pattern to another, he noticed that he couldn’t build up a mysterious connection with any one of those patterns.</span></p>
 <p><span>His gaze roamed here and there, continuously sweeping across the wall, before it suddenly fixed on one pattern that was filled with numerous fragmentary stars, which made it seem like a dazzling and bright star atlas.</span></p>
 <p><span>The moment his gaze landed on it, a mysterious connection was established between Nie Tian and the pattern.</span></p>
 <p><span>The fifteen Heaven Sparks on his hand once again became extremely hot. At the same time, a strong attractive force was born within them.</span></p>
 <p><span>In the next moment, the mysterious pattern that seemed to be made of stars was pulled out of the wall and slowly flew towards him, soon merging with his Heaven Sparks.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian carefully probed his Heaven Sparks and found that as soon as the pattern of fragmentary stars entered the Heaven Sparks, it seemed to disintegrate.</span></p>
 <p><span>The complicated and detailed star atlas exploded and turned into numerous ancient symbols, which scattered around inside the fifteen Heaven Sparks.</span></p>
 <p><span>His psychic awareness drifted around from one Heaven Spark to another, and he discovered that the numerous, unreadable symbols that he had absorbed from the dilapidated city had morphed into ancient scripts.</span></p>
 <p><span>There were hundreds of ancient scripts within the fifteen Heaven Sparks, each of which shone brightly and looked like fragmentary stars that were drifting around indefinitely and quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span>Although he could recognize most of those ancient scripts, since they weren’t in the correct order, he couldn’t decipher the true meaning behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, he was quite certain that they recorded the first part of the Fragmentary Star Incantation.</span></p>
 <p><span>Another thing was that he had the feeling that the ancient scripts that he obtained was far from enough to complete the first part of the Fragmentary Star Incantation.</span></p>
 <p><span>In order to obtain the legacy, not only would he have to add more scripts to his Heaven Sparks, but he would also need to spend countless hours to rearrange the disorderly scripts and put them in the right order.</span></p>
 <p><span>Only in that way would he be able to understand the profound mysteries within the Fragmentary Star Incantation and start cultivating with it.</span></p>
 <p><span>WHOOSH!</span></p>
 <p><span>He breathed out a mouthful of waste after channeling two more patterns from the wall into his Heaven Sparks. He could tell that he had already consumed a large amount of his psychic power.</span></p>
 <p><span>He decided to slow down his pace. Instead of continuing to channel the patterns on the palace walls, he turned around to look at the other three cultivators in the Lesser Heaven area.</span></p>
 <p><span>He was convinced that the three of them were here for the one and only purpose: to obtain the first part of the Fragmentary Star Incantation, legacy of the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span>He discovered that the three of them were doing exactly what he had done, absorbing patterns from the distant walls and adding magical symbols into their own Heaven Sparks.</span></p>
 <p><span>He paid more attention to the blue-garbed young woman.</span></p>
 <p><span>Since she had placed her hands on her knees, palms facing up, Nie Tian never had the chance to see how many Heaven Sparks she had.</span></p>
 <p><span>At that moment, she was also using her psychic power and the special connection to absorb mysterious patterns from the walls into her Heaven Sparks.</span></p>
 <p><span>This gave Nie Tian the chance to get a clear view of her hands, and on the back of her milky left hand he saw as many as twenty Heaven Sparks!</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian counted inwardly. Convinced that there were twenty Heaven Sparks on the young woman’s hand, Nie Tian’s expression flickered. “Twenty!”</span></p>
 <p><span>According to his understanding, having more Heaven Sparks meant killing more trial takers and having greater power.</span></p>
 <p><span>The fact that the teenager in white had sixteen Heaven Sparks and the teenager in black had eighteen had already made him pay special attention to the two of them.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, only until now did he finally realize that the young woman was actually the most fierce one and the one who he should be the most careful with.</span></p>
 <p><span>His speculation was soon proved valid.</span></p>
 <p><span>He discovered that shortly after him, the white-robed young man and black-robed young man both stopped channeling and absorbing patterns from the walls due to overconsumption of their psychic power.</span></p>
 <p><span>Only the blue-garbed young woman was still searching for patterns that she had connections with on the walls, her eyes glittering with a bright light. Before long, a few more detailed and beautiful patterns flew into the Heaven Sparks on the back of her left hand.</span></p>
 <p><span>The black-robed young man grinned and said, “Wow, no wonder people say Su Lin from the Heaven Palace sect in the Realm of Mystic Heaven is quite a character.” </span></p>
 <p><span>“Realm of Mystic Heaven, Heaven Palace sect!” Nie Tian’s eyebrows rose.</span></p>
 <p><span>Right before he headed off to the Hell sect, Wu Ji had imprinted the things that required his attention in the command medallion and had told him to read them on his way. That was where the Realm of Mystic Heaven and the Heaven Palace sect had previously come up.</span></p>
 <p><span>According to the information that Wu Ji had obtained, the one of the other two Heaven Gates had opened up in the Heaven Palace sect in the Realm of Mystic Heaven.</span></p>
 <p><span>Meanwhile, the other one had opened up in the Realm of a Thousand Devastations.</span></p>
 <p><span>There were nine realms in the Domain of the Falling Stars: the Realm of Mystic Heaven, Realm of Endless Ice, Realm of Unbounded Desolation, Realm of a Thousand Devastations, Realm of a Hundred Battles, Realm of Black Marsh, Realm of Earth Sieve, Realm of Dark Underworld, and Realm of Flame Heaven.</span></p>
 <p><span>Each of these nine realms had a few Qi warrior sects located in it, whose strength varied from one another.</span></p>
 <p><span>Of all the realms, the Realm of Mystic Heaven, the Realm of Endless Ice, and the Realm of Unbounded Desolation were known as the three strongest realms.</span></p>
 <p><span>Close behind them were the Realm of a Thousand Devastations, the Realm of a Hundred Battles, and the Realm of Black Marsh. The Realm of Earth Sieve, the Realm of Dark Underworld, and the Realm of Flame Heaven were ranked last.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Realm of Mystic Heaven had always been considered among the most powerful of the nine realms. Some people might even say that it was the number one powerful realm.</span></p>
 <p><span>On the other hand, the Heaven Palace sect was widely accepted as the most powerful Qi warrior sect in the Realm of Mystic Heaven, whose status in the Realm of Mystic Heaven was even more unshakable than the Hell sect in Realm of Flame Heaven.</span></p>
 <p><span>At least in the Realm of Flame Heaven, the four sects with the Spiritual Treasure sect as their leader had been dissatisfied with the Hell sect’s dominant position.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, all the sects in the Realm of Mystic Heaven acknowledged the Heaven Palace sect’s ruling position, and would even take orders from the Heaven Palace sect at all times!</span></p>
 <p><span>Since Su Lin was from the Heaven Palace sect, her arrogance and the fact that she was able to obtain twenty Heaven Sparks seemed to make sense now.</span></p>
 <p><span>Under Nie Tian and the other two’s gazes, Su Lin attracted one more pattern into her Heaven Sparks, and only then did her eyes finally stopped searching.</span></p>
 <p><span>After all, the process was too consuming on psychic power, even so for her. Therefore, she also needed time to recuperate.</span></p>
 <p><span>She didn’t look at anyone, but rather sat in silence and used her unique, secret magic to channel the rich spiritual energy in her surroundings, as if she wanted to use the spiritual energy in the air to restore her psychic power.</span></p>
 <p><span>Even though Nie Tian was confused and incredulous, seeing that Su Lin was doing it, he thought he might as well try it as well.</span></p>
 <p><span>The only way that Nie Tian knew to replenish his psychic power was through protracted sleep.</span></p>
 <p><span>According to his experience, by breathing spiritual Qi of the heaven and earth alone, he wasn’t able to restore any of the psychic power that he had lost.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, when he copied what Su Lin was doing and used the Qi Refining Incantation to circulate the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth, he was surprised to discover that the spiritual energy in this place contained a small amount of unknown energy that actually could replenish his psychic power.</span></p>
 <p><span>The unknown energy was extremely faint, about one hundredth of the intensity of the spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p><span>Even so, Nie Tian was amazed and thrilled at the fact that he had a way to restore his psychic power in this place.</span></p>
 <p><span>Eyes narrowed, Nie Tian pondered in silence for a while before his expression suddenly flickered. “There is a special kind of energy in the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth. This means that the more spiritual energy I take in, the faster I’ll be able to restore my psychic power...”</span></p>
 <p><span>He suddenly remembered the secret magic that he had learned from one of the giant arms in the mysterious land.</span></p>
 <p><span>That arm had its fingers stretched out like a claw, as if it had attempted to rip the heaven out of the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span>He recalled that by casting that secret magic in that mysterious land, he had managed to channel the relatively rich spiritual energy into himself much more effectively and speed up his cultivation by multiple times.</span></p>
 <p><span>Since it primarily relied on a high concentration of spiritual energy, he didn’t try it on the Cloudsoaring mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, he was currently in a place where there was a endless supply of unprecedentedly rich spiritual energy!</span></p>
 <p><span>He gave a bright smile. “There’s no better place to use that technique than here!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Without wasting any time, he calmed himself and started to cast the secret magic to gather spiritual energy.</span></p>
