<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">By the time all of the Divine Flame Sect disciples had entered the palace, Yue Yanxi’s furrowed eyebrows finally relaxed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He was now free of worries.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though the foreign Qi warriors Xing Beichen had summoned here were all at the Void domain, he was confident that he would be able to escape from them if things went south quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He might not be able to defeat multiple Qi warriors at his domain at the same time, but it wouldn’t be easy for them to kill him either.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The palace left by the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace seemed to have many secrets. Yue Yanxi had repeatedly tried to enter it, but failed every single time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He didn’t think it would be any different with the Qi warriors who were coming with Xing Beichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Now that the safety of the other Divine Flame Sect disciples was guaranteed, what worries did he still have? If he found himself in an unfavorable situation, he could simply run back to their headquarters in the Domain of Heaven’s Boundaries and seek help.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Tian Ziping from the Bliss Mountain Sect looked very grim as she stared coldly at the closed stone gate. “Little bastard! I can’t believe he actually closed the gate in our face!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Jiang Feng, however, didn’t seem very upset. After a moment of hesitation, he said, “Go start that ancient golden starship now, and leave the central region. Xing Beichen and those foreign experts will get here soon. This palace will be their first and primary target. Only after they’re finished here will they spread out to find you.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“So you need to go to the other regions of this continent and wait for my message. If I... am lost, you just get out of here on that ancient golden starship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Bliss Mountain Sect disciples looked rather frustrated after hearing these words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They had gone to great lengths to find this place, which would be a perfect new location for their sect’s headquarters. They had strongly desired to take it for their own.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, now it seemed that all of their efforts and schemes would go to waste.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">SHEW!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Face covered by a thin veil, Mu Biqiong was the first to jump up and land lightly on the berthed ancient golden starship.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon seeing this, the other experts from the Bliss Mountain Sect realized her stance on the matter.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Therefore, they rapidly flew into the ancient starship as well under Jiang Feng’s urging.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Seeing the ancient golden starship slowly rising up after all of the Bliss Mountain Sect disciples had gotten on board, the members of the Jian Clan and the Guan Clan also looked rather downcast.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Jian Tong sighed. “They’re making the right decision. Since that little brother refused to take our members in, you shouldn’t stay here either. Without an ancient starship of our own, you might not be able to leave this continent, but you can spread out and hole up in remote corners of this continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I’ll stay here and handle the foreign Qi warriors with Jiang Feng and Yue Yanxi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After hearing these words, the Guan Clan and Jian Clan members did as they were bid and left with bitter expressions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Moments later, the three Void domain experts were all who remained in front of the palace, waiting for the powerful foreign experts Xing Beichen had summoned from another domain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">…</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Inside the grand palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Divine Flame Sect disciples kept glancing around and discussing with one another after entering.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Such rich spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth! The spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth in here is three times richer than out there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Aside from the rich spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth, there’s also rich star power here, which makes this place a perfect place for Qi warriors from the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace to practice cultivation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“It seems that no one from the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace is here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yin Yanan, who had been the first to enter the palace, stepped into the middle of the great hall, where there stood a large-scale teleportation portal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Just as I expected!” Standing at the gate, Nie Tian took a brief glance around, and realized that this palace was almost identical to the one that had risen from the depths of the earth in the Realm of Split Void.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The dome of the great hall was semi-transparent. The immense starry river could be seen through it, along with countless shining stars. It gave people a distant and mysterious feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, the spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth and the star power inside the great hall were several times richer than in the palace he had found in the Realm of Split Void.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He therefore believed that this place was the ideal place for him to practice cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Not only would he be able to gather power and refine his spiritual sea more efficiently with the rich powers within this palace, but he also felt very relaxed here, both physically and mentally, which he believed would help him derive enlightenment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Besides, the fire-attributed and wood-attributed regions on this continents would also be very helpful to his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the wood-attributed region, he would be able to absorb and refine wood power with his Wood Thriving Formation. The refinement of his vortex of wood power and his fleshly body would accelerate significantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The endless flesh auras of outsiders and ancient spirit beasts that surrounded this continent would further speed up his Meridian Toughening process.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The fire-attributed region was filled with erupting volcanoes that contained rich, fierce flame power. If his speculations were correct, there must be a large amount of earthflame essence and earthflame crystal strings there as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, the Flame Dragon Armor would be able to fully recover the flame power it had consumed to refine the Phantasm soul before.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The refinement of his vortex of flame power would also achieve twice the results with half the effort.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“This place is such a hidden land of peace and prosperity. If my grandfather, aunt, and Dong Li could come to practice cultivation in this place through the teleportation portal in the Realm of Split Void, then their cultivation efficiency would soar through the ceiling.” Eyes narrowed, Nie Tian felt overjoyed as he became increasingly certain that this palace and this entire floating continent were left here for him by the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, Yin Yanan from the Beast-controlling Sect finally couldn’t help but ask in a loud voice, “Nie Tian! Do you know where you can go through this teleportation portal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, Qiao Yunxi and two Soul realm experts from the Divine Flame Sect were also standing beside her. They had all observed the teleportation portal for quite some time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian snapped back to reality. With a faint smile, he took his time to walk over to them and said, “I do, but I’m afraid there’s something wrong with this teleportation portal. I haven’t been able to establish a connection with it since I came here from the Domain of the Falling Stars. Can you tell where its problem lies?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Taken aback, Qiao Yunxi asked, “It connects this place to the Domain of the Falling Stars?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Well, the Domain of the Falling Stars is one of the two locations it connects to. The other is somewhere else that has a close connection with the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace.” Standing in front of the teleportation portal, Nie Tian placed one hand on the control panel and sent a wisp of soul awareness into it. Immediately afterwards, he sensed the existence of two sets of coordinates within it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As he had expected, one set of coordinates led to the Domain of the Falling Stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The other set of coordinates seemed to lead to somewhere that had close connections with the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">An old man from the Divine Flame Sect named Tang Yong, who was squatting and examining the spell formation, answered, “I don’t see any problem with this teleportation portal. It might have just run out of materials that contain spatial power. Teleportation portals run on spatial power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Perhaps it’s just been too long since anyone used this portal, and the fueling materials within it have lost their power and vanished.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I think it’ll work again once it’s refilled with new fueling materials.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian looked down with rapt attention, and discovered that, just as the man had said, the place at the bottom of the teleportation portal that held spatial energy materials like Space Spirit Jades was now empty.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“So it just needs new fueling materials,” He muttered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Shiny, immaculate stones that contained spatial power flew out of Tang Yong’s palm to the bottom of the teleportation portal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the stones gradually filled the bottom of the portal, the spell formation that might have not been activated for the past ten thousand years started to thrum with strong spatial fluctuations.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Tang Yong’s eyes suddenly lit up. He subconsciously took a step back and looked over at Nie Tian. “The spell formation is working again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yin Yanan, Qiao Yunxi, and the others also fixed him with anticipating gazes and waited for his next move.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All of them assumed that Nie Tian would teleport to the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace’s headquarters through this teleportation portal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a moment of hesitation, Nie Tian moved his fingers very subtly, and as a thought entered his mind, the spell formation was set to the coordinates of the Domain of the Falling Stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, he didn’t open his eyes right away, but rather focused on examining the other set of coordinates, hoping to learning where it lead to exactly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After all, this was the main reason why he had come on this trip.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, even though he did his utmost to hold onto the second set of coordinates with his soul awareness, he couldn’t. He felt as if something was keeping him from doing so.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It was a familiar feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Before he had entered the Worldly realm, when his true soul hadn’t formed yet, he had had similar feelings when he had attempted to penetrate the mysterious ward over the hidden underground palace in the Realm of Split Void.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Only after he had entered the Worldly realm had he overcome the obstacles and been able to send his soul awareness through the ward to touch that palace, which had caused it to rise to the earth’s surface.</span></p>
 <p><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“It’s either because of my inadequate cultivation base, or my insufficient understanding of the fragmentary star marks.</span></em></p>
 <p><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“The powerful experts from the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace had all this planned for me thousands of years ago, yet they set up restrictions as well.</span></em></p>
 <p><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“This must be some sort of test, a test for their Son of the Stars!”</span></em></p>

Come to think about it, do you know why Chinese light firecrackers and perform Lion Dances to celebrate New Year? It all started with a monster named Nian.</p>
 <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px">According to Chinese mythology, a Nian (simplified Chinese: 年兽; traditional Chinese: 年獸; pinyin: nián shòu) is a beast that lives under the sea or in the mountains. The character Nian more usually means "year" or "new year".&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Once every year at the beginning of Chinese New Year, the Nian comes out of its hiding place to feed, mostly on men and animals. During winter, since food is sparse, he would go to the village. He would eat the crops and sometimes the villagers, mostly children. There are several accounts as to how it looked, such as the way some sources cited that it resembles a flat-face lion with a dog's body and prominent incisor. Other authors described it as larger than an elephant with two long horns and many sharp teeth. The weaknesses of the Nian are purported to be a sensitivity to loud noises, fire, and a fear of the color red.</p>
 <p>Some local legends attribute the Chinese lion dance to the legend of the Nian. The tradition has its origins in a story of a Nian's attack on a village. After the attack, the villagers discussed how to make the Nian leave them in peace. Since it was discovered that the beast was afraid of the color red, people would put red lanterns, spring scrolls, and paper-cuts on their windows and doors. They would also leave food at their doorstep in a bid to divert it from eating humans.</p>
 <p>The traditions of firecrackers, red lanterns, and red robes found in many Lion Dance portrayals originate from the plan the villagers had in which drums, plates and empty bowls were hit, red robes were worn, and firecrackers were thrown, causing loud banging sounds that they hoped would intimidate the Nian. According to this same myth, captured by Hongjun Laozu, an ancient Taoist monk, and Nian became Hongjun Laozu's mount.</p>
