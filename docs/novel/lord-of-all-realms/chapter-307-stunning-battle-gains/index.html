 <p><span>SHEW!</span></p>
 <p><span>After seeing the Blood Skull’s metal war chariot, as well as the familiar faces on it, Nie Tian cast the short-range Starshift again.</span></p>
 <p><span>In in a flash, he broke through the Hunters’ blockade and shot towards the metal war chariot like a bolt of lightning.</span></p>
 <p><span>None of the Hunters who were pursuing Nie Tian had their own Heaven Eyes, and thus they weren’t aware of the appearance of the war chariot yet.</span></p>
 <p><span>After having chased after Nie Tian for a long time, all the Hunter organization leaders could sense Nie Tian’s weariness.</span></p>
 <p><span>“He’s only hanging by a thread! Come on everyone! Let‘s get him, dead or alive, so that at least we can please one of Li Langfeng or the Fang!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The few Greater Heaven stage experts were able to perceive the spiritual power fluctuations Nie Tian emanated, and thus knew that when he launched the last few strikes, the speed at which his spiritual power circulated had become noticeably slower.</span></p>
 <p><span>This meant that Nie Tian was on the verge of burning out his spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p><span>Both Li Langfeng and Song Li didn’t want Nie Tian to flee back to Shatter City. They shared the same view on this matter.</span></p>
 <p><span>These Hunter organization leaders had been searching for Nie Tian for weeks, and had lost many of their subordinates, so they also wanted to mete out justice for themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span>Dead or alive, they were determined to get Nie Tian!</span></p>
 <p><span>Therefore, they pursued him madly.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Hua Tian!” Standing in the war chariot, Shi Qing’s pupils contracted as he caught sight of Nie Tian, who was running towards them at full speed.</span></p>
 <p><span>Upon hearing his shout, Liu Kang, Cai Yuan, and Li Ye also looked forward with rapt attention.</span></p>
 <p><span>A dashing figure covered in blood appeared on the distant horizon of the open wasteland.</span></p>
 <p><span>As he came closer, Li Ye got a clear view of Nie Tian. His expression immediately flickered as he exclaimed loudly, “He’s sustained serious injuries!”</span></p>
 <p><span>At this moment, Nie Tian’s pupils were as red as blood, and he was covered in close to a hundred fine wounds; some of the cuts were so deep that they reached his bones! Bathed in blood, he looked like a god of slaughter.</span></p>
 <p><span>Even still, endless fighting spirit could still be seen hovering within his scarlet pupils.</span></p>
 <p><span>He unleashed an invisible killing intent into his surroundings, making him seem extremely ferocious and bloodthirsty.</span></p>
 <p><span>Liu Kang, who wasn’t familiar with Nie Tian, took a deep look at Nie Tian before he said with a astonished tone, “Such a strong killing aura! How many men did he kill to give him such a strong killing aura?!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Shi Qing and Cai Yuan remained silent as the war chariot under their feet kept charging forwards at full speed.</span></p>
 <p><span>SHEW!</span></p>
 <p><span>When they were close enough to Nie Tian, Shi Qing and Liu Kang jumped out of the war chariot almost simultaneously.</span></p>
 <p><span>As soon as they leapt into the air, the metal war chariot slowed down and came to a stop about ten meters in front of Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span>Shi Qing and Liu Kang landed right beside Nie Tian, one to his left and one to his right.</span></p>
 <p><span>“How are you doing, Hua Tian?” Shi Qing asked, seeming rather concerned.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian finally loosened up as he smiled embarrassedly and said with a nod, “Relax, I’m not going to die.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“That’s good,” Liu Kang said. He subconsciously looked at the sizable leather pouch hanging on Nie Tian’s waist and asked, “What’s this?”</span></p>
 <p><span>He heard clanking sounds and sensed subtle fluctuations of spatial energy coming from the leather pouch.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Bracelets of holding.” As Nie Tian answered, Cai Yuan and Li Ye also jumped out of the war chariot. They rapidly approached him and attempted to support him with their hands.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian shook his head. “I’m fine.” As he took the large leather pouch from his waist, the wounds on his arm were torn open, causing blood to drip down his arm. “Here. Would you please convert them into spirit stones and accumulate my contribution points when we get back?”</span></p>
 <p><span>The moment Cai Yuan grabbed the leather pouch, his expression flickered, since he immediately felt how heavy it was.</span></p>
 <p><span>Under Shi Qing, Liu Kang, and Li Ye’s gazes, Cai Yuan opened the pouch and looked into it. Immediately afterward, a flabbergasted look appeared on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span>Curious about what was in there, Shi Qing, Liu Kang, and Li Ye also looked into the pouch, and then were also taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span>“There are so many of them!” Li Ye exclaimed. “Hua Tian, you looted all these bracelets of holding from your enemies? God! How many people have you killed?!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Only after hearing Li Ye’s exclaimation did Shi Qing and Liu Kang snap back to reality.</span></p>
 <p><span>Shi Qing rubbed his forehead as he turned to Liu Kang and said, “There are at least 50 bracelets of holding in here. From what I can tell, most of these bracelets of holding belonged to early and middle Heaven stage cultivators. However, some of them seem to have belonged to late Heaven stage cultivators.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Liu Kang stared at Nie Tian like he was looking at a monster. Only after a short while did he nod towards Shi Qing, agreeing with his opinion.</span></p>
 <p><span>WHOOSH! WHOOSH!</span></p>
 <p><span>At that moment, the leaders of the Blood Hand, the Scorpion, and the other pursuing Hunter organizations arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span>Their expression flickered as soon as they saw the metal war chariot, and Shi Qing and Liu Kang who were standing in front of them. “It’s the Blood Skull!”</span></p>
 <p><span>They exchanged a glance with each other. Without saying a word, they turned and fled in different directions, giving up their pursuit of Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Who else is after you?” Liu Kang asked Nie Tian with a soft tone.</span></p>
 <p><span>Shi Qing was also curious. “How come we don’t see members from the Fang?” </span></p>
 <p><span>“The Fang got into a fight with Li Langfeng,” Nie Tian answered, “so they probably won’t show up here any time soon. Aside from these leaders of the major Hunter organizations, their Heaven stage subordinates are probably also in this area.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Shi Qing’s expression flickered. “Li Langfeng is after you too?” </span></p>
 <p><span>After a moment of hesitation, Nie Tian explained why the Fang were fighting Li Langfeng to them in detail.</span></p>
 <p><span>After hearing Nie Tian’s explanation, Shi Qing turned to Liu Kang and said, his eyes filled with a strange look, “Our men should be here at any moment now. From the look of it, the battle between Li Langfeng and the Fang will go on for some time. That being the case, you and I can take advantage of this period of time and hunt some Hunters.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Liu Kang nodded and said, “Let’s do it.”</span></p>
 <p><span>With these words, the two Greater Heaven stage experts moved out to pursue the fleeing Hunter organization leaders.</span></p>
 <p><span>Cai Yuan had his arm around Nie Tian’s shoulders and said to Li Ye, “Let’s help Nie Tian into the war chariot.” </span></p>
 <p><span>“Alright.” The two of them supported Nie Tian’s two shoulders and helped him onto the war chariot without his consent.</span></p>
 <p><span>Standing in the war chariot, Nie Tian discovered that another Greater Heaven stage expert was silently sitting up straight in a corner of the war chariot.</span></p>
 <p><span>The man seemed to be at the late Greater Heaven stage, the same as Liu Kang. Seeing Nie Tian step closer, a bright light shone across his narrowed eyes as he nodded towards Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span>At that time, Nie Tian discovered that he wasn’t wearing garments that had the Blood Skull’s sigils on them.</span></p>
 <p><span>“This is Uncle Xue Long. Just like you, he’s also one of our guest elders.” Cai Yuan introduced him to Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian felt deep veneration upon hearing these words.</span></p>
 <p><span>He was well-aware that anyone who was given the honor of becoming the Blood Skull’s guest elder must not be an ordinary person.</span></p>
 <p><span>Only the truly powerful ones would have the privilege to be invited and become a guest elder of the Blood Skull.</span></p>
 <p><span>The incomparably fierce Li Langfeng was the Dark Moon’s guest elder, and his battle prowess even surpassed Ma Jiu, the Dark Moon’s highest commander in the Void Illusion Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p><span>Even though Li Langfeng and Ma Jiu were both at the late Greater Heaven stage, as far as Nie Tian saw it, Li Langfeng could probably beat three Ma Jius in a battle.</span></p>
 <p><span>Since Xue Long was a guest elder of the Blood Skull, it was very likely that he was an expert as strong as Li Langfeng.</span></p>
 <p><span>He bowed respectfully. “Greetings, Uncle Xue Long.” </span></p>
 <p><span>Xue Long waved his hand. “No need to stand on ceremony.” Then, he looked Nie Tian up and down with his narrowed eyes before saying, “You’re better than me when I was at your stage. When I was at the early Heaven stage, I could hardly kill one middle Heaven stage enemy. You, however, single-handedly killed a large number of Heaven stage enemies. Aside from that, you even killed a handful of late Heaven stage enemies. I couldn’t compete with that.”</span></p>
 <p><span>With these words, Xue Long fell silent and slowly closed his eyes, as if he was cultivating some secret magic.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian, on the other hand, didn’t intend to explain how he had done it either. He just felt relieved after learning that Xue Long was also a guest elder of the Blood Skull.</span></p>
 <p><span>At that moment, he came to understand why Shi Qing and Liu Kang had left the noble Cai Yuan and the lofty Li Ye, and chased after the Hunter organization leaders without the slightest hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span>Xue Long must be the reason.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Sit down, and take these medicinal pills.” Li Ye forced Nie Tian to sit down by pressing against his shoulder. Before Nie Tian had a chance to say anything, he took out a handful of multicolored medicinal pills and stuffed them into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian knew that Li Ye wouldn’t harm him, so he cooperated and swallowed all the medicinal pills.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Hua Tian, how many Hunters did you kill along the way?” Curiosity was stretched across Cai Yuan’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span>“You saw the bracelets of holding in that leather pouch. Aside from those, there are probably another twenty-something Hunters that died by my hands.” Nie Tian sighed and added with a regretful tone, “It’s a pity that I was in a hurry to break through their blockade, so I didn’t have the time to collect those Hunters’ bracelets of holding.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“There are twenty more!?” A bitter expression appeared at the corner of Cai Yuan’s mouth. He shook his head and whispered to himself, “Is this guy some kind of monster, or what?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Even Xue Long, who was cultivating with his eyes closed, had a slight change in his facial expression as he said in his heart, “Monstrous battle prowess indeed.”</span></p>
