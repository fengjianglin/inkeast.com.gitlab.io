<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span>With his new-found understanding, Nie Tian lifted up one hand and started to channel the spiritual energy in the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p><span>Within moments, a strong attraction force was born in the center of his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span>HUFF! HUFF! HUFF!</span></p>
 <p><span>The incomparably rich spiritual energy in the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace began to madly converge on his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span>It wasn’t very long before a ball of semi-liquidized spiritual energy gradually took form in his palm.</span></p>
 <p><span>The spiritual energy ball expanded to the size of a table, while misty spiritual energy constantly rose up from the liquid surface within it, releasing massive amounts of raging energy fluctuations.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Hmm?” Both the white-robed young man and the black-robed young man detected the anomaly, opened their eyes, and cast curious gazes towards Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span>Eyes narrowed, Nie Tian quietly cast a spell to absorb the pure spiritual energy within the ball.</span></p>
 <p><span>PHEW! PHEW!</span></p>
 <p><span>One after another, numerous wisps of light flowed out of the spiritual energy ball and rapidly flew into Nie Tian’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span>The two vortexes of spiritual power within his spiritual sea started to revolve at an unprecedentedly high speed.</span></p>
 <p><span>The infusion of the pure, condensed spiritual energy instantly filled his spiritual sea to the brim.</span></p>
 <p><span>At the same time, Nie Tian had a very clear feeling that the special energy was quietly flowing into his mind, rapidly replenishing his overused psychic power.</span></p>
 <p><span>Only after a few moments had passed did his eyes start to glitter with brilliant light, as if he had already restored his psychic power to a great extent.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, the giant spiritual energy ball in his palm hadn’t shrink in the least bit, and the energy within was still incomparably copious.</span></p>
 <p><span>But the special energy had already been completely sucked away in such a short time.</span></p>
 <p><span>He couldn’t detect any residual bit of it.</span></p>
 <p><span>Brow furrowed, Nie Tian searched in his brain for awhile before he made up his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span>He decided to give up the spiritual energy ball.</span></p>
 <p><span>SHEW!</span></p>
 <p><span>With a flick of his fingers, the spiritual energy ball left his palm and flew away like a balloon.</span></p>
 <p><span>Although Nie Tian had given up controlling it, the spiritual energy ball stopped about five meters to his left and floated there. The semi-liquidized spiritual energy within it was still sending out strong energy ripples.</span></p>
 <p><span>Perhaps because he was its creator, even though he decided to set it free, there was still a mysterious link between him and the spiritual energy ball.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, Nie Tian didn’t think too much about it.</span></p>
 <p><span>After all, the purpose of him creating the energy ball was to more effectively absorb the unknown energy in it, so as to recover his psychic power.</span></p>
 <p><span>After casting away the first energy ball, Nie Tian repeated the spell that he had picked up from the mysterious land, and created another spiritual energy ball.</span></p>
 <p><span>Before long, it too expanded to the size of a table.</span></p>
 <p><span>With the same method, Nie Tian rapidly absorbed the energy within.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, since his spiritual sea had already expanded to the limit of middle Lesser Heaven stage and he couldn’t take in any more spiritual energy, he only pulled away the special energy within the ball and channeled it to his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span>With another surge of replenishment of his psychic power, Nie Tian’s eyes shone with an increasingly bright light.</span></p>
 <p><span>Thrilled by his new findings, he flicked the spiritual energy ball that was devoid of the special energy to the side. “Next!”</span></p>
 <p><span>With the same method, he condensed another energy ball and absorbed only the special energy from it.</span></p>
 <p><span>Over and over, he repeated the process to restore his psychic power.</span></p>
 <p><span>Before long, there were already seven spiritual energy balls floating around Nie Tian, emanating intense energy fluctuations.</span></p>
 <p><span>By that time, Nie Tian had already restored all the psychic power that he had consumed from attracting the complicated patterns from the walls.</span></p>
 <p><span>Not only that, he even felt a certain growth in his psychic power!</span></p>
 <p><span>He smiled to himself and stopped cultivating. Once again, he started examining the patterns on the distant walls.</span></p>
 <p><span>Soon afterwards, he found a pattern that he felt a connection with, and used his psychic power to pull it towards him before it flew into the fifteen Heaven Sparks on the back of his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span>As soon as it entered, it once again exploded and turned into dozens of ancient scripts, scattered within the Heaven Sparks.</span></p>
 <p><span>“He has recovered his strength already?!” The face of the black-robed young man from the Realm of Unbounded Desolation turned grim after he noticed that Nie Tian had already stopped cultivating and begun taking in more magical symbols of the Fragmentary Star Incantation again.</span></p>
 <p><span>The white-robed young man from the Realm of Endless Ice also cast an astonished gaze towards Nie Tian. Even though he didn’t say a word, he seemed to grow uneasy.</span></p>
 <p><span>The two of them had both reached the peak of the Lesser Heaven stage. Even still, they couldn’t recover so quickly after such a great consumption of their psychic power.</span></p>
 <p><span>Meanwhile, Nie Tian’s cultivation base was inferior to theirs, and he was from the weakest realm of the nine, the Realm of Flame Heaven...</span></p>
 <p><span>As a matter of fact, the white-robed young man had despised Nie Tian from when they had first met, thinking that it was a joke that a middle Lesser Heaven stage boy from the Realm of Flame Heaven had come here for the legacy.</span></p>
 <p><span>He had also noticed that the young man from the Realm of Unbounded Desolation had already viewed Nie Tian as his prey.</span></p>
 <p><span>He originally thought that it wouldn’t be long before the guy from the Realm of Unbounded Desolation gave in to the temptation of killing Nie Tian, and Nie Tian wouldn’t stand a chance if he did.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, now...</span></p>
 <p><span>He shook his head upon realizing that Nie Tian was much more than what he originally had in mind. He was convinced that there must be something unusual about him.</span></p>
 <p><span>PHOOH!</span></p>
 <p><span>At that moment, the blue-garbed Su Lin from the Heaven Palace sect awoke from her cultivation and fixed her beautiful eyes on Nie Tian for the first time.</span></p>
 <p><span>With her unique, secret magic, she managed to fully restore her psychic power within a short time.</span></p>
 <p><span>Even still, she found herself one step behind Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span>She unleashed her psychic power and sensed that it would still take the other two about an hour to fully replenish their psychic power.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Perhaps it was because his cultivation base was low and his psychic power was puny that he was able to recover so quickly.” Su Lin muttered to herself. Without dwelling on it, she continued to attract the detailed patterns that contained the first part of the Fragmentary Star Incantation with her psychic power.</span></p>
 <p><span>A long time passed.</span></p>
 <p><span>Out of the corner of her eyes, Su Lin noticed that Nie Tian had taken in three patterns in a row before coming to a stop, seemingly depleted of psychic power.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Three!” She finally started to attach importance to Nie Tian. Her mind drifted away while she was in the middle of absorbing a pattern.</span></p>
 <p><span>She knew perfectly well how much psychic power was required to attract three patterns that were imprinted with the Fragmentary Star Incantation.</span></p>
 <p><span>She herself could only attract five patterns even when her psychic power was at the fullest.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, in order not to completely drain her psychic power, she would usually stop at four. After all, she preferred to be on the safe side.</span></p>
 <p><span>The other two young men, on the other hand, didn’t dare to pull more than three patterns into their Heaven Sparks in a row, despite the fact that they had both reached the peak of the Lesser Heaven stage.</span></p>
 <p><span>The fact that Nie Tian could also attract three patterns into his Heaven Sparks meant that his psychic power was at least at the same level as the other two young men.</span></p>
 <p><span>Su Lin was also well aware of what status they had in the Realm of Unbounded Desolation and the Realm of Endless Ice.</span></p>
 <p><span>She couldn’t help but wonder how a middle Lesser Heaven stage young man from the Realm of Flame Heaven had acquired psychic power so impressive, and how he managed to recover his psychic power so rapidly.</span></p>
 <p><span>Eyes glittering with a curious light, she studied Nie Tian from head to toe and whispered to herself, “I have to pay more attention to him.”</span></p>
 <p><span>After detaching and pulling three more detailed patterns into his Heaven Sparks, Nie Tian once again stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span>He used the same method to condense another spiritual energy ball, and then drained it only of its special energy that could help him restore psychic power.</span></p>
 <p><span>Immediately after, he released the energy ball into his surroundings and went ahead to create a new one.</span></p>
 <p><span>Time passed quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian repeated the process of using his psychic power to attract the patterns that carried the first part of the Fragmentary Star Incantation into his Heaven Sparks and replenishing it with the energy balls.</span></p>
 <p><span>Before long, there were already about thirty balls of pure spiritual energy floating around him.</span></p>
 <p><span>Since he recovered his psychic power far faster than the other two young men and slightly faster than Su Lin from the Heaven Palace sect, the ancient symbols that he had obtained outnumbered all of them.</span></p>
 <p><span>In the end, the four of them together took all of the detailed, delicate patterns that stood out into their Heaven Sparks.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian’s gaze went wall to wall, searching for more patterns that he could interact with, but his search turned out fruitless.</span></p>
 <p><span>That was when he realized that all the ancient symbols that carried the first part of the Fragmentary Star Incantation were in the Heaven Sparks on their hands by now.</span></p>
 <p><span>The other three soon came to the same realization.</span></p>
 <p><span>At that moment, the black-robed young man from the Realm of Unbounded Desolation suddenly reached out his hand and pulled a long, strangely-shaped saber from his back. Smiling at Nie Tian, he said, “It’s time to do some reaping.”</span></p>
