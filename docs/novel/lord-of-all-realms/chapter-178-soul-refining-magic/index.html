 <p><span>All the Heaven Sparks rapidly merged with each other on the back of Nie Tian’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span>The numerous magical symbols in the Heaven Sparks also realigned, presenting the readable and complete first part of the Fragmentary Star Incantation.</span></p>
 <p><span>It wasn’t long before all the Heaven Sparks in Nie Tian’s Heaven Gate pattern merged and turned into a hexagram.</span></p>
 <p><span>The hexagram was located in the center of the Heaven Gate pattern, emanating a bright glow, within which lay all the realigned ancient symbols.</span></p>
 <p><span>With a thought, Nie Tian sent a wisp of his psychic awareness into the hexagram.</span></p>
 <p><span>He saw a large number of ancient symbols written neatly in the sky within the hexagram, almost like an unfurled bamboo scroll.</span></p>
 <p><span>Without any hesitation, he started to read it with his psychic power.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, it wasn’t very long before he had the feeling that he had over consumed his psychic power and had to retract his psychic awareness from the hexagram.</span></p>
 <p><span>Although he had retracted the psychic power that he had used to invade Su Lin’s mind before she was dragged out of the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace, he found that he had consumed a large portion of his psychic power reading the first part of the Fragmentary Star Incantation.</span></p>
 <p><span>With furrowed eyebrows, he looked towards the Heaven stage area and the Greater Heaven stage area to find that their fights were still going on.</span></p>
 <p><span>Only two people were still alive in the Heaven stage area. Both of them had wounds and blood all over their body. From the look of it, whoever the winner would be, he wouldn’t be in a much better situation than the defeated one.</span></p>
 <p><span>Further off in the Greater Heaven stage area, Tang Yang and another cultivator were still attacking the powerful expert from the Heaven Palace sect together.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Greater Heaven stage expert who Su Lin had referred to as her martial uncle looked somewhat tired after killing several of his enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, Tang Yang and the other cultivator seemed to be in much worse condition.</span></p>
 <p><span>From what Nie Tian could tell, the winner in the Greater Heaven stage area would probably be Su Lin’s martial uncle.</span></p>
 <p><span>“It seems I’d better forget about the final part of the Fragmentary Star Incantation.” Nie Tian muttered to himself as he retracted his gaze. “Perhaps, I’ll have a shot with the middle part.”</span></p>
 <p><span>With these thoughts, he decided that he wouldn’t read the rest of the first part of the incantation.</span></p>
 <p><span>In the Lesser Heaven stage area, where he was now the only person left, he once again used the technique that he had learned from the mysterious land to condense energy balls, and used the energy within them to replenish his spiritual and psychic power.</span></p>
 <p><span>In the meantime, he took out several large chunks of spirit beast meat from his bracelet of holding and wolfed them down, so as to restore his peak state within the least amount of time.</span></p>
 <p><span>He planned to wait for the right time and cross the seven-colored river into the Heaven stage area the moment one of them died.</span></p>
 <p><span>He believed that he would only have a chance to snatch the middle part of the incantation from a Heaven stage cultivator when he was still weak from killing his opponent.</span></p>
 <p><span>If the winner was given even a little time to recuperate with medicinal pills and the rich spiritual energy in the air, the chance of him getting the middle part of the incantation would be very slim.</span></p>
 <p><span>PHEW! PHEW!</span></p>
 <p><span>The intense spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth rapidly condensed into an energy ball as soon as Nie Tian cast the spell.</span></p>
 <p><span>Just as he was about to absorb the condensed spiritual energy within it into his spiritual sea and nourish his soul with it, he suddenly noticed something.</span></p>
 <p><span>Looking up, he saw that numerous rays of starlight were shooting out of the ceiling of the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was the same kind of light that had shone on the mysterious patterns on the palace walls and made them bright and dazzling.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, the Qi warriors with different cultivation bases in the three areas had already used their psychic power to channel all the mysterious patterns into their Heaven Sparks.</span></p>
 <p><span>Therefore, there wasn’t a single pattern left on the walls now.</span></p>
 <p><span>Upon a closer look, Nie Tian realized that the starlight that was shooting out of the mysterious river of stars was actually coming towards where he was standing.</span></p>
 <p><span>At that time, Nie Tian felt a bright light also shooting up from below. He looked down and saw the hexagram in his Heaven Gate shining like a star.</span></p>
 <p><span>It seemed that it was the hexagram that had attracted the starlight from out of the starry river and into Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was also at that moment that all the ancient symbols that Nie Tian had briefly swept through suddenly began to become clear, as if they were now deeply engraved in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span>Furthermore, he felt like he had an epiphany. Not only did all the ancient symbols start to make perfect sense to him, he even realized how to attract and receive the starlight that was pouring towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span>Under his guidance, the silver starlight converged into one light beam before it entered Nie Tian’s mind through the top of his head.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian silently examined himself and found that a tiny light dot had appeared in his soul and started to shine.</span></p>
 <p><span>With the infusion of more and more starlight from the starry river, the light dot in his soul grew brighter and brighter.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian’s body shuddered. “A fragmentary star?! A fragmentary star has fallen into my soul?! Is this a part of the Fragmentary Star Incantation?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Eyes glittering with the light of excitement, he was fairly certain that he had solved one of the profound mysteries of the Fragmentary Star Incantation.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Fragmentary Star Incantation was actually dedicated to tempering one’s psychic power. To be exact, it was a soul cultivating incantation.</span></p>
 <p><span>There were very few secret magics regarding cultivation of the soul in the nine realms of the Domain of the Falling Stars!</span></p>
 <p><span>Nie Tian found it hard to imagine that there was a mysterious soul-tempering incantation that could allow the starlight from the boundless starry river into one’s soul and appear in the form of a fragmentary star. Therefore he cherished it like it a priceless treasure!</span></p>
 <p><span>It was also at that moment Nie Tian finally understood why the Heaven Palace sect from the Realm of Mystic Heaven was so eager to obtain it.</span></p>
 <p><span>He had witnessed how powerful Su Lin and her martial uncle were, and they were only the ones that he had seen.</span></p>
 <p><span>He assumed that the Heaven Palace sect must have sent many more powerful experts into the Heaven Gate trial to assist Su Lin and her martial uncle in finishing their mission.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Fragmentary Star Incantation! Soul cultivating magic!” Nie Tian couldn’t suppress his excitement. </span></p>
 <p><span>From his fight with Wu Ling, he had realized that even though he possessed outstanding psychic power, he didn’t know how to wield it, and thus couldn’t turn it into actual battle prowess.</span></p>
 <p><span>The moment he had finished his battle with Wu Ling, he had decided to go to his master as soon as the Heaven Gate trial was over and learn some psychic magics from him.</span></p>
 <p><span>Never would he have thought that the psychic magic that he had longed for would present itself, now branded within the hexagram in his Heaven Gate pattern.</span></p>
 <p><span>He believed that as long as he continued to build up his psychic power and put his heart to studying the incantation, he would be able to unveil all the mysteries of the Fragmentary Star Incantation and put it to good use.</span></p>
 <p><span>More importantly, the Fragmentary Star Incantation was more about tempering one’s soul than psychic power.</span></p>
 <p><span>When he was strong enough, his psychic power would upgrade and become soul power. Only at that time would he be able to make the most out of the Fragmentary Star Incantation and display the true might of the incantation!</span></p>
 <p><span>He tried his best to calm himself and pull himself out of his reverie. Following the instructions of the incomparably clear symbols that were now engraved in his mind, he continued to take in the starlight.</span></p>
 <p><span>More and more starlight poured down from the heavens and converged onto the top of Nie Tian’s head, and from there it flowed into his soul.</span></p>
 <p><span>At the same time, he glanced around and noticed that he was the only one absorbing starlight from the starry river. Everyone in the other two areas was still fighting.</span></p>
 <p><span>He realized that only when someone had gathered all the Heaven Sparks from their opponents in the area and completed that part of the incantation, would they be able to receive the instructions of the Fragmentary Star Incantation, and thus attract the falling starlight.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I’ve got to make full use of this opportunity!”</span></p>
 <p><span>With these thoughts, he felt increasingly lucky and concentrated on using the secret magic that he had just learned to allow as much starlight as possible into his soul.</span></p>
 <p><span>He probed into his own soul and saw that, after a large amount of starlight had poured into it, the fragmentary star was rapidly growing brighter and larger.</span></p>
 <p><span>Only seconds had passed and the originally grain-sized star had already grown to the size of a thumb.</span></p>
 <p><span>Within the fragmentary star, Nie Tian could sense extremely strong psychic energy fluctuations. He had the feeling that the psychic power within the small star was far more powerful and profound than all of the psychic power in his soul. Furthermore, he believed that there were still many secrets within it that he would need time to solve.</span></p>
 <p><span>“The heavens must favor me!” he thought to himself.</span></p>
