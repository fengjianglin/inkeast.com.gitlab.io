<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the east of the Land of the Abandoned in the Realm of Split Void.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The entire region was covered in lush trees and plants that looked like a thick carpet of vegetation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This had originally been a dense forest. After the upheaval, poisonous energy had poured into the Realm of Split Void and killed most of the vegetation in the realm, completely changing the environment of the Realm of Split Void. However, a small proportion managed to survive the hostile environment. They mutated over time, and thrived in new forms.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After their mutation, the trees and plants had become taller, but also more dangerous.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Some of the plants had branches and leaves that were as sharp as blades, making them look very scary. If Qi warriors with low cultivation bases were to pass through this region, the plants would give them deep cuts all over.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Land of the Abandoned was under the Dark Moon’s governance. As one of the Dark Moon’s guest elders, Li Langfeng knew this region like the back of his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After arriving in the region, Nie Tian established the Wood Thriving Formation without hesitation. A hemispherical, dark-green ward instantly formed over his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the dark-green ward, numerous mysterious tree patterns could be seen swimming about like fish in the sea as they rapidly channeled wood power from the vicinity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The wood power in this region was far fainter than in the Floragrims’ ancestral land, where he had obtained the Wood Thriving Formation, or the island that he had recently come back from.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, in his senses, the wood power in this region was richer than in most realms in the Domain of the Falling Stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He thought about it, and suspected that this could be a result of the plants’ mutation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Without any delay, he started healing Li Langfeng’s festering wounds and eroded insides, and refining his whole body for him with Heavenly Wood Heal and the Wood Thriving Formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Since Li Langfeng’s internal damage had lasted for many years, it was harder to tackle than Nie Tian had imagined.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After moving to seven different locations to get fresh wood power from their surroundings, he had barely healed Li Langfeng’s most serious injuries. During the process, he had even consumed a significant amount of his own wood power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even so, what Nie Tian had healed amounted to only half of Li Langfeng’s injuries.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Two weeks later, Nie Tian stopped and withdrew his hands. Somewhat frustrated, he said, “Your injuries are much more serious than I had imagined. I’m afraid it’ll take a long time to heal them bit by bit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He seemed to be rather sorry that his current cultivation base didn’t allow him to heal Li Langfeng completely in one go.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, Li Langfeng seemed that he couldn’t be happier.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As he sensed Nie Tian withdrawing his hand, his eyes snapped open, blossoming with suffocating light. Like a serpent that had just come out of its hibernation, he licked the corner of his mouth, and smiled dangerously. “Good! This is already good enough! Now I can seek my next breakthrough with the help of that Fiend heart without worrying about dying during the process!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Before meeting Nie Tian, he had prepared himself for death during his breakthrough into the late Worldly realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After all, he knew his own condition better than anyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, now, after moving to seven different locations, Nie Tian had healed a large proportion of his old injuries and damage, much of which he had deemed permanent and irreversible.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Before, he had spent massively to get medicinal pills that could help nourish one’s fleshly body from the Dark Moon. However, none of them really helped.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Therefore, he had long since given up on finding cures for his condition. Who would have thought that the combination of Nie Tian’s Heavenly Wood Heal and the Wood Thriving Formation could have such miraculous effects?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His primary headache had been his eroded internal organs, but after Nie Tian’s unrelenting efforts, they were now fully healed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Now, he could finally seek his next breakthrough without worrying about dying in the process.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian nodded. “Yeah, I believe that you won’t have any life-threatening issues for now, but I suggest that you make proper use of that Fiend’s heart, and don’t strain yourself. Even I can’t tell what grade that Fiend was at when they were alive, so you’d better be very cautious when you extract its toxic essence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I understand,” Li Langfeng said, laughing broadly. “I’ll stay here and focus on my cultivation. I won’t go anywhere for now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Good,” Nie Tian said. Then after a moment of pondering, he added, “I’ve got things to take care of in Shatter City. If you need me, just come to Shatter City and find a person named Hu Rong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Li Langfeng nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian summoned his Golden Chariot and flew off towards Shatter City.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Great changes could take place in the Realm of Split Void at any moment. Perhaps the powerful outsiders had already made their way to the top continent and discovered the few spatial rifts leading to the Domain of the Falling Stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meanwhile, he wondered how the battle between Hua Mu and the sectmaster of the Spirit God Sect was going.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He also wanted to know what the major sects’ reaction would be now that their chosen ones had returned to their sects with word of what had happened in that dimension.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Golden Chariot sailed through the air at a very high speed, and eventually landed outside Shatter City.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had passed regions that should have been roamed by hunters on his way to Shatter City, yet he didn’t see a single hunter.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had even unleashed his Heaven Eyes and used them to scan his surroundings, but still failed to detect any signs of human Qi warriors along his way.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He wondered where those hunters had gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as he stepped through the city gate, he discovered that there were only a handful of people in the streets, completely different from how he remembered the city to be. It seemed that many of the fierce-looking outlaws that had lived in the city for years had left.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Now, most of the pedestrians he saw were at the Heaven stage, with very few Greater Heaven stage cultivators.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He walked straight to the courtyard where Pei Qiqi lived.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Standing before the gate, he instantly had a feeling that numerous wisps of soul awareness had flown over to examine him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">KREEEN!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The wooden gate opened by itself, and Nie Tian strode into the yard. He instantly saw that a few familiar people were standing in the middle of the yard.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They were Zhen Huilan, Pei Qiqi, Hu Rong from the Spirit Condor, Cai Lan, the head of the Blood Skull, and a few Worldly realm members of the Blood Skull. Many of them seemed very surprised to see him, while some didn’t seem to know who he was.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhen Huilan looked ghastly, though a hint of a smile appeared at the corner of her mouth as she saw Nie Tian walk in. Then she turned to the others and said, “Some of you might recognize him, but you probably don’t know who he really is. Allow me to introduce Nie Tian, also known as Hua Tian, the only successor of the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace in the Domain of the Falling Stars.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Cai Lan’s expression flickered as he exclaimed, “It’s you?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Hu Rong, who had long since learned about his true identity, nodded, smiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian was very surprised that Zhen Huilan would reveal his true identity. Before entering that other dimension, Zhen Huilan had even given him a special mask to prevent others from recognizing him, especially people from the Flame God Sect and the Heaven Palace Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, her actions now confused him deeply.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhen Huilan saw through his confusion, and thus explained, “Times are different. Knowing that a joint outsider army is going to march into the Domain of the Falling Stars, none of the sects are in the mood to start strife among ourselves now. Not to mention that you have the Yin Sect and the Yang Sect at your back. The five forces from the Realm of a Hundred Battles, the Ice Pavilion Sect, and the Spirit Condor will also be happy to shelter you. I’m certain that the Flame God Sect and the Heaven Palace Sect won’t seek trouble with you at such a time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian went blank for a moment before asking, “What’s the situation now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhen Huilan then briefly explained the situation in the Realm of Split Void and the overall situation of the Domain of the Falling Stars to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Thanks to the return of the chosen ones, all the major sects gained a thorough understanding about what had happened in that mysterious heaven and earth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Now everyone was aware that outsiders would invade the Domain of the Falling Stars before long.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The reason why the hunters had all evacuated the Realm of Split Void was because they had learned that the Realm of Split Void might become the main battlefield once the outsider army arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meanwhile, since all the teleportation portals in the Realm of Split Void had recently opened to the public, hunters or normal citizens, everyone was free to leave the Realm of Split Void, just as others were free to come.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As a result, about eighty percent of the Qi warriors that had lived in the Realm of Split Void had chosen to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Furthermore, since the entire Domain of the Falling Stars was facing an outsider invasion, the Heaven Palace Sect and a few other powerful sects had stepped up and stopped the conflicts in the Realm of Dark Underworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Through intermediation, Wu Langxie had withdrawn from the Flame God Sect, and Hua Mu had ended his battle with the sectmaster of the Spirit God Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Each and every major sect in the Domain of the Falling Stars was dispatching their powerful experts to the Realm of Split Void, where they were preparing for engagement with the outsiders.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Can’t you seal those few spatial rifts, Master Zhen?” Nie Tian asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing these words, everyone present smiled bitterly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhen Huilan let out a frustrated sigh and shook her head. “I tried, and so did Wu Ya, a spatial power expert from the Heaven Palace Sect, as well as a few other top spatial power experts. As it turns out, there’s very little we can do. Those spatial rifts are extremely complicated, and ever-changing. None of us were able to seal them.”</span></p>

 <p>In the Qin Dynasty (221-207 BC), there was a young man who liked to talk big. One day he got a rotten steel rod and told people that it was a sword he got from an immortal living in Nanshan Mountain, and named it Chi Xiao. He carried his “sword” wherever he went. He also boasted that he was the incarnation of a red dragon from Heaven, and that he had known Emperor Qin, who, according to him, was the incarnation of a white dragon. He even said that the incarnation of the Emperor had turned from a white dragon into a white snake wandering around Feng Xize, claiming that he, with more spiritual power now than the Emperor Qin, would replace him as the emperor.</p>
 <p>People all around assumed that he was a braggart and did not believe his nonsense. However, people’s distrust changed after what happened one night. On that night, a few dozen young people, including the braggart, carrying his sword, went to the town of Feng Xize to find work. On the way there, they came across a huge white snake. Terrified by it, no one dared to move. It was the braggart, who volunteered to kill the snake, chased it into the woods. The others waited for him to return, but he did not come back that night. Finally, they returned home, believing that he had become the supper of the snake.</p>
 <p>The next day, people found that the snake had been cut in half, and the young man was sleeping next to it. His rotten steel rod had been replaced by a glittering sword, with two characters on it reading: “Chi Xiao.” Astounded by this scene, people realized that what the braggart said was all true. The young man's name was Liu Bang, who later defeated Emperor Qin and founded the Han Dynasty. The sword Chi Xiao was the one he used to kill the snake and lead battles in his revolution against the emperor. Hence, the white dragon was replaced by the red dragon, and Chi Xiao became known as a sword of majesty.</p>
