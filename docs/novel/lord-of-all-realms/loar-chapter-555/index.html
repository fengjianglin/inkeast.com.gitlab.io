<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In a split second, the nine fragmentary stars in Nie Tian’s soul blossomed with blindingly bright light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as the light of the floating fragmentary stars shone upon his sea of awareness, all dizziness and discomfort were eliminated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His stirred soul was instantly soothed, and he recovered a clear mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“What the-?!" Armes gasped, shock appearing in his eyes.&nbsp;</span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic">“I thought humans at the Greater Heaven stage wouldn’t have developed their soul power yet. Was I mistaken?!”</span></em></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He seemed to be rather familiar with human cultivation, and thus had expected that Nie Tian wouldn’t be able to withstand his soul attack, and would fall into bewilderment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The fact that Nie Tian had so effortlessly neutralized his soul magic took him by surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, Nie Tian realized that the pieces of broken armor wreathed in a misty, cyan aura were already rather close to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a cold snort, he cast a short-range Starshift, and suddenly appeared before Armes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dragging a tail of blazing flames, the Flame Star in his hand slashed down with the crushing momentum of thunder.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At the same time, his chaotic magnetic field instantly enveloped Armes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">But what surprised Nie Tian was that Armes didn’t seem to experience any discomfort. He only frowned slightly, and nothing more than a minor stir seemed to occur in his soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In his experience, when his previous opponents had been enveloped by his chaotic magnetic field, their spiritual seas would have been thrown into disorder, and their souls would have been distorted, causing great pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, this Phantasm stood unwavering in his chaotic magnetic field, as if nothing had happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">CLANK!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As Armes raised his hand, his fingers suddenly became as translucent as jade. Wisps of cyan aura flowed within his jade-like fingers. All of a suddenly, the Phantasm’s unique, terrifying power burst forth from those fingers, with which he effortlessly stopped the Flame Star’s crushing momentum.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Glorious sparks sputtered from the contact point, as if the Flame Star had hacked onto a piece of solid iron.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Before Nie Tian could unleash the various powers he had vested the Flame Star with, they were scattered by the cyan aura that exploded out of Armes’ fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a low chuckle, fine cyan lightning could be seen swimming in the depths of Armes’ unfathomable eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">FIZZ! FIZZ!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Armes splayed his other hand and pressed it towards Nie Tian’s unprotected chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As he did, a cluster of cyan light was quickly born within his palm, which then suddenly exploded, creating a storm of countless fine cyan lightning bolts that instantly engulfed Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Each and every bolt of cyan lightning contained shocking amounts of flesh power, as well as Armes’ profound soul power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Aching and sore all over, Nie Tian felt as if he had been caught in a electric net. Even his inner spiritual power flow was slowed down, holding him back from unleashing powerful counterattacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Armes shoved his palm into Nie Tian’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Feeling as if he had been hit by a mountain of steel, Nie Tian was thrown into the air, and fell with a loud crash.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As he struggled to assume a firm foothold, he could still see cyan lightning bolts slithering all over him. Formed with copious flesh and soul power, they were madly drilling into his flesh in an attempt to destroy his meridians and bones.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Cracks appeared in several of his ribs after he took Armes’ violent palm strike.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a thought, he cast Heavenly Wood Heal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Refined wood power was instantly summoned out of his spiritual sea, which morphed into bright sparks of life force and infused into his damaged ribs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Simultaneously, his heart started pounding violently. The blood it pumped into his veins made it seem as if it were seething.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Like an erupting volcano, his raging flesh power wiped out all of the cyan lightning from Armes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In no more than a few seconds’ time, every last bit of Armes’ flesh power and soul power was washed away from Nie Tian’s body, like smoke blown away by a severe gale.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Confusion and shock filled Armes’s eyes that looked like a pair of cyan gems. “You… I can’t believe you survived my attack! Are you not human? Why do you possess such strong flesh power?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, he dashed over, wreathed in cyan light shields.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though he was only at the fourth grade, he was much faster than spirit beasts at his grade.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He practically teleported to Nie Tian’s face. Within arm’s reach from him, Nie Tian couldn’t possible display the might of his Flame Star, which was about two meters long.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Therefore, he quickly put his Flame Star away in his ring of holding, and started fighting Armes with punches and kicks at this very limited distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BANG! BANG! BANG!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Every time their fists and feet clashed, it gave rise to thunderous sounds, as if two gigantic beasts were charging into each other and trying to tear each other to bits.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Armes’ battle prowess was surprisingly high. At first, Nie Tian could only struggle to defend himself against Armes’ storming attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Armes’s punches and kicks were so fast that they dazzled Nie Tian’s eyes. He even felt that the speed at which his spiritual power circulated wasn’t fast enough to support his defensive efforts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, in contrast, his rich flesh power that was now scattered in every bone and muscle all over him could flow very rapidly to any part he wanted it to.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The defensive shield he formed with his spiritual power was easily smashed by Armes’ deluge of attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BANG BANG BANG!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Armes’ attacks with his fists, palms, elbows, knees, and feet were all as swift as lightning.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian felt as if he were being attacked by a dozen fierce beasts in a variety of ways at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As he defended against these moves, and with every clash, the flesh power he had absorbed from the outsiders earlier was rapidly being drained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Soon, his spiritual power failed to support such intense and high frequency exchanges, and thus he could only keep fighting with his flesh power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His whole life, he had had great confidence in his ability to fight with his bare hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Almost all of the opponents he had come across growing up had greatly relied on their exquisite spiritual tools or all sorts of spiritual incantations.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This had given him a great advantage when they had to fight with bare hands. Thanks to his exceptionally tough body, he had won almost every time when it had come to that.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, this Phantasm named Armes was nothing like the other opponents he had encountered before. The vigor of his flesh power was something he had never seen before.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">According to his master, Wu Ji, Phantasms weren’t even the outsiders that possessed the strongest fleshly bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, the terrifying close-up battle skills Armes displayed shocked Nie Tian deeply.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the fight went on and his heart pounded more and more violently, his veins were about to explode with seething flesh power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Having defended passively for so long, his heart was now brimming with rage. At this moment, he suddenly summoned his burning rage and formed a Rage Punch along with his flesh power and all sorts of spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With this punch that contained one third of his overall strength, he met Armes’ incoming attack with his splayed, translucent palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BOOM!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon contact, Armes, who had been attacking actively this whole time, coughed up a mouthful of blood and staggered a few steps backwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The wounds that had closed up and healed to a great extent once again burst open, blood spilling from them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A shocked look once again appeared in Armes’ eyes as he exclaimed, “Who are you exactly?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After unleashing the Rage Punch, Nie Tian still hadn’t recovered from his mental state, and was still panting with rage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At that moment, when he finally had the opportunity to catch his breath, he saw through his Heaven Eyes that more and more Birdmen were flying towards his location.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian took a deep look at Armes and said, “I’ve told you. I’m from the Domain of the Falling Stars.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">SHEW!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His voice still lingered, but he was already nowhere to be seen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a grim look in his eyes, Armes was just about to put on a new suit of armor and really get into the fight with Nie Tian when he realized that Nie Tian had vanished into thin air right before his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He looked into the air and saw the incoming Birdmen, and thus thundered, “Get the hell away! Don’t you dare interrupt my battle with him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The prismatic crystal between his eyebrows thrummed with ripples of invisible soul fluctuations as he started to scan the vicinity for signs of Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I’m gonna kill that human kid named Nie Tian by myself. Stay out of my way!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing his angry roars, all of the Birdmen that had rushed to this place kept their distance from him, as if they were intimidated by his strength and status.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With the help of the Phantasm’s special soul magics and his profound bloodline talent, he quickly determined the direction Nie Tian had left in, and then sped away in that direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Cowed by his warnings, the Birdmen could only remain in place and watch him disappear into the distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Moments later, Abreu arrived with Tago and other Phantasms and high-tier Demons.</span></p>

I don't know if I'll be able to match my former releasing rate, but I'll do my best. At the same time, I'll continue to bring contents about Chinese language and culture that I reckon interesting and worth reading. So hopefully, you'll continue to like and support this novel.&nbsp;</p>

 <p><span>About red envelopes, they are gifts presented at social and family gatherings such as weddings, holidays such as Chinese New Year, or other happy occasions. The red color of the envelope symbolizes good luck and is a symbol to ward off evil spirits.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>The amount of money contained in the envelope usually ends with an even digit, in accordance with Chinese beliefs. The number 6 is frequently used, which has the meaning of success and well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>At wedding banquets, the amount offered is usually intended to cover the cost of the attendees as well as signify goodwill to the newlyweds. Amounts given are often recorded in ceremonial ledgers for the new couple to keep.</span></p>
 <p><span>During the Chinese New Year, in Southern China, red envelopes are typically given by the married to the unmarried, most of whom are children. In northern China, red envelopes are typically given by the elders to the younger under 25 (30 in most of the three northeastern provinces), regardless of marital status, while in some regions red envelopes are only given to the young people without jobs. The amount of money is usually notes to avoid heavy coins and to make it difficult to judge the amount inside before opening. It is traditional to put brand new notes inside red envelopes and also to avoid opening the envelopes in front of the relatives out of courtesy.</span></p>
 <p><span>It is also given during the Chinese New Year in workplace from a person of authority (supervisors or owner of the business) out of his own fund to employees as a token of good fortune for the upcoming year. (RWX gave us red envelops during Thailand trip, hahaha.)</span></p>
