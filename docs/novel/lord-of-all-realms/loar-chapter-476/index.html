 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian looked up and noticed Pei Qiqi, who was standing by the window and looking down at them with an expressionless face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He nodded briefly at her as Dong Li forcibly dragged him towards the end of the street.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Only a few Qi warriors could be seen strolling about in the lonesome street. Most of them were at the Greater Heaven stage or the Worldly realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Those who dared to stay in Desolate City after word of Zhao Shanling’s return had spread possessed either extraordinary cultivation bases or powerful backgrounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li dragged Nie Tian to the end of the street and entered a rough, small restaurant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She led Nie Tian directly up to a room on the second floor. As she pushed the door open, he saw Dong Baijie sitting by a table in an unconstrained fashion, drinking by himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon seeing him, Dong Baijie rose to his feet and said with a smile on his face, “We meet again, Nie Tian.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The window to the street was shut. Plates of snacks and fruits filled the table, along with a half bottle of wine.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian realized that Dong Li had already let go of him, as if she wanted to keep a distance from him in front of her elder brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Surprised, Nie Tian asked, “How come you’re also here in the Realm of Unbounded Desolation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li sat by her brother’s side, while Nie Tian sat across the table from him. As soon as he sat down, Dong Baijie poured a cup of alcohol for him and answered with a broad laugh, “I’m here for Little Li.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Cheers!” Dong Baijie raised his cup and emptied it. Then, with a sincere expression, he said, “This shows my respect for you. Thank you for helping Little Li in the Realm of Dark Underworld and bringing her such a great fortune in the Realm of Unbounded Desolation. I knew you were no ordinary person!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had met with Dong Li soon after he had come to Desolate City with the other Dong Clan members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Afterwards, he had a private meeting with Dong Li to ask about her recent experiences.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li had never kept secrets from her older brother, who loved her dearly. Therefore, she had told him about what she and Nie Tian had been through in the Realm of Dark Underworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She had even told him about them coming to the Realm of Unbounded Desolation to gather earthflame essence for Nie Tian’s Flame Dragon Armor, along with them finding that magical place, obtaining Fruits of Life, and Nie Tian letting her take the credit for finding Zhao Shanling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Baijie had been flabbergasted by their experiences. Meanwhile, he had an increasingly strong feeling that he had made the right decision by befriending Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, since even Dong Li herself didn’t understand how Nie Tian had been able to find the entrance to that magical place or locate Zhao Shanling, she had left out some of the details.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Therefore, Dong Baijie had attributed all of Nie Tian’s incredible abilities to his three fragmentary star marks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The fact that Dong Li had helped the Tool Sect find Zhao Shanling, thus ending the turmoil in the Realm of Unbounded Desolation, had already put the Tool Sect in the Dong Clan’s debt. Not only had Dong Li received wide attention, but her status in the Dong Clan had also risen significantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That was before she revealed the fact that she had obtained a Fruit of Life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After she returned to the Dong Clan and gave that Fruit of Life to their patriarch, her status in the Dong Clan would probably see another boost.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She had only gained such great fortunes because she had come to the Realm of the Unbounded Desolation with Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meanwhile, Dong Baijie could tell that, after their trips to the Realm of Dark Underworld and the Realm of Unbounded Desolation, Dong Li no longer gnashed her teeth and stomped with fury when she talked about Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">On the contrary, he noticed that, when she talked about their exciting encounters together now, she tended to beam with joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">When he made jokes about her and Nie Tian, she would tell him to cut it out, yet her face was always full of smiles.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Bottoms up!” Nie Tian chugged his cup of alcohol and then asked, “Well... did people in your clan ask about the thing I obtained from the Phantasms in the Realm of Dark Underworld?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Stop.” Dong Baijie interrupted him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian stopped and looked at him, his face filled with confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">During their secret meeting before he had gone to the Realm of Dark Underworld with Dong Li, Dong Baijie had told him not to worry, and that Dong Mingxuan would keep an eye on Dong Li and stop her if she crossed the line.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That meant Dong Mingxuan knew about his actual identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He thought Dong Li might have told people in her clan about his acquisition of the Spirit Pearl. He had gone on that trip to the Realm of Dark Underworld with powerful members of every major power in the Realm of a Hundred Battles. All the others had gained nothing, while he had ended up obtaining the Spirit Pearl. He had wondered how he should explain it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Baijie assumed a serious expression. “The truth is that I didn’t tell Uncle Mingxuan or anyone about your identity. No one knows what you’ve obtained in the Realm of Dark Underworld. Even if your identity was exposed and people learned that you went to the Realm of Dark Underworld under the name Wu Tian, you’ve got to insist that you obtained nothing, and that the thing that chased you somehow flew away on its own.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A surprised expression spread across Nie Tian’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A faint smile appeared on Dong Baijie’s face as he continued, “You’ve already done enough by bringing Little Li such great fortunes. Also, I don’t care what the other clans in the Realm of a Hundred Battles want.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian was surprised that not only would Dong Baijie not demand the Spirit Pearl from him, but he would also help him keep it a secret.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Li rolled her eyes at him. “Don’t worry. No one’s ever seen you with it anyways. As long as you deny having it and I don’t tell people you do, things will be fine.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a pause, she added, “Sectmaster Li and the others from the Blood Sect returned to Desolate City before you did. I took the liberty of telling them that you still had important business to attend to, and you had already left Desolate City. They left for the Realm of Flame Heaven after hearing that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian nodded. “Oh, I see.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Seeing the puzzled expression on Nie Tian’s face, Dong Li explained, “We received word that the Heaven Palace Sect and the Flame God Sect are still looking for you. Not many people know about you coming to the Realm of Unbounded Desolation. It’d safer for you and the Blood Sect if you don’t spend too much time with people from the Blood Sect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Baijie nodded slightly. “You stayed at Li Ye and Pei Qiqi’s. You must have heard about the changes in the Realm of Split Void. Do you want to go on an exploration trip with us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Anticipation also filled Dong Li’s face as she said, “It won’t be long before the word of what happened in the Realm of Split Void spreads to every corner of the Domain of the Falling Stars. By that time, every major sect will send people there. Our clan is already making arrangements and preparations. You’ll be safe if you go with us. What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Well...” Nie Tian pondered in silence for a few seconds. “I’ll be there in the Realm of Split Void. Perhaps I’ll also enter those spatial rifts. But I’ve already promised someone that I’ll go with Master Zhen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“You promised Pei Qiqi, did you?” Dong Li asked with a cold snort.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Not her,” Nie Tian explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Baijie didn’t dwell on it. “Alright. Since we’re going to the same destination, I suppose it doesn’t really matter if we enter those spatial rifts together. Perhaps we’ll meet on the other side. We might be able to work with each other then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, he handed a Sound Stone to Nie Tian and said, “Keep this Sound Stone on you. After we enter the dimension inside those spatial rifts, as long as we’re within 250 kilometers of each other, we’ll be able to communicate through it. There are only three of them. You, Little Li, and I each will hold one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Okay." Nie Tian accepted the Sound Stone and put it away in his bracelet of holding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Keep in mind that the Void Illusion Mountain Range will soon become the target of every major sect in the Domain of the Falling Stars, so be careful,” Dong Baijie reminded him solemnly. “You’d better not reveal your identity to anyone, lest the Heaven Palace Sect or the Flame God Sect get to you. As powerful and lofty as Master Zhen is, she won’t necessarily be able to shelter you. You’d better act with discretion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Thanks, I got it.” Nie Tian nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Come on,” Dong Baijie said with a broad laugh, raising his wine cup. “Enough about trivial matters. Drink up!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Smiling brightly, Dong Li also rolled up her sleeves, raised her wine cup, and started drinking with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Dong Baijie and Dong Li brought out quite a few drinking games. As Nie Tian chugged down one cup of hard alcohol after another, his clear eyes gradually grew sleepy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon seeing that, Dong Baijie proposed to end the drinking party and saw Nie Tian out of the restaurant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After bidding farewell to Dong Baijie, Nie Tian briefly circulated his internal power, and the smell of alcohol on him rapidly dissipated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Soon, he returned to the stone pavilion where Pei Qiqi and Li Ye lived.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon entering the front gate, he saw Zhen Huilan sitting in the hall. Li Ye and Pei Qiqi were standing beside her. The three of them were talking and laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The moment Zhen Huilan saw him, she recognized him and said, looking surprised, “It’s you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">An embarrassed smile appeared on Nie Tian’s face as he bowed respectfully towards her and said, “Greetings, Senior Zhen. Sorry for not informing you earlier of my...” He realized that Zhen Huilan must have found out about his identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhen Huilan waved her hand. “That’s alright.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Eyebrows furrowed, she asked, “How did you end up with that girl from the Dong Clan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Girl from the Dong Clan?” Pei Qiqi went blank briefly before suddenly coming to a realization. “That woman you were with was Dong Li from the Dong Clan?! The same woman who organized her Fang members to chase after you outside Shatter City?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“You know that she’s Song Li?” Nie Tian was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Master just told me.” Pei Qiqi’s face turned ice-cold. “If you know who she was, why were you so intimate with her? How open-minded of you! Have you forgotten all about what she’s done?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian felt increasingly embarrassed. “Umm... It’s quite complicated. It’ll take forever to explain.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhen Huilan looked deeply at him. After a moment of silence, she said, “Forget about that. We set out for Shatter City now. You just remember to handle your relationship with her properly. That girl is full of vicious tricks. She did whatever she liked and took quite a few lives in the Realm of Split Void. I suggest you keep your distance so that you don’t get yourself killed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian nodded obediently.</span></p>
