 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yin Yanan’s air-transportation spiritual tool suddenly came to a stop.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Separated from each other by a few hundred meters, Nie Tian’s group and the young Phantasm stared at each other. With a mysterious smile on his face, the Phantasm youngster didn’t seem eager to launch any attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The illusory skull, which was formed by countless discarnate souls, floated slowly about, collecting the agonizing souls of those who had recently died.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The top of the short mountain peak was almost smooth enough to be used as a mirror. Nie Tian examined it with rapt attention, and discovered that it wasn’t rocks that were revealed by the cut, but some kind of crystal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The crystal seemed to have been hidden within the heart of the mountain peak before it had been cut in the middle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Under the dazzling starlight, the crystal, whose size was unknown, suddenly unleashed misty light, as if to channel something to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Eyes narrowed, Nie Tian examined his surroundings with rapt attention, and discovered that the Phantasm Qi in the vicinity was being channeled and slowly infusing into the crystal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Eyebrows furrowed, Yin Yanan said, “That’s a sixth grade Phantasm. I have a feeling that he’ll be very hard to handle, but what worries me the most is that skull made of discarnate souls. Even though I don’t know exactly what it is, my Frost Blood Python seems to be rather apprehensive about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">While she spoke, Nie Tian saw the tattoo-like Frost Blood Python pattern gradually grow distinct on her slender waist.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">By the time the Frost Blood Python pattern fully revealed itself, Nie Tian instantly felt the intensity of her flesh aura start to skyrocket.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">SSSS! SSSS!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the next moment, the Frost Blood Python slithered out of her waist that was devoid of any fat, and morphed into its solid form. Then, it actually coiled around her waist.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A flesh aura that was unique to eighth grade spirit beasts instantly burst forth from within it, making even Nie Tian sense great pressure from it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“The eighth grade, finally,” Nie Tian marveled weakly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though it had just advanced to the eighth grade, it now possessed the battle prowess of a Void domain human expert.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Now that this Frost Blood Python had advanced to the eighth grade, Nie Tian’s Bone Blood Demon wouldn’t have any advantage facing it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Bone Blood Demon had been at the eighth grade when it had been alive, but now, after being turned into a blood puppet, it could only display the battle prowess of a seventh grade Bonebrute.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The smile soon faded from the Phantasm youngster’s face as he saw the Frost Blood Python slowly uncoil from Yin Yanan’s waist to slither on the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As he gazed at the Frost Blood Python from afar, the prismatic crystal between his eyebrows suddenly lit up, and the skull made of discarnate souls stopped collecting souls, but instead floated over his head motionlessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Only then did he seem somewhat secure and relaxed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Very vigilant, the youngster said in perfect human language, “This is a phantasm crystal that I’m standing on. It’s useless for you humans.” Then, pointing in a direction, he added, “You’d better go there. There are spiritual materials that suit you humans there. I know your spirit beast is at the eighth grade, but neither of us will benefit if we’re to engage in a fierce battle. I suggest we make peace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yin Yanan closed her eyes and stroked the Frost Blood Python’s head gently to communicate with it in private.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">From the Frost Blood Python, she learned that the skull made of countless discarnate souls was extremely strange and evil.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even the eighth grade Frost Blood Python didn’t have complete confidence to beat it in battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Did you kill all these people?” Nie Tian asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Phantasm youngster nodded slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian’s eyes widened with shock. “Including the outsiders?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Aside from humans, there were also Stonemen, Birdmen, Blackscales, and Demons among the corpses scattered in the vicinity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had had a few encounters with outsiders. Every time, the Phantasms had fought side by side with Demons, Fiends, and other outsiders, so he had thought they were allies.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Who would have thought this Phantasm youngster had actually killed other outsiders too?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The handsome youngster fixed Nie Tian with a puzzled look. “Yeah… Is this your first time in the Shatter Battlefield?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Yes, it is,” Yin Yanan answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">An enlightened expression appeared on the youngster’s face as he said, “No wonder. There are no rules in the Shatter Battlefield. People kill even their own kind in here, not to mention that they weren’t my kind. I won’t hesitate to kill anyone who wants to take this phantasm crystal from me, even other Phantasms.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Hey, speaking of which, you humans are actually more extreme than us.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“The fights you have among yourselves are even more fierce and regardless of any rules. So I advise you to be more careful when you run into your kind in here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, he sat down and closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, the enormous skull over his head fixed its dark, hollow eyes on Nie Tian and the girls.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The three of them would feel light-headed whenever they looked at that skull, as if they were going to lose control of their own souls.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yin Yanan communicated briefly with her eighth grade Frost Blood Python before turning to Nie Tian and saying, “This Phantasm won’t be easy to handle, and that phantasm crystal is indeed of no use to us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian pondered briefly and said, “Alright, do what you think is right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, without asking for Mu Biqiong’s opinion, Yin Yanan once again started her air-transportation spiritual tool.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The air-transportation spiritual tool turned and left in the direction the youngster had pointed out for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As they flew away, Yin Yanan said in a low voice, “Outsiders’ lifespans are much longer than ours. As young as that Phantasm looked, he might very well be more than a hundred years old. He might be very young among his kind, but he must be more seasoned than us three.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Mu Biqiong frowned. “So even just the outermost ring of the Shatter Battlefield isn’t as safe as we thought.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian shared her view.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had thought that they would be able to crush any opponent they might encounter in the outermost ring of the Shatter Battlefield with the help of his Bone Blood Demon and Yin Yanan’s Frost Blood Python.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Who would have thought the first opponent they encountered turned out to be so powerful?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With the help of that strange skull, that Phantasm youngster had single-handedly killed hundreds of opponents, and most of the humans he had killed had been at the Worldly and Profound realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This proved that his actual battle prowess had actually far exceeded the sixth grade.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even the eighth grade Frost Blood Python had been rather apprehensive of that skull of his, which proved how formidable it was.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As their air-transportation spiritual tool flew farther and farther away, the Phantasm youngster reopened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The skull moved out again to collect the discarnate souls that hadn’t dissipated into heaven and earth. As it did, its strength seemed to be building up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Eyes narrowed, the youngster gazed in the direction Nie Tian and the girls had disappeared in, and chuckled weakly. “An eighth grade spirit beast, and it’s a hybrid… I can’t believe they actually went there. This is going to be interesting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, he slowly closed his eyes again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Soon, sharp cries echoed out from ahead, along with loud clashes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing them, Yin Yanan accelerated her air-transportation spiritual tool.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Moments later, four lofty, silver mountain peaks that were about three thousand meters high entered Nie Tian’s view.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Bathed in starlight, the four mountain peaks glittered with silver light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Wreathing each of the mountain peaks seemed to be many silver rings, from which came ear-piercing humming sounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nearly a hundred figures could be seen yelling and brandishing their weapons within those silver rings, all of them enveloped in their own spiritual power wards.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian looked over with rapt attention, and discovered that the silver rings that wreathed the four mountain peaks were in fact formed by countless silver bugs, and it was the light that bounced off their shiny exteriors that formed the ‘silver rings’.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yin Yanan stopped her air-transportation spiritual tool when they were still a significant distance from the mountain peaks. Her expression grew grim as she exclaimed, “Silver Beetles!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She also discovered that the four mountain peaks were actually riddled with bug holes, which made them look like four enormous beehives.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, more silver bugs were still flying out of those holes and joining the battle against the humans, who were clearly from the same sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Is that Silver Beetle also a kind of insect from the Desolate Antiquity Era?” Nie Tian asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yin Yanan nodded. “Like Bone-devouring Leeches and Metal-devouring Bugs, Silver Beetles are also from the Desolate Antiquity Era. Even though they’re not as powerful as Bone-devouring Leeches or Metal-devouring Bugs, they have the advantage of numbers. Back in the Desolate Antiquity Era, Ancientspirits used to fight outsider races in the Shatter Battlefield, so it’s not surprising that there are still Silver Beetles here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“That Phantasm youngster didn’t set us up by telling us to come here for spiritual materials that we would need, did he?” Mu Biqiong asked, growing alert.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian frowned. “That’s actually quite likely.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He unleashed his Heaven Eyes and observed the human Qi warriors from afar.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He discovered that those people dressed in the same garments were either fighting the Silver Beetles that filled the sky, gathering dead Silver Beetles, or capturing Silver Beetles alive with large nets.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Others were unleashing dark brown smoke against Silver Beetles. As some Silver Beetles were engulfed in the smoke, they would sway in the air and fall to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All of them seemed to have their own job. Some were fighting, while others were collecting.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meanwhile, about a dozen dead humans could be seen at the foot of the mountain peaks, who seemed to have been killed by the Silver Beetles, as all of their flesh had been gnawed away, leaving nothing but pale-white bones.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yin Yanan from the Beast-controlling Sect observed for a while before saying in a low voice, “They’re from the Heavenly Witchcraft Sect in the Domain of Heavenly Witchcraft. Like the Divine Seal Sect, the Heavenly Witchcraft Sect also has Saint domain experts. The reason why their domain is named the Domain of Heavenly Witchcraft is because no sect throughout the entire domain can match the Heavenly Witchcraft Sect’s strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I only know about them because the incantations they practice are similar to ours.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“They like to capture insects from the Desolate Antiquity Era and use them to improve their battle prowess.

 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, she seemed to notice Nie Tian and the girls’ arrival. She turned around and shot them a glance from afar.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">WHOOSH!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the next moment, she flew over by herself while calling, “We’re from the Domain of Heavenly Witchcraft. I’m Fang Yingying from the Heavenly Witchcraft Sect. Where are you from?”</span></p>
