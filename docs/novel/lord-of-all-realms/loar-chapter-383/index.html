<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">One of the guards, Kong Hong from the Yang Sect, solemnly expressed his gratitude towards Nie Tian. “Nie Tian, we’ll forever remember what you’ve done for the Realm of a Thousand Devastations!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The two members of the Yin Sect who had stayed and guarded him were both female, one enchantingly gorgeous, and the other charming in an elegant way.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Tunic-clad, they were both smiling heartily as they nodded gently towards Nie Tian, brilliant light flowing within their charming eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Since I was blessed with the legacies of the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace during the Heaven Gate trial, it was my responsibility to seal the spatial rifts while facing the Demons’ massive invasion,” Nie Tian said modestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a brief pause, he sighed softly and added, a hint of bitterness appearing at the corner of his mouth, “If people from the Realm of Flame Heaven shared the same thoughts as you, I would have felt more comforted.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Since he had come from the Realm of Flame Heaven, after he had come out from the Heaven Gate trial, he had exerted all his efforts to help the Blood Sect, Ghost Sect, and other sects defend against the Demons.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In order to do that, he had even awakened the Blood Sect’s Bone Blood Demon with his pure bloodline power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had thought that, considering he had done so much for the Realm of Flame Heaven, when he had been in hiding, the sects in the Realm of Flame Heaven would have remembered all that and taken good care of his family.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, when he had returned to the Realm of Flame Heaven, he had found out that his grandfather and aunt had been forced to take shelter in the Realm of a Hundred Battles because many people in the Cloudsoaring Sect had detested them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">What he had witnessed and heard about himself in Black Cloud City had also been mostly negative.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Due to the speedy spread of the demon Qi, people had been submerged in a desperate atmosphere, and thus made him their vent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Many people even blamed him for the calamity that had devastated the Realm of Flame Heaven.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His experience in the Realm of Flame Heaven had deeply disheartened him. He even had even once lost hope in people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, he had never imagined that people from the Realm of a Thousand Devastations, who he had absolutely no connection with, would risk their own lives to protect him while he was activating the spell formation left by the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Yin Sect and the Yang Sect, who had never been fond of each other, had no divergence of opinion when it came to protecting him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the Realm of a Thousand Devastations, Nie Tian felt a long-lost warmth in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“The Realm of Flame Heaven?” Fan Shanshan from the Yin Sect asked curiously, her slender eyebrows furrowed. “Don’t tell me that people in the Realm of Flame Heaven treated you differently. If it weren’t for you, the spatial rift in the Realm of Flame Heaven wouldn’t have been sealed. Compared to our realm, their strength is far inferior. They wouldn’t have stood a chance if they had been forced to contend against the Astarte Clan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The other female member of the Yin Sect, named Tian Xue, also seemed surprised as she said, “They should have been proud of you and the fact that you’re from the Realm of Flame Heaven.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian shook his head and didn’t want to continue that topic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">AWWW! ROOAR!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At that moment, low-tier Demons’ miserable screams and wails suddenly rang out from the spatial rift.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The handful of people on the mountaintop looked down and discovered that, since all the enormous low-tier Demons were eager to return to the Fifth Demon Realm, as they scrambled through the spatial rift, many of them were pushed into the formation of starlight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon contact, their bodies instantly became badly mangled. Some even had their wings sliced off.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Considering that the high-tier Demons were only slightly bigger than humans, they didn’t encounter much difficulty when they flew through the spatial rift.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Anguz and a few other high-tier Demons from the Barten Clan shouted at the top of their lungs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">From the look of it, they were trying to tell those low-tier Demons to calm down and avoid the formation of starlight, which was gradually forming at the mouth of the spatial rift, as much as they could.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, Qi warriors from the Realm of a Thousand Devastations were attacking and killing the fleeing Demons that lagged behind, which contributed to their eagerness to return to their home realm, and made their retreat disorderly and congested.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After observing for a short while, Nie Tian’s eyes flickered as he stopped summoning power from the formation of starlight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As soon as he stopped, not another stream of starlight flew out of the formation of starlight at the mouth of the spatial rift again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The extremely large formation of starlight gradually stabilized and quietly reaped the low-tier Demons’ lives as they scrambled through the spatial rift, which was wide enough for several of them to pass simultaneously.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As rivers of starlight continued to pour down from the heavens and infuse into the formation of starlight, it expanded rapidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As it covered an increasingly large area, the Demons came under increasingly heavy pressure as they squeezed through the spatial rift, which resulted in more casualties.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">WHOOSH!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Liu Ling from the Yin Sect appeared in the distant sky, steering her Silver Chariot and approaching Nie Tian at a fast speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The chariot wobbled in the air, as it had clearly been damaged. Huang Fan from the Heaven Palace Sect, who had escorted him to this place, was also standing in it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Both Fan Shanshan and Tian Xue from the Yin Sect greeted Liu Ling as the Silver Chariot descended. “Senior martial sister.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Seeing that Nie Tian was unharmed and that the Demons were scrambling through the spatial rift, which had now become a meat grinder, Liu Ling let out a sigh of relief before jumping down from her Silver Chariot and smiling broadly at Nie Tian. “Thank you for what you’ve done.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I’m glad that you are fine,” Nie Tian replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Liu Ling sighed again and said with an exhausted expression on her face, “You’ve turned the situation around and saved us. Originally, Huang Fan and I were surrounded by many Demons. Our lives were hanging by a thread. However, as a roar suddenly rang out from this location, the Demons that were attacking us quickly scattered and fled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Only because of this were we able to come here in one piece.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With the expression of a man who had just escaped death, Huang Fan nodded and smiled gratefully at Nie Tian, saying, “Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“It’s good as long as everyone is fine,” Nie Tian said, smiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, none of them needed to do anything anymore. As Anguz roared furiously, the Demons lost all will to fight as they madly converged on the spatial rift.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Qi warriors from the Realm of a Thousand Devastations, on the other hand, were maximizing their victory by cutting down the fleeing Demons.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">None of the Demons dared to stay and make a move against Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Not to mention that a handful of powerful experts from the Yin Sect and the Yang Sect had been guarding Nie Tian with great commitment this whole time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“It seems to me that the threat in the Realm of a Thousand Devastations has been lifted.” The tip of Huang Fan’s eyebrow rose as he turned to Nie Tian and said, “Your business is finished here. Let’s go back to the Realm of Mystic Heaven.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian frowned in silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“What’s wrong?” Huang Fan asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I don’t plan on going to the Realm of Mystic Heaven right now.” Nie Tian gave voice to his stance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing these words, the members from the Yin Sect and the Yang Sect looked deeply shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Huang Fan seemed somewhat confused and displeased as he said, “Our sectmaster demanded to see you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Before their trip to the Realm of a Thousand Devastations, Zhao Luofeng had instructed him in private that he should bring Nie Tian back to the Heaven Palace Sect as soon as the spatial rift here was sealed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The deal between the Heaven Palace Sect and Auden from the Fourth Demon Realm was a secret of paramount importance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Now that Nie Tian had obviously learned about it, the only way to make him keep that secret was if the Heaven Palace Sect took Nie Tian in as their disciple.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Both Zhao Luofeng and Ling Dong had taken it for granted that Nie Tian would agree to become a disciple of their sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After all, as the Qi warrior sect with the most deep-rooted strength, the Heaven Palace Sect ranked first in battle power throughout the entire Domain of the Falling Stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhao Luofeng and Ling Dong had even made preparations for a grand sect-entrance ceremony when Nie Tian joined the sect. Not only that, but they were also ready to cultivate Nie Tian with everything they had and make him their sect’s brightest future star, now that Ning Yang was in the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhao Luofeng had told Huang Fan about their plans for Nie Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Huang Fan couldn’t think of any reason that might keep Nie Tian from accepting their handsome offer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Thus, upon learning that Nie Tian didn’t want to return to the Heaven Palace Sect after the situation of the Realm of a Thousand Devastations was stabilized, Huang Fan was truly upset.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Seeing that Huang Fan’s expression had grown grim, the experts from the Yin Sect and Yang Sect stood quietly in front of Nie Tian with their eyes narrowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Huang Fan let out a cold harrumph and said with a displeased expression, “Kong Hong! Liu Ling! What are you doing? You should know that if I didn’t bring Nie Tian here, the Realm of a Thousand Devastations would still be deep in trouble! You should be grateful to our sect!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Kong Kong shook his head firmly and said with a calm tone, “You’ve got it wrong, Brother Huang. We are grateful, but not to the Heaven Palace Sect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He turned around to glance at Nie Tian as he continued, “He is the man who has saved every man and woman in the Realm of a Thousand Devastations!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Liu Ling and the other two female members from the Yin Sect nodded as Liu Ling said, “Brother Huang, we’re grateful that you brought Nie Tian here safely. However, compared to what Nie Tian has done, your contribution seemed barely noticeable.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“If you intend to force Nie Tian to do things against his will, we won’t just sit back and watch.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After she uttered these words, Fan Shanshan and Tian Xue, who were standing behind her, nodded along.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">These Qi warriors from the Yin Sect and the Yang Sect had just been through a nightmare. It was Nie Tian who had given them hope when they were the most devastated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Therefore, they all considered Nie Tian as their savior.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even if Huang Fan, a member of the Heaven Palace Sect, wanted to make a move against Nie Tian, they wouldn’t allow it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Huang Fan’s expression was very sullen as he silently gazed back and forth between Nie Tian and the others, a meaningful look filling his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
