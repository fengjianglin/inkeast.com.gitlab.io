<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Outside the magnificent palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yue Yanxi, Jiang Feng, and Jiang Tong were sitting with their eyes closed. Three small vortexes were floating over the top of each of their heads.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though the vortexes were small, they were channeling and changing the movement of the rich spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth on this continent in a profound way.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yue Yanxi’s eyes suddenly snapped open. Two clusters of flames seemed to be burning in the depths of his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A loud rumble that sounded like a volcanic eruption echoed out from within him. At the same time, in the very distant fire-attributed region, clusters of flames seemed to be somehow attracted by him, and started to gather towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The sky seemed to be painted red by the sea of flames that was surging towards his location.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">SHEW!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A man covered in blood suddenly appeared out of thin air before them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Jian Tong instantly sprang to his feet and asked with a worried expression, “How are you doing, Big Brother Guan?!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The man had fine cuts all over him. Some were so deep that bones could be seen, as if he been cut by many sharp blades. Blood spilled from the cuts continuously.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even now, numerous small, snake-like blade lights were still slithering within his split wounds, inflicting damage to his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The burly tall man was Guan Fu, the middle Void domain reinforcement Guan Qi had summoned from their clan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A grayish-yellow magnetic field seemed to be greatly compressed, and only enveloped a three meter range around him now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That was his personal domain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Within the grayish-yellow domain, fierce sword intent was still flashing across with enough might to tear the heavens to bits.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">FIZZ! FIZZ! FIZZ!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At the same time, Guan Fu’s own power constantly clashed with the sword intent, giving rise to small explosions and bright lights.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With every explosion, Guan Fu would let out a muffled groan, and his wounds would further split.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“They are here.” Guan Fu bellowed weakly, looking behind him with bloodshot eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Several figures appeared in the distant sky. Each and every one of them looked elegant and carefree as they soared over on their swords.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Xing Beichen was among them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With his usual harmless smile, Xing Beichen was flying behind the five Void domain experts, who were all dressed the same. Instead of a pursuing killer, he looked more like a young scholar who was out on a sightseeing tour. Not the slightest killing intent could be sensed from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The five Void domain experts all had indifferent looks in their eyes, and couldn’t be any calmer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They were wearing garments with sleeves that were not only wide, but also long. On each of their chests was embroidered a mountain that had countless swords plunged into it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">From the look of it, that must be their sect’s sigil.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Guan Pu gave a pained groan and said to Yue Yanxi, Jiang Feng, and Jian Tong, “They’re from the Domain of Heaven Python, and the Thousandsword Mountain Sect is the name of their sect. According to them, the Trisword Sect in our domain was founded by someone from their sect. Xing Beichen was originally a chosen one of the Thousandsword Mountain Sect. However, he offended some important figure in the Domain of Heaven Python, and thus had to come to the Domain of Heaven’s Boundaries to lie low until the wind blew over. (Idiom: stay away from trouble)</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Now, his seniors have already solved the problem for him, and he can return to the Domain of Heaven Python at any time now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Guan Fu had engaged in battle against the five Thousandsword Mountain Sect experts, during which he had obtained this information.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Confused expressions appeared on Yue Yanxi and Jiang Feng’s faces as they muttered, “The Domain of Heaven Python... The Thousandsword Mountain Sect...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Obviously, they hadn’t heard of such a domain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Their domain is very far from the Domain of Heaven’s Boundaries, so we never got in touch with them before,” Guan Fu explained. Then, his face grew very grim as he added, “Their peak experts are at the Saint domain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon hearing these words, Yue Yanxi and the other experts finally gasped. “The Saint domain?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Their expressions grew unprecedentedly somber as they looked at the incoming experts from the Thousandsword Mountain Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After arriving in front of the palace, Xing Beichen still stood behind the five Void domain experts. Eyes fixed on the grand palace, he exclaimed weakly, “It’s a palace built by the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Who would have thought there would be a palace of the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace on this continent wreathed in rich spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth! So does it mean Nie Tian...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The five Thousandsword Mountain Sect experts’ expressions grew serious as they examined the palace carefully with their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, they didn’t pay much attention to Guan Pu, who they had seriously wounded, and the other experts from the Domain of Heaven’s Boundaries.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a moment of hesitation, Xing Beichen said with a reluctant expression, “Martial Uncle Ke, that kid named Nie Tian seems to be from the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace. I heard that he came here shortly before us. But since he’s not here now, it’s very likely that he has already entered this palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Ke Jinpeng frowned, not uttering a word.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">On their way here, he had learned from Xing Beichen that there was a young man named Nie Tian, who was supposed to be a member of the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace, and he had obtained a large amount of soul crystals and Metal-devouring Bugs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had assumed that if Nie Tian was an ordinary member of the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace who had come here on a tour, so even if they killed him, they probably wouldn’t draw ire on themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, this palace before him was clearly the work of the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This palace had been here for who knew how many years, and now a successor of the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace suddenly came to find this place...</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Ke Jinpeng couldn’t figure out what was going on, and thus found the matter somewhat intractable.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Just now, as soon as he had entered the atmosphere and sensed the surprisingly rich spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth in this place, he had decided to take this continent for their sect and add it to their sect’s arcane realms.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, now that he realized what that palace stood for, he suddenly grew hesitant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The existence of the palace proved that this place already had a owner, which was the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">How would he not ponder the matter carefully if he wanted to seize this unique heaven and earth from the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace’s hands?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After a moment of silence, Xing Beichen said, “Martial uncle, that Nie Tian is only at the Worldly realm, and he didn’t have others from his sect with him. Perhaps the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace has long since abandoned this place, or the powerful expert who had created this place died a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“And Nie Tian wasn’t sent here by the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace, but he just happened to find this place by accident.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“If that’s the case, we may actually take this unwanted place, and it’ll be alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The other four Void domain experts from the Thousandsword Mountain Sect nodded after hearing these words, greed flashing across their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even in their domain, they couldn’t find a place with such rich spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth, not to mention that this continent was divided into six regions, and each region had their unique wonders, along with a large number of rare plants and precious materials.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If they managed to take this place for the Thousandsword Mountain Sect, every one of them would be heavily rewarded for it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these thoughts, a middle Void domain expert named Sha Yan turned to look at Yue Yanxi, who was standing the closest to the palace gate. With a faint smile, he said, “Fellow cultivators, is that Nie Tian person in there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yue Yanxi smiled coldly. “That’s right. He is in the palace. But we can’t tell who’s in there with him. Perhaps powerful experts from the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace are still practicing secluded cultivation in there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Thousandsword Mountain Sect experts’ expressions flickered noticeably.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the next moment, five strands of immense soul awareness morphed into enormous swords and pierced towards the magnificent palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They were hoping to pry into the palace and learn the situation inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If Nie Tian was the only one in there, they would seriously consider killing him and taking this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, if, like Yue Yanxi had just said, powerful experts from the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace were practicing cultivation inside, then they would have Xing Beichen apologize to Nie Tian. If Nie Tian wouldn’t let it go no matter what, they would even give Xing Beichen up to gain the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace’s forgiveness.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">FIZZ! FIZZ! FIZZ!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Starlight sparks suddenly floated out of the palace walls like numerous dazzling stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They interwove into a mysterious star formation, warding off the Void domain experts’ soul awareness.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The giant swords that the five experts had formed with their soul awareness could easily penetrate metal and shatter stone, yet they couldn’t infiltrate the palace in the least.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Seconds later, the five experts had to withdraw their soul awareness, their expressions grimmer and more hesitant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">CREEN!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, the closed stone gate was suddenly pushed open from the inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian slowly walked halfway through it. With half of his body out of the palace and the other half inside the palace, he leaned against the stone gate and said to Xing Beichen with a disdainful tone, as if he knew that he had strong backing, “What? You want to kill me? Do you want my soul crystals, Metal-devouring Bugs, or this continent?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The moment the stone gate was pushed open, Sha Yan and the others took the opportunity to send their soul awareness inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Their soul awareness that was as thin as hair rapidly flew through the open gate and circled around within the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Eyes narrowing, Ke Jinpeng said with a respectful tone, “There are quite a few people in the palace, but there don’t seem to be any seniors from your sect among them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">An icy smile appeared at the corner of Sha Yan’s mouth as he nodded at Xing Beichen and said, “Your speculation seems to be correct.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Xing Beichen laughed. “You shouldn’t have come out, Nie Tian. If you didn’t, we wouldn’t have been able to learn the actual situation inside the palace. It was very foolish of you to come out and allow us to learn that there aren’t any powerful experts from the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Now I can tell you what we want.</span></p>
