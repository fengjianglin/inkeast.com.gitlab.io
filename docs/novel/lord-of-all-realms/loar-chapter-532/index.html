<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The aura Nie Tian released gave Xuan Ke a sense of familiarity, a feeling that he had met him somewhere before.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Xuan Ke possessed a shockingly keen sense for danger. The moment he had seen Nie Tian, he had sensed something that had alarmed him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He didn’t know that Nie Tian had discovered them through one of his Heaven Eyes long before they had discovered him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">What he had sensed that made him feel insecure and uneasy was actually the aura of that Heaven Eye, which Nie Tian had used to determine the cultivation bases of the four of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Furthermore, Nie Tian’s extremely intense killing intent made it clear that Nie Tian was full of wrath. Hence, to be safe, he didn’t want to initiate a battle with Nie Tian before he figured out who he was and how powerful he was.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Followed by his three subordinates, he ran after Nie Tian at a controlled speed, wondering what Nie Tian was after.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meanwhile, Nie Tian saw every move they made through that Heaven Eye of his.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He snorted inwardly and kept dashing forward at full speed, not showing the slightest interest in learning their intentions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After traveling for quite some time, one of his Heaven Eyes finally located Su Lin a place full of rubble at the foot of that magnificent mountain peak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She wasn’t alone. Standing beside her were a handful Qi warriors from the Heaven Palace Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This didn’t surprise Nie Tian at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">What did surprise him was that a gigantic, black phoenix was lying in the midst of the rubble.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Apparently, it was dead. However, it was so huge that its spread black, feathered wings covered a very large area.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“A black phoenix!” Nie Tian’s expression flickered slightly the moment he saw it, for it was almost identical to Dong Li’s black phoenix beast spirit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The only difference was that this dead black phoenix was noticeably larger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He instantly reached the conclusion that this black phoenix was of a higher grade than Dong Li’s black phoenix beast spirit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He also also realized that Su Lin must have been communicating with these Heaven Palace Sect disciples through Sound Stones.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Those people must have discovered this gigantic, black phoenix first, and then informed Su Lin at the first opportunity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Upon receiving such important information, Su Lin had rushed over at her fastest possible speed, ignoring her search plans with Hong He and Huang Hu.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That was why Su Lin had been able to come to such a distant location within such a short period of time, escaping the detection range of Nie Tian’s Heaven Eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, Su Lin was discussing something with the other Heaven Palace Sect disciples beside the black phoenix’s enormous corpse.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meanwhile, a few Thunder Mountain Sect disciples were standing by a huge rock slightly farther from the black phoenix’s corpse, eying the Heaven Palace Sect disciples indignantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">From the look of it, it was them who had found this black phoenix first.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Later, when the Heaven Palace Sect disciples had come, they had been forced to give it up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The reason why those Heaven Palace Sect disciples had informed Su Lin at the first moment possible must have been because they had been worried that those from the Thunder Mountain Sect would daringly challenge the Heaven Palace Sect’s authority.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">One Heaven Eye after another converged from all directions, and then floated silently around the black phoenix’s corpse.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After noticing the special situation via his Heaven Eyes, Nie Tian instantly slowed his dashing pace, and started moving stealthily.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He intended to get a full understanding of the situation with the help of his Heaven Eyes first, then make a move when an opportunity showed itself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Counting Su Lin, there were a total of five Heaven Palace Sect disciples gathered by the black phoenix’s corpse. The atmosphere was quite still.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">One of them examined the black phoenix while the other four silently eyed the few Thunder Mountain Sect disciples, who didn’t show any intention of leaving at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Other than Su Lin, the other four Heaven Palace Sect disciples were all at the middle or late Greater Heaven stage. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">On the Thunder Mountain Sect’s side, they only had four people, but they were also at either the middle or late Greater Heaven stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">From an objective point of view, the two sides seemed almost equally strong. However, the Thunder Mountain Sect had decided to take a step back and give their finding to the Heaven Palace Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The only reason for such an action was that the Heaven Palace Sect’s position as the overlord of the Domain of the Falling Stars made the Thunder Mountain Sect scrupulous.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Back in the Realm of Split Void, the Thunder Mountain Sect had forcibly taken the Blood Skull’s inter-realm teleportation portal in Shatter City. Afterwards, they had established a blockade to stop local Qi warriors from entering the Void Illusion Mountain Range, killing anyone who had dared to disobey their orders.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All of their doings indicated that they were by no means a group of kind people. Nie Tian was fully aware of this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, they had now put away their arrogance and cowered at the presence of the Heaven Palace Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Heaven Palace Sect’s unique status gave the Thunder Mountain Sect disciples scruples. Now that they weren’t certain that they were able to kill all five Heaven Palace Sect disciples without others knowing about it, they didn’t dare to make a move.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“How come we can’t get in touch with Hong He and Huang Hu, Junior Martial Sister Su?” One of the Heaven Palace Sect disciples asked in a low voice, while keeping his eyes on the Thunder Mountain Sect disciples that refused to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“I tried to contact them with my Sound Stone, but neither of them is responding,” Su Lin said, looking somewhat irritated. “I don’t know what’s wrong with them.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She had long since speculated that the reason why those from the Thunder Mountain Sect disciples were still not leaving was because they were also calling for backup with their Sound Stones.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She was aware that the Thunder Mountain Sect and Heaven Expanse Sect were the two major sects from the Realm of Earth Sieve. They had reached a mutual understanding earlier, and had entered this dimension via the same spatial rift.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Once the four of them got in contact with others from the Thunder Mountain Sect or the Heaven Expanse Sect, and summoned them to this location, the four of them might not still want to stand down by then.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">By that time, when they had confidence to annihilate all five Heaven Palace Sect disciples in this place, they wouldn’t necessarily be scrupulous anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As long as no one learned about their actions, they would have nothing to be afraid of.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“This black phoenix appears to have been an eighth grade spirit beast before it died!” The Heaven Palace Sect Qi warrior who had been examining the black phoenix’s corpse straightened his back and exclaimed with nothing but astonishment on his face. “The strength of an eighth grade spirit beast equals that of a Void domain human Qi warrior, and right now, we don’t have a single Void domain expert throughout the Domain of the Falling Stars.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Overwhelmed by his shocking discovery, he had exclaimed quite loudly, so much so that the four Thunder Mountain Sect disciples, who were gathered not far away, caught every word.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Su Lin jerked her head towards the four of them, and discovered that their eyes were shining with the light of greed as their breathing became increasingly rapid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Spiritual materials harvested from an eighth grade spirit beast could be used by peak Soul realm experts to enter the Void domain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In order to enter the Void domain, Soul realm experts would need to forge their inner domains. There might just be parts on the eighth grade black phoenix that were critical spiritual materials for the process.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though the seventh grade Earthshatter Beast had been dead for thousands of years, by the time Nie Tian and Dong Li had discovered it, there had still been copious amounts of flesh power in its corpse, as well as a perfectly preserved eye. Hence, there must be even more valuables in this eighth grade black phoenix’s corpse.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian shuddered as he heard the man’s exclamation, learning that the black phoenix was a eighth grade spirit beast.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He was very certain that Dong Li had never even imagined to come across an eighth grade black phoenix on this continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If she could ever obtain it, her cultivation base and strength, and even the strength of her black phoenix beast spirit, would probably go through heaven-shaking and earth-toppling changes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With this thought in mind, he secretly tried to get in contact with Dong Li with the help of one of his Heaven Eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The reason he had felt safe enough to leave Dong Li was because he had left one of his Heaven Eyes with her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Through that Heaven Eye, he had learned while he was dashing towards this location that Dong Li had already taken Huang Hu’s ring of holding and come after him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, she was still traveling in the dense forest, a sizable distance from the foot of the mountain peak where he was.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a thought, he commanded that Heaven Eye to descend from the sky to float before Dong Li’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though she still couldn’t see it, since it had come so close to her, she sensed the presence of some strange aura, and thus scanned her surroundings with her psychic awareness.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The moment her psychic awareness made contact with the Heaven Eye, a wisp of Nie Tian’s thoughts found it way to Dong Li’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">She instantly learned that Nie Tian had discovered a dead eighth grade black phoenix at the foot of the majestic mountaintop ahead of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A shudder ran through Dong Li’s dashing body as a fierce light of excitement burst forth from within her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With her slightly trembling hand, she took out her Sound Stone and whispered in a stern voice, “You could have contacted me via the Sound Stone I gave you, you fool! &nbsp;Stay where you are and don’t make a move! I’ll be there shortly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After sending the message out, she summoned her black phoenix beast spirit and flew directly towards Nie Tian’s location at full speed with its help.</span></p>

 <p>Tale: In the Eastern Han Dynasty, there was a famous politician named Sun Jing, who was very eager to study, even at night. In case he fell asleep when reading at night, Sun created an extreme measure that would aid him. He tied his hair to the beam while reading. Then, if he dozed, his hair would be pulled upward by the rope and the pain would wake him up. Before you get shocked by Sun’s self-torture, the anecdote of Su Qin, a famed strategist, in Warring States Period, was more appalling. According to Strategies of the Warring States, when Su was young, he failed so many times to obtain a governmental position that even his family looked down at him. So he made up his mind to work hard. When he felt sleepy at night, he used an awl to stab at his thigh. He could become sleepless and focus on reading again. Of course his blood and hard work was rewarded. With his excellent performance, he was appointed as premier in six states out of seven at that time. Then, people combined Su’s story with Sun’s and created this allusion.</p>
 <p>This idiom is often used to describe hard workers.</p>
