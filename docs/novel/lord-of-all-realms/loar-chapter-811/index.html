<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Looking deeply confused, Guan Fu hastily asked, “What’s wrong, Brother Yue?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yue Yanxi had been in the middle of a conversation with them when he had suddenly taken out a Sound Stone and started communicating via it in private. Immediately afterwards, his expression flickered with fright. This made Guan Fu wonder what was going on.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The three of them followed Yue Yanxi into the Seven-star Blue Sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As they did, Yue Yanxi hesitated briefly before saying, “Nie Tian said those stone statues won’t bring us great fortune. Instead, unknown danger lies within them. I trust him, so I told all disciples of our sect to evacuate!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Jiang Feng, Guan Fu, and Jian Tong all gasped with astonishment. “Nie Tian said that?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In that forbidden region, they had all witnessed Nie Tian’s incredible abilities as the seventh Son of the Stars of the Ancient Fragmentary Star Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A figure like him wouldn’t make important decisions without a reason, especially at such a sensitive moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though the Bliss Mountain Sect, which Jiang Feng was from, had strife with Nie Tian, he decided to trust Nie Tian after pondering in silence for a few seconds. Therefore, he hurriedly took out his Sound Stone and issued orders to the Bliss Mountain Sect disciples.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Guan Fu and Jian Tong trusted Nie Tian even more. They had already made arrangements as Jiang Feng hesitated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">SHEW!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Flame Bird sped away from the heart of the Seven-star Blue Sea at full speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">But at the same time, Nie Tian sent a wisp of his soul awareness to the Beast-controlling Sect disciples’ location, where it suddenly flew into Yin Yanan’s sea of awareness.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Shameless bastard!” Yin Yanan grew furious as she assumed that Nie Tian was so daring that he was actually going to take advantage of her with his soul awareness again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Therefore, she decided to teach him a lesson as soon as Nie Tian’s soul awareness barged into her mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, at that very moment, Nie Tian’s soul awareness delivered a message to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A shocked look appeared in her eyes as she received Nie Tian’s warning.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At that moment, Mu Biqiong from the Bliss Mountain Sect suddenly called out in her womanly voice, “Senior Zhou, we disciples of the Bliss Mountain Sect have decided to give up on deriving enlightenment from these stone statues. We’re leaving now, and we won’t ask for our spirit jades back.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Sure!” Zhou Shang said, laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Like Mu Biqiong, the representatives of the Guan Clan and the Jian Clan also sprang to their feet and took turns to express their intention to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“We’ve decided to leave too, Senior Zhou.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Considering that we can’t seem to gain anything, we don’t want to waste any more time here. We’re leaving too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They started the spell formations within their respective air-transportation spiritual tools as they spoke. They only waited for Zhou Shang to nod so they could leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Still smiling, Zhou Shang nodded and waved at them. “Sure. Go ahead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">SHEW! SHEW! SHEW!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The air-transportation spiritual tools that belonged to the Bliss Mountain Sect, the Guan Clan, and the Jian Clan sped off after the Flame Bird.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, instead of heading towards their own ancient starships, they headed towards the Divine Flame Sect’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That was because Jiang Feng, Jian Tong, and Guan Fu had ordered them to follow the Flame Bird, so that all of them would be able to join up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Originally, Yin Yanan had been somewhat hesitant after Nie Tian had warned her against the stone statues. But her expression flickered as well when she saw the Bliss Mountain Sect, the Guan Clan, and the Jian Clan leaving in a hurry.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yin Yanan finally made up her mind, and said, “It seems we won’t be able to come to gain anything here either. We’re out of here too.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The other nine disciples of the Beast-controlling Sect were all shocked and confused by her decision.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">They fixed Yin Yanan with inquiring gazes, wishing to know what made her decide to follow the Divine Flame Sect’s example and leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Instead of giving them an explanation, Yin Yanan shook her head towards them, and then fixed her eyes on Zhou Shang.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a lazy expression, Zhou Shang waved his hand at them. “Leave if you want to.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As he did, a hint of doubt finally flashed across his narrowed eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The fact that three sects and two clans had simultaneously pulled their members out of this place in a hurry puzzled him as to what was happening.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had a feeling that these parties had reached some mutual understanding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, he couldn’t figure out why they would leave all at the same time, while his sect and the Chu Clan had successfully interacted with the stone statues.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He then shot his gaze at the people from Trisword Sect and the Chu Clan, and was slightly relieved to discover that they were still observing where they had been.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, two disciples of his sect managed to interact with two other stone statues.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">This put him in a good mood again. He laughed heartily and forgot about the other parties suddenly leaving.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the person who was in charge of this operation, if he could help these talented young disciples from his sect derive valuable enlightenment from these stone statues, it would be considered a significant contribution on his part.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Whether he would be able to hold on to his lofty position in the Pure Heaven Sect would rely on Patriarch Pure Heaven’s attitude towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After all, he wasn’t the only middle Void domain expert in the Pure Heaven Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The success of this operation would have a significant impact on him. Those who had derived valuable enlightenment from these stone statues would most likely have bright futures in the Pure Heaven Sect, and it was him who had decided who would come on this trip.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As he thought of what this operation would bring him in the future, he grew increasingly relaxed and calm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">SHEW! SHEW! SHEW!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">One air-transportation spiritual tool after another was flying closer and closer towards the Divine Flame Sect’s berthed ancient starship.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At the same time, Yue Yanxi and the other experts were flying towards them at full speed in an attempt to meet them halfway.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">During this time, disciples of the Pure Heaven Sect managed to interact with all of the remaining stone statues.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this point, all of the eight stone statues had shed their original pale-gray rocky appearances, and turned to look as if they had been carved out of huge pieces of jade.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Even though there had been signs of changes, people would still often be caught by surprise when they happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Shortly after the air-transportation spiritual tools had left one after another, the eight members of the Chu Clan and the Pure Heaven Sect who had managed to interact with the stone statues suddenly flew uncontrollably towards the eight statues, which now looked like jade.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhou Shang stood aghast. “Zhang Tian!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BANG! BANG! BANG!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The eight young men and women suddenly exploded as they flew closer to the statues.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Their bones, flesh, and blood instantly merged with the statues. Even their true souls were sucked into the statues.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Blood-colored light started to wiggle in the eight statues’ blurry faces, which gradually morphed to take the appearances of the eight youngsters who they had just killed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The twisted faces of the youngsters’ true souls appeared over the statues’ faces, as if they were still suffering unimaginable pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, a shudder went through Zhou Shang as he suddenly realized that the other parties must have discovered something, and thus left on the Flame Bird and their other air-transportation spiritual tools.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All of a sudden, the stone statues flew up from under the sea’s surface.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">An incomparably terrifying aura instantly burst forth from within the statues, shaking heaven and earth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Without the slightest hesitation, the eight statues raised their enormous jade arms and slapped the Trisword Sect, the Chu Clan, and the Pure Heaven Sect’s berthed air-transportation spiritual tools with great force.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Those air-transportation spiritual tools were puny in the face of their enormous, hundred-meter-tall bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Under their overwhelming attacks, the air-transportation spiritual tools exploded one after another, as if they were all made of paper.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The lives of ten members of the Chu Clan, ten disciples of the Trisword Sect, and a few dozen disciples of the Pure Heaven Sect instantly perished.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The middle Void domain Zhou Shang was the only one who survived. Even though his private domain trembled unceasingly after taking a violent slap from a huge jade arm, he wasn’t injured.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, he let out a miserable shriek in the next moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All of these young disciples from the Pure Heaven Sect were either chosen ones with unmatched talent, or core disciples who had had good chances at making new breakthroughs in their cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Each and every one of them held unlimited potential, even though their cultivation bases hadn’t ranked very high among all of the Pure Heaven Sect disciples, which was close to a thousand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Otherwise, they wouldn’t have been arranged to come here and derive enlightenment from these stone statues.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A few dozen young disciples with great potential had suddenly died at the same time. As the person who was responsible for this operation, how would he explain this to Patriarch Pure Heaven?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In just a flash, the Pure Heaven Sect’s vital energy was greatly undermined. The stone statues had annihilated their fortune over the coming century. Who knew how long and how many precious materials it would take for them to gather so many chosen ones again?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhou Shang felt an agonizing heartache.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Meanwhile, he discovered that each statue exuded an aura that wasn’t any weaker than his.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Combined, they held terrifying strength that made him feel like he would die in this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Some of the dead youngsters’ blood, bones, and bits of flesh fell out of the sky, along with debris from the air-transportation spiritual tools.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As that happened, a huge vortex gradually formed and stretched towards the depths of the sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Zhou Shang discovered that the vortex seemed to be gathering all of the remains that had fallen into the sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, a stone statue that was much larger appeared at the bottom of the vortex and gradually rose towards the surface of the sea.</span></p>
