<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yin Yanan and Mu Biqiong didn’t show any response after hearing Nie Tian’s words, their faces expressionless.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">It seemed as if the deaths of those Qi warriors didn’t cause even the slightest wave in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian snorted a laugh and said, “Aren’t you two broad-minded.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He didn’t say anything else. A cold look appeared in his eyes as he kept a close watch on the three lurkers’ movements, wondering what they were planning to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All of the Qi warriors who had left this place had been at the Worldly realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian realized that he couldn’t sense their flesh auras anymore and thus was convinced that they had died. At the same time, the originally faint death Qi in the air grew considerably denser.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The fact that they heard nothing when those Worldly realm Qi warriors had been killed proved that their killers must have extraordinary means.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As intense demon Qi and phantasm Qi continued to pour into the mountain valley, the mountain peak, which the Qi warriors referred to as the Dao Enlightenment Rock, was gradually submerged in thick demon and phantasm Qi.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian looked up, and the starlit sky was already blocked from view.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Something is wrong.” The early Profound realm Qi warrior who Yin Yanan had talked to earlier sensed the unfavorable situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a deep frown, he took out a Sound Stone from within his cuff, and whispered a few words into it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">From the look of it, he was friends with some of the Qi warriors who had left, and now he was hoping to talk to them through his Sound Stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">His face grew grimmer as he held the Sound Stone to his ear, waiting for a response.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He took a deep breath and called out, “I can’t get in touch with Qiao Fei!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The other Qi warriors who were gathered around the Dao Enlightenment Rock all stopped what they were doing and gazed at him from afar with furrowed eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Two others also took out their Sound Stones and whispered something into them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Moments later, their faces turned very grim as they said, “Nothing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, all of them connected this to the increasingly rich phantasm Qi and demon Qi, and sensed imminent danger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“We need to get out of here now!” They exchanged a glance and instantly gathered to one point, where they prepared to leave the Dao Enlightenment Rock.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The thick demon Qi, phantasm Qi, and death Qi that was slowly building up would put humans at a disadvantage in battle. Therefore, whether danger was lurking around them or not, it was wise to leave as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With puzzled expressions, they cast their gazes towards Yin Yanan. “Aren’t you leaving?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Not only did the three of them not move at all, but they didn’t even have the slightest fear on their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“No,” Yin Yanan said coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The man nodded and said, “Suit yourselves.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, he picked a direction where the phantasm Qi and demon Qi was less thick, and dashed off at full speed with the other Profound realm Qi warriors.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As they did, a few air-transportation spiritual tools rose up and joined them in fleeing at full speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">BANG! BANG! BANG!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, they only flew several hundred meters before they suddenly fell off their air-transportation spiritual tools.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, the inertia carried their air-transportation spiritual tools forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Those who fell from their air-transportation spiritual tools gasped with shock and shouted, “It’s the Phantasms’ Dark Soul Ward!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian slowly rose to his feet. Gazing at them from afar, he muttered in a low voice, “Dark Soul Ward...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">He had fought a powerful Phantasm named Armes, which made him rather familiar with this particular Phantasm bloodline magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Phantasms could use Dark Soul Ward to confine souls. When he had attempted to escape the Dark Soul Ward during his battle against Armes, he had suffered the agony of his soul being separated from his body, and thus had been forced to stay.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Those Profound realm Qi warriors might be able to separate their souls from their bodies, but once they abandoned their bodies, it would mean the end of their path of cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Besides, after being stripped of their bodies, their souls would suffer more miserable fates if the Phantasm were to unleash soul magics on them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">WHOOSH!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">An enormous skull flew over.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Sitting on the skull was none other than the Phantasm youngster who Nie Tian and the girls had met once.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the youngster’s face split into a grin, the skull, which was formed by countless discarnate souls, opened its huge mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Two Profound realm Qi warriors instantly had their true souls ripped out of their seas of awareness.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the next moment, their true souls disappeared into the skull’s unfathomable mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After losing their true souls, the two Profound realm Qi warriors collapsed to the ground, bereft of any life force.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The few other Profound realm Qi warriors’ faces turn pale with fright as they subconsciously stepped backwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The skull went on to channel their true souls. However, they either practiced profound incantations or possessed powerful spiritual tools, so they all managed to pin their true souls in their seas of awareness, and escaped death.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Like bolts of lightning, they shot back to the Dao Enlightenment Rock.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Phantasm youngster had a hearty smile on his face as he controlled the enormous skull that he sat on to fly over in an unhurried fashion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Instead of the five Profound realm Qi warriors, the Phantasm youngster looked at Nie Tian and the girls and said, “Long time no see. I suppose you’ve taken the Silicon Silver from the Heavenly Witchcraft Sect’s hands, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yin Yanan let out a cold harrumph. “Yeah, so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a smile, the youngster said, “Good. You know Silicon Silver is not only of great value to you humans, but to us too. Originally, I assumed that a fierce battle would break out between you and those Heavenly Witchcraft Sect disciples, but I only found the corpse of one of them after I arrived.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Yin Yanan didn’t chime in. Instead, she placed her hand on the Frost Blood Python’s head and sent it a message.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the next moment, her expression flickered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Frost Blood Python’s soul awareness was still examining the Dao Enlightenment Rock and deriving enlightenment from those complicated lines. It didn’t even respond to her call.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">If the Frost Blood Python’s soul awareness didn’t return, it meant she no longer had her strongest backing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Phantasm youngster’s gruesome skull made even the eighth grade Frost Blood Python apprehensive. Therefore, she was no longer confident now that she had lost the Frost Blood Python’s backing for the time being.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“There’s a problem, Nie Tian,” She whispered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian had already noticed the anomaly, but he remained calm as he asked the Phantasm youngster, “Where are your friends? Let me guess. One of them is a Demon, and the other is a Bonebrute. Am I right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The man who had talked to Yin Yanan earlier burst into a flaming rage. “You knew that outsiders have been lurking in the dark?!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Yeah, I knew,” Nie Tian answered with understatement.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Phantasm youngster held out his thumb towards Nie Tian. “Impressive. I can’t believe you actually sensed our presence. You three are what we came for. The others are only add-ons.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, his eyes suddenly narrowed. “You seem to have something that shouldn’t belong to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“What are you talking about?” Nie Tian asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Phantasm youngster’s eyes shone with the light of excitement. “A Spirit Pearl.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, the prismatic crystal between his eyebrows suddenly burst forth with bright light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Fine cyan lightning bolts then appeared and interwove within the prismatic crystal, as if they were manipulating the Dark Soul Ward.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Like a huge net, the Dark Soul Ward started to shrink at an alarming speed, the space inside of it becoming smaller and smaller.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">CRACK!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All of a sudden, the ground where everyone was standing cracked, and a translucent bony hand thrust out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Standing on the crack was a middle Profound realm Qi warrior. The bony hand caught him by his ankle and dragged him into the earth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The man’s bloodcurdling scream came from under the ground, but stopped abruptly in the next moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The remaining four Qi warriors gasped with shock as they hastily jumped away. “That’s a Bonebrute!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Blood spilled from the crack in the earth, which indicated the man’s instant death.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Then, a short Bonebrute slowly climbed out of the bloody crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, he didn’t have a single shred of blood on his translucent and sparkling bones after he came out. Misty light could be seen flowing within his jade-like skeleton.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">An aura that could wither all things gradually rose from his small bony body, and pervaded the entire area.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">All of the Qi warriors in his surroundings gasped with astonishment as they hastily infused their wards with more spiritual power to stop the aura of death from infiltrating them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Bonebrute...” With a surprised expression, Nie Tian examined the Bonebrute. After a moment of pondering, he asked, “Do you know Xing Bo from the Thousandsword Mountain Sect? He’s from the Domain of Heaven Python.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">After Xing Bo’s collusion with the Bonebrutes had been brought to light, he had escaped the pursuit of the Thousandsword Mountain Sect’s experts, along with a Void domain elder. With the Bonebrutes’ help, they had fled to a Bonebrute realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Before he had left, he had claimed that he would enter the Shatter Battlefield, and people were welcome to come and settle accounts with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Xing Bo had killed Zhen Huilan and captured Pei Qiqi. Nie Tian had long since put him on his must-kill list.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">That was why he thought of Xing Bo as soon as he saw a Bonebrute.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Xing Bo... the Domain of Heaven Python...” the Bonebrute youngster muttered in fluent human language. “He sounds familiar, but I can’t be sure. I suppose he has connections with another branch of our race, and has also come to the Shatter Battlefield through our spatial tunnel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Nie Tian’s eyes lit up. “Do you know where he is?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The Bonebrute youngster ran his round eyes up and down Nie Tian. With a puzzled expression, he said, “You’re going to die soon. Why do you still care about that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With these words, he summoned a bone saber that was only half a meter long.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, as soon as he did, the death Qi in the air seemed to suddenly seethe.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">With a quick motion, he swung the bone saber towards the four Profound realm Qi warriors.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Numerous sparkling and crystal-clear spots flew out of the bone saber as an overwhelming aura of death instantly engulfed the four.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The bone saber seemed to be vested with unlimited power by Death.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Deeply panicked, they screamed within the thick aura of death, as if they had recognized the Bonebrute youngster, “That’s that legendary bone saber!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">CRACK! CRACK!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Their spiritual tools and spiritual armor were all as fragile as paper before the bone saber. They shattered along with their owners.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">As the Bonebrute made a few slashing motions with the bone saber, the four Qi warriors were cut to pieces. Then, their death aura was channeled away from their mangled bodies and absorbed by the bone saber, which made the bright spots on the bone saber even brighter.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The most powerful of the four Qi warriors was at the late Profound realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">However, none of them were able to even hold on for a few seconds facing the bone saber.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this point, the foreign Qi warriors who had been gathered around the Dao Enlightenment Rock had all been wiped out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Not the slightest change could be seen in the Bonebrute youngster’s eyes after he slaughtered the four Qi warriors. He turned to the Phantasm youngster and demanded, “I want half of the Silicon Silver.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">At this moment, a thunderous voice came from the distance. “I want that eighth grade python!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">In the next moment, a tall youngster dressed in black garments and a violet-gold belt strode into everyone’s view.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Judging from his purple hair and pupils, he was clearly a high-tier Demon. However, the ferocious look in his eyes made him look like a frenzied beast from Demon realms, not a creature with remarkable intelligence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Raging flesh auras wreathed him as he arrived in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">A vicious smile appeared on the Phantasm youngster’s face as he laid his eyes on Nie Tian and the girls and said, “Alright, I’ll take the other half of the Silicon Silver and that Spirit Pearl.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The three outsiders rapidly reached a mutual understanding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“The Spirit Pearl...” Nie Tian sent a wisp of soul awareness into his ring of holding. In the next moment, the Spirit Pearl flew out and landed in his palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“You do have a Spirit Pearl!” The Phantasm youngster exclaimed, looking overjoyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">“Come on out!” As Nie Tian shouted these words, the Bone Blood Demon also flew out of his ring of holding and landed with a loud crash.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">The sight of the Bone Blood Demon put burning fury in the Bonebrute youngster’s eyes. “A senior of our race! I can’t believe you actually turned him into a puppet!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal">Pointing at Nie Tian, he shouted, “He’s mine!”</span></p>
