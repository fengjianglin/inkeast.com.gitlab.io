 <p>There were several canteens in Baelenbaatar Middle School. Normally, Lu Jie and his friends preferred the canteen at the training ground the most because it had the most meat-based meals and the biggest portions.</p>
 <p>Chang Fu saw a group of people at a distant training ground before he even got near to the canteen. It was chaos as shouts and howls rang through the rain.</p>
 <p>A fight really had broken out again!</p>
 <p>Chang Fu rushed towards the group. Lu Jie and his friends should’ve been very easy to find because they were normally leading the fights, but Chang Fu wasn’t able to find anyone of them despite looking around for some time.</p>
 <p>Chang Fu pulled over a student - he was a commoner - and asked about his friends’ whereabouts. The fight seemed to have filled the student with rage as he answered, “Those egg f*cking nobles hurt Lu Jie and Tai Tu. This has gone too far. I’ll show them!”</p>

 <p><strong>Star Rank Hunter moving out of volare</strong></p>
 <p>Hello everyone, this is a lengthy but important announcement. As some of you might know, SRH is published by a certain publisher who shall not be named. This automatically makes it into a time bomb, waiting to explode. After a lot of pondering, we found a less than ideal solution, but one nonetheless. We will move out of Volare by the end of this month and moving onto a combination reddit and google docs. We will have the chapters’ announcements on reddit, and they will contain a link to the google doc of the chapter. The subreddit we will be using is aptly named /r/starrankhunter/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/starrankhunter/). This way, SRH is no longer monetized, hence it will just become a passion project.</p>
 <p>We know this whole thing sounds a little grim, but believe it when we say that it's not as bad as it sounds. It takes a load of deadly worry off our shoulders, and if you're a veteran Reddit user it's not even inconvenient (probably)! Anyway, SRH ISN'T DEAD, IT JUST MOVED TO A SAFER PLACE is what we're trying to say. The rest - schedule, uniform upvotes, procrastination etc - will all remain unchanged. So uh, cause for celebration? Yay!</p>
 <p>-Craxuan and darklord5555</p>
 <p>_____________________</p>
 <p><strong>Note from etvo</strong></p>
 <p>Hey guys, etvo here.</p>
 <p>I wanted to tag along to Craxuan's announcement because the circumstances regarding this one are a bit different from last May. When the entire brouhaha erupted last year, individual translators decided to drop their Qidian novels for various reasons. Whether it was out of disapproval of corporate actions, speaking out for their beliefs, or that the novel also happened to be really long, the events of last May were the catalyst for us dropping our novels. This was a wholly voluntary action that wasn't due to an official takedown request.</p>
 <p>Over the course of the last year, we divested two thirds of our Qidian novels. The bulk of those novels were the entirety of our most popular novels. What we had left were frankly, the short or less popular novels that I thought we could keep around until the situation changed or Qidian might be willing to work with other sites again. They were just a handful of views, surely those would be fine.</p>
 <p>Now, that situation remains the same, but it's come to my attention for a while now that various accusations and/or falsehoods have been created regarding volare and the remaining Qidian novels on the site. To which I say, "Enough". I will not allow immaturity and negativity to touch my folks. I have asked our remaining Qidian novels to leave, and there are various plans to either move or halt translations upon reaching certain milestones. It's sad that things have come to this state, given that we're all here to enjoy these wonderful stories. But that's what we're here for, and not this other nonsense. So thank you for your understanding and please support the translators when they transition to the new novels. Please direct all questions/comments to me. Please don't be annoyed at the translators, as I asked them to do this.</p>
