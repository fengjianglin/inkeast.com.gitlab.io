 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Protect Lin Yun!” The face of the Sword-Bearing Elder who was fighting with the elders of the four sects changed when he saw this scene. They didn’t have many people, but they still managed to send eight deacons over to Lin Yun. But this was only the beginning. As the elders of the four sects became more violent, Lin Yun gradually became more endangered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A cosmic artifact?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The eight deacons’ faces changed when they saw Lin Yun bringing out a cosmic artifact, but they soon sneered, “How much power can you bring out from it? You’re dreaming if you think that you can survive just because you have a cosmic artifact.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even cultivators in the Violet Palace Realm couldn’t control a cosmic artifact if they wanted, not to mention Lin Yun who was only in the ninth stage. In their minds, Lin Yun probably couldn’t even bring out half of the cosmic artifact’s prowess. Furthermore, the origin energy that a cosmic artifact consumed wasn’t something that someone in the Profound Martial Realm could endure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m afraid that you guys aren’t enough to kill me!” said Lin Yun coldly. He might be concerned if he was facing experts in the Violet Palace Realm, but the quasi-Violet Palace Realm was nothing to him. He could already use the Scarletflame War Flag’s close-combat mode back when he was in the seventh stage. Unfortunately for them, Lin Yun had reached the ninth stage now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re courting death!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll see how long you can put up your strong front for!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No one can save you since you’ve killed three of our core disciples!” The eight deacons were furious. They were in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm and they outnumbered Lin Yun. They had no idea where Lin Yun got his confidence from, thinking that he could kill them with a cosmic artifact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The eight of them instantly unleashed their strongest moves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come!” sneered Lin Yun. Before the attacks landed on him, Lin Yun raised the flag and stabbed at them. In the next second, the attacks from the eight deacons were shattered. This caused their faces to change as they executed their ultimate moves once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cloudshattering Slash!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mountain Breaker!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bloodshadow Eighteen Slash!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Infernal Seal!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The eight attacks created a phenomenon that came crashing down at Lin Yun. But Lin Yun had no change in his expression. With a luminous radiance from the flag, he slashed out and yelled, “Luminous Moon!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Luminous Moon executed by the cosmic artifact seemed like an eerie crimson moon. The blood moon then manifested into a slash and charged at the attacks of the deacons. The power was even more terrifying than when Lin Yun used the Flower Burial Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only did this attack contain the ominous aura from the cosmic artifact, the power was so explosive that Lin Yun nearly lost control of it. In an instant, the two sides clashed and one of the deacon’s arm was cut off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The deacon screamed out in pain, but before he could recover from the pain, Lin Yun had already descended with the Scarletflame War Flag. In a split second, the origin energy that the deacon used to defend himself was shattered and he was reduced to a cloud of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Scarletflame War Flag trembled in Lin Yun’s hand. This scene shocked the seven remaining deacons.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A quasi-Violet Palace Realm deacon was so easily killed?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;But before they could gather themselves from the shock, Lin Yun appeared before the next person and slashed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Retreat! There’s something unusual about his cosmic artifact!” Everyone woke up from the shock and panicked when they saw Lin Yun approaching. In their eyes, Lin Yun had turned into a demon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun’s gaze was cold and he poured his origin energy into the cosmic artifact. He had already cut off his path of retreat the moment he took out the Scarletflame War Flag. He had no plans on stopping unless he ran out of origin energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other sects’ elders and disciples were shocked by this scene. As spectators, they had a clear view of the fight. The killing aura emitting from Lin Yun was shocking and they couldn’t believe that two cultivators in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm had died so quickly. It was unbelievable, even if Lin Yun was using a cosmic artifact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He cut off his own path of retreat. That sort of person is the most terrifying,” muttered one of the spectators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Those deacons are demonic cultivators. So it’s not surprising that they’ll reveal their true nature the moment they face death.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This monstrous genius of the Sword Firmament Pavilion has completely displayed what a swordsman should be.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If our sect’s disciples had such courage, they wouldn’t suffer whenever they ran into demonic cultivators” There were countless demonic cultivators in the Great Qin Empire and ordinary sects’ disciples would usually lose their lives if they ran into them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was because they lacked Lin Yun’s courage. They were intimidated by the opponent’s ominous aura. In fact, it would be a good thing if they could even bring out 50% of their strength in those situations. On the other hand, Lin Yun had faced death courageously and forced the eight demonic cultivators to retreat by himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Raining Spring!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Incessant Wave!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Misty Fog!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Myriad Frost!” Lin Yun executed move after move from the Aquaselenic Sword. In the next second, three more deacons lost their lives. This left the three remaining deacons terrified. They were running for their lives as they cried out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just when the three of them were about to be slain, a saber ray descended and collided with the Scarletflame War Flag.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun could feel his hands becoming numb as he was pushed back. It took him several steps before he finally managed to stabilize himself. When he raised his head, he saw an old man from the Sevendespair Palace standing before him, a Violet Palace Realm elder!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I never expected that someone with your bloodlust would exist in the empire. It would be a pity to kill you, but you have to die today!” The old man unleashed the pressure from his cultivation and crushed Lin Yun’s aura from a distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cultivators in the Violet Palace Realm were too strong. Before Lin Yun could even catch his breath, the old man unleashed three slashes with his saber. After the three sabers, Lin Yun was sent flying. While he was flying in mid-air, he gnashed his teeth and swung the Scarletflame War Flag.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the old man reacted in time, he was still too slow. Lin Yun’s move left a shallow gash on his chest. This made the old man’s gaze turn even colder. Before Lin Yun even landed on the ground, he swung his saber and knocked the Scarletflame War Flag out of Lin Yun’s hand. At the same time, he also left a horrifying gash on Lin Yun’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother!” Xin Yan’s face changed. The faces of the other elders from the Sword Firmament Pavilion also changed. Their defensive line was still broken through in the end and an elder in the Violet Palace Realm made it over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re courting death!” Xin Jue, who was fighting with a deacon, turned into a bolt of lightning and dashed over. The Sword Firmament Pavilion didn’t have enough people. So none of the elders could make it over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sword Firmament Pavilion’s elders were practically fending off at least three enemies each. As for the Sword-Bearing Elder, he alone was fending off ten elders!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So no one else aside from Xin Jue could render assistance to Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Another one coming to die?” The old man sneered and slashed with his saber. But Xin Jue’s Thunderclap Sword was stronger than he had imagined, which forced him to take several steps back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You have to pass through me if you want to kill Lin Yun!” The surface of Xin Jue’s body crackled with lightning as he stood before Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Quasi-Violet Palace Realm?” The old man was briefly stunned when he sensed Xin Jue’s aura. He then smiled, “The Sword Firmament Pavilion is filled with many talents. Ordinary cultivators in the Violet Palace Realm might not be able to do anything to you, but it’s a pity that you ran into me. Die!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man soared into the sky and slashed out with his saber. His attack was accompanied by rumbling lightning that flew towards Xin Jue like a dragon. Although Xin Jue was able to block this attack, he was still pushed back three steps and blood dripped down from his sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother, catch!” cried Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun held onto his chest on the ground and threw out a sword from his interspatial pouch. It was the ancient cosmic artifact that he obtained in the ninth level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Jue’s eyes glowed when he saw the sword. Before the sword reached him, Xin Jue flipped backwards and grabbed onto the sword. But without relenting, the saber came crashing over once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Jue didn’t have any time to think. He instantly turned around and drew his sword. The moment he drew his sword, the sword’s body glowed brightly like a dazzling sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another cosmic artifact?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;The old man’s face started to change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a great sword!” Xin Jue laughed in mid-air and crushed the old man’s attack before unleashing his strongest attack with the cosmic artifact. Nine bolts of lightning descended on the old man, each stronger than the previous one. The eighth lightning bolt shattered the old man’s aura, and the ninth one stabbed him in the chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moon Reflection!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun’s eyes glowed and he slammed his palm on the ground. He soared into the sky and charged at the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re courting death,” sneered the old man when he saw Lin Yun charging over. But his smile soon froze on his face when he saw Lin Yun divide into nine afterimages. He couldn’t make out which was the real Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Die!” When the nine afterimages overlapped, Lin Yun’s sword glowed like a bright moon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before the old man could even react, he was slashed in the throat. His head flew off from his body with his eyes opened wide, full of reluctance. When the old man collapsed onto the ground, Lin Yun finally relaxed as he threw up a mouthful of blood. At this moment, his face became even paler than before.</span></p>
