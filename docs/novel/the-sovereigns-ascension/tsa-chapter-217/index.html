 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun eventually fell on one knee in front of the old man and the sound of his bones cracking under the huge pressure could be heard. This scene made everyone take sympathy for Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eventually, someone couldn’t help speaking up for Lin Yun, “Elder, why don’t you make an exception for him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’ll be going to the Life-Death Stage in a month and he won’t have a chance at winning if he doesn’t enter the fourth level.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder, he’ll die if you don’t stop.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite the persuasion from the surrounding, the elder remained firm without any intention of compromising. But when he saw the determination in Lin Yun’s eyes despite being covered in blood, he ultimately did not continue pressuring him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s your name?” The elder asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder, his name is Lin Yun. He used to be a sword slave from a small place. You can’t make an exception for him to visit the fourth level!” A person walked out from the Martial Hall before Lin Yun could even speak. It was Leng Mo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun instantly knew who it was when he heard the voice. It was Wang Yan’s lackey, who was trashed by him back in the competition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do I need you to teach me how to perform my duties?” The elder looked at Leng Mo with rage flickering across his eyes. In the next second, his cultivation in the Violet Palace Realm came crashing down on Leng Mo. Leng Mo was caught by surprise and fell onto the ground under the huge pressure before he could even apologize.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leng Mo’s face instantly turned pale and he could no longer stand up from the pain. When everyone in the surrounding saw this scene, they sucked in a mouthful of cold air. At this moment, they finally knew what tremendous pressure Lin Yun had been putting up with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no way I can allow you on the fourth level according to the sect's rules. Take this jade plaque and get lost.” The elder waved his hand and threw a jade plaque at Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Receiving the jade plaque and seeing that it was the complete copy of the Overlord Sword, Lin Yun immediately cupped his hands together, “Thank you, Elder!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why should I stop you if you’re courting death?” The elder did not bother looking at Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll be taking my leave then.” Lin Yun turned around and left. But just when he raised his foot, the elder suddenly called out to him, “Wipe the blood on your face before leaving.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A napkin appeared on the table, which Lin Yun took and thanked the elder for.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Yun, even if you managed to enter the fourth level, you still wouldn’t be able to defeat Ye Liuyun. Now that you’ve failed to enter the fourth level, you’ll surely die! A sword slave like you has no idea how powerful someone ranked 36th on the Mortal Ranking is!” Leng Mo said with hatred while lying on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wiping the blood off his face, Lin Yun stepped on Leng Mo’s chest when he passed by, causing the latter to wail loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You talk too much,” Lin Yun snorted. He then left, leaving Leng Mo screaming on the ground in pain. No one in the surrounding took pity on him. After all, they all felt that Leng Mo deserved it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But their feelings became complicated when they looked at Lin Yun’s silhouette. Lin Yun killed Wang Ning in the Nine Stars Contest and stood out among his batch. He was undoubtedly a rising star with great potential. If possible, no one wanted him dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had only been in the sect for a month and he already received a challenge from Ye Liuyu. Outside the Martial Hall, Li Wuyou and Ku Yun’s brows loosen up when they saw Lin Yun coming out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother, what took you so long? What martial technique did you choose? Let me take a look at it!” shouted Li Wuyou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m curious as well.” Ku Yun and Li Wuyou were both feeling curious because Lin Yun had taken a long time choosing in the Martial Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun knew that the Overlord Sword wouldn’t be simple. After all, the elder only handed it to him reluctantly. So, for the time being, Lin Yun didn’t want to let the two know about the Overlord Sword. He replied, “It’s just an ordinary sword technique. Come, let’s go to the capital.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Wuyou and Ku Yun’s eyes instantly lit up when they heard that they were going to the capital. Li Wuyou had too much pent up, so he wanted to have a good stroll in the capital. On the other hand, Ku Yun was filled with expectations because he knew that Lin Yun was finally going to start his business.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back at the Locket Mountain, in Xin Yan’s residence, a burly and rough-face disciple was respectfully giving a report, “Senior Sister, Junior Brother Lin has just left the Marital Hall and is about to leave the sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His name was Mo Cheng, and just like his name, he had a burly build. He was one of the stronger disciples in Locket Mountain and he had followed Xin Yan for years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who did he go with?” she asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Brother Wuyou and an alchemist from the Pellet Hall, Master Ku Yun…” Mo Cheng reported.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay. Ku Yun has just been promoted to a two star alchemist and with him around, no one will dare to mess with Junior Brother Lin.” Xin Yan nodded her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, back in the Gentlemen Union’s base, Wang Yan also received news that Lin Yun would leave the sect. There was a flash of joy in his eyes when he heard that, but he was instantly disappointed when he heard that Master Ku Yun was going as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Pellet Hall had a unique position in the Sword Firmament Pavilion and not even Wang Yan dared to offend an alchemist from the Pellet Hall. But when he heard from Leng Mo what happened back in the Martial Hall, he smiled, “This sword slave is full of wishful thinking. He actually wants to visit the fourth level? It’s already too late for him to ask for help! This is only the beginning, I will make him kneel before me like a dog one day!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the capital’s inner city, Lin Yun’s group was making their journey late at night on horses. Time was precious, so they did not want to waste a single second. But they were exhausted when they arrived at their destination, not to mention that the night was cold as heavy snow descended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The snow is really fierce. I just want a warm bath right now.” Li Wuyou shivered. Compared to the fine snow a month ago, the snow tonight was much worse .</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ku Yun smiled, “No worries. I’m a Guest Elder in the Glittering Pavilion. Now that I’m a two star alchemist, my treatment will be higher. You can make any request to the Glittering Pavilion and they will do their best to satisfy your wish.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Glittering Pavilion was one of the largest chambers of commerce in the inner city. Just like the name implied, the Glittering Pavilion was filled with glitter. Pellets were important commodities in every store and alchemists could enjoy a high status in these shops.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Pellet Hall did not prohibit their alchemists from being involved with chambers of commerce. Firstly, refining pellets was expensive and it was difficult to sustain by solely relying on the Pellet Hall. You would need to have other sources of income. At the same time, it also allowed alchemists to accumulate their wealth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Secondly, the Pellet Hall had a cooperative relationship with many chambers of commerce. After all, if disciples were all swapping their contribution points for pellets, it would be a huge loss to the sect. So they had to rely on the chambers of commerce to make profits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So Ku Yun had instantly thought of this idea when Lin Yun asked for resources. The two of them would cooperate. Lin Yun would be responsible for inscribing spiritual runes, while Ku Yun would focus on refining pellets. Then, they would auction them through the chambers of commerce to obtain spiritual jades.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Lin Yun’s ability to inscribe spiritual runes, they would definitely be able to make a great fortune for themselves. Li Wuyou smiled, “Then we’ll have to depend on Master Ku Yun later on. It has been three days since I took a wink, and my butt is getting sore on horseback. I heard that the Glittering Pavilion is the top chamber of commerce in the capital. And their wealth can be comparable to a nation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not exactly comparable to a nation, but they’re not any worse off as a top chamber of commerce,” Ku Yun said indifferently. He was obviously somewhat arrogant since ordinary chambers of commerce couldn’t catch his attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Half an hour later, a magnificent building appeared before them, with ‘Glittering Pavilion’ written on the signboard with vigorous strokes. When they arrived, Ku Yun took out his Sword Firmament Token confidently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tell Hall Master Mo to come over. Let him know that an old friend has come to visit.” Alchemists from the Pellet Hall were aloof and prideful. The guard did not dare to neglect and quickly walked in with the Sword Firmament Token.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In no time, a middle-aged man came out with a smile and cupped his hands politely, “So it’s Master Ku Yun. Welcome! Welcome!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Master Ku Yun nodded his head and wanted to enter. But just when he took a step, the two guards in the sixth stage of the Profound Martial Realm stopped the three of them. Ku Yun’s face changed, while Lin Yun and Li Wuyou both looked baffled. Ku Yun questioned, “Hall Master Mo, what’s the meaning of this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ku Wun was furious. He suppressed the anger in his heart and continued, “A dignified two star alchemist like me can’t enter your Glittering Pavilion?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hall Master Mo had smiles on his face and explained, “Master Ku Yun, I’m really sorry, but the Glittering Pavilion has accumulated a lot of pellets during this period. So we don’t need an alchemist to settle in for the time being. Of course, we will not forget your income as a Guest Elder.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun couldn’t help looking disappointed because he never expected something like this to occur. However, he did not want to make things complicated and spoke out, “Master, let’s go somewhere else and rest. It has been three days since we rested.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Great! What this little friend says makes sense.” Hall Master Mo smiled humbly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ku Yun had a ball of fire pent up in his chest. Hall Master Mo clearly had evil intentions even though he had a big smile. Why couldn’t they go in and rest even if they didn’t need pellets? This was clearly an act to embarrass them. But Ku Yun did not know how to get angry with Hall Master Mo acting so polite.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go!” Ku Yun turned around and left. But shortly after, they saw two people arriving in their direction while riding on Snow Dragon Horses. Lin Yun was surprised when he saw the woman because it was Liu Yue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun did not recognize the old man, but Ku Yun naturally recognized him and exclaimed out in shock, “Lord Fu Guang!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fu Guang was an experienced two star alchemist and he could inscribe two star spiritual runes many years ago. On the other hand, Ku Yun had just been promoted to a two star alchemist, not to mention that he still couldn’t inscribe any two star spiritual runes. So there was no way his reputation could compare with Fu Guang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fu Guang did not get down from the Snow Dragon Horse and reprimanded him, “Ku Yun, you’ve just been promoted, so why are you around here when you can’t even inscribe two star spiritual runes perfectly?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ku Yun bit down on his lips. His face turned ugly and lowered his head, “Yes, you’re right.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go away. Don’t get in my way,” said Fu Guang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lord, please travel safely.” The three of them gave way and Lin Yun could see the mockery flashing through Liu Yue’s eyes. The three were tired and they did not wish to talk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother, look!” Li Wuyou suddenly stopped and pointed at the Glittering Pavilion not far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hall Master Mo, who had just chased them away, was bowing as he received Fu Guang and Liu Yue. They could even vaguely hear their conversation. “Quick, bring out Master Fu Guang’s signboard immediately. Inform the entire city that Master Fu Guang will be in the Glittering Pavilion for the next month. This is a genuine two star alchemist!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ku Yun’s hand trembled and he dropped the horse reins. His face paled as they stood on the snow-covered street.</span></p>
