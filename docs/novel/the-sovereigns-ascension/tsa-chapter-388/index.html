 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Judging from the horns on its head, the snake was showing signs of transforming into a dragon. Demonic beasts in the same cultivation were ranked differently based on their strength. They were separated into ordinary, elite, overlord, and monarch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An overlord-ranked demonic beast in the Violet Palace Realm was terrifying enough, not to mention a monarch-ranked one. The Sword-Bearing Elder wasn’t able to chase the Thunderflame Python away previously even with the Firmament Sword, not to mention that he wasn’t at his strongest state now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone began to feel uneasy when they saw the gigantic head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m only here to borrow the path, and we won’t stay here for long. I believe that you can understand my words,” said the Sword-Bearing Elder coldly. A demonic beast of this level could understand human words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The gigantic head spat out its tongue, looking at the Sword-Bearing Elder with greed flashing in the depths of its eyes. The Sword-Bearing Elder knew that this beast must have seen through him, knowing he wasn’t at his strongest state. It was definitely here for revenge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It also probably had the intention of devouring him. Human cultivators could increase their cultivation by refining beast cores. The opposite was true for demonic beasts, they could increase their strength by consuming human cultivators. For the Thunderflame Python, the Sword-Bearing Elder was a delicacy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without giving a reply, the Thunderflame Python opened its jaw and spat out its poisonous breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You're courting death!” The Sword-Bearing Elder drew his sword. He swung his sword and split the poisonous fog apart, but that was only the beginning of the battle. Before the poisonous fog could dissipate, the Thunderflame Python shot out and fought the Sword-Bearing Elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battle was intense and all the trees within a thousand meter radius were levelled to the ground. The ground trembled and cracks spread out from the impact of their fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone else from the Sword Firmament Pavilion could only watch this battle. They weren’t qualified to participate in the battle. Even Luo Feng wasn’t on that level. At the same time, the shockwave from the fight scattered the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun soared up from the Dragon Blooded Horse. He dodged the two falling trees and threw several punches out. When his punches clashed with the sword rays and ominous aura, it created shrapnels in the air. When he landed on the ground, several more sword rays descended down like the rain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun took several more steps back and each step of his would create a huge crater on the ground. The rays were from the Sword-Bearing Elder’s attacks. After his attacks were scattered by the Thunderflame Python, the remnant attacks fell onto the Sword Firmament Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the saying went, mortals would suffer from a fight between gods. No one from the Sword Firmament Pavilion dared to be careless and they instantly spread out to avoid the attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They gathered a brief moment later and almost half of the party was injured in this short amount of time. Some unlucky disciples were heavily injured. This was mainly because the Thunderflame Python attacked without showing any signs beforehand, so the Sword Firmament Pavilion hadn’t been prepared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone looked at the battle as their faces turned white. Right at this moment, someone asked, “Elder, can’t we help the Sword-Bearing Elder?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Feng turned around and glared at the person who spoke. He questioned coldly, “Are you courting death? We can’t even take the shockwave, so how are we going to help? Even my attacks in my strongest state could barely injure this snake. You guys are courting death to go over.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words instantly caused everyone to fall silent. Lin Yun sighed because his guess was right and the Sword-Bearing Elder wasn’t in his top state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Quick. Take this opportunity to leave!” Luo Feng made a decisive decision. There was no question that it was a right decision for them to leave right now. With the Sword-Bearing Elder’s strength, it wouldn’t be a problem for him to leave anytime he wanted, but that was only if no one was dragging him down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if something happened to the Sword-Bearing Elder, it wasn’t something that they could help. This decision was a little cruel for Luo Feng, but he didn’t have a choice. He knew that the Sword-Bearing Elder would make the same decision if he was in the same spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, a dagger shot into a disciple’s forehead. When that disciple collapsed, more daggers shot out from the forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Sister, watch out!” Lin Yun’s face changed and he drew his sword in front of Xin Yan to block three daggers flying in her direction. In the next second, everyone drew their swords as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun’s face changed when he looked at those daggers. He knew that the person who launched that attack was at least in the tenth stage of the Profound Martial Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s going on?” Xin Yan was startled. Not only her, but everyone’s face had become grave as well. It was a piece of bad news for them to be attacked when the Thunderflame Python was still here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’re being ambushed,” Xin Jue said this with a grave expression while looking around. Was it a coincidence that they were ambushed while the Sword-Bearing Elder was being held up by the Thunderflame Python? No one believed that this was a coincidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it was more terrifying that it wasn’t. This meant that their opponent knew their route well. So who prepared such a meticulous plan and who was it for? Lin Yun was filled with doubts. But before he could think more about it, more cold rays shot over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s the Silverlight Bomb! Dodge them!” The Silverlight Bombs were similar to the Primal Chaos Sects’ Blackflame Crows. They were both powerful and expensive. Just one Silverlight Bomb cost 3,000 second grade spiritual jades and you couldn’t find them in the market even at that price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Luo Feng’s words were still too late because the Silverlight Bombs were too fast. When the bombs exploded, the shockwaves they caused weren't any weaker than the fight between the Sword-Bearing Elder and the Thunderflame Python.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A heatwave danced through the air and the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s formation was completely shattered. Many people died in the explosions. This scene left Lin Yun dumbfounded because that wave of bombs amounted to 200,000 second grade spiritual jades.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just who would spend such a huge sum of money to deal with the Sword Firmament Pavilion?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Lin Yun’s heart was bleeding when he looked at the dying disciples. After the explosions, their attackers dashed out from the surrounding forest, donned in black. The weakest among them was in the eighth stage of the Profound Martial Realm and there were even cultivators in the Violet Palace Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who the hell are you guys?! You guys dare to attack the Sword Firmament Pavilion?!” roared Luo Feng, but no one replied to him. There were three men keeping him occupied. None of them spoke a word as they launched their attacks at the Sword Firmament Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re courting death!” Lin Yun snorted when he saw an enemy coming at him. He stabbed his sword out without any hesitation, slaying that enemy before he could even approach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, their enemies didn’t panic at all. Very quickly, four enemies in the tenth stage came after him. They didn’t try to kill him. Rather, they were focusing on keeping him occupied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun was using the Aquaselenic Sword, which made the four who were keeping him occupied cry bitterly inside. It didn’t take long for them to be covered in injuries. But they still bit their teeth and put their lives on the line to keep Lin Yun occupied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were in the tenth stage of the Profound Martial Realm, so Lin Yun couldn’t get rid of them quickly. His eyes flickered with fury because he wanted to retrieve the Scarletflame War Flag several times, but he didn’t want to reveal his trump card so soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You idiot. What the hell are you waiting for?!” roared a black-clothed man who was keeping Luo Feng occupied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Feng could vaguely sense that something was amiss, but he was soon faced with lethal attacks the moment he let his mind wander a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the back of the battlefield, a black-clothed man held onto a cylinder. His gaze was on Xin Jue who was a thousand meters away. He knew that as long as he activated the artifact in his hand, he would be able to kill his target. It was a low-ranked cosmic artifact that could only be used once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Anyone under the Violet Palace Realm would die the moment he used it. According to the plan, he should have already used it by now, but for some reason, he didn’t because there was another person in the battlefield that attracted his attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he looked at Lin Yun, his gaze was filled with rage and hatred. As the hatred continued to accumulate in his eyes, the cylinder in his hand locked onto Lin Yun without him even realizing.</span></p>
