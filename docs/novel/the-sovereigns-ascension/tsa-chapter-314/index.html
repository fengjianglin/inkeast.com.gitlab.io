 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A boundless domineering aura surged out. The Overlord Sword was known as a forbidden technique and Lin Yun was using it to face Chang Wu and Chu Haoyu. Chu Haoyu and Chang Wu’s attacks were terrifying and even an ordinary sixth stage disciple would be instantly killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Eternal Cloud was even in complete mastery. This attack was perfect without any weakness. Many elders exclaimed in admiration when they saw Chu Haoyu’s attack. On the other hand, Chang Wu’s Firecloud Sword was only in greater mastery, but it was ultimately still a spiritual martial technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chang Wu supported the Firecloud Sword with the Firecloud Art and brought his attack to a whole new level. Chu Haoyu and Chang Wu’s attacks were actually on the same level. No one felt optimistic for Lin Yun to hold his own against the two attacks. But when Lin Yun unsheathed the Flower Burial Sword, it suddenly gave hope to the surrounding spectators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s the Overlord Sword!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But will that do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Overlord Sword was famous back then, it was even stronger than the Dragon-Tiger Fist!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples had a special feeling for the Overlord Sword, just like the Heavenly Profound Sect’s disciples had a special feeling for the Dragon-Tiger Fist. But it was a pity that no one managed to practice it in the past hundreds of years. All who tried practicing the Overlord Sword ran amok or suffered a backlash in their cultivation technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun was the only one who succeeded in the past hundreds of years. This was also the reason why his fame spread throughout the Sword Firmament Pavilion when he killed Ye Liuyun with it. It was rare for anyone to see Lin Yun using it, so the spectators couldn’t help feeling emotional at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elders were also briefly shocked before they shook their heads. The Overlord Sword was strong, but how could it compete against the Cloudstun Sword in complete mastery, especially when it was only in lesser mastery? The Cloudstun Sword was famous in the sect and the difficulty of practicing it was on the same level as Seven Profound Steps. But after reaching complete mastery, the sword technique had undergone a huge transformation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spectators watched as Lin Yun executed the Overlord Sword to face Chu Haoyu and Chang Wu. It caused a huge uproar and the two attacks paused in mid-air. The phenomenon created by both Chu Haoyu and Chang Wu’s attacks showed cracks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He actually took it head-on?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spectators were energized by this scene. But before they could even exclaim, the domineering aura from Lin Yun dissipated and the two attacks descended. The two attacks caused a huge explosion and caused the ground to tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun was defeated and fell into the sea of flames. If he couldn’t get up, then he would be incinerated into ashes by the flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Great!” Bai Ting cheered from on top of the Sword Condor. He laughed, “It’s just as I expected. Does he want to turn the tables around with the Overlord Sword only in lesser mastery? He must be dreaming!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The battle still hasn’t ended,” sneered Luo Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hasn’t ended? Even if he’s not incinerated, there’s no way he can take another attack from Chu Haoyu and Chang Wu. What can he even do now that the Overlord Sword failed?” Bai Ting sneered, “He’s going to die. I really can’t think of any other possible outcome other than dying.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just when the flame was about to devour Lin Yun, he slammed his palm on the ground, which prevented the sea of flames from covering him. He soared into the sky and stood on an ancient sword. There was no way he could last in the sea of flames even with the Dracophant Battle Physique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blood dripped from the corner of Lin Yun’s lips. Chu Haoyu and Chang Wu resumed their attacks. They didn’t want to give Lin Yun an opportunity to escape. There was nothing Lin Yun could do. If he tried anything, he would only exhaust his origin energy before dying a terrible death. But there was no way he could give up so easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had already given his promise that he would become the champion. But under this situation, the only way he could win was for the Overlord Sword to reach greater mastery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chang Wu and Chu Haoyu’s attacks were lethal, not to mention that they joined forces together. But under the crowd’s gaze, Lin Yun did something unexpected. He shut his eyes and sheathed his sword, causing the crimson petals to disappear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is he doing? Is he insane?” Everyone doubted their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s insane!” Many people shook their heads. If Lin Yun couldn’t fight with the two of them, he could give up and make a comeback in the future. But he was giving up and facing death, which was insane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is he waiting for death? Well, it’s not a terrible death to die at the hands of two elites.” Bai Ting stroked his beard on the Sword Condor with a faint smile. His smile was cold and filled with hatred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Feng, on the other hand, locked his brows together. He couldn’t be bothered with Bai Ting right now. His gaze was on Lin Yun as he fell into deep thought.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is Lin Yun trying to gain insight in his sword? But who would try to comprehend something in the middle of a fight? Is he insane?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun was naturally not insane. He was half a step away from reaching greater mastery in the Overlord Sword when he refined the Imperial Sword Herb. He already had the foundation, so he just needed some insights to spark his growth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless thoughts crossed Lin Yun’s mind when he closed his eyes. He was thinking of how to make a breakthrough in the Overlord Sword. But as he felt the two attacks from Chu Haoyu and Chang Wu descending, his heart gradually calmed down instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He would either live or die at this moment. Either he would blossom like the flowers in summer or he would die an earth-shattering death. It didn’t matter since it would be a worthy death to be buried here with the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s ancestors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a light flashed in Lin Yun’s mind.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s a sword, not a move. But a sword was also a move. Guardian Plum...you’ve really dug a huge hole for me to jump in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just when the two attacks were ten meters away from devouring him, Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes and unleashed his domineering aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s the Overlord Sword again!” The spectators were confused as to why Lin Yun used the Overlord Sword again when it had failed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a joke!” scoffed Bai Ting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait!” Luo Feng’s eyes flashed. He suddenly sensed that there was something amiss with the Overlord Sword this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It looks like you haven’t learned your lesson. There’s no way the Overlord Sword in lesser mastery can take our two attacks!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Die!” Chang Wu and Chu Haoyu’s eyes flashed. There was no trace of pity in their eyes. As origin energy fluctuated from their bodies, they swung their strongest attacks at Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who says that my Overlord Sword is only in lesser mastery?” Lin Yun’s lips rose with a faint smile. He then stabbed his sword out. His sword was filled with a boundless domineering aura, solely powered by sword intent alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a simple move, but Lin Yun’s aura had undergone a huge transformation. He was like a primordial emperor that ruled the world. Even the surrounding ancient swords were trembling in fear. This left Chu Haoyu and Chang Wu shocked. Their attacks were shredded like paper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Break!” Lin Yun finally brought the Overlord Sword to greater mastery and destroyed their attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come forth Martial Souls!” Chu Haoyu and Chang Wu spit up mouthfuls of blood. They finally lost their composure and summoned their respective martial souls. When they summoned their martial souls, their aura rose once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They’re already forced to bring out their martial souls?” The spectators exclaimed at this scene. No one had thought that the Alliance-Union Battle would require them to summon their martial souls. Although summoning the martial souls would boost their strength, any damages to the martial soul would result in eternal damages.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Injuries on the physical body could be healed, but it was not the same for martial souls. This was the reason why many people would rather be injured than summon their martial souls.</span></p>
