 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ling Yan’s aura climbed to its peak by the time he arrived at the courtyard. The door suddenly shattered and was reduced into fragments. Lin Yun was beneath a huge tree comprehending the three ultimate moves. But he opened his eyes and looked at Ling Yan as soon as the door was destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ling Yan was dressed in a blue and white robe and had an ordinary appearance. But he was giving off a sharp aura that emitted a huge pressure. Paired with his cultivation in the eighth stage, many disciples felt suffocated when Ling Yan glanced at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The high terrain was filled with disciples from the Sword Firmament Pavilion who came to watch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a powerful aura! It looks like Senior Brother Ling Yan held back when he pushed past the Locket Mountain’s disciples.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, this must be Senior Brother Ling Yan’s true strength.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He was an unstoppable force when he entered the Locket Mountain. He didn’t even need to draw his sword. He’s being underestimated since he is ranked tenth.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How do you think Lin Yun will respond?” Everyone looked at this scene with excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun frowned his eyebrows when he heard the discussions in the surrounding. He never expected that Ling Yan would come looking for him. Didn’t Ling Yan know that it was rude to disrupt someone who was cultivating?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If you disrupted a swordsman at a crucial moment, you couldn’t be blamed if you got killed. Lin Yun suppressed the killing intent in his heart and looked at Ling Yan. He was waiting for the other party to provide a reason for the disruption.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I apologize for disturbing you, but I need a reason for your refusal to accept my challenge.” Ling Yan looked at Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no reason. I just don’t wish to fight you,” replied Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Very well. I also don’t wish to fight you. I just want the quota for the Demonlotus Realm, but I don’t want others to talk behind my back about it. So I’m here to defeat you,” declared Ling Yan pridefully as he drew his sword. His aura spread out like a ripple and a sword ray shot towards Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun jumped and immediately took more than ten steps back. When he regained his footing, the tree that he was sitting next to was snapped in two. Everyone was shocked by the power behind the sword. If Lin Yun was slightly slower, he would be cleaved in two just like the tree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re truly a genius to dodge my attack so easily. If I wasn’t a few years older than you, I wouldn’t have the confidence to defeat you.” Ling Yan’s eyes blazed with fighting spirit. It seemed that his trip wasn’t in vain and he could only prove that he had the qualification to the Demonlotus Realm by defeating Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Take another sword of mine!” Ling Yan charged at Lin Yun. His figure moved and his origin energy rippled. It gathered onto the sword and formed a sword ray.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This attack made many people exclaim out of admiration. “Brilliant!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wow, I wouldn’t be able to see that sword if my eyesight was slightly worse.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s gathering a thunderclap with his origin energy pouring it into his sword.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Yun’s aura is completely suppressed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ling Yan’s face was smug. His sword was about to devour Lin Yun, but at that moment, Lin Yun frowned. He was sighing at this moment. He wanted to retaliate, but he recalled his promise to Xin Yan. He circulated the Seven Profound Steps and dodged the attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ling Yan was ranked tenth on the Earth Ranking. But when his sword aura landed on Lin Yun’s body, it didn’t even scratch Lin Yun’s skin due to the Dracophant Battle Physique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You want to dodge? Can you even dodge this?” Ling Yan snorted and swung his sword once more, which produced another thunderclap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blink of an eye, Ling Yan swung more than ten swords, one more ruthless than the other. The spectators had no idea what was actually going on and thought that Lin Yun wasn’t Ling Yan’s match.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Yun’s cultivation is still one stage lower.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But we can’t say that Lin Yun is weak. At the very least, it’s impressive that he managed to withstand so many attacks from Senior Brother Ling Yan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That might be so, but it’s still a pity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Brother Lin Yun is still too young. He just needs more time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people looked disappointed as they shook their heads inwardly. Suddenly, the crowd exclaimed and sucked in a cold breath because Lin Yun was nearly cut in two at the waist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun managed to avoid the attack, but it left a wound on his face. Facing Ling Yan, Lin Yun touched his injury and locked his brows together. When Ling Yan sensed the emotions fluctuating from Lin Yun, he squinted his eyes in excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thundercloud Break!” Ling Yan charged forward accompanied by rumbling lighting that was about to devour Lin Yun whole. He was too quick and his attacks sealed every path of retreat for Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Along with a shocking momentum, Ling Yan burst into laughter, “Fight back. Otherwise, there’s no meaning in me winning. At the very least, you still have a chance to retaliate.” He was pretty confident about his attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As you wish.” Lin Yun summoned the Flower Burial Sword and his gaze changed, unleashing his quasi-xiantian sword intent. When Lin Yun drew his sword, everyone saw an unbelievable scene. An indescribable sword gleam blossomed from Lin Yun like the moon was being reflected on him. He was like a moon that shined brightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to Lin Yun’s sword aura, Ling Yan’s sword aura was like a firefly. The firefly couldn’t compare to the moon and was instantly extinguished. The sword in Ling Yan’s hand was sent flying away and stabbed the wall. Ling Yan was blown away and a fist-sized crater was left on his chest with blood flowing out. His face turned pale and he looked at Lin Yun in horror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I didn’t draw my sword because I don’t want to win. I don’t need you to give me any chances,” said Lin Yun, which left Ling Yan dumbfounded. Lin Yun was simply too strong. He thought that Lin Yun couldn’t draw his sword under his attack, but the truth was much worse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The observing disciples were dumbfounded and disbelief filled their eyes. When they recovered from their shock, they looked at Lin Yun with revere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That was too powerful. How can a sword be so terrifying?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That looks like the ultimate move from the Aquaselenic Sword, Luminous Moon. I’ve seen someone use it before, but it’s a lot weaker than Junior Brother Lin’s.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother Ling’s attacks failed to injure Junior Brother Lin, while Junior Brother Lin only used one attack to defeat Senior Brother Ling…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Brother Lin definitely has ability since he became so famous in the Great Qin Empire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We misjudged the situation.” Many people sighed because they never expected that the battle would end so quickly once Lin Yun drew his sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, a few people flew out with cold killing intent in their eyes. It was Xin Yan and everyone else who went into seclusion to make preparations for the Demonlotus Realm. They rushed over immediately when they heard the news. But when they saw Ling Yan’s sorry appearance, their faces changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s going on?” The killing intent disappeared from Xin Yan’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before anyone could reply, a few people descended from the sky. It was Guardian Plum and the seven Sword-Bearing Elders.</span></p>
