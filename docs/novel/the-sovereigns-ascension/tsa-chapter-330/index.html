 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Deep at night, when the moon hung high in the sky, Lin Yun was slowly opening his eyes. He had just finished refining his origin energy with the Age Sutra and his eyes glowed like two bright gems.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although his origin energy was refined when he reached the pinnacle sixth stage with the Dragonflame Fruit, his foundation wasn’t stable. This was the reason why Lin Yun tempered his origin energy with the Age Sutra. With the Dragonflame Fruit’s medicinal effect, there wouldn’t be an obstruction even if Lin Yun tried to make a breakthrough into the seventh stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the Great Qin Empire, the Dragonflame Fruit was rare. The eight titles all had a solid background, but they still needed luck to encounter a Dragonflame Fruit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun didn’t think that he would be involved in so many troubles at the banquet, which ruined his mood to sleep. He took out the Aquaselenic Sword book and started looking through it, hoping to bring the Aquaselenic Sword to complete mastery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Aquaselenic Sword was definitely the most underrated sword technique in the Sword Firmament Pavilion. Lin Yun soon lost himself in his comprehension. When he woke up, he frowned with doubt. He had run into a barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the gentle moonlight shined through the window, Lin Yun got up and looked around. Several branches were hanging down outside the courtyard as the moon was reflected in the lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a spectacular scene to see two moons, one was in the sky and the other was reflected on the lake. He had a feeling that this lake wasn’t just an ordinary lake. The maid was right. This courtyard was truly the best place to admire the moon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a thought flashed through Lin Yun’s mind. He waved his hand and barked, “Sword!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sword box suddenly opened and the Flower Burial Sword flew out. Grabbing onto the sword, Lin Yun slowly overcame the problems that troubled him in the Aquaselenic Sword. A surging sword intent was suddenly released from Lin Yun. It felt as though he was a butterfly breaking through its cocoon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, a cloud streaked over and covered the moon. Suddenly, the surrounding became dark without the slightest moonlight. But Lin Yun grabbed onto something right at this moment. When he swung his sword, it seemed as if two moons were shining brightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Terrifying sword intent escaped from Lin Yun like a wind, which made the branches sway. The elders staying in the nearby courtyards also opened their eyes. They felt a powerful sword intent just a moment ago. The sword intent was pure and untainted like the clear moon. But the sword intent soon settled down just when they wanted to look for the source.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a powerful sword intent. He’s probably coming in contact with innate sword intent. Since when was there such a monstrous genius in the Great Qin Empire?” A black-clothed elderly man muttered to himself. His gaze was directed at the residence that Lin Yun was stayng in. Not long after, the old man closed his eyes. Many people in the manor felt the sword intent, but only this old man managed to track back to Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun sheathed his sword and took a deep breath. His eyes were clear now. The trouble he was facing with the Aquaselenic Sword finally became understandable. He finally resolved the last doubt he had with Aquaselenic Sword. But with the Moonless Water, it wouldn’t take long for him to bring it to complete mastery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My sword intent seems to have improved.” Lin Yun drew the curtains and fell asleep. Later, the early dawn light shot through the window and lit up the entire house. The manor was bustling with people, and the scene was even more spectacular after what happened yesterday.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bloomphoenix Princess isn’t the same. I heard that the four prestigious clans all sent a representative for this event.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s for sure. Who’s the Bloomphoenix Princess?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As the saying goes, there’s no way two tigers can remain on the same mountain. Everyone who came with us is extraordinary and it isn’t easy to meet some of them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The elites from the third sequence, along with the sect’s little monsters, are all here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey, did you guys hear about what happened last night? I heard that someone’s sword intent reached the borders of innate sword intent. Isn’t that terrifying? After all, not even the eight titles have accomplished this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun listened to the surrounding discussion as he walked by. The sword intent’s cultivation was differentiated into nine levels. The first level was the innate sword intent. Any sword intent beneath innate wasn't as effective as one’s cultivation, cultivation techniques, or martial techniques when it came to battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only by reaching innate sword intent could the sword intent’s prowess begin to show. This was also the terrifying fact about swordsmen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But there weren’t many treasures capable of aiding the comprehension of sword intent. Even reaching the Violet Palace Realm and Heavenly Soul Realm wasn’t as shocking as comprehending the innate sword intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it was rumoured that you could comprehend the complete innate sword intent upon reaching the ninth heavens in the Myriad Sword Diagram. But that was a feat that not many could achieve, so it gradually faded as a legend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I gained some insight into sword intent yesterday, and I didn’t think that I'd cause such a commotion.” Now that Lin Yun thought about it, he was in a profound state when he saw the two moons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Brother!” Xin Yan’s voice sounded out. When Lin Yun turned around, he saw Xin Yan, Xin Jue, and Luo Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It didn’t take long for Tang Tong, Wang Zheng, and Yan DIng to arrive as well. When they came, Luo Feng smiled, “Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The massive manor was filled with people. The Great Qin Empire was also known as the Hundred Counties. Many forces came, in addition to the four prestigious sects. As one of the four prestigious sects, Lin Yun had a clear feeling of the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s towering position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The crowd looked at them with reverence and moved aside. Lin Yun was familiar with this scene because he was just like them two years ago. Back in the Azure Sun County, he was filled with respect for the Sword Firmament Pavilion and Demonic Moon Villa’s disciples; he didn’t dare to offend them back then. But today, god knows how many outer and inner disciples he had defeated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There will be a sparring session at the banquet. You guys have to be careful of that. Don’t push yourselves. The sect’s face isn’t as important as your lives,” said Luo Feng. People would tend to hold back when it came to sparring, but accidents were unavoidable, not to mention that some cultivators had malicious intentions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Especially you. Don’t risk your life like how you did back in the Alliance-Union Battle.” Luo Feng turned to look at Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Yan smiled, “Elder Luo, you don’t have to worry about our junior brother. Unless it’s someone at the same level as Big Brother, it won’t be easy for anyone to kill him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Feng smiled when he heard that. He was relatively confident in Lin Yun’s strength. He was even looking forward to how Lin Yun would perform at the banquet. But he still had to warn him as he was the elder that was accompanying them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The banquet was held at the island located in the lake that wasn’t too far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Tong suddenly asked, “Elder, people are saying that something big happened last night. I heard that all the Violet Palace Realm’s elders were alarmed last night.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Feng’s smile disappeared when he heard that. Xin Jue also spoke out, “I also vaguely sensed the sword intent last night. It shouldn’t be fake.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It wasn’t fake,” said Luo Feng with a grave expression. Luo Feng sighed and shook his head. “The sword intent was released from the guest residences. It doesn’t belong to an elder, yet this person is so terrifying. His sword intent even startled me. Let’s hope that he doesn’t belong to any of the three sects.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words made the faces of Tang Tong, and everyone else changed. They were shocked because they never thought that the rumor would be real.</span></p>
