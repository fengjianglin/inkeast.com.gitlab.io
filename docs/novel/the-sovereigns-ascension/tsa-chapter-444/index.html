Bai Lixuan advanced smoothly in the first round, and he didn’t even reveal his Saint Physique. But there was no question that he was the center of attention in the Great Qin Empire. After all, who wouldn’t be curious about the Saint Physique’s power?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Zuo Yun, many people only felt that he was qualified to fight Bai Lixuan. Everyone was more curious to see how far Zuo Yun could force Bai Lixuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sensing all the gazes directed over, Zuo Yun maintained his calm composure. He knew what everyone was thinking. When he slowly stretched his hands out of his sleeves, his palms were filled with callus. This was a sign of someone who put great effort in his training.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bai Lixuan, I’ll be fighting with all my strength no matter what the outcome will be. Watch out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Lixuan slowly opened his eyes, and he nodded at Zuo Yun, “The Sword Firmament Pavilion’s Bai Lixuan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next second, two massive surges of origin energy exploded out on the stage. The two of them didn’t face off for too long before Zuo Yun stomped his foot on the ground, leaving an afterimage behind and he drew out his saber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he drew out his saber, he left behind an afterimage in the sky, and he disappeared. His movement technique was so fast that it couldn’t be followed with naked eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at Zuo Yun who disappeared, Bai Lixuan’s eyes became seriou, and he dodged to the side. In the next second, a saber stabbed through Bai Lixuan’s afterimage along with an explosion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What speed!” The speed of that attack startled everyone, and those weaker once couldn’t see how Bai Lixuan managed to dodge that attack. His saber was fast, but Bai Lixuan’s sword was faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Bai Lixuan landed on the ground, a sword ray flew out, stabbing at the wrist of the hand Zuo Yun used to wield his saber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But just when the sword ray was about to stab Zuo Yun’s wrist, the saber turned around and stabbed at Bai Lixuan’s wrist instead. Sparks flew when the sword and saber clashed together, and the two weapons were aimed at each other’s throat next with killing aura brimming in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ferocious clash made everyone take in a cold breath because the two of them were too ferocious. This was only just beginning, and they were already fighting with their lives on the line. None of them were taking a step back, and this meant that they would both die if their attacks connected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Were they betting who was faster? But the price was too great if any of them lost. This instantly made the bustling plaza silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But just when the two weapons were about to reach each other’s throat, Zuo Yun and Bai Lixuan used their left hand to knock the saber and sword away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two palms exploded with great power, but Bai Lixuan was clearly in the upper hand with his cultivation. He remained unmoving under that palm, while Zuo Yun was sent flying. When Zuo Yun was in mid-air, he summoned his dracophant energy and started emitting the ferocious aura of a beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two were evenly matched with another clash, and they both took three steps back. But they soon dashed forth and clashed again, leaving behind the sounds of their clashing booming in the air. They were both using all sorts of techniques that blinded many people’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spectators were all focused. They didn’t dare to miss out any details. The saber and sword were all aimed at each other’s lethal spots, and this battle was more exciting than everyone had imagined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They’re still probing each other?” Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts. In his view, this ferocious clash was just the two of them probing each other’s strength. But the two were truly powerful to cause such commotion from probing alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re worthy of being the only person who achieved the Saint Physique in the past millennia,” said Zuo Yun when he landed on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re not too bad yourself,” said Bai Lixuan. Zuo Yun was stronger than the rumors, especially his saber technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve said that I’ll go all out to fight for the victory,” said Zuo Yun with a grave expression. He clearly wasn’t willing to stop at the best thirty-two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fiendcloud Seal!” Zuo Yun roared and his dracophant energy suddenly released a crimson glow that covered his body. Simultaneously, his aura instantly reached the Violet Palace Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the crimson glow stabilized, Zuo Yun’s eyes flashed coldly, and he dashed forth with his saber. Infusing his origin energy into this attack, his saber tore through the air and created a ghostly howl. This move made everyone shocked because Bai Lixuan’s sword aura was actually being suppressed by this attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Lixuan took several steps back from the clash, and when he took four steps back, the Thunderclap Sword finally unfolded, and he finally held his ground firmly. This made Lin Yun shocked because he never expected that Bai Lixuan actually chose the same sword technique as Xin Jue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Yun could tell that Bai Lixuan had reached deep attainments in the Thunderclap Sword, but even so, his aura was still slightly weaker. On the other hand, Zuo Yun was like an ancient beast after using the Fiendcloud Seal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This proved that you couldn’t underestimate anyone in the Dragon Gate Competition, and everyone has their own trump cards. The slightest carelessness would just get you eliminated from the competition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zuo Yun’s saber became even more ferocious, which caught Bai Lixuan by surprise and sent him flying. This made Zuo Yun finally see an opportunity, and his aura reached the peak. Before his saber even descended down, the entire stage was already dyed red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This made Bai Lixuan who was sent flying out felt threatened. But he landed on the ground calmly, and he shook his head, “A secret technique is ultimately a secret technique. Thunderclap Crusher!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Lixuan’s eyes lit up, and his aura surged all of a sudden. Facing Zuo Yun’s attack, he stabbed his sword out that shot through the horizon like a bolt of lightning. The spectators were only able to see a bolt of lightning flashing across the stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While in mid-air, Zuo Yun threw out a mouthful of blood with disbelief in his eyes. A sword had cut through his demonized skin on his chest with blood splattering out. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t swing his sword down at Bai Lixuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Bai Lixuan sheathed his sword, Zuo Yun’s chest was torn apart with him sent flying. When Zuo Yun landed on the ground, he returned to his normal appearance as he clutched onto his chest and looked at Bai Lixuan with reluctance. He clearly had a chance to win this fight, but the tables were turned all of a sudden. He still couldn’t figure out how he failed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You still don’t understand. It’s just as I’ve said. Strength brought to you by secret techniques doesn’t belong to you, and you’ve already lost the moment you used it,” said Bai Lixuan. His tone was indifferent, and his words were ruthless. This made the spectators sighed as they felt pity for Zuo Yun. After all, Zuo Yun was just one step away from winning.</span></p>
