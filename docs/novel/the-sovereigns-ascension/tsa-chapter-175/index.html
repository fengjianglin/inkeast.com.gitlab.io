 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Ning smirked when he heard the commotion. He had finally gotten back at Lin Yun. Lin Yun was truly impudent to come to the Sword Firmament Pavilion. When the uproar gradually grew louder, the middle-aged man roared to control the disturbance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fwoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the Elders turned to look at Xin Yan with shock in their eyes. If what Wang Ning said was true, giving a seeded candidate quota to a Sword Slave was laughable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Talents had gathered in the capital from a different hundred counties. The four sects and Heavenly Qin Institute were recruiting at the same time. So, the slightest disturbance would sweep through the whole capital.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the Great Qin Empire, the Sword Firmament Pavilion was known as the holy land of swordsmen. If news got out that they gave a seeded candidate quota to a Sword Slave, they would become a laughing stock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aside from Li Wuyou, the youths who stood behind Xin Yan wore an odd expression as they moved away from Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is he speaking the truth?” An Elder questioned Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I guess so. It was true that I was a Sword Slave for a period of time.” Lin Yun never considered the fact that he was once a Sword Slave to be taboo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then why are you still standing here? To embarrass yourself?” Wang Ning barked coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Sister Xin Yan, your eyesight is a little too poor. Why don’t your candidates go and join the queue?” To begin with, Wang Yan did not have a good relationship with Xin Yan. So he would naturally savor this opportunity to embarrass her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Listening to Wang Yan’s words, the faces of Li Xiaotian and the youths around him started to change. When they looked at Lin Yun, there was a hint of unhappiness in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shut up!” Xin Yan’s face turned cold. She glared at Wang Yan and retorted, “So what if he was a Sword Slave? The Sword Firmament Pavilion has never been concerned with our disciples’ background during recruitment. Elder Luo Feng also came from a humble background. Are you guys saying that Elder Luo Feng should leave the pavilion as well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Ning was frightened by Xin Yan’s words. He immediately shut his mouth. Even Luo Feng did not speak and only watched how the situation would develop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Yan calmed down and sneered, “Don’t try to slander us. As a senior, Elder Luo Feng naturally knows that we don’t mean that. It’s true that the Sword Firmament Pavilion doesn’t pay attention to our disciples’ origin, but what about their aptitude? Didn’t you hear my younger brother say that he has a terrible aptitude?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Mortal Physique was usually considered trash. But even the Mortal Physique was separated into different grades. Some weaker sects would also accept Mortal Physiques as their disciples because of this. But as for the four prominent sects, Mortal Physiques couldn’t catch their attention. They were even strict with Spiritual Physiques.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Elders on the stage all had their own opinion, but they kept their silence since Luo Feng did not speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Yun, have you tested your aptitude?” Xin Yan turned to look at Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve never tested my aptitude, but it’s true that my aptitude is terrible.” Lin Yun replied honestly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe. How do you know about that if you’ve never tested your aptitude?” Xin Yan chuckled as she loosened up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why would he become a Sword Slave if his aptitude wasn’t terrible? How naive.” Wang Ning sneered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Utter another word and I’ll tear your mouth apart!” Xin Yan’s face turned dark. She looked at Wang Ning coldly, sending a chill down his spine and causing him to hide behind Wang Yan. He was startled by Xin Yan’s ferocity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But besides that, her figure was truly impressive. If he had an opportunity, he would never let her go. As Wang Ning looked at Xin Yan’s figure, his imagination began to run wild. He was afraid of Xin Yan’s strength, so he could only peek at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Wang Yan wasn’t afraid of Xin Yan. With a hypocritical smile, he looked at Lin Yun and Xin Yan saying, “Then let’s have a test. As long as Junior Sister Xin Yan isn’t afraid of being humiliated.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come with me.” Xin Yan led Lin Yun to the front of the queue. She nodded her head at the middle-aged man and walked Lin Yun to the stone platform. There was a crystal orb on the stone platform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Yun, this is the Spiritual Orb. All you have to do is inject your spiritual energy into the orb. You can test your aptitude with it. If you have a Mortal Physique, you won’t be able to light up the orb. But if the orb lights up, then you have a Spiritual Physique. The stronger the light, the higher the grade.” Xin Yan smiled at Lin Yun while leading him to the orb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun was touched by her actions and smiled, “Senior Sister Xin Yan, have you ever considered that I have a trash physique? If that’s the case, you’ll end up as a laughingstock to everyone here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone in the queue looked at Lin Yun. As for Wang Ning, he wore a sneer on his lips. He definitely wouldn’t let Lin Yun off so easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t say that. Since I’m the one who brought you here, I’m naturally responsible for you,” said Xin Yan sincerely to Lin Yun. She was rather fond of Lin Yun, but not in a romantic sense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She noticed Lin Yun’s pure gaze when she first met him. His gaze was pure even when he was looking at her. Xin Yan had met many people over the years, but someone like Lin Yun was rare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone had a scar or an unbearable past in their hearts. What Wang Ning did was uncover Lin Yun’s wound and rubbed salt on it. If someone else was standing in Lin Yun’s position, they would’ve already collapsed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Lin Yun was still as calm as before. When Xin Yan saw this scene, she couldn’t help feeling a little ache in her heart for him. After all, she was the one who brought Lin Yun over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What Wang Ning said was true. My aptitude is truly terrible. Originally, I was thinking of grasping a complete sword intent before coming to the capital. Perhaps, through that method, I would have been exempt from the Sword Firmament Pavilion requirements, but I’m probably thinking too much. So Senior Sister Xin Yan doesn't have to force the issue.” Lin Yun already knew that Wang Yan was purposely trying to make him take the test. He wanted to embarrass Xin Yan in public.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But you’ve never taken an aptitude test before, right?” Xin Yan smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah,” responded Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then take the test. I’m not afraid of embarrassment. I just don’t want you to leave any regrets behind.” Xin Yan did not give Lin Yun the opportunity to decline. Putting Lin Yun’s hand on the Spiritual Orb, Xin Yan smiled, “Go for it, tiger.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Facing her goodwill, Lin Yun wasn’t in any position to decline. Since that was the case, he had to take the test. He was also curious about his aptitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun began to circulate the Iris Sword Sutra. Wisps of violet spiritual energy poured into the Spiritual Orb through his palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His spiritual energy disappeared the moment he poured it into the Spiritual Orb. It was like a droplet entering a vast ocean. There was no reaction from the Spiritual Orb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was it too little?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;It didn’t make any sense for there to be no reaction. Even if he had a Mortal Physique, the Spiritual Orb should at least tremble. After briefly pondering, a pedal of the Iris Flower in his body opened up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spiritual energy in the Spiritual Orb suddenly increased. But even so, there was no response from the Spiritual Orb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So he really has a shitty physique…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wow. Even those with First Grade Spiritual Physique were eliminated. But someone with a shitty physique came to register for the Sword Firmament Pavilion.” A commotion broke out among the crowd when they saw no response from the Spiritual Orb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Up on the platform, Wang Yan smiled, “It looks like this brat really has a shitty physique.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why else would he be a Sword Slave for two years if it wasn’t for his shitty physique?” Wang Ning had ridiculement on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is great. This woman has been going against me in the sect. Now, I finally have something against her.” Wang Yan sneered. “As long as this brat truly has a shitty physique, I’ll be able to file a complaint against her. At the very least, I can get her confined for a month. If news got out that she mispicked a seeded candidate, it will make her a laughingstock.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother, we can’t keep that brat around…” Wang Ning warned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He killed so many people of my Wang Clan in the Azure Sun Realm, so how can we leave him around? After he’s asked to leave, you can have your fun torturing him.” Wang Yan smiled. He was clearly not bothered by Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But all of a sudden, the Spiritual Orb suddenly released a violet brilliance. Lin Yun was shocked. He could sense a strand of aura entering the Spiritual Orb from the six orifices around his chest. The purple Spiritual Orb began to release a light halo. It was the sign of First Grade Spiritual Physique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s still trash!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But his spiritual physique seems really refined from the tint of red in the orb.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No matter what, that’s only the First Grade Spiritual Physique. That’s still beneath the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s standard.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Spiritual Orb released another halo. The violet radiance that it was giving off began to dazzle. Strands of aura seeped out from his seven orifice into the Spiritual Orb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun immediately understood what was going on. It must be the Seventh Orifice Exquisite Pellet that Su Ziyao gave him. His aptitude had already changed after refining the Seventh Orifice Exquisite Pellet, causing him to undergo a huge change. Even he had no idea that his aptitude had changed drastically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A ring of halos continued to light up, eventually stopping at seven halos. At the same time, the Iris Flower in his Dantian started to blossom, unleashing dazzling purple brilliance. The Spiritual Orb began to dazzle, releasing dreamy ripples into the surrounding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s the Seventh Grade Spiritual Physique!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Damn it! How is that possible?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Wang brothers were both dumbfounded. Wang Ning, who was so confident that Lin Yun had a trash physique was completely stupefied. The ring of halos were like slaps to his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the thirty petals of the Iris Flower blossomed in his Dantian, the Spiritual Orb suddenly exploded. Everyone was startled and reflexively crouched down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A powerful wave of incomplete sword intent beyond their control started emitting from Lin Yun, causing the surrounding swords to buzz. Lin Yun’s hair fluttered in the wind and he looked elegant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Up on the stage, Wang Ning’s face turned pale. He knew that he was in deep trouble. Even Li Xiaotian and the rest who distanced themselves from Lin Yun had a brilliant display on their faces. All of them had disbelief on their faces along with regret. Only Li Wuyou and Xin Yan had &nbsp;bright smiles on their faces.</span></p>
