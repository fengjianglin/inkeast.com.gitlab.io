In the next second, a silver lightning bolt tore through the thunderclouds and descended in his direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is this a test?” But in Lin Yun’s eyes, the silver bolt of lightning looked more like a sword instead. Without any hesitation, Lin Yun circulated his origin energy to protect himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the lightning struck his body, he trembled, and he could also feel the shake in his internal organs. When the bolt of lightning made of sword intent coursed through his body, it felt like countless swords smashing onto him, and the pain he felt came from the sword intent in the lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is…!” Lin Yun was shocked to realise that the sword intent contained traces of pure spiritual energy. But since this place was created with sword intent, then it wasn’t surprising to find spiritual energy here. The bolt of lightning was a test, and at the same time, it was also his opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he circulated the Iris Sword Sutra, the purple origin energy coursing through his body violently was swiftly being devoured. When the Iris Flower sensed the sword intent mixed with spiritual energy, it seemed rather excited. It was just like how Lin Yun refined the Swordcloud Cores back in the Union-Alliance Battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lord Thirteen is right. This place is an opportunity for me, except that it’s a little painful,” smiled Lin Yun bitterly. The name ‘Sword Burial’ was well-deserved here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After being struck by the bolts of lightning several times, Lin Yun gradually calmed down. He realized that the sword intent here was extremely nourishing to the Iris Flower, and he had no idea when was the last time he made a breakthrough in the Iris Sword Sutra.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He even refined two Violet Palace Realm beast cores, but his Iris Sword Sutra still showed no signs of making a breakthrough. He had no idea how much resources he needed to make a breakthrough, and this place was an opportunity for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the spiritual energy contained in the sword intent was too little. Lin Yun soon changed his mind to his cultivation instead. He was already in the pinnacle ninth stage, and he would have a higher odds of winning if he could reach the tenth stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he couldn’t make a breakthrough with the Iris Sword Sutra, then he would rather give it a try in his cultivation. After Lin Yun made his decision, he absorbed the spiritual energy in the sword intent into his nine profound veins.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he guided the spiritual energy, the spiritual energy charged through his nine profound veins. But the spiritual energy from the sword intent was too dangerous, and it wasn’t easy to control it. Aside from that, he also had to maintain the origin energy to protect his body. So Lin Yun was practically multitasking at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sensing the violent sword intent, Lin Yun took a deep breath and continued to activate the platform beneath him. The platform continued to guide bolts of lightning down from the thunderclouds which light up this dark world at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the lightning exploded on the surface of Lin Yun’s body, he could sense the endlessly spiritual energy entering his body. He gnashed his teeth and bore the pain. Simultaneously, he used his origin energy to refine the spiritual energy to make a breakthrough in his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not enough…” The reason why Lin Yun was able to make a breakthrough previously was because he was already in the ninth stage to begin with before he crippled one of his profound vein. But making a breakthrough to the tenth stage was an entirely different concept. It wouldn’t be any easier than making a breakthrough in the Iris Sword Sutra.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go for it!” Lin Yun made a decision. Just when more bolts of lightning were about to descend, Lin Yun removed the origin energy he maintained to protect himself and used his physical body to withstand the violent lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If anyone was here to see Lin Yun, they would definitely be shocked. Out in the Sword Burial Woods, Lord Thirteen, who was busy cooking the fish, frowned his eyebrows when he saw a bamboo snapping all of a sudden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s that brat doing?” Lord Thirteen instantly felt a headache as he wondered if the beast core he gave to Lin Yun could save his life. Logically speaking, it should allow Lin Yun to come out of the secret realm safely, but it was a different thing if Lin Yun pushed himself too far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then again, if he knows how to control himself, he wouldn’t have come this far.” A bitter smile appeared on Lord Thirteen’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back in the secret realm, Lin Yun was practically on the edge of fainting from the bolts of lightning descending down. But he was able to withstand it all with his powerful physique. Without any origin energy to protect his body, he could sense the sword intent and spiritual energy entering his body from all directions. The amount was ten times from what he absorbed previously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go for it. Otherwise, I won’t be able to make a breakthrough to the tenth stage.” After Lin Yun made up his mind, he circulated the Iris Sword Sutra and guided the massive spiritual energy into his profound veins. As he continued the process, he could sense a crack in his bottleneck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With more spiritual energy entering his body, his physical body was healing at a rapid pace to be prepared for the next bolt of lightning. He knew that it would all be easier after he endured the first batch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two days later, Lin Yun was covered in a purple glow on the platform. His eyes were closed, but the purple light emitted from him were all sword intent. It wasn’t from the bolts of lightning, but it was because there was too much sword intent within his body that they started leaking out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t this obvious in the beginning, but it was like a cocoon two days later that enveloped his body. But even so, the bolts of lightning still continued to deliver spiritual energy into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when the energy within Lin Yun’s body reached the limit even for the Dracophant Battle Physique, Lin Yun opened his eyes by a small gap, “Time to make a breakthrough.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regardless if he would succeed or fail, Lin Yun knew that it was time for him to make a decision. When Lin Yun opened his eyes fully, lightning coursed through his pupils, and the sword intent around him was so dense that it could even pierce through the clouds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the thunderclouds tumbling in the sky, Lin Yun no longer felt afraid by it anymore. He merely glanced at it before he closed his body to circulate the massive origin energy gathered within his body to his profound veins, shattering everything that stood in his way. It didn’t take long for him to reach the final hurdle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With all the petals bloomed, the Iris Flower emitted a dazzling radiance that made Lin Yun seem like an ancient sword stabbed into the ground. When the Iris Flower blossomed, it resonated with the heaven and earth, emitting a ferocious roar that belonged to the flower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a crack, the final hurdle shattered, and his profound veins lit up subsequently before the massive energy within Lin Yun’s body condensed into the tenth profound vein. Facing the surging energy, the tenth profound vein devoured them greedily, and it took half an hour for Lin Yun to stabilize his cultivation in the tenth stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, the violent sword intent and spiritual energy disappeared. Even the Iris Flower was closing its petals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Basked in the overflowing purple light, Lin Yun finally reopened his eyes again after a long time. His gaze was sharp, looking as dazzling as the stars in the sky. In the next second, a powerful energy coursed through his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Yun let out a long breath, and he could clearly sense that the origin energy stored in his body was twice the amount of before. He knew that he had finally made a breakthrough, and he now had more confidence about walking down the competition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With an arc rising on his lips, Lin Yun was glad that he made a breakthrough. It was also thanks to the Dracophant Battle Physique that strengthened his body greatly. The amount of energy he absorbed previously was so massive that anyone else in his position would be torn into pieces.</span></p>
