 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth who walked in had black hair and blue eyes. He had a perfect face and an aloof temperament. He was giving off immense pressure when he looked around the hall. Even some elders in the Violet Palace Realm felt fearful when they saw him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Greetings, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We greet the crown prince!” The elders and disciples immediately got up and cupped their hands. On the other hand, the greetings by the four prestigious sects were more tame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That youth was Qin Yu, the Great Qin Empire’s crown prince. He was also the Flying Feather of the eight titles. Not only did he have a noble status, but he also had strength comparable to the titles. Since none of the titles were present, there wasn’t anyone who could suppress him among the younger generation. So his arrival naturally caught everyone’s attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How powerful… He’s clearly not in the Violet Palace Realm, but he’s giving off an aura even stronger than those who have just entered the Violet Palace Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Speaking of which, the prince does have a record of killing someone in the Violet Palace Realm, using only ten moves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The royal clan’s foundation is really apparent through him. He has a greater advantage than the others in the eight titles.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After forming the Violet Palace, it was easy to suppress cultivators in the Profound Martial Realm. After all, the gulf between the Violet Palace Realm and Profound Martial Realm was great. Naturally, it was shocking that someone in the Profound Martial Realm could kill a Violet Palace Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no way the elders of the four prestigious clans would be respectful to a prince, but no one dared to look down on Qin Yu. Even Lin Yun locked his brows together. He could sense something unusual with Xin Yan and Xin Jue’s reactions when Qin Yu made his appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No need to stand on ceremony. Please, sit.” His words alone drove deep pressure into the crowd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Today is my younger sister’s birthday. It has been five years since she had a birthday celebration, and your presence brings light to this humble dwelling.” Qin Yu wore a playful smile. There was nothing wrong with his words, but it felt weird for some reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun fell into deep thought and figured that Qin Yu must have a bad relationship with the princess. Then again, that sounded about right. The princess’ birthday was something that all the sects were invited to, becoming something of an annual festival.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The crown prince was a competitor for the throne, so it was natural for him to have resentment towards the princess. It had been five years since the last birthday banquet was held, so he must be here to probe his younger sister and to intimidate her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu was satisfied with the respect he was receiving. In the last five years, his prestige had reached the highest height in the Great Qin Empire and no one could compete with him. He was just here to see if there were any geniuses worth recruiting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s begin the banquet. My sister will be here soon.” Qin Yu smiled before he retreated to the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It didn’t take long for the gate to open again. This time, a slender figure walked in, attracting everyone’s attention. It was a woman in a white dress with pearly white skin. However, everyone was disappointed when they looked at her face. It was just as the rumors had said. The princess wore a veil that covered half of her face. Only her bewitching eyes were revealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were two people walking alongside her. The one on the left was the Heavenly Profound Sect’s Drifting Goblet and the right was an old man dressed in grey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It has been five years since we last met. I’m grateful that everyone here can join me for my birthday celebration today.” The princess bowed. She went to her seat, which signified the beginning of the banquet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The banquet started with a dance performance that riled up the atmosphere. The dancers weren’t mortals. All of them had decent cultivation, after all, they were artists raised by the Princess Manor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The disciples of the various sects looked at the performance with focused eyes, but their hearts soon calmed down. Everyone knew that the performance was nothing. The main event was at the very end, where the disciples would spar with one another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone here had their own thoughts about wanting to become famous through the sparring session. The Primal Origin Sect’s Wen Yanbo raised his cup to Luo Feng from afar with a sinister smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Jue merely threw a glance over before saying, “It will probably start soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Be careful later on and don’t be careless,” muttered Luo Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the disciples nodded their heads. Right at this moment, Xin Yan suddenly spoke out, “Junior Brother, you have to watch out. The Heavenly Qin Institute’s Cao Jie, Divine Guards’ Yue Qing, Primal Origin Sect’s Zuo Yun, Heavenly Profound Sect’s Bai Yu, and that Situ Yi have looked at you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No worries,” replied Lin Yun with a calm tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Contrary to Lin Yun’s composure, Luo Feng was very worried. Earlier, Liu Yue openly mocked Lin Yun for being a sword slave that the Sword Firmament Pavilion brought along. Those words actually caused everyone to mock Lin Yun and the Sword Firmament Pavilion. With so many people casting their gazes at the Sword Firmament Pavilion, Luo Feng naturally knew what they were planning to do. The situation wasn’t advantageous for the Sword Firmament Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Feng initially had some expectations for Lin Yun, but the latter actually practiced the Aquaselenic Sword. But fortunately, Lin Yun was also proficient in the Dragon-Tiger Fist. Luo Feng was pleased at the fact that Lin Yun wouldn’t lose too terribly. Luo Feng sighed inwardly. It looks like they still didn’t prepare enough for the birthday banquet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At noon, the sun cast down a golden veil on the hall and the princess placed her cup down, finally speaking up, “The last event has always been a sparring match between the various sects. It has been five years since this was held, so I believe everyone must be anxiously waiting.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s finally here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In the past banquets, monstrous geniuses will appear every time. I wonder who it is this year.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since there’s a winner, then there’s naturally a loser. I don’t know who’s the winner for this year, but I know that the Sword Firmament Pavilion has already lost half the battles.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, who could’ve imagined that a genius from the Sword Firmament Pavilion would be a sword slave? They actually dared to bring a sword slave to this sort of occasion. It will be troublesome if the princess pursues this matter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cut it out. The Sword Firmament Pavilion is still one of the four prestigious sects. It’s not someone you can provoke.” A discussion rose in the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bloomphoenix Princess glanced around before she spoke up, “Since it’s a friendly spar, keep in mind to hold back. You’re not allowed to injure others on purpose. Aside from that, no cosmic artifacts are also allowed. Now, let us begin!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A figure shot out from the Primal Chaos Sect. It was the youth from earlier who wanted to challenge Xin Yan. He looked in the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s direction and smiled, “I’m Chen Yan of the Primal Origin Sect. I wonder if the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s Xin Yan dares to accept my challenge?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was finally beginning. The Primal Origin Sect was really impatient because they challenged the Sword Firmament Pavilion right from the beginning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Sister isn’t required to deal with someone like you.” A figure flew out. He was Tang Tong. Xin Yan was one of the four experts in the third sequence, so they naturally couldn’t let anyone challenge her so easily. This was the reason why they were here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Yan looked disappointed, but he wasn’t surprised. He smiled, “Xin Yan doesn’t dare to come up herself and sends you up as cannon fodder?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Talk after you win me.” Tang Tong snorted at Chen Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can deal with you within ten moves,” sneered Chen Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll take a look at how you’re going to defeat me within ten moves!” Chen Yan snorted. He drew his sword and executed the Aquaselenic Sword. His Aquaselenic Sword was already at greater mastery, so it wouldn’t fluctuate when he used it. When Tang Tong stabbed his sword forward, an outburst of origin energy roared from his sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Yan merely smiled before the dracophant energy started spreading throughout his body. He threw a punch that was accompanied by saintly music and a thunderous roar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not good!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Feng roared inwardly when he saw this scene. The saintly music was a sign that Chen Yan’s Dracophant Battle Physique had reached the third stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, take my fist then!” Chen Yan disregarded Tang Tong’s sword and threw his punch out like a wild beast. When the two attacks clashed, Tang Tong was shocked because his sword nearly flew from his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His enemy’s punch completely curbstomped &nbsp;his Aquaselenic Sword. Tang Tong wasn’t even able to bring out half of the Aquaselenic Sword’s prowess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Again!” Chen Yan laughed. The dracophant energy surged from his body as he constantly got closer to his enemy. Based on his terrifying physique, he had only suffered superficial wounds so far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun knew that Tang Tong would lose and that it was just a matter of time. It probably wouldn’t take ten moves. Although Tang Tong could curbstomp his opponent’s defence if he grasped the true intent behind the Aquaselenic Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it was a pity that Tang Tong ruined such a powerful sword technique. After eight moves, Chen Yan’s fist imprinted on Tang Tong’s chest, which caused the latter to throw up a mouthful of blood. When Tang Tong landed on the ground, he held onto his sword and wanted to charge forth once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But right at this moment, the princess spoke out, “That’s enough. You already lost and you can’t change anything even if you continue fighting.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tang Tong, come back.” Luo Feng’s face was unsightly. Not only did Tang Tong lose, but he even lost so quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Barely ten moves. The Aquaselenic Sword doesn’t look so impressive at all. The Sword Firmament Pavilion is known to be the strongest when it comes to swords, but it seems that they are nothing.” Chen Yan raised his brow and barked, “Bloody Rose Xin Yan, I’ll treat it that the Sword Firmament Pavilion has no one else if you don’t come out!”</span></p>
