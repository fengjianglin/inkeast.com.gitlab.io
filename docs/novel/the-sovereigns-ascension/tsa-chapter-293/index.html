They had never heard of this name. Excluding the various alliance-unions, this was a bet involving 5,000 second-grade spiritual jades. However, in the end, the winner wasn’t Chu Haoyu, Ye Xiu, Jiang Feng, or even Lin Yun. It was someone that no one had heard of before, which gave all the elders a slap to the face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who’s Zhong Yunxiao?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve never heard of him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can it be that he’s one of those who disregards ranking? I’ve heard that all of them were cultivating madmen. They’re either outside the sect training themselves or cultivating in the Myriad Sword Diagram. All of them are extremely powerful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s a possibility. After all, there are tens of thousands of outer disciples and no one can guarantee that there aren’t any experts among them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But the outcome is surprising. It’s simply unimaginable.” Everyone was trying to find out more about Zhong Yunxiao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Ting, who was confident in Chu Haoyu, had an unsightly face. He looked at the elder who came to report and asked, “Are you sure that you didn’t make a mistake? The Imperial Sword Herb’s pressure is horrifying, so how could someone possibly take it before Chu Haoyu?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elder who was being questioned began to tremble with fear. He was under great pressure from Bai Ting’s rage and he replied, “It’s indeed someone by the name of Zhong Yunxiao. I’ve looked into him. He’s with Lin Qiushan. They even seem to have a close relationship.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go down and maintain the Alliance-Union Battle’s order. Haha, this is getting more interesting now.” Luo Feng smiled with narrowed eyes. He was also shocked that the one who obtained the first Imperial Sword Herb was a person that no one had heard of. But that was also a piece of good news to him. Anyone was good as long as it wasn’t Chu Haoyu. At the very least, Bai Ting wouldn’t be able to smile anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are we going to do with the bet now? Strictly speaking, all of us lost.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since there’s no winner, then it’s not counted then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right. Since there’s no winner, then we naturally have to take back the bets.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some elders wanted to take back the bet, but Luo Feng suddenly laughed, “Who said that there isn’t a winner? Since the first Imperial Sword Herb was taken by Zhong Yunxiao, then the 5,000 second-grade spiritual jades naturally goes to Zhong Yunxiao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Outrageous!” Bai Ting sneered, “Zhong Yunxiao? Who knows where he came from. Don’t forget that this is only the first round of the Alliance-Union Battle and it’s uncertain if he can survive the second round. Give it to him? Are you giving it to a dead person? Old geezer, you must be muddle-headed!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right. Who knows where this Zhong Yunxiao came from. He’s just someone who won the first round by luck.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is only the first round. Why should we give it to him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha. Elder Luo, you must be going insane since Lin Yun hasn’t shown himself, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right. Lin Yun didn’t win the bet. If he won the bet, we will naturally give the second-grade spiritual jades to you. But Zhong Yunxiao? He might be in the limelight right now, but who knows about the second round.” The Elders were naturally unwilling to give the second-grade spiritual jades to Zhong Yunxiao. After all, it wasn’t a small sum. And with Bai Ting taking the lead, they naturally got bolder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Old geezer, your face is pretty thick. We’ll wait and see then,” replied Luo Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Ting looked at Luo Feng before he raged, “Then we’ll wait and see then. Do you think I’m afraid of you? There’s nothing this Zhong Yunxiao could do in the Alliance-Union Battle. The same goes for Lin Yun. After Chu Haoyu and the rest refine the Imperial Sword Herb, there will be an even bigger gap between their strength and Lin Yun’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Imperial Sword Herb can combine with the Swordcloud Core perfectly to increase cultivation and comprehension. Now that the Imperial Sword Herb round was over, the remaining battle was the key. Bai Ting was unhappy because he had embarrassed himself by expressing his confidence in Chu Haoyu earlier. He smiled, “Old geezer, the first round doesn’t matter. I’ll still be the ultimate winner as long as Lin Yun dies in the Burial Sword Peak.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t be so sure about that. I’m afraid that your face won’t last long from the slaps,” smiled Luo Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s wait and see then. What can he possibly do after offending everyone in the top ten? Without the Imperial Sword Herb, what can he even compete with? It’s still a question if he can even make it into the second round!” All the other elders were having a heated debate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, the leaders or the various alliance-unions were more composed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where did this Zhong Yunxiao come from?” Wang Yan’s face was ugly and no one in the surroundings dared to utter a word. He was initially confident about winning with Chu Haoyu around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Xin Yan was looking at the Burial Sword Peak meaningfully. Meanwhile, Mo Chen was feeling a heartache. Since the elders weren’t willing to refund the bet, their money went down the drain and only the banker won.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Chen was feeling heartache for Xin Yan’s spiritual jades. When he saw that Xin Yan wasn’t speaking, he spoke out in a soft voice, “Senior Sister, don’t take it too hard.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mo Cheng, don’t you find the name ‘Zhong Yunxiao’ odd?” Xin Yan asked with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhong Yunxiao? Why does the name sound so weird? The only thing that’s weird is that I don’t think I’ve heard that name before.” Mo Cheng scratched his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is that so?” Xin Yan smiled and she fell into deep thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was discussing among themselves on the observation platform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back in the Burial Sword Peak, everyone was left shocked without being able to say a word. No one had expected that Zhong Yunxiao would take the Imperial Sword Herb so easily. Even Gu Feiyun, Xiao Feng, and the others were shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were still imagining that they would have a chance if Lin Yun was heavily injured. Then, they could wash away their humiliation. After all, how could they endure being humiliated in front of so many people? It was especially bad with how Lin Yun threatened them so blatantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But all their imaginations were shattered in a single moment. Not only did Lin Yun obtain the Imperial Sword Herb, but his cultivation also surged with every step. He had already broken through the bottleneck and he could form the fifth profound vein anytime he wanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just where did Zhong Yunxiao come from?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Feiyun laid on the ground unwillingly and hammered his fist on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Sister, Zhong Yunxiao took it!” Lin Yan exclaimed after a brief moment of joy. Compared to everyone’s shock, her face was blushing red with excitement. Lin Qiushan had maintained her composure and she only squeezed out a smile when she saw Lin Yan walking over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Beixuan and Chen Ling exchanged a glance before they both smiled bitterly. Compared to Lin Yan, the three of them were shocked by this scene. They were expecting Lin Yun to be covered with injuries from the sword gale, but not only did Lin Yun suffer no injuries, his cultivation even increased. So who dared to stop him under this circumstance?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun didn’t need their help at all. Since that was the case, would Lin Yun still share the Imperial Sword herb with them? After all, who would share something so precious if they had a choice not to?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yan pulled Lin Qiushan by the sleeve and she smiled, “Big Sister, look! Zhong Yunxiao is coming over!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Lin Yan noticed that Lin Qiushan didn’t move. Not only her, but even Gu Beixuan and Chen Ling were frozen. Finally, Lin Yan felt something amiss. She asked with her brows furrowed, “What’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you know? Can’t you see the current situation? Zhong Yunxiao can go if he wants and no one can stop him. If we go up right now, he might think that we’re trying to get a share of the Imperial Sword Herb,” smiled Chen Ling bitterly. Lin Qiushan and Gu Beixuan maintained their silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No way. Big Brother Zhong will naturally share it. He’s not that kind of person,” said Lin Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three smiled bitterly and shook their heads. People would give their lives for the Imperial Sword Herb, so how could Lin Yan possibly know about its benefits?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun arrived in front of the party using the Seven Profound Steps. Then he spoke out saying, “Come and leave with me. I’ll share the Imperial Sword Herb with everyone when it’s more convenient.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was a straightforward person who didn’t like to beat around the bush. His words stunned Lin Qiushan, Gu Beixuan, and Chen Ling. They even wondered if they heard it incorrectly. On the other hand, Lin Yun was confused when he saw their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“See? I told you that Big Brother Zhong will naturally share the Imperial Sword Herb. You guys didn’t believe me!” Lin Yan smiled brightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun also smiled. He wasn’t surprised that they would think that, after all, they held leadership positions. But he had a pleasant time along the way, so he wouldn’t go back on his promise since he had given it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Ling probed, “Brother Zhong, are you really going to share the Imperial Sword Herb with us?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I won’t force you to take it if you’re unwilling,” smiled Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want! Who wouldn’t want such a treasure!” Chen Ling rejoiced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Qiushan and Gu Beixuan also exchanged a glance before they looked at Lin Yun with revere.</span></p>
