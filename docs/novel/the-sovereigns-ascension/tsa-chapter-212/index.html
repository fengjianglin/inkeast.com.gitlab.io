 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huangfu Jingxuan’s face changed with uncertainty. He could roughly guess what these people were trying to do. They probably intend to destroy Lin Yun’s sword intent in the Myriad Sword Painting to deal a heavy blow to Lin Yun’s strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun was only in the first stage of the Profound Martial Realm, so his complete sword intent was the reason he was so powerful. If Lin Yun lost his sword intent, then he wouldn’t be so powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you want me to teach you a lesson?” The blue-clothed youth sneered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huangfu Jingxuan was frustrated. He recognized this person as the Gentlemen Union’s Ye Liuyun. He &nbsp;had been in the Sword Firmament Pavilion for two years. He was in the third stage of the Profound Martial Realm and often went outside the sect for missions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dozen that stood around him were all within the top hundred of the Mortal Ranking. The top one hundred were split into two groups. Those who were in the top fifties could practically crush those in the later fifties of the rankings. One of them was equivalent to ten bottom one hundred cultivators, some would say that the actual result would be more exaggerated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Liuyun was ranked 36th in the Mortal Ranking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll get lost.” Huangfu Jingxuan gnashed his teeth and turned to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heh. Do you really think that you’re an elite from the Huangfu Clan? The Sword Firmament Pavilion never lacks geniuses, especially people like you,” Ye Liuyun sneered. “We never lack resources and we’ve been taking from Senior Brother Wang Yan all the time. Now, it’s time for us to repay him. Do you guys know what to do now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes!” Everyone sat around Lin Yin and closed their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huangfu Jingxuan, who was taking his leave, turned around suddenly and sat with his legs crossed. When he reopened his eyes, he was in the Myriad Sword Painting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He saw Lin Yun seated far away, absorbing the surrounding sword intent. Even now, Lin Yun still had no idea that he was in danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huangfu Jingxuan immediately rushed over. When Lin Yun sensed that someone was approaching, he opened his eyes to see Huangfu Jingxuan rushing over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he even asked, Huangfu Jingxuan said in a solemn tone, “Leave this place immediately. There are a dozen experts from the Gentlemen Union coming. They’ve surrounded you on the outside and they’re coming to you from the second heaven!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun’s face changed when he heard that. Today was only the third day after leaving the Herbal Peak and Wang Yan had already made his move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How do I leave this place!” cried out Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There are two methods, either dissipate your sword intent or exit through one of the many spatial cracks that can be found in every single heaven.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was too late for Lin Yun to go with the first method because he would need more time. If he really went with the first method, Ye Liuyun and his goons would arrive. Lin Yun had no choice but to go with the second option.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But before they could get far, thunder rumbled throughout the horizon with streaks of lightning. There were dozens of them,and they all emitted powerful sword intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Someone from the second heaven?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What the hell is someone from the second heaven doing here? This heaven rejects them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s the Gentlemen Union!” The faces of everyone in the first heaven changed when they saw the bolts of lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You want to run?!” The bolts of thunder charged over. A total of twelve of them formed into an invisible sword barrier that stood before Lin Yun and Huangfu Jingxuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun could see that all twelve of their sword intent’s physical manifestations were extremely refined. They were like ancient statues that oppressed them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huangfu Jingxuan, how dare you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We let you go, but you actually dared to return!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Well then, we’ll deal with you as well!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The twelve people looked at Huangfu Jingxuan with ill intent. Then, the group attacked together, executing their strongest attacks with the swords that were in their hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cultivation did not matter in the Myriad Sword Painting. The stronger your sword intent, the stronger you would be in the painting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All twelve of them were elites handpicked by Wang Yan and all of them had grasped the complete sword intent. The moment they attacked, powerful strength was unleashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their attacks roared and swept over. In the Myriad Sword Painting, attacks executed with sword intent would be more powerful than they would be in the outside world. In a single exchange, Huangfu Jingxuan was blown away. There was no way he could contend with these twelve people given his current strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry about me. Leave this place!” Huangfu Jingxuan roared when he saw that Lin Yun could still fight back despite being besieged by twelve people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Damn it!” Lin Yun’s face sank while he threw out punches. With the Dragon-Tiger Fist and his sword intent infused into his fists, Lin Yun shattered all the attacks aimed at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The twelve from the Gentlemen Union were elites on the Mortal Ranking, so they were shocked by Lin Yun’s strength. They started to surround Lin Yun when a cold order was given, “Kill!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun looked at Huangfu Jingxuan, who was lying on the ground before he gnashed his teeth and turned around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After him!” The twelve from the Gentlemen Union chased after him without any hesitation. They never expected that Lin Yun could escape under this situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was all Huangfu Jingxuan’s fault. If it wasn’t for him, how would Lin Yun receive the news beforehand? But they couldn’t be bothered with Huangfu Jingxuan at the moment and continued their pursuit of Lin Yun. After all, they would become a laughingstock if they allowed Lin Yun to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before they came here, Wang Yan had emphasized that they had to crush Lin Yun’s sword intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Damn it! These people are fast!” The twelve were following Lin Yun closely. This was the first heaven in the Myriad Sword Painting, so Lin Yun looked pathetic when he tried to run.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kill!” Seeing that these people were about to catch up to him, Lin Yun roared. When his foot tapped on the ground, he shot forward like a sword towards the second heaven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He never belonged here, but he didn’t want to rush his ascent since he had just come here. But the Gentlemen Union’s group was on his tail, so he could only head towards the second heaven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is this fellow trying to do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s trying to enter the second heaven after he had just come to the Myriad Sword Painting?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s insane!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dozen from the Gentlemen Union held their breath with weird expressions. Lin Yun had just grasped the complete sword intent and yet he was actually headed for the second heaven. If he failed, his sword intent would collapse. But something happened that left them surprised. The barrier on the first heaven slammed onto Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What powerful sword intent! Someone is attempting to enter the second heaven!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who is he? Why have I not seen him before?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s Lin Yun! He’s the one who killed Wang Ning in the Nine Stars Contest a month ago! This kid is really amazing. Not even the twelve elites from the Gentlemen Union could do anything to him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun soared and penetrated through the layers of barriers, which left the spectators amazed. The faces of the twelve elites from the Gentlemen Union looked ugly. They knew that if Lin Yun succeeded in breaking through the barrier, he would be randomly teleported somewhere in the second heaven. At that time, it would be nearly impossible for them to find him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lin Yun shattered through the layers of barriers, he could feel his sword intent condensing. The surrounding sword intent was rushing towards him frantically, strengthening his sword intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Closing his eyes, Lin Yun suddenly had an insight into the nature of this world. This world was truly unique. It was like an illusion, but it wasn’t much different than the real world. All martial techniques and movement techniques could be derived from sword intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As long as his sword intent was strong enough, there were unlimited possibilities to what he could do. After all, sword intent was the foundation of this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A whole new world appeared when Lin Yun opened his eyes. This was the Myriad Sword Painting’s second heaven and the sword intent here was more powerful. He was only one foot away from the second heaven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The threshold to enter the second heaven wasn’t high. At the very least, it could be easily accomplished by Lin Yun. He comprehended the complete sword intent during his life and death experience in the Sword Burial Woods. Compared to the disciples who cultivated in the first heaven, his sword intent was much stronger. It was just that his sword intent was stronger than he had imagined.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next moment, despair descended onto Huangfu Jingxuan. When the dozen from the Gentlemen Union couldn’t catch up to Lin Yun, they went back and looked for Huangfu Jingxuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huangfu Jingxuan, how dare you poke your nose into our business!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A piece of trash like you dares to poke your nose around?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since that’s the case, then I believe you must be prepared to have your incomplete sword intent crushed. Don’t blame us for it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dozen walked towards Huangfu Jingxuan with gloomy expressions. But just before they could make their move, a bolt of lightning suddenly descended. When they turned around, they saw Lin Yun slowly getting up from having one knee on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You actually came back!” They were briefly shocked before they started laughing. They were under the impression that they missed their chance to deal with Lin Yun, but they never imagined that Lin Yun would return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I just remembered that you couldn’t bring your cultivation into the Myriad Sword Painting. Since that’s the case, then you guys should be the ones afraid. After all, my sword intent isn’t weaker than any one of you here,” said Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How arrogant!” They sneered and pounced at Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, Lin Yun did not run. Not everyone comprehended their sword intent through life and death experiences, so not everyone’s sword intent was the same as his. He would rather snap his sword intent than relent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Raising his hand, the sword in Lin Yun’s hand started buzzing. Like the wind, flower, snow, moon, and rumbling lightning, Lin Yun’s sword broke through the horizon. In the next second, a thunder clap echoed from the sword in Lin Yun’s hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, the sword intent of everyone from the Gentlemen Union shattered under the rumbling noise. They were all blown away and the bodies that they manifested with sword intent began to crumble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s the Sword Heart! That’s clearly the sword intent at the third heaven’s level! Damn it, how is this possible?!”</span></p>
