 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lil’ Brother, you can sit here if you don’t mind.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The source of the voice was a muscular man. The man was topless as he revealed his muscles. Additionally, his aura was released and it was at the fifth orifice of the Xiantian Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man was rather far from the crater. Generally speaking, those who could stay closer to the crater were stronger. For example, the old man could disregard everyone present because he was in the seventh orifice of the Xiantian Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With his strength, he could easily snatch the Lava Core from everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the man was far from the crater, which meant that he would lose an advantage when the Lava Core appeared, it didn’t matter much to Lin Yun. He was new here, and he wanted to get familiar around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you.” Lin Yun cupped his hands together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heh, heh! There’s no need for such courtesy. My name is Zhang Yue; how can I address you?” The man smiled when he saw Lin Yun walking over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Yun.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re not someone from the Azure Sun County?” asked Zhang Yue. When he saw Lin Yun nod his head, he carried on with a smile, “Figured so. I also don’t belong to the Azure Sun County.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In just a moment, the two of them had gotten acquainted with each other. Zhang Yue was from Aqua Condensing County, he was twenty-five years old, and he came here to try his luck since his cultivation technique had reached a bottleneck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For Xiantian Realm cultivators, the Lava Core was a treasure that could help them refine their spiritual energy. It could allow them to make a breakthrough in their cultivation technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How long have you been here, Big Brother Zhang?” Lin Yun addressed Zhang Yue intimately after they got familiar with each other. After all, it sounded rude if he were to address Zhang Yue by his name without any honorific.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve been here for roughly four months now. However, my luck hasn’t been good; I only managed to get one Lava Core.” replied Zhang Yue as he retrieved a crimson gem from his interspatial pouch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The gem contained a great fire elemental spiritual energy. At the same time, the flames seemed odd, as if they were alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many greedy gazes shot over when he took out the Lava Core. Zhang Yue chuckled, he quickly put away the Lava Core and said, “That’s the Lava Core. But the quality of mine isn’t high since only one layer of spiritual flames envelopes it. Still, it’s enough for the time being because of its size.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How is the Lava Core graded?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heh, heh! There’s a lot to learn about this.” Zhang Yue then began to explain the grades to Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lava Cores were divided into eight different grades, going by ascending order. There were even ungraded Lava Cores. However, the Lava Cores produced by the Heavenly Flame Peak were all graded, which was why everyone took a risk to come here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Lava Core was created with the Yang Origin Stone, which could be found in the Flame Vein beneath the volcano. However, the Yang Origin Stone alone couldn’t be considered a Lava Core. Only a Yang Origin Stone that had given birth to spiritual flames could be regarded as a Lava Core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Next, the layers of spiritual flames would represent their grades. Zhang Yue’s Lava Core only had one layer, which meant it was a First Grade Lava Core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Above the eight grades, there’s the Perfect Lava Core, but it can only be found at the bottom of the lava. It is born through the refinement of purgatory flames. Aside from transcendent existences, it’s impossible to go down to the bottom.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Yue continued with his explanation, “But only one in a million Yang Origin Stone can endure the purgatory flames’ refinement without melting. If you want to find one gushing out from the volcano, you can only hope for a miracle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This has happened for over thousands of years and only three Perfect Lava Cores have been found. So, it would be incredible if you could obtain one above the third grade.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Yue’s explanation was an eye-opening experience for Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun never expected that there would be so much knowledge about the Lava Core. He recalled the Thunderblitz Battle Physique mentioning that he could create the perfect Fiery Demon Battle Physique with a Perfect Lava Core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But when he heard Zhang Yue’s explanation, he was no longer optimistic about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother Zhang, were there also this many people in the past?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were at least two to three hundred people on their side and the opposite side would probably not be any lesser. With so many Xiantian Realm cultivators around, Lin Yun wasn’t optimistic about getting a high-quality Lava Core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his head, Zhang Yue replied, “Nah. They only started to gather a month or two ago. They probably wanted to try their luck here with the Azure Sun Realm opening soon. It would be an opportunity of a lifetime if they could get some treasure from the Azure Sun Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun smiled when he heard that. It looks like many people here shared the same idea as him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The days on the summit were dull. When the volcano did not erupt, there was nothing they could do except cultivate. Lin Yun chatted with Zhang Yue for a long time and he was somewhat exhausted so he closed his eyes to cultivate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even without the Lava Core, cultivating here was beneficial to those who had practiced fire elemental cultivation techniques. Before Lin Yun closed his eyes, he gauged the distance and saw that he was at least two thousand meters from the crater.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He now knew why Zhang Yue could only obtain one Lava Core over the past four months. There weren’t many Lava Cores, and the competition was intense. With how far they were, it would be hard for them to compete.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Lin Yun decided to calm down for now while he made his plans. With that, Lin Yun closed his eyes and began cultivating on the summit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The density of fire elemental spiritual energy here was terrifying and anyone who dared to cultivate here could be considered ruthless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But even if they were ruthless, they did not dare to cultivate at full force. Even Lin Yun had slowed down the absorption of his Xiantian Pure Yang Art.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With that, the dull days slowly passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seven days later, the peak suddenly started to tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone’s eyes flickered with excitement as they opened their eyes due to the tremors that they sensed. They looked at the crater that gushed out with sparks that looked like fireflies. A gorgeous scene was created when the sparks spread out into the surroundings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They could even hear cracking explosions that rang out incessantly. It was the sound of the lava surging!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Along with it, the surrounding temperature also soared, making everyone feel significantly pressured. They even increased the amount of spiritual energy used to defend themselves against the high temperature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s finally in the active state.” Zhang Yue spoke out in excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Active state?” questioned Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s a sign that the volcano is about to erupt. The longer the active state lasts, the greater the lava rain will be. Generally speaking, the volcano will erupt five to seven days from now.” Zhang Yue explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s finally here!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Lin Yun was also excited. Looking at the crater from away, he was deeply shocked. At the same time, he was wondering how it would look inside the crater.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Lin, you have to be cautious at that time. You can’t predict what people will do here. If there’s a high-quality Lava Core, a dogfight will definitely take place. People rarely die from the lava rain, they mainly die because” Zhang Yue lowered his voice and faced Lin Yun with a ‘you-know-what’ gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry about it. I’ll be careful.” Lin Yun replied with a dazzling and harmless smile. But he was sneering in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone here needed the energy to resist the temperature at all times, especially now with the rising temperature. But Lin Yun could activate his Fiery Demon Physique instead, so he didn’t have to be distracted like everyone else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this place, the temperature was harmless to his Fiery Demon Physique. Most importantly, he still had his trump card — the ancient sword box!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With all his trump cards, Lin Yun was confident in making someone in the sixth orifice of the Xiantian Realm pay dearly if they were careless here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blink of an eye, six days had passed. The temperature in the summit rose and everyone felt pressure. They had to defend against the lava rain, those around them, and the high temperature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is it not erupting yet?” Zhang Yue wore a grave expression. He could sense that there was something unusual with this eruption.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother Zhang, what’s the matter?” Lin Yun curiously asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It has been six days, but the Heavenly Flame Peak shows no signs of reaching the limit. I’m guessing that the active state will last at least ten days this time.” Zhang Yue solemnly replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Lin Yun’s facial expression had turned solemn upon hearing that. The logic behind the active state was just like how cultivators built up their power. The eruption of the volcano after ten days in active state would be terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun felt somewhat nervous to encounter an eruption of this scale for his first time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, it was just as Zhang Yue had guessed. The Heavenly Flame Peak was still in the active state after ten days, with no signs of reaching the limit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The active state is a little too terrifyingly long.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m guessing that it will last for at least five more days.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m afraid that people will die in this lava rain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The atmosphere was grave while everyone shared their opinions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Wang retreated!” The old man that had been a hundred meters from the crater moved a hundred meters back with a grave expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man had been confident of his cultivation in the seventh orifice of the Xiantian Realm as he occupied the best position. However, the active state lasted a little too long this time, making someone like him fearful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, many people were terrified by the old man’s retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was like a dangerous signal when everyone retreated. Even Zhang Yue and Lin Yun did not dare to take it lightly. The two of them were already towards the rear, and with this retreat, the two were practically standing by the border.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But five days later, the active state still showed no signs of reaching the limit and had lasted for half a month now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Yue felt uneasy and spoke out, “Over the four months I’ve been here, the longest active state was ten days. That time, over ten people died in the lava rain… But this time the active state has lasted for half a month and shows no signs of ending!”</span></p>
