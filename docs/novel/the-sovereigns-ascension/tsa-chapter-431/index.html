The battle between Lin Yun and Tong Yuan had attracted everyone’s attention. But strictly speaking, the two couldn’t be considered darkhorse because everyone already knew Lin Yun, and he had proven himself during the wedding. It was just that people had underestimated his strength because he crippled his profound vein.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Tong Yuan, he had a high status in the Heavenly Profound Sect. He was comparable to Ye Feng in the Sword Firmamant Pavilion. It was just that not many people knew about him because he had been in seclusion. But no matter what, the two had already proven their strength, and their battle was something no one had expected, especially when the two of them used the Dragon-Tiger Fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tong Yuan frowned his brows on the stage as his face looked ugly. He was unhappy that Lin Yun had belittled him. An outsider actually dared to use the Dragon-Tiger Fist against him? That was the same as slapping his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lin Yun, are you looking down on me, Tong Yuan, or are you looking down on the entire Heavenly Profound Sect?!” Tong Yuan was furious as he continued, “Draw your sword. Even if I lose today, I’ll wholeheartedly accept my loss to be defeated by your manifestation stage Aquaselenic Sword!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m sorry, but I don’t intend on using my sword.” Lin Yun wanted to explain that he didn’t look down on Tang Yuan. It was precisely because Tang Yuan was proficient in the Dragon-Tiger Fist which was why Lin Yun wanted to use it to find his flaws. But he knew that some things wouldn’t be easy to explain, and he gave up after a brief thinking about it. Why should he, Lin Yun, care about what others think?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Arrogant!” Lin Yun’s words had thoroughly enraged Tong Yuan. Tong Yuan’s bones began to crackle, and his already robust body grew by another size. His muscles looked as if they were forged with metal which made him look like a golden statue. Looking at Lin Yun, Tong Yuan continued, “Lin Yun, you’re not going to explain yourself?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why should I?” replied Lin Yun with a hint of annoyance in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright. Go and die then!” Tong Yuan roared. When he placed both his palms before his chest, a Buddhism glow radiated from his back along with a ‘卍’ symbol. At that split second, Tong Yuan’s aura had reached an unbelievable height.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s the Vajra Battle Physique! The body-refining technique of the Heavenly Profound Sect. This Tong Yuan has probably reached the level of invulnerability height.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tong Yuan is enraged. After all, it made no sense for him to reveal this trump card so early on.” The spectators were shocked by this scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s see how this brat continues to be arrogant!” The Heavenly Profound Sect’s elders sneered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there wasn’t any change in Lin Yun’s expression as a resounding sword buzz rang out from his body. He had released his sword intent to perfectly fuse with his tiger and dragon aura. In that split second, he looked upright like a sword standing on the stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Undying Vajra Seal, Dragon-Tiger Steps!” Tong Yuan roared. His hands began to form an ancient seal swiftly as he took a step out at the same time. Every step he took would cause the stage to tremble, but it felt as if the entire world was shaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great!” Lin Yun also used the Undying Vajra Seal, Dragon-Tiger Steps. Unlike Tong Yuan, he wasn’t emitting any buddhism aura, but the aura of a peerless sword. The face-off caused the eighth stage to tremble violently, and you could even feel the ripples from the spectating stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Those two…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just which is the authentic Dragon-Tiger Fist?” The spectators were shocked because they couldn’t differentiate who was the authentic one. When the two took nine steps out, their aura both manifested into a soaring dragon and leaping tiger as they threw out their fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the two punches clashed, Lin Yun felt his entire hand going numb. At the same time, Tong Yuan’s aura also started to crack under his sword aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe, this is only the beginning. Come again!” Gaining a small advantage from the clash because of his cultivation, a cold smile rose on Tong Yuan’s lips. “</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Flying Dragon, Leaping Tiger!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You think I’ll be afraid of you?” Lin Yun also used the same move from the Dragon-Tiger Fist. The two of them were like dragons soaring into the sky that clashed together. But before they landed on the ground, they both turned around and unleashed the real killing move of this attack. The buddhism aura clashed with the sword aura in the sky. It looked as though a sword had transformed into a dragon as it fought with a golden vajra.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a darkened face, Tong Yuan’s aura became murky as the ink, and so did Lin Yun. This made all the spectators confused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s going on? Holy shit, why can’t I see anything? What are the two of them doing?” Many people were anxious because this was the most exciting battle since the Dragon Gate Competition began.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tong Yuan and Lin Yun’s figures suddenly became blurred, and the spectators could only sense a horrifying power brewing on the stage. Just when everyone were baffled, the scene began to clear up on the scene as Tong Yuan unleashed a roar with Dragon Painting. A painting unfolded behind him with a dragon coming out of it and pouncing at Lin Yun through his fist. The terrifying aura of this attack made the atmosphere on the stage feel suffocating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die!” Tong Yuan’s face became sinister.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dragon Painting!” A painting also appeared around Lin Yun, but his was dazzling like a sword. Tong Yuan’s painting was a dragon, but his was a sword. A sword that would destroy everything that stood in his way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two punches clashed, and they were both evenly matched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Damn it!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Tong Yuan cursed inwardly. He was shocked to realise that cracks started to appear on his dragon image. He instantly drew himself out from the clash and swung his fists forth with the Soaring Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Yun was unfaltered as he faced Tong Yuan head-on with the same attacks. The Dragon-Tiger Fist had manifested into powerful moves in the hands of those two, and every single of their clashes would be accompanied with a resounding boom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, when they clashed with the last move of the Dragon-Tiger Fist, the Vanquishing Dragon and Tiger, Lin Yun was sent flying with a groan and landed on the edge of the stage. When the dust settled down, Tong Yuan landed on the ground with his upper clothes ripped, revealing his sturdy muscles with a dragon and a tiger deeply imprinted on his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dragon-Tiger Empowerment!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Could it be that Tong Yuan has reached complete mastery in the Dragon-Tiger Fist?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I heard that upon reaching complete mastery, you’ll manifest a dragon and a tiger, which you could use to fight. No wonder Lin Yun lost.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yeah. He’s not a monk, so he can’t achieve that.” An uproar rang out when everyone saw the tattoos on Tong Yuan’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon-Tiger Fist is truly profound.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Lin Yun muttered inwardly with his eyes narrowed into slits, and he still had ways to go in this technique. He instantly changed his strategy and wandered around on the stage with the Seven Profound Steps. He gave up facing Tong Yuan head-on, and using the advantage in his movement technique, he landed countless barrage of punches on Tong Yuan’s body. But all his punches felt as if he had hit a metal wall as Tong Yuan stood on the stage unmoving.</span></p>

Don’t you know? I’ve already reached the stage of Vanquishing Dragon and Tiger. You won’t be able to harm me with your Dragon-Tiger Fist, but I can harm you with mine,” snickered Tong Yuan as he threw a punch out. The dragon and tiger tattoos on his body looked as though they had come to life as they coiled around his hand and enveloped Lin Yun in it.</span></p>

When the three seals overlapped, Tong Yuan’s aura had reached the Violet Palace Realm and he emitted a golden glow.</span></p>

Lin Yun was already injured by Tong Yuan, and he would surely lose his life if he was hit by the three combined seals.</span></p>

Lin Yun’s aura began to fluctuate as he formed the three seals as well. He was emitting a powerful sword aura when he was done forming the three seals. But that wasn’t all. His origin energy manifested into thirty-three swords, which opened up behind him like a fan.</span></p>

When Lin Yun landed on the ground, his eyes became bloodshot as he unleashed his attack, the four combined seals!</span></p>
