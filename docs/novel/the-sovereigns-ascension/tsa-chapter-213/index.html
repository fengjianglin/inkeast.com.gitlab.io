 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hurry up! Leave immediately! None of us can beat him in the Myriad Sword Painting!” Astonishment filled their eyes. They were veterans in the Myriad Sword Painting, so they knew how terrifying someone with sword intent from the third heaven was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You guys think you can leave so easily?” Lin Yun snorted and his sword intent suppressed them like a colossal mountain, crushing them into the ground. None of them could move under the immense pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Get down!” Lin Yun roared and unleashed his sword intent. He wasn’t holding back anymore. His sword intent was like a boundless mountain that crushed the bodies of their manifested sword intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“NO!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“YOU BASTARD! STOP IT RIGHT NOW!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“M-M-MY SWORD INTENT PHYSIQUE!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The group could only look at their crumbling sword intent, there was nothing they could do about it. At this moment of life and death, Lin Yun, who had comprehended the sharpness of sword intent, was extremely terrifying. Even he was shocked by his own strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But suddenly, he comprehended something. Although the Myriad Sword Painting could speed up one’s ability to comprehend the sword intent, it was just like cultivators in the Xiantian Realm who used the Profound Breaking Pellet. They were in the same realm, but they had different strengths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One cannot be powerful without experiencing life and death. After all, there was no shortcut in the cultivation of sword intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Die!” There wasn’t any trace of mercy in Lin Yun’s eyes. His sword intent manifested into a colossal mountain and launched the final wave of suppression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But right at this moment, a terrifying thunder rumbled in the horizon. Amid the countless bolts of lightning, someone basked in four layers of radiance was appearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“An expert from the fourth heaven!” Everyone was shocked. It wasn’t easy for someone in the fourth heaven to come to the first heaven. But if someone managed to do it, they would be like a god descending onto the mortal realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The majestic sword intent made everyone lower their heads. Even Huangfu Jingxuan was shocked when he raised his head. It was just as he had expected; the newcomer was Ye Liuyun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The 36th of the Mortal Ranking, Ye Liuyun!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those who could make it into the top fifties were famous figures, well-known by everyone in the outer sect. So Ye Liuyun’s appearance caused a commotion in the surrounding area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A faint smile hung on Ye Liuyun’s lips. He looked around like a god that was viewing mortals. It seemed as though he could crush anyone here with a single finger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It really isn’t easy to come to the first heaven, but things should be resolved by now.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Liuyun was in deep thought. Those he brought over were from the second heaven, so they should be more than enough to deal with a rookie who had just entered the Myriad Sword Painting. There was nothing for him to worry about. After all, he even came here from the fourth heaven to be on the safe side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother Ye, save us!” Suddenly, a few calls for help attracted Ye Liuyun’s attention. When he turned around, the smile on his face froze. He was witnessing an unimaginable scene. The twelve people that he was proud of were all lying on the ground. As for Lin Yun, whom he had thought to be dealt with, he was preparing his final move for the twelve of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stop!” The smile on his face instantly turned dark.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Lin Yun paid him no attention and waved his palm down. His sword intent manifested into a mountain range and descended. When the mountain crashed down, it produced a series of cracks. The cracking sounds came from the twelve elites of the Gentlemen Union. Lin Yun’s sword intent had shattered their sword intent instantly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back in the outside world, the faces of the twelve that were seated around Lin Yun turned pale and pain spread across their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go!” While Ye Liuyun was going into a rage, Lin Yun immediately grabbed Huangfu Jingxuan and headed towards the nearest spatial crack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lin Yun reopened his eyes on the Myriad Sword Platform, he saw the twelve elites looking at him resentfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll kill you!” One of them ultimately lost their temper and charged over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Get lost.” Lin Yun kicked out, drawing a cracking sound from the attacker’s ribs. The attacker was sent flying like a sandbag. When Lin Yun looked around, the rest of the twelve started to crawl away with their hands and legs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a bunch of garbage.” Lin Yun snorted. These goons were too full of themselves. They were heavily injured, yet they still dared to attack him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Die!” Ye Liuyun, who followed Lin Yun out of the Myriad Sword Platform, launched his attack. A cold light flashed through his eyes. He didn’t retrieve his sword; he merely raised his hand and pointed his fingers at Lin Yun like a sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even before the sword arrived, Lin Yun could feel a stinging pain all over his body. Not daring to be careless, the Iris Flower in his Dantian bloomed and he executed the Undying Vajra Seal. When he started forming seals with his hands, fiery energy exploded out in the form of dazzling golden radiance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go!” Lin Yun pushed his hands forward, unleashing the Undying Vajra Seal. However, Ye Liuyun’s fingers were like an unparalleled sword, piercing through the seal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Witnessing this scene, there was a trace of surprise flashing through Lin Yun’s eyes. Fusing his fist and sword together, he faced Ye Liuyun’s attack. When his punch collided with Ye Liuyun’s fingers, Lin Yun could sense a towering sword aura surging at him, crushing his origin energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun spit out a mouthful of blood and took a dozen steps back. On the other hand, Ye Liuyun’s body had merely swayed from the collision. Ye Liuyun unleashed his aura in the next second, which made Lin Yun feel tremendous pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Third stage of the Profound Martial Realm!” Lin Yun locked his brows together. Niu Bingshun was also in the third stage of the Profound Martial Realm, but Niu Bingshun wasn’t even qualified to be Ye Liuyun’s lackey despite having the same cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Yun, be careful. He’s Ye Liuyun, 36th of the Mortal Ranking!” Huangfu Jingxuan immediately yelled out when he saw Lin Yun actually receiving an attack from Ye Liuyun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the disciples in the surrounding heard that, their faces changed drastically.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun only took ten steps back after taking Ye Liuyun’s attack?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll remember this attack.” Lin Yun looked at the wound on his fist and turned around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where do you think you’re going after destroying the sword intent of twelve people from my Gentlemen Union!” Ye Liuyun immediately flew into rage and chased after Lin Yun. He did not want to give Lin Yun any opportunity to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two left the Myriad Sword Platform, but Lin Yun couldn’t shake Ye Liuyun no matter how he utilized his movement technique. Their movement techniques weren’t on the same level, which made Lin Yun suffer greatly. However, Lin Yun did not dare to stop. After all, he would only be courting death if he did. Ye Liuyun’s cultivation was two stages higher, not to mention that his sword intent even reached the fourth level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun was already gasping for breath after being chased around by Ye Liuyun. Right behind him, Ye Liuyun followed with a gloomy face. He could catch Lin Yun with his movement technique, but he chose not to. After all, there was nothing he could do to Lin Yun even if he caught up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only did the sect forbid fighting, but killing or crippling a fellow disciple’s cultivation was also forbidden. Even if he managed to catch Lin Yun, all Ye Liuyun could do was give him a beating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His best opportunity was to destroy Lin Yun’s sword intent in the Myriad Sword Painting. After all, it would feel even more terrible than crippling someone’s cultivation. But not only did the plan fail, it even cost the destruction of twelve elites’ sword intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That outcome made him feel extremely terrible. So at this point, he was just toying with Lin Yun, allowing everyone in the sect to witness Lin Yun’s embarrassing appearance. He would only make his move to stop Lin Yun once the latter was exhausted. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to vent out the resentment pent up in his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After fifteen minutes, Lin Yun had practically run everywhere in the mountain, but he couldn’t shake Ye Liuyun off. But a thought suddenly crossed his mind, Lin Yun instantly knew what Ye Liuyun was trying to do. With that, he suddenly stopped running.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why aren’t you running anymore?” Ye Liuyun mocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Turning around, Lin Yun smiled even though his face looked exhausted, “Do you think that it’s interesting? Someone ranked 36th on the Mortal Ranking is chasing me all around.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment Lin Yun spoke, the surrounding disciples all looked at Ye Liuyun with a strange expression. Ye Liuyun had joined the sect for two years and he was truly strong. After all, someone who could be ranked 36th on the Mortal Ranking wouldn’t be weak. But targeting someone who had just joined the sect for two months had caused everyone to look down on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ll know if it’s interesting in a while.” Ye Liuyun pulled his sword and thrust it towards Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun knew that Ye Liuyun was toying with him in order to make him beg for his life. But there was no way Lin Yun would do it. Even if he had to die here today, he would make Ye Liuyun pay the price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, the sword plunged into Lin Yun’s chest. This scene had left everyone shocked. Even Ye Liuyun was shocked. He thought that his sword wouldn’t be able to hit Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun could exchange at least ten moves with him. But in reality, his sword stabbed into Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that brief second, when Ye Liuyun was distracted, Lin Yun grinned and threw a punch out. Caught by surprise, Ye Liuyun was punched on the nose. His nose was fractured by the impact and his face was turned to mush. Lin Yun’s fist had blown Ye Liuyun away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spitting out a mouthful of blood, Lin Yun started to sway as blood continued to flow out of his chest. He was in great pain from the sword intent pouring into his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll kill you!” Ye Liuyun lost his cool. He was 36th on the Mortal Ranking, but he was actually bested by a rookie. He had never suffered such humiliation before. He lost all rationale and swung his sword at Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spectators exclaimed when they saw this scene because Ye Liuyun was actually trying to kill a fellow disciple inside the sect!</span></p>
