 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yin energy gathered above the cold lake. At the center of it, Lin Yun sat cross-legged, hovering in midair. There was an Iris Flower behind him, blooming and devouring the surrounding Yin energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun could feel the Yin energy pouring into his body, coursing through his veins and gathering at the Iris Flower in his Dantian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did not convert the Yin energy and just blindly devoured it. Every mouthful of Yin energy he devoured was equivalent to half a month of cultivation for ordinary people. Standing at the shore, Lord Thirteen was surprised by this scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He promised that he would bestow cultivation upon Lin Yun, but not in this way… There was an array set up here by the predecessor, allowing this place to convert Yin energy. So anyone could absorb the Yin energy here, regardless of their cultivation techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cultivating on the stone platform could increase the cultivation speed, achieving twice the effect with half the effort. But Lin Yun’s cultivation speed wasn’t just twice as fast. The Yin energy was extremely cold and not even cultivators with ice-attributed cultivation techniques dared to be so reckless. After all, the slightest carelessness would result in injuries. Furthermore, it would be even more troublesome if the Yin energy condensed into cold poison in the body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Sky Devouring Art?” Lord Thirteen recalled a taboo cultivation technique. But he soon dismissed the idea. If it were really the Sky Devouring Art, then Lin Yun would be courting death to practice it at his cultivation. But even if it wasn’t the Sky Devouring Art, it must be something similar. Moreover, the cultivation technique shouldn’t be simple since Lin Yun showed no signs of stopping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Looks like there are some secrets on this lad,” smiled Lord Thirteen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Seven orifices fully unlocked... he’s trying to make a breakthrough into the Profound Martial Realm!” Li Wuyou, who was digesting the Snowdragon Carp from earlier, was standing beside the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The seven orifices on Lin Yun’s chest were blooming with radiance, violently absorbing and refining the Yin energy without reservation. If Lin Yun weren’t trying to make a breakthrough into the Profound Martial Realm, he wouldn’t have caused such a huge commotion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Xiantian Realm represented the seven orifices - the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, hands, feet, and heart. Every breakthrough would slowly shed the mortal body. But unlocking the profound channel was akin to breaking the mortal restriction completely and transforming into a butterfly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Generally speaking, the more powerful the cultivation technique, the stronger the physique. That would also mean that unlocking the profound channel would also be more difficult. If it was an ordinary Xiantian Realm cultivation technique, unlocking the profound channel would be the same as tearing through a piece of paper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Lin Yun, the Iris Sword Art that he was practicing wasn’t normal. So, since it was harder for him to unlock the profound channel, he would be much stronger after making his breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hundred refinery!” Lord Thirteen sighed. “It might be a hundred refinery, but looking at his situation, I’m afraid that he wouldn’t be able to make his breakthrough after undergoing tens of thousands of refineries.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s the matter? My big brother can’t make a breakthrough into the Profound Martial Realm?” Li Wuyou voiced his concern.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking a glance at Li Wuyou, Lord Thirteen replied, “This brat is too greedy. He’s trying to devour as much Yin energy as possible, suppressing his breakthrough in the process. This will make his breakthrough even harder. He’s playing with fire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe. I don’t think that there’s a need to worry about him. He naturally knows his potential well since he has the perfect Thunderblitz Battle Physique. Are you sure you aren’t feeling heartache for the Yin energy here?” Li Wuyou smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lord Thirteen was embarrassed upon being exposed. Lin Yun’s Sky Devouring Art had already devoured one-tenth of the Yin energy here and there weren't any signs of Lin Yun stopping anytime soon. Lord Thirteen lived here in seclusion and relied on the Yin energy to cultivate on weekdays. If Lin Yun devoured too much, he would have none left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who the hell do you think you’re talking to?” Lord Thirteen glared at Li Wuyou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Wuyou immediately fell back and smiled, “Sorry for being rude. Senior, you’re generous, so I believe that you won’t hold it against me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But when he saw the grave expression on Lin Yun’s face, the smile on Li Wuyou’s face disappeared. What Lord Thirteen said was true. If Lin Yun absorbed too much Yin energy, it would be more difficult for him to make his breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Wuyou couldn’t imagine what sort of backlash Lin Yun would face if he failed. But he knew that Lin Yun did not have any other way. He was hunted the moment he stepped into the Firmament Realm. When he finally turned the tables around and had an opportunity to kill his opponent, he was stopped by an elder for no reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, he was trapped in a dead-end after Wang Ning gathered the ten Profound Martial Realms. Lin Yun had a million grievances pent up in his heart, but Li Wuyou had never seen Lin Yun losing his temper. Although Lin Yun didn’t say anything, Li Wuyou knew that Lin Yun’s resentment was pent up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So if Lin Yun didn’t take risks, how could he vent his anger out?</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The final test lasted for one month and anyone who managed to come out of the forest alive were considered to have passed the test. The Sword Firmament Pavilion’s homebase was located outside the Firmament Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were nine days left before the end of the test and people had already started coming out. Under the lofty mountains, many disciples and elders were gathered. However, upon closer look, this group was divided into two factions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Yan and the others stood together, supported by Elder Bai Ting, who presided over the test. The other side was Xin Yan’s party, along with Elder Luo Feng. Beside Xin Yan, there was a tall and handsome youth who resembled her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little sister, do you think he will be among the first batch?” The youth smiled. He was Xin Yan’s elder brother, one of the best disciples in the Sword Firmament Pavilion, Xin Jue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Yan wore azure clothes, which perfectly outlined her voluptuous figure. She whispered, “Yeah, most likely. I’ve never seen him act, but it’s hard for any Profound Martial Realm cultivators to defeat him individually.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wang Ning and Leng Mo came out first!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No wonder they’re seeded candidates selected by Senior Brother Wang Yan. They’re extraordinary indeed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone instantly recognized Wang Ning and Leng Mo when they came out. Wang Yan had joy on his face and immediately walked over. “How was it? Did you get nine stars?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s for sure. With our strength, it’s easy for us to get nine stars.” Wang Ning wore a smug look on his face. They took out their jade pendants and nine stars flickered on each of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Good! There’s a show after the test ends. Don’t embarrass me. If you’re lucky, you might be selected by the elders!” Wang Yan paused briefly before asking in a soft voice, “What about that brat?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Ning exchanged a glance with Leng Mo before he smiled, “He won’t show up before you again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Good. Rest well for now,” replied Wang Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they talked, more people began to walk out from the test. When the participants came out, the elders immediately stepped forward to check the stars. Those with nine stars were specially picked out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where are they?” Xin Yan frowned. She couldn’t see Lin Yun and Li Wuyou anywhere. She couldn’t help turning to look at the Wang brothers and saw the sinister smile on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior sister, Li Xiaotian and the others are out!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go and take a look!” Xin Yan had a bad premonition. Her face was dark as she walked towards Li Xiaotian’s group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Jue had grown up with his sister and he knew his sister’s temper well. He knew that she was enraged, but he had no idea what had caused her to be outraged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where’s Lin Yun?” Xin Yan immediately asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The faces of Li Xiaotian and the others were dark. Xin Yan was clearly saying that they were inferior to Lin Yun. However, they couldn’t refute that at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But they had no idea how to respond to Xin Yan. For a moment, they seemed embarrassed and avoided eye contact. Lin Yun had risked his life to save them, but when Lin Yun was driven into desperate straits, they were so frightened that they didn’t dare to help. They only watched Lin Yun being cornered from a distance. If they told Xin Yan the truth, the latter would definitely be furious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“SPEAK!” Xin Yan barked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Xiaotian started to panic. He knew that there was no way he could cover this matter up since thousands of people had seen it. Lowering his head, he whispered, “Wang Ning gathered ten Profound Martial Realm cultivators to force Lin Yun into a dead-end… I heard that Lin Yun was forced to enter the Sword Burial Woods…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Xiaotian roughly described what had happened, including the matter of them being saved by Lin Yun and Li Wuyou. At this moment, Li Xiaotian and his group only wished that those two would die in the Sword Burial Woods and never appear again. Otherwise, they would certainly have offended Xin Yan after joining the Sword Firmament Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Sword Burial Woods!” The faces of the junior brothers behind Xin Yan changed. There was even a slight fluctuation in Xin Yan’s expression. That was the famous forbidden ground in the Firmament Realm. In the past few decades, no one had managed to come out of there alive. Xin Jue knew some insider information and knew that there was no legacy in the Sword Burial Woods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if Lin Yun were lucky enough to get through the array, he would still be killed by the strange man. A Ninth-Grade Spiritual Physique with a huge background once died there. But in the end, the matter was suppressed. As time passed, the Sword Burial Woods eventually became a ground of certain death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little sister,” Xin Jue called out to Xin Yan, fearing that she might be impulsive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Xin Yan did not listen to her elder brother. With killing aura surging around her, she walked towards Wang Yan’s party. Looking at Wang Yan coldly, the murderous aura coming from her sent a chill down his spine. “WANG NING, HOW DARE YOU!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surrounding temperature suddenly dropped. The murderous aura coming from Xin Yan had caused a stir in the crowd. The Bloody Rose, Xin Yan, was furious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, Wang Ning still dared to provoke her from afar. But when he looked into Xin Yan’s eyes, he immediately cowered. He knew that this woman had killed more people than his brother. Thinking about the Bloody Rose legends, Wang Ning did not dare to raise his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing beside him, Wang Yan sneered, “Junior Sister Xin Yan, what are you trying to do here? Elder Bai is here. Mind your manners!”</span></p>
