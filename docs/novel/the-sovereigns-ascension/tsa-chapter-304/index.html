 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The roaring sword intent caused a tremor in the Sword Tomb. No one had expected that the clash of Lin Yun and Chu Haoyu’s murderous aura would create such a huge commotion. The violent storm did not differentiate between allies and enemies as it swept through the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What horrifying sword intent!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This Sword Tomb is a little too horrifying. I wonder what the cultivation of the ancestors buried here was when they were alive…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They must be at least in the fifth stage of the Violet Palace Realm. There might even be Heavenly Soul Realm cultivators around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Damn it! I was hurt!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the disciples summoned their origin energy to protect themselves and those who were weaker had to draw their weapons. All of this was a chain reaction caused by two people who merely looked at each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who the hell is this fellow to make Chu Haoyu show such murderous aura?” The inner disciples were baffled when they looked at Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shouldn’t the first on the Mortal Ranking be a prideful existence? But for Chu Haoyu to show a murderous aura to this youth, this meant that this youth must be strong. Furthermore, this youth didn’t seem weak and he stared right back at Chu Haoyu like a ferocious tiger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s Lin Yun, the one who rang the Phoenix Plum two months ago.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s him? Indeed, he’s somewhat capable since he can kill Xue Feng.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Phoenix Plum everyone in the top ten a slap to the face. But even so, it makes no sense for Chu Haoyu to lose control of his murderous aura. I’m afraid that it’s because he joined the Gentlemen Union.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right! The Gentlemen Union’s Wang Yan is mortal enemies with Lin Yun. Although Chu Haoyu didn’t say a thing, he must want to retrieve Lin Yun’s head to repay Wang Yan.” Whispers sounded between disciples, but only the inner disciples instantly knew the reason why Chu Haoyu would reveal his murderous aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Officially, Lin Yun had offended the top ten on the Mortal Ranking by taking the A-ranked missions. Privately, Chu Haoyu naturally had to repay Wang Yan since he joined the Gentlemen Union.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps he didn’t think that it would be troublesome to kill Lin Yun. He just didn’t expect that Lin Yun would also release such murderous aura that caused a clash in the Sword Tomb. This made Chu Haoyu stunned because he didn’t expect that Lin Yun had the guts to face him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How bold!” Chu Haoyu placed his hand on the sword hilt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stop it right there!” A bark sounded out as two Sword Condors descended. There was an elder standing on each condor. They were in the Violet Palace Realm and their suppression instantly shattered the murderous aura in the atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun and Chu Haoyu both snorted with a trace of fear in their eyes. Everyone turned towards Luo Feng and Bai Ting. They were the hosts for the Alliance-Union Battle. They could no longer stay on the observation platform since this was the final battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother, are you alright?” asked Li Wuyou with concern. Lin Yan sneaked over as her heart throbbed. The scene earlier was shocking and they could feel chill in their hearts when Chu Haoyu held his sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun waved his hand and he cupped his hands, “We greet the two elders.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Feng and Bai Ting both had a high position in the sect and there was a possibility that they could become the Hall Master of the Elders Hall. So none of them dared to be disrespectful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You guys want to start the fight before the rules for the second round are announced?” Bai Ting smiled, “Don’t worry. There will be plenty of opportunities later. Chu Haoyu, there’s no need for you to be so anxious.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I understand,” replied Chu Haoyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Feng glanced at Bai Ting. This fellow was clearly on Chu Haoyu’s side, but Luo Feng couldn’t be bothered. His fingers joined together and formed a weird seal. When he opened his eyes, crimson flames suddenly blazed on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blazing flames then covered the entire ground. Everyone was caught by surprise and there was only one place they could stand to avoid the flames. In the end, they were all standing on the swords plunged in the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The flames are igniting my origin energy!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Doesn’t this mean that we’ll die if we fall down?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are they trying to do?” Everyone panicked when they stood on the swords with shock written on their faces. Everyone started feeling something strange. The second round had exceeded their wildest imagination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The flames come from the flame vein and the remains of the ancestors buried deep underground. It’s formed by countless souls merging together. Those who aren’t in the Violet Palace Realm will die if they come in contact with it,” said Luo Feng on the Sword Condor. He continued, “The rules for the second round are simple. Stand on the sword for as long as you can and the stars in your jade plaque will increase. When there’s only one person left, the second round will come to an end. We will then rank everyone based on the stars.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun exclaimed inwardly. This rule was beneficial to the outer disciples. After all, the outer disciples all had thirty stars. The rules might seem simple, but it was brutal. Everyone wanted to remain for as long as they could, but didn’t this mean that there would be a messy fight? No one could guarantee that they would be the last one standing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aside from that, the flames will also give birth to incinerate souls that will attack cultivators,” continued Bai Ting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone sucked in a cold breath. Not only did they have to survive under this harsh atmosphere, but they also had to defend themselves against the flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief pause, Bai Ting smiled, “If you can kill the incinerate soul, you will obtain one flame crystal. I won’t reveal their use to you guys. I can only say that you guys won’t be disappointed. At the same time, leaving this stage also means giving up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many disciples directed their gaze over and saw that there were no flames at the borders. It might be far, but it wasn’t difficult for disciples to reach the borders. But if given a choice, no one would give up. At the very least, they defeated thirty disciples in order to stand here. They were all elites among the outer sect and they naturally wanted to become inner disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Feng looked around and announced, “The final battle begins!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I wish everyone luck,” smiled Luo Feng. He was looking at Lin Yun when he said that. Shortly after, the two Sword Condors soared into the sky and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was it finally beginning? The final battle started abruptly. Everyone looked nervous when they stood on the swords and the surroundings were silent aside from the blazing flames. The clouds were dark and the atmosphere in the Sword Tomb also started to rise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beads of sweat began to appear on Lin Yan’s forehead. Although she didn’t feel comfortable, she didn’t dare to wipe her sweat. The surroundings were silent and she regretted not listening to her elder sister when she insisted on joining the Alliance-Union Battle. She now understood that this was the toughest Alliance-Union Battle in the past hundred years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was slightly distracted and the sword she was standing on started swaying. She immediately became frightened that she might lose her balance. She wasn’t the only one. There were many disciples who felt the same thing and were trying to maintain their balance on the swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There weren’t many who could maintain their composure. Lin Yun closed his eyes and sensed the suppressed atmosphere of the Sword Tomb. His heart then gradually calmed down. He knew he had to stay calm at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the silence broke when a bolt of lightning rumbled. The inner disciples drew their swords and started attacking the outer disciples, “Attack!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The outer disciples didn’t dare to get distracted and drew their swords to retaliate. In an instant, the gale grew a few times stronger. It was stronger than when the murderous aura from Lin Yun and Chu Haoyu clashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lin Yun opened his eyes, he saw three people heading towards him.
