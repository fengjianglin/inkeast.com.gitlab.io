 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the grey-clothed youth looked at the sinister-looking mask that Lin Yun wore, his face became grave. He started transferring his origin energy into the sword in his right hand while he looked at Lin Yun. At the same time, Lin Yun’s words reverberated in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who is this guy?” The faces of the inner disciples beneath the stone statue changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The inner disciple that went by the name of Mu Ling spoked out coldly, “It’s just an act. Isn’t he just a little capable?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were getting annoyed that an outer disciple actually threatened them. Not even the nineteenth ranked Gu Feiyun had the guts to do that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Qiushan and her team were getting nervous, even though they were standing in the back. They had no idea if Lin Yun was boasting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What should we do? Nothing will happen to Big Brother Zhong, right?” asked Lin Yan with a hint of concern flashing in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Isn’t this Zhong Yunxiao a little too arrogant?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right. His opponent is an inner disciple after all. It looks like we have no choice but to hand over the Swordcloud Cores.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Damn it. These inner disciples have an advantage over us in their cultivation techniques and martial techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I knew that the sect wouldn't just hand out the inner disciple quotes so easily.” The outer disciples began to discuss among themselves. It wasn’t because they didn’t believe in Zhong Yunxiao’s strength, but the inner disciples were truly powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They could practically destroy them with brute strength based on their cultivation technique and martial technique. Gu Feiyun had just been defeated, yet Zhong Yunxiao still tried to threaten the inner disciples. But something strange happened because the grey-clothed youth didn’t launch another attack even after a long time. This made everyone feel a little suspicious as they looked at Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Brother Tian, what are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Attack!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you terrified by that brat?” The faces of the inner disciples beneath the statue turned unsightly. On the other hand, the grey-clothed youth was cursing inwardly. The pressure that he was currently facing wasn’t something that outsiders could imagine. Now that he thought about it, he started to realize the terror of Lin Yun who avoided his attacks so easily. This was also the reason why he didn’t have any confidence to swing another sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But being in a stalemate wasn’t the answer. In the end, he gnashed his teeth and proceeded to attack. But just before he attacked, Lin Yun moved. Lin Yun was already annoyed by the arrogance of these inner disciples. Not only did they defeat Gu Feiyun, but theu even called them garbage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since you didn’t want to attack when I gave you the opportunity, then I guess it’s my turn. Try out this punch!” Dracophant energy began to surface on Lin Yun’s body and he circulated the eighth stage of the Iris Sword Sutra.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Iris Flower bloomed. After his origin energy, dracophant energy, and sword intent combined together, Lin Yun threw out a punch like a bolt of lightning. The punch caused an earth-shaking rumble that made everyone’s ears ache.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This…” Lin Yun’s strength thoroughly shocked Lin Qiushan and everyone else. His strength had reached a height that they couldn’t see through. Lin Yun, who had just reached the fifth stage of the Profound Martial Realm, had undergone a complete transformation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The grey-clothed youth was startled. He instantly knew that he wouldn’t be able to take this punch and that he would be killed within ten moves if he did. But was he able to escape? The grey-clothed youth wanted to retreat, but Lin Yun’s punch slammed into his chest and sent him flying out like a cannonball. He crashed into the statues and threw up a mouthful of blood before fainting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Brother Tian!” The four inner disciples were completely dumbfounded. They didn’t expect that Lin Yun would be so powerful. This time, the disdain on Mu Ling’s face disappeared. He stared at Lin Yun for a long time before he spoke out, “You and your friends can pass through here without paying any Swordcloud Cores.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Qiushan and her party became excited that the inner disciples actually made a concession. However, Lin Yun’s reply shocked them. Lin Yun revealed a playful expression, and he smiled, “Interesting. Do you think that I stood out to play around? Judging by your face, you really think that the Sword Tomb is your courtyard!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun's words were like a slap to Mu Ling. Despite Mu Ling making a concession, Lin Yun replied with ridicule instead. This left everyone in the surroundings silent. Only Lin Yan narrowed her eyes into slits as her face blushed. This was what she liked about Lin Yun; he wouldn’t take a step back no matter what the rules were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What did you say?!” Mu Ling lost his temper. Did Lin Yun really think that they were afraid of him? If it wasn’t for the fact that they were worried about the crowd gaining an advantage if they fought with Lin Yun, Mu Ling would’ve already crippled Lin Yun based on how he injured their companion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was rare for Mu Ling to show benevolence and yet he was treated with ridicule instead. While Mu Ling lost his temper, Lin Yun casually waved his hand and coldly responded, “Cut the crap. Hand over all the Swordcloud Cores you guys have on you. Otherwise, I will not be responsible for the consequences!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If these people didn’t have Swordcloud Cores, Lin Yun wouldn’t be willing to be used by the outer disciples. After all, he could enter and leave the Sword Tomb as he wished since no one was capable of stopping him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha! I’ve seen many arrogant people, but I’ve never seen someone like you. Kill him!” Mu Ling waved his hand. The three inner disciples drew their swords, charged at Lin Yun, and unleashed their attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is…” Gu Beixuan and Chen Ling’s faces changed. They found the sword technique executed by the three inner disciples somewhat familiar, but they couldn’t exactly recall what it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother Zhong, watch out! That’s the Three-Demise Sword Formation!” yelled Lin Qiushan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Three-Demise Sword Formation?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Lin Yun was briefly stunned. It sounded familiar and it seemed to be a spiritual sword technique that combined the power of several people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Lin Yun was in deep thought, the three inner disciples swung their swords with disdain. Facing the sword formation, Lin Yun was caught by surprise and allowed a few sword gleams to cut his clothes, causing blood flow from his wounds. However, the Seven Profound Steps allowed him to avoid the lethal attacks and thanks to the Dracophant Battle Physique, he merely suffered superficial injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph!” Mu Ling’s face turned dark when he saw this scene.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Three-Demise Sword Formation was truly powerful and enlightening for Lin Yun. If he faced the three inner disciples individually, he could easily defeat them within ten moves. But it was a different question with the three of them combining their strength together. It was more interesting now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A brief moment later, he found the loopholes in the formation and his eyebrows scrunched beneath his mask. The Three-Demise Sword Formation was powerful, but these people didn’t even reach greater mastery with it. It was full of flaws. However, Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry to break the formation as he wanted to observe more and gain some comprehension. Perhaps it could loosen his bottleneck in the Overlord Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the spectators knew nothing about his thoughts. They only felt that Lin Yun was having a tough time against the Three-Demise Sword Formation. This made Lin Yan nervous and she asked, “Big Sister, what’s the Three-Demise Sword Formation?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Three-Demise Sword Formation is derived from the Nine-Demise Sword Formation from ancient times. The Nine-Demise Sword Formation has been lost for a long time, but the remnants of it gave birth to many sword formations. The Three-Demise Sword Formation is one of them. It’s an intermediate spiritual sword technique and in the entire Great Qin Empire, only the Sword Firmament Pavilion possesses a full copy,” explained Lin Qiushan with a grave expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After listening to Lin Qiushan’s explanation, even Li Wuyou’s expression turned grave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This spiritual sword technique is truly extraordinary. It trapped Zhong Yunxiao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhong Yunxiao will get hit in his vitals sooner or later. These inner disciples are really shameless to use the Three-Demise Sword Formation against an outer disciple.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph! There’s a reason why they’re ranked in the last one hundred on the Earth Ranking. What a pity for Zhong Yunxiao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The outer disciples were filled with admiration for Zhong Yunxiao’s strength and confidence. When they look at how he faced the Three-Demise Sword Formation by himself, they couldn’t help cursing the inner disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is bad!” exclaimed Lin Qiushan. They noticed that Mu Ling had snuck up on Lin Yun without anyone noticing. On the other hand, Lin Yun was fully focused on comprehending the Three-Demise Sword Formation, so he didn’t notice Mu Ling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Die!” Mu Ling suddenly revealed a sinister smile. He charged into the Three-Demise Sword Formation without any warning and threw a punch at Lin Yun’s chest. The violent origin energy poured into Lin Yun’s body from the fist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no way Lin Yun could take it even with the Dracophant Battle Physique. Blood started to leak from his lips and he was blown away. Before Lin Yun even landed on the ground, Mu Ling’s punches struck out once more and forced Lin Yun to put up his defence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Origin energy fluctuated and Mu Ling ended up throwing dozens of punches in a split second. When his last punch landed, it sent Lin Yun flying over a hundred meters away. After Mu Ling landed on the ground, he looked at Lin Yun and sneered, “And here I thought you were somewhat capable. So it turns out that you’re just a piece of garbage!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nice one!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha! Senior Brother Mu is right. This brat is just courting death.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s kill him today. Otherwise, the outer disciples will still look down on us.” The three inner disciples sheathed their swords and mocked Lin Yun with disdain on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun slightly tilted the mask and wiped the blood off his lips. When he looked at his own blood in his hand, he smiled, “You guys are ultimately inner disciples. It’s time for me to get serious. It looks like there’s no way for me to win without using martial techniques.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t use any martial techniques?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;The four inner disciples were shocked. Lin Yun readjusted the mask and revealed a cold smile, immediately charging over at them. When he ran, he released the Dragon-Tiger Might and Lin Yun’s image began to grow bigger in everyone’s hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Ling and everyone else didn’t feel much, but all the outer disciples became emotional because they recognized the Dragon-Tiger Fist. Out of tens of thousands of outer disciples, there were those who knew the Dragon-Tiger Fist and there were also those who knew the Seven Profound Steps. However, there was only one person in the outer sect that knew the Dragon-Tiger Fist and the Seven Profound Steps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A name suddenly appeared in everyone’s hearts. For a split second, everyone including Lin Qiushan became emotional. Zhong Yunxiao was Lin Yun, the monstrous genius who rang the Phoenix Plum!</span></p>
