 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun felt as though his head was splitting apart and he couldn’t muster any strength from his body. The Scarletflame War Flag had practically exhausted all his origin energy, not to mention that he was heavily injured after taking a saber from the old man. It was a ruthless sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Lin Yun endured his injuries to execute the Moon Reflection. So not only was his origin energy exhausted, but he even drained himself past his reserves. He was overwhelmed by exhaustion and pain now that he could relax.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No words could describe this pain. However, Lin Yun tried his best to endure and keep his eyes open. He was yelling at himself inwardly because he knew that he wouldn’t be able to get back up if he collapsed right now. But the exhaustion and pain was too much for him to bear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But just when he was about to collapse, a figure bolted over and placed a hand on his shoulder. It was Xin Jue, who sent a wisp of origin energy into Lin Yun’s body at this critical moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Jue was calm and didn’t even panic in this situation. He controlled his origin energy to circulate throughout Lin Yun’s body, guiding the violet origin energy. Lin Yun’s consciousness was blurred, but he still opened his eyes and asked weakly, “Senior Brother, am I dying?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You won’t die here,” smiled Xin Jue. He continued, “You have to live well. We still have to participate in the Dragon Gate Competition together at the end of this year. Let’s get a title together.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I might not be able to do it. All the titled figures are capable of killing Violet Palace Realms, but it was too forceful for me to do it.” Once the Dragon Gate competition was mentioned, Lin Yun gradually came to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Says who? How will you know if you don’t try? Live well and don’t think too much about it,” smiled Xin Jue. He knew that Lin Yun was finally stable since Lin Yun’s origin energy had also started to circulate under his guidance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While he was speaking to Lin Yun, he was also helping Lin Yun to recover his injuries. The injury on his chest was a serious one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man no longer got up once he fell to the ground. His vitality soon dissipated and he became a cold, dried-up corpse. It was only now that everyone believed that an elder in the Violet Palace Realm was killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless sects’ elders and disciples sucked in a cold breath when they saw this scene. There were many casualties in the battle between the five sects, but there hadn’t been any deaths among the elders until now. Excluding the old man, they were, at most, heavily injured by the Firmament Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sword-Bearing Elder wanted to kill them, but he couldn’t free himself from the fight, sohe could only allow them to escape. It wasn’t easy to reach the Violet Palace Realm and the elders represented the foundation of a sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So much so that the number of Violet Palace Realm elders determined a sect’s position. So losing an elder was a greater loss than losing Mu Xiuhan, Bai Yue, and Jing Jue.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t easy to kill a cultivator in the Violet Palace Realm, but now, one had died right in front of them. He was killed by Xin Jue and Lin Yun, which made everyone feel frightened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Holy shit. The Sword Firmament Pavilion is really filled with talent. Just Lin Yun by himself is terrifying, but there’s also Xin Jue…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve heard for a long time that he possesses strength comparable to the eight titles.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I heard that the Sword Firmament Pavilion is planning to let him participate in the Dragon Gate Competition at the end of this year to become one of the eight titles.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He has the qualification with his strength.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t underestimate Lin Yun either. The last attack he used was terrifying. I’m afraid that no one can compare to him in terms of swords.” The various sects’ elders and disciples started discussing among themselves after their initial shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back at the Hundred Beast Gate’s camp, an elder looked at the battle with killing intent brimming in his eyes. He spoke out, “Feng Ye, the Sword Firmament Pavilion is clearly in a disadvantageous position. I’m afraid that the Heavenly Profound Sect and Demonic Moon Villa won’t join into this battle. So what do you think of…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a sect located at the border of the Great Qin Empire, it was normal for them to rob others. The Sword Firmament Pavilion was alone and fighting against four sects. Sooner or later, they would be defeated. So the elder was thinking of taking advantage of this opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The various sects of the Great Qin Empire might feel indignant for the Sword Firmament Pavilion, but they didn’t dare to do anything when the Heavenly Profound Sect and Demonic Moon Villa were just watching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Ye was tempted by the suggestion because he knew how many treasures were in Lin Yun’s interspatial pouch. But he couldn’t help hesitating whenever he recalled his interaction with Lin Yun back in the Demonlotus Realm. He knew that Lin Yun would become a threat if he wasn’t killed so he had thoughts of robbing Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, Feng Ye gave up on the idea. He shook his head, “Don’t be rash. I feel that even if the Sword Firmament Pavilion is defeated, the Sword-Bearing Elder can still leave with Lin Yun and that no one can stop him. Furthermore…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Furthermore what?” asked the elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Ye smiled, “Furthermore, Bai Yue, Mu Xiuhan, and Jing Jue are dead. In the future, how will the three sects compete with us? I obtained a fruit in the Demonlotus Realm and have yet to refine it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Hundred Beast Gate was already the biggest winner even if they didn’t join in the fight. So there was no need for them to take the risk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, a commotion suddenly rang out in the Extermination Barrens. Sounds came from all directions, causing the face of everyone present to change. They saw flags waving in the sky with two words written on them, Divine Guards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s the Divine Guards!” Feng Ye’s face changed. He soon thought of something and he couldn’t help being covered in cold sweat. But soon after, he smiled, “The Demonflame Sect is doomed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s going on?” asked the Hundred Beast Gate’s elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just enjoy the show,” smiled Feng Ye. Compared to Feng Ye, the various sects’ elders were baffled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s the Divine Guards doing by marching all at once? They actually mobilized their entire army…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s weird. The Divine Guards never poke their nose into the affairs of the sects. They’re only responsible for keeping this place safe.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are they trying to do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the sects’ elders locked their brows together. The Divine Guards was an elite army of the empire. They might not be able to compete with the sects’ disciples individually, but they were professionals when it came to large-scale wars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most importantly, the Divine Guards had been operating in the Extermination Barrens for a thousand years. There was no way that the men dispatched by the various sects could compete with them. Putting in a nutshell, the Divine Guards was an overlord in the Extermination Barrens and no sects could compete with them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Simultaneously, the five sects also sensed the Divine Guards’ actions. The four sects were furious when they saw this scene. They were winning, but the Divine Guards just had to ruin the moment. Just what were they trying to do by sending out their army?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It didn’t take long for the Divine Guards to surround the five sects. The soldiers were each donned in a silver armor and shield. They were elites that brimmed with killing aura. They were nothing impressive by themselves, but they were to be feared when banded together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were also tamed demonic beasts hovering in the air to cut off all paths of retreat. The formation split apart and a soldier riding on a demonic beast horse came before the two factions. His gaze was cold, but no one could see his appearance under his armor. But everyone instantly recognized his identity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Liu Feilong!” Liu Feilong, also known as the Flying Dragon General. He was one of the strongest existences in the Great Qin Empire. It had been many years since anyone had seen him, so he was rumored to be in seclusion making his breakthrough into the Heavenly Soul Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sword-Bearing Elder was also surprised when he saw Liu Feilong. But when he swept his gaze, he saw Liu Yue standing beside Liu Feilong.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was it because of Liu Yue?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;But that didn’t make any sense because Liu Yue was already kicked out two months ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“General Liu, what is the meaning of this?” The Demonflame Sect’s Grand Elder frowned. The other sects’ elders also looked unhappy. They finally forced the Sword Firmament Pavilion to a dead-end after so many casualties. So they couldn’t accept the fact that the Divine Guards came to interfere in this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Divine Guards have never interfered in the sects’ disputes. Furthermore, we might not belong to the empire, but we’ve been loyal to the royal family. The Divine Guards represent the royal family, so you wouldn’t make an enemy out of us, right?” An elder stepped forward, but Liu Feilong had ignored him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Anyone who’s not related to the Demonflame Sect should leave now,” yelled Yue Qing as he rode the demon beast horse forth. This made the various sect’s elders baffled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wen Yanbo instantly gave a signal. The elders and disciples of the Primal Origin Sect quietly backed off and put quite a distance between them and the Demonflame Sect. The Sevendespair Palace and Bloodbone Gate also sensed that something was amiss and quickly retreated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surrounding shields stepped forward to narrow the encirclement. Not long after, the Demonflame Sect were left by themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elders and disciples of the Demonflame Sect started to panic. They weren’t stupid, so they could tell that the Divine Guards were about to make a move at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An elder of the Demonflame Sect stepped forward and smiled, “General, is there a misunderstanding?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But before he could even finish, Liu Feilong suddenly moved. No one even saw how he moved, but when he landed on the ground, the Demonflame Sect’s elder was pierced through the head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Leave none of them alive! Slaughter them all!” instructed Yue Qing. In the next second, a massacre unfolded.</span></p>
