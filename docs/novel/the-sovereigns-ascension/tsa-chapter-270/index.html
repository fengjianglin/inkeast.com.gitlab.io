 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Lei fell onto the ground in pain and his face looked drained. His eyes reflected his fear and shock. Dragon Painting was the fifth form of the Dragon-Tiger Fist and there weren’t many disciples in the Heavenly Profound Sect who managed to practice it. Even worse was that Lin Yun had reached greater mastery in it. But as a Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciple, the Dragon Painting executed by Lin Yun was even stronger than the ones used by the Heavenly Profound Sect’s disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Damn it, I’ll kill you today!” Zhang Lei roared and hammered his fist into the ground. He jumped up off the ground, raising a cloud of dust outside the Contribution Hall. His fist made the ground tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Lei grabbed onto his sword and dashed out, circulating the Blazing Sun Art within his body. His eyes began to blaze with flames and his hair fluttered in the wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Lin Yun was starting to lose his patience as rage built up in his eyes. Anyone who wasn’t stupid could tell the difference between them from the previous exchange, but Zhang Lei still foolishly charged at Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Did Zhang Lei really think that Lin Yun didn’t have a temper? Lin Yun raised his leg and poured the two cultivation techniques’ origin energy into his right foot before kicking out. Cracks started forming on the ground and Lin Yun’s foot shot out with his sword aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His attack raised a cloud of dust outside the Contribution Hall and everyone struggled to stabilize themselves. As for Zhang Lei, he was once again sent flying away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother!” The disciples in the same alliance-union as Zhang Lei called out and immediately went over to him. But once they got to their feet, they sensed a cold glare directed at them. They raised their heads and saw Lin Yun looking at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They turned to look back at Zhang Lei who was struggling to get on his feet. They knew that they couldn’t move, so their faces turned pale. It was a terrible feeling being unable to move under Lin Yun’s glare. It felt even more terrifying than being enveloped by a wandering cultivator’s ominous aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Yun, don’t take it too far! The consequences for failing the missions isn’t something that you can imagine. Not even Xin Yan can save you!” Zhang Lei looked at Lin Yun furiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“And what does it have to do with you?” Lin Yun asked calmly with his hands behind his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Lei was furious, but he didn’t know what to say when Lin Yun asked him that question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun pressed him again, “Does it have anything to do with you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Does it?” he questioned. For some reason, those two simple words sent deep fear into Zhang Lei’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three sword gleams shot out when Lin Yun flicked his finger, pinning Zhang Lei down. It wasn’t hard since he was already struggling to get back on his feet. The sword gleams lasted for four breaths before they disappeared. They were four times stronger than the ones released by Zhang Lei. The cloud of dust slowly spread out and everyone exclaimed in fear of Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I-I-It has nothing to do with me!” Zhang Lei finally submitted from the pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do I have to give you any explanation?” Lin Yun showed no signs of letting Zhang Lei off even after the latter surrendered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Lei was overwhelmed by fear and his legs wouldn’t stop trembling. He could sense that Lin Yun was furious, but he didn’t know how to reply. But when he saw Lin Yun slowly approaching, he finally replied with a trembling voice, “You don’t have to give me any explanations. Junior Brother Lin, you must’ve misunderstood my words…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Lin Yun was still walking over. He raised his voice and asked, “Didn’t you say that you needed an explanation from me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surroundings were silent as no one dared to utter a word. Zhang Lei arrived with the intention of trampling Lin Yun for failing the missions. However, he was the one who ended up on the ground trembling in fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only three months had passed, but now Zhang Lei was nothing in Lin Yun’s eyes. Lin Yun was so domineering and those who mocked him previously started to tremble uneasily. They were afraid that Lin Yun would turn his attention to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Lei wore a bitter expression as he watched Lin Yun approach. The pressure he was currently feeling wasn’t something that anyone could imagine. Every single footstep from Lin Yun sounded like a demonic bell ringing in his heart</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Speak! What explanation do you want from me?” Lin Yun’s bark sounded off like a bolt of rumbling lightning and everyone trembled at it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Lei was initially the one who was doing the interrogating, but the tables had turned. Those three questions from Lin Yun left Zhang Lei speechless and trembling in fear. But all of a sudden, something unexpected took place. Zhang Lei’s knees fell down heavily as he kneeled on the ground. This struck a great blow in everyone’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Lei was in the top ten of the Mortal Ranking, but he was now on his knees from Lin Yun’s three questions. This scene caught everyone by surprise. Many people widened their mouths in shock. The top ten on the Mortal Ranking were kings in the outer sect and they had nothing to fear. They were domineering and their words represented the law.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If anyone provoked them, not only would they have to beg for mercy on their knees, but they also had to admit their mistake. However, Zhang Lei kneeling on the ground shattered that image. Instead, this humiliation was done by a youth named Lin Yun. A youth who was soaring in the outer sect like a dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Brother Lin, I apologize for what I said previously,” said Zhang Lei on his knees.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do I have the qualification to walk here?” Lin Yun questioned him calmly without any ripples on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can,” responded Zhang Lei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can I accept the five star missions?” asked Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can,” Zhang Lei said while gnashing his teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun continued, “Can I break the rules?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can,” responded Zhang Lei once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Lei didn’t have any anger as he kneeled before Lin Yun. He only asked Lin Yun not to torture him anymore. He didn’t want to go through the torturous questioning again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the sword box on his back, Lin Yun looked at Zhang Lei and asked, “Then why are you kneeling down?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t dare to stand up without your permission.” Zhang Lei’s words shattered many people’s hearts, especially those from the same alliance-union as Zhang Lei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Well then, carry on. Remain kneeling for however long you’ve made others kneel.” Lin Yun turned around and headed towards the Contribution Hall. Lin Yun’s figure was imposing in everyone’s eyes. Then, the onlookers sighed at the sight of Zhang Lei on his knees.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Complicated emotions filled the onlookers as they observed Lin Yun’s silhouette. It was at this moment that they finally realized that another monstrous genius was born in the Sword Firmament Pavilion.</span></p>
