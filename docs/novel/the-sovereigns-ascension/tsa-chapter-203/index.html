 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Lin Yun and Li Wuyou take the initiative to charge over, the four guards and Liu Yue were briefly shocked and slowed their pace. But after a while, there was a strange smile on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A first stage of the Profound Martial Realm and a Xiantian Realm brat dare to take the initiative to attack us?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are they insane?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Deacon Liu, you can stay here and see how we deal with them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t surprising to see them act so confidently. After all, the four of them were in the sixth stage of the Profound Martial Realm, so any single one of them could destroy the pair. They were so much stronger that they could even kill them with one move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a massive gap of five stages in their cultivation. The only explanation they had for Lin Yun and Li Wuyou’s actions was that they were insane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Raising her brow, Liu Yue replied indifferently, “The two of them are courting death, just remember not to injure the Dragon Blooded Horse.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, we know, we know. It’s rare for Deacon Liu to take a liking to something, so we will do our best.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Descending Moon and Stars—Nine Nether Slash!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But before they could even make a move, a starry sky appeared above their heads. The starry sky was boundless and bright. It was so close that it felt like they could touch it by reaching out. The entire starry sky was like a giant pair of eyes that were staring at them. This sudden phenomenon left the four guards stunned. They never expected Li Wuyou’s Martial Soul to create such a huge commotion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Wuyou let out a roar into the starry sky. Shortly after, a sword basked in myriad starlights descended from the nine heavens. The commotion caused by this sword was great and the four guards did not dare to take it lightly. They couldn’t believe that such a phenomenon was created by someone in the seventh orifice of the Xiantian Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go!” The four guards did not dare to be careless and faced Li Wuyou’s majestic sword. But what took them by surprise was how weak Li Wuyou’s sword looked. When they executed their martial techniques, Li Wuyou’s sword had already started to break apart before their attacks connected with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Wuyou vomited out a mouthful of blood. The blood within his body was thrown into chaos and his face paled. The four guards were surprised by this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But shortly after, the four of them calmed down. After all, it would be abnormal if a cultivator in the seventh orifice of the Xiantian Realm could take their attacks. But just when their attacks were about to land on Li Wuyou, a crimson figure bolted past them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the Dragon Blooded Horse. When the horse landed on the ground, it defended Li Wuyou with its magnificent body. When the four guards saw this scene, their faces immediately changed and they quickly stopped their attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t hurt the horse! Subdue it!” The four of them changed their strategy and relied on their cultivation to suppress the Dragon Blooded Horse. When Niu Bingshun saw that the four were busy dealing with the Dragon Blooded Horse, he hurried over to help Li Wuyou to his feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heh, it’s ultimately still a beast!” The Dragon Blooded Horse might be fast, but it was helpless against the four guards. It merely took a moment for them to subdue the horse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they looked at the Dragon Blooded Horse, the four guards smiled. They were excited to take credit for completing the task.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, wait! Where’s the other one?” One of the guards suddenly recalled that Lin Yun was missing and changed his face. Right at this moment, a scream could be heard from the back. When they turned around, they saw Liu Yue on the ground and Lin Yun stepping on her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Get lost!” The four of them immediately flew into anger and kicked Niu Bingshun. They carried Li Wuyou and anxiously ran towards Lin Yun. They now understood that Li Wuyou was creating an opportunity for Lin Yun by causing a huge commotion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four of them were in the sixth stage of the Profound Martial Realm. So aside from capturing Liu Yue, there was no way they could win. This meant that Liu Yue was their only chance of turning the tables.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the four guards were puzzled. They had no idea where Li Wuyou’s confidence in Lin Yun came from in order to take Liu Yue down and to face all four of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Order them to release him!” Lin Yun barked as he looked at Li Wuyou who was being escorted over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Never!” Liu Yue gnashed her teeth with her face practically stuck in the ground. She never imagined that she would get stepped on by someone from Herbal Peak. When she saw the four guards escorting Li Wuyou over, a cold light flashed across her eyes. She immediately raised her head and gave them a signal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the guards received her signal, they threw Li Wuyou onto the ground and stepped on him. When they applied pressure to their feet, cracks could be heard coming from Li Wuyou’s ribs. The guard who was stepping on Li Wuyou barked at Lin Yun, “Let Deacon Liu go if you want your brother alive!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the other three, they were feeling nervous. No matter how things ended today, there was no way they could escape punishment for allowing Liu Yue to be captured under their watch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Get your men to release Wuyou!” Lin Yun spoke out coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Yue could sense Lin Yun’s trembling feet, causing her to sneer. She was confident that Lin Yun was only faking it and barked out coldly, “Kill him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun’s face turned cold instantly. He had been polite with this woman since the beginning and he didn’t use much force even when he was stepping on her. But this woman had forced him time and time again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the rage building up in his chest reached its limit, he raised the whip in his hand and lashed down. The whip produced a loud snapping sound on Liu Yue’s body and left a long gash. However, Lin Yun didn’t bother with that and whipped her two more times. Liu Yue screamed out in pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’ll release him! We’ll release him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stop immediately!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brat, do you know who she is?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four guards immediately panicked when they saw the three gashes on Liu Yue’s body. Beads of cold sweat rolled down their foreheads. They immediately helped Li Wuyou back on his feet without any delay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wuyou, come over.” Lin Yun said. He had raised the whip in his hand, but did not strike down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let me go!” Li Wuyou shook their hands off and staggered towards Lin Yun. On the ground, Liu Yue was whining out in pain. She didn’t have the energy to speak. She had always been the one whipping others, not the other way around. However, she finally experienced how painful it was to be whipped. She also knew that Lin Yun had given her a chance by not doing so earlier.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You couldn’t expect others to be polite to you if you were shameless. The three whips were Lin Yun’s lesson to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You deserve it!” Li Wuyou said, standing beside Lin Yun as he coldly looked at the four guards. The four guards were strong. They were overbearing just a moment ago, but now they were wiping the sweat off their foreheads with ugly expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother, we’ve already released your friend. Shouldn’t you release Deacon Liu as well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother, you really can’t touch Deacon Liu. If you don’t release her immediately, we will all be doomed,” the four guards begged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Get lost!” Lin Yun ignored their words and barked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Quick, look for the Hall Master!” The four guards did not want to waste any more time. The four of them were panicking from the current situation. After all, that was Liu Yue and she had been whipped three times by someone serving time at Herbal Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They immediately ran towards the Herbal Hall. Not long after they ran out, a condor descended from the sky. The terrifying aura released from the condor slammed the four of them back. Spreading its wings wide, the condor let out a cry, which produced gusts of wind in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Someone was standing on the condor’s back, it was Xin Yan. Today, she wore a red dress that wrapped her voluptuous figure tightly. Who else could be so charming besides Xin Yan?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jumping down from the Sword Condor, Xin Yan looked at the three gashes on the person below Lin Yun’s foot with shock. But she soon regained her composure and spoke out, “Junior Brother Lin Yun, let her go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Roger that!” Lin Yun naturally complied and released Liu Yue. Liu Yue’s hair was a mess. Dirt covered her face and she struggled to get up. Although she was a woman, in comparison to Xin Yan, it was like one was a ghost and the other was a fairy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe. Senior Sister Xin Yan, what brings you here?” Li Wuyou’s eyes immediately lit up when he saw Xin Yan. Even his injuries didn’t feel so painful anymore. Furthermore, his eyes were fixed on her chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin yan suddenly slapped him on the head and snapped, “Where do you think you’re looking at?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Sister Xin Yan, what brings you here? It hasn’t been three months yet,” Lin Yun smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Staring at Lin Yun, Xin Yan said in a half-joking tone, “That’s because I miss you guys. Now, come with me. We’ve already given that old fellow enough face for a month. He’s in trouble right now and he’s wrecking his head trying to explain things to the Wang Clan. He can’t be bothered with you two right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No way! The two of them destroyed a hundred spiritual herbs and they have to be punished here for ten years!” Liu Yue barked, seeing that Xin Yan was about to leave with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A hundred spiritual herbs?” A boundless sword intent suddenly burst out from Xin Yan, destroying a few patches of spiritual herbs in the field. At least two thousand of them were destroyed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Now, I destroyed three thousand spiritual herbs. Add their hundred onto mine and get your Hall Master to look for me.” Xin Yan sheathed her sword and turned around. At this moment, she looked gallant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at her, Lin Yun and Li Wuyou were both speechless from her beauty.</span></p>
