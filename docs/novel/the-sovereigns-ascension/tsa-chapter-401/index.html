He had already guessed the plump old man’s identity, but he didn’t expect that the old man to be so heartless. The old man had clearly helped him to comprehend the tenth sword, but he also gave him such a challenge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I heard that the Pavilion Master is hardly seen and that his mood fluctuates easily. It looks like the rumours are true,” said Lin Yun as he looked at the old man. If he was right, this old man was the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s Pavilion Master, Jian Xuanhe. Aside from him, no one would dare to be so wanton.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stop wasting time here and think about how you’re going to get back up. Hah, the boy who doesn’t regret his killings. I do have to remind you that Lil’ Plum won’t be able to save you if you’re discovered to be gone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lil’ Plum? Was that Guardian Plum’s nickname?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then again, this old man was probably the only one who dared to call Guardian Plum by that nickname. Lin Yun no longer bothered with the old man and jumped back to the lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He took a rough look at the cliff. He could only see a thousand meters before the cliff was covered in clouds. He might be able to give it a try if he used the Seven Profound Steps to climb the wall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Turning into a streak of light, Lin Yun flashed and grabbed onto the cliff. But to his realization, he wasn’t able to leave any marks on the cliff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How is this possible?!” Lin Yun’s face changed. He practiced the Dracophant Battle Physique, which made his fingers as powerful as a profound artifact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Lin Yun recalled how the mountain shook from his palm, but it didn’t leave any marks behind. He finally understood that the cliff had an array and that it was practically impossible to leave any marks on it. The cliff was smooth like a mirror and it was too unrealistic trying to find somewhere he could use as his footing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Executing the Seven Profound Steps once more, the Golden Crow Seal appeared behind his back and he soared into the sky like a golden crow. However, he lost momentum halfway up the cliff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With reluctance flashing in his eyes, Lin Yun stepped on the air and left behind nine afterimages, with each afterimages throwing out a palm. When Lin Yun’s afterimages overlapped together, Lin Yun took a deep breath and his figure became blurred in the sky. In the next second, he radiated like a sun as he soared into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the old man saw Lin Yun disappearing from his view, he muttered to himself, “The higher you climb, the harder you fall.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lin Yun entered the clouds, he raised his head and finally saw the end of the Repent Cliff. He instantly rejoiced, but before the smile could even last a second on his face, he dropped down like a meteor and fell into the lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His fall caused a huge wave. Looking at Lin Yun, he wasn’t far from having his bones broken. It was impossible for him to climb the cliff with his current cultivation, even with the help of the Seven Profound Steps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he tried to beg the old man, he knew that the old man might help him, but that would only make the old man look down on him. Lin Yun got back on his feet and he took out a jade slip. The jade slip has three words written on it—Great Wind Scripture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was his reward from the Azure Sun Realm. He could hear the words of the Sky Piercer Altar’s spirit lingering in his ears, “I will bestow you the Great Wind Scripture, hoping that you can soar to the nine heavens with the wind one day!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He initially thought that the Great Wind Scripture was a cultivation technique for the Profound Martial Realm, but he later realized that it was different. He had to comprehend the intent behind it if he wanted to practice it. It would be dangerous if he didn’t. He had a feeling that the Great Wind Scripture was for cultivators in the Violet Palace Realm. After all, how could a martial technique from ancient times be compared to those today?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I only have one night to try this.” Lin Yun placed the jade slip on his forehead and allowed the martial technique to enter his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Northern Nether has a fish, known as the Kunpeng. It could transform into a bird and fly in the air. Free and unfettered requires wind and the elements. And it is only achieved by gathering all the six elements. Heaven and earth have six elements - wind, rain, yin, yang, light, and darkness. The wind was one of the six elements and it was also placed at the beginning of the six elements. Without wind, none of the five other auras could exist…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun read through the jade slip and placed it down. When he opened his eyes, the sky had already turned dark, meaning he didn’t have much time left. Lin Yun held onto the jade slip and he slowly walked on the lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps it was because he had brought the Aquaselenic Sword to the manifestation stage, but he realized that the Great Wind Scripture was no longer that hard to comprehend. Kunpeng could swim in the sea and it would also transform into a bird to fly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, he was like a fish in the sea and he had to transform into a bird to fly. This meant that he needed wind. After all, how could he fly without wind?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Great Wind Scripture had a total of four stages, which was different from modern categorization. The Great Wind Scripture was separated into fine, brilliant, wondrous, and perfection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It started out fine, which meant that lesser and greater masteries didn’t exist. This stated that this martial technique had a high threshold and you would either gain something from it or fail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Where does wind come from?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could naturally create wind by gathering his origin energy and sending his palm forward, but it was clearly the wrong method.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Win, rain, yin, yang, light, and darkness. They should be the six elements, which have existed through ancient times. He had a feeling that he could get a clue from ‘without wind, the five other elements wouldn’t exist.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps the plump old man would know something about it. Lin Yun turned to look at the old man, but the old man was smiling at him as he pointed at the sky. The old man was implying that the sky had turned dark and that he didn’t have much time left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the old man’s expression, Lin Yun recalled his gaze because he knew that he couldn’t depend on the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wind… If a leaf is being blown around, was the leaf moving or was the wind moving? It was clearly the wind that moved the leaf.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun’s eyes suddenly lit up and he caught onto something. He closed his eyes and he began to ponder. Time gradually passed and Lin Yun’s eyes lit up when he reopened them. Where does the wind come from?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was wind as long as there was something moving in the world. So if he moved the water on the lake, the wind would naturally be produced. The more Lin Yun pondered about it, the brighter his eyes lit up. At the same time, he also gained insight into the Great Wind Scripture’s mantra.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He circulated his origin energy according to the mantra and he was soon enveloped by a boundless aura. This made the old man frown his brows as he wondered what Lin Yun was trying to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Lin Yun soared into the sky and he threw a palm at the lake. When his palm landed at the lake, the force from his palm sent the lake three inches down and the rebound force sent Lin Yun into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun smiled as he saw the Repent Cliff getting closer. When he was a few hundred meters away, Lin Yun’s face suddenly changed when he sensed the wind getting weaker. Right at this moment, the zither sounded out and a wind enveloped him to send him to the Repent Cliff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun gently landed on the ground. In the end, he still needed help from the old man. But Lin Yun wasn’t too bothered about it as it couldn’t be considered a favour.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he raised his head, he saw the deacons looking at him on their Sword Condors. When they saw that he was still on the Repent Cliff, they didn’t say anything and left. But Lin Yun didn’t know that the moment he crossed the Repent Cliff, Guardian Plum appeared on the lake. He looked at the lake and sighed, “The wave is really big.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There cannot be waves without wind. What brings you here?” Asked the plump old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The crown prince came again today,” said Guardian Plum with an unsightly face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The plump old man had a faint look of sorrow on his face as he looked at the lake silently. Pulling the zither strings, he spoke out without any expression on his face, “No one can touch her if she’s not willing. But if she nodded her head, then no one can save her.”</span></p>
