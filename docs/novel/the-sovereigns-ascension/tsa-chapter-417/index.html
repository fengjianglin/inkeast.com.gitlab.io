But Luo Yuhang was Twilight’s junior brother and he also had an unfathomable cultivation. So despite the commotion caused by the disciples, none of them dared to step forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, Luo Yuhang said that he would exchange pointers after defeating someone. This meant that they wouldn’t just lose, but they would also be used as the topic to pick on. It was humiliating to think about. If they were defeated, they wouldn’t just be embarrassing themselves, but also the Sword Firmament Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Yuhang curled his lips with disdain and he suddenly stood up, “There’s naturally a reason why I’m ranked fifth on the Newly Risen Ranking. Senior Brother Ye is low-profile, which is why he isn’t in the ranking. What’s the matter? Do you guys think that you are also not in the ranking because you are low-profile?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Those with strength but not on the ranking are called low-profile. As for those without the strength to make it into the ranking, they’re just garbage. I’m not targeting anyone, but I’m saying that none of you here are my opponent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His words instantly caused an uproar. Before the uproar could settle down, Luo Yuhang continued, “What’s the matter? You guys find it prickling to the ears? It’s just the truth. Bai Lixuan is ranked first on the ranking and he’s one of your Sword Firmament Pavilion. That, I accept. But he’s in seclusion, and he’s not here right now. But I heard that there’s someone else in the Sword Firmament Pavilion. Unfortunately, he crippled one of his profound veins and dropped to the eighth stage. As for him, I can only say that he won’t go far in the Dragon Gate competition.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Brother Ye invited me to exchange pointers, so I still stick to my words. I’ll talk when I defeat someone with the sword in my hand. Otherwise, who would be convinced by just words?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples were all enraged. Luo Yuhang was simply too arrogant to humiliate them. Then again, what he said made sense. At the same time, they could also refute it by defeating him, but none of them were confident to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Yun locked his brows together. It looks like the Sword Cloud Pavilion was here to make trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Does anyone here dare to spar with me?” Luo Yuhang smiled, but his smile was filled with ridicule for all of the disciples present. Since Luo Yuhang was Twilight’s junior brother, he must be the second strongest in his sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Sword Cloud Pavilion was inferior to the Sword Firmament Pavilion in terms of foundation, Luo Yuhang must have his own tricks to make it into the fifth on the Newly Risen Ranking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since Brother Luo wants to exchange pointers, then I’m interested in giving it a try.” A person stood up just when Lin Yun was about to go up. That person was Chen Xuanjun, who was ranked ninth on the Heaven Ranking. He was the same Chen Xuanjun who went into the Demonlotus Realm together with Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When all the gazes fell onto Chen Xuanjun, the latter could feel an immense pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Brother Chen made a breakthrough?” asked Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He made his breakthrough half a month after coming back from the Demonlotus Realm. It has been three months since then and he’s in the pinnacle tenth stage now,” explained Xin Yan. Chen Xuanjun had received great benefits from the Demonlotus Realm. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have stood up at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xuanjun landed on the stage and drew his sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It looks like the disciples of the Sword Firmament Pavilion aren’t cowards after all,” said Luo Yuhang as he stood a step forth and unleashed his cultivation in the pinnacle tenth stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This instantly caused a commotion beneath the stage because Luo Yuhang was truly worthy of being arrogant with his strength. Just his cultivation alone had suppressed the majority of the disciples here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xuanjun’s lips twitched. He started to regret stepping onto the stage at this moment, but there was nothing he could do since he was already up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry, I won’t take advantage of you. I’ll defeat you with my cultivation in the ninth stage,” smiled Luo Yuhang as his horrifying aura suddenly retracted. In the blink of an eye, he sealed his cultivation to the ninth stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This made Chen Xuanjun’s face turn red because Luo Yuhang was practically humiliating him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How arrogant!” roared Chen Xuanjun and his sword intent swelled like a demonic beast. Stabbing his sword, he was carried forward by its momentum and dashed towards Luo Yuhang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great timing!” Luo Yuhang took a step forward and his aura came crashing down. He didn’t even draw his sword. His aura took the shape of a sword and shot towards Chen Xuanjun’s forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This fellow does have some tricks up his sleeves after all,” muttered Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two on the stage had exchanged several moves in the blink of an eye. Although Luo Yuhang didn’t draw his sword, every of his attacks forced Chen Xuanjun to change the direction of his attacks. This repeated for ten-odd times before Chen Xuanjun’s aura began to drop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not good!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Lin Yun yelled in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My turn now.” Luo Yuhang smiled coldly and he suddenly grabbed onto his sword. His cultivation was still in the pinnacle ninth stage, but his aura underwent a transformation when he held onto his sword. His sword aura began to rise, causing his clothes and hair to flutter under the breeze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he drew his sword out, it unleashed a dazzling radiance that forced many disciples to squint their eyes from the brightness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Chen Xuanjun could catch a clear glimpse, the stage suddenly turned dark and Luo Yuhang’s figure disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s going on?” Chen Xuanjun’s face changed, but in the next second, the darkness was suddenly replaced by a dazzling brightness that caught him by surprise and stung his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xuanjun instantly reacted by retreating to avoid the fatal blow. As light and darkness alternated, Chen Xuanjun constantly dodged the incoming attacks directed at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After several moves later, Chen Xuanjun’s sword was knocked away along with several strands of his hair. Compared to his sword on the ground, his hair was even more striking. Because if Luo Yuhang had intended to kill him, then his hair wouldn’t be the only thing severed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I lost,” said Chen Xuanjun with much reluctance. Not only was his sword knocked away, but his opponent even cut several stands of his hair. This was a complete loss on his part.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The faces of the elders who saw this scene became ugly.</span></p>

What an embarrassment. Get lost.” Ye Feng spoke with a prideful tone. His words were like needles that stabbed into Chen Xuanjun’s heart, making him feel awkward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xuanjun could even see the ugly faces of the elders. He knew that he had embarrassed the Sword Firmament Pavilion. Simultaneously, even the disciples down the stage also feel that Chen Xuanjun was putting up a strong front because of Ye Feng’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not skillful enough and I’ve embarrassed the sect.” Chen Xuanjun cupped his hands together. He did not want to stay on the stage for another second.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’re not done exchanging pointers. I didn’t point out where you lost. You will go down only after I’m done,” said Luo Yuhang as he sheathed his sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xuanjun’s eyes blazed with rage when he heard that. Luo Yuhang was clearly not intending on letting him off. Not only did Luo Yuhang defeat him, but Luo Yuhang wanted to humiliate him even further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With grievance written on his face, Chen Xuanjun gnashed his teeth, “Go ahead, advise me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This isn’t exactly advice. Your sword technique is powerful and you’ve achieved great feats in it. However, you’re too bound by convention. You don’t know how to use it smoothly at all. This is the reason why I can defeat you so easily despite suppressing my cultivation to the ninth stage.” Luo Yuhang paused briefly, and he continued, “If you use that sword technique in the Dragon Gate Competition, your loss will be even more unsightly. It’s best if you don’t participate in it or you’ll just embarrass your sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Yuhang sat back in his chair and continued, “You can return now. I’m not targeting you personally, but I’m just saying that all the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples don’t amount to much. All of you have trapped yourselves in a box, so you guys will be beaten sooner or later. Then again, it’s not like you guys are better than garbage now. The Sword Firmament Pavilion only remains because there’s still a few people holding everything up. But if this goes on, you guys will lose the title as the strongest sword sect in the Great Qin Empire sooner or later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His words instantly dropped a bomb into the surroundings because Luo Yuhang practically just insulted them as garbage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Isn’t that a little too much?” Chen Xuanjun’s face turned red. He could feel that there was something wrong with Luo Yuhang’s words, but there was nothing he could say since he lost the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have to be honest since we’re exchanging pointers. We’re swordsmen and we talk with our swords. How is that too much? You can come and challenge me anytime if you think that it’s too much,” smiled Luo Yuhang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although his words caused an uproar down below, everyone soon became silent. They had to be cautious since Chen Xuanjun was an example beforehand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sitting beside Xin Yan, Lin Yun sighed inwardly. The Dragon Gate Competition was truly a grand event that caused all sorts of people to appear. As a sharp flash flickered through his eyes, Lin Yun stood up, “I would like to seek some advice from you.”</span></p>
