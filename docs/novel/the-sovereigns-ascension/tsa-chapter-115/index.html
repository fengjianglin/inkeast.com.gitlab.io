 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over a hundred people rushed towards Lin Yun because he was holding the Eighth Grade Lava Core in his Fiery Demon Physique form. Lin Yun had become the target of the masses just as the Demonic Blood Vulture had been when it was surrounded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man with the cultivation in the seventh orifice of the Xiantian Realm was the first to arrive. If Lin Yun continued to reach for the Lava Core, his attack would reach Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun looked at the old man and recalled the Wild Dragon Fist’s power. If the old man hit him, he might die even with the Fiery Demon Physique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hand over the Lava Core and I’ll spare your life!” The old man’s hair fluttered in the wind with killing intent glowing in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Lin Yun unhesitantly grabbed onto the Lava Core. In doing this, the old man’s fist was able to strike him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun cried out as he spit out a mouthful of blood. His fiery hair still fluttered in the wind as his entire body ached. Ultimately, his wound had caved in from the injury.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re courting death!” The old man coldly snorted and threw his palm over at Lin Yun’s forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Lin Yun rejoiced with a smile hanging on his lips; Lin Yun’s gamble was a success. All along he had been betting that the old man wouldn’t be able to kill him instantly. He had placed a bet on his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, it was just as he'd expected. Although the old man’s attack took half his life away, he was still alive thanks to the Fiery Demon Physique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man’s face changed. He was baffled by Lin Yun’s smile. There was no path of retreat and Lin Yun was still surrounded. Even if he had managed to survive the attack, there was no way he could escape. After all, Lin Yun couldn’t take everyone’s attack like the Demonic Blood Vulture had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, something unexpected occurred. Lin Yun’s body sank down and jumped into the crater.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one could obstruct the path of his jump into the crater.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man’s attack missed, leaving him dumbfounded. He had seen Lin Yun jump into the crater. It wasn’t just the old man, everyone had seen this and all their faces had changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stop him! Stop him!” Roars sounded out from the surrounding Xiantian Realm cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only was that brat jumping to his death, but he was also bringing the Eighth Grade Lava Core with him. The Eighth Grade Lava Core was something that would only appear once in a few hundred years. They would have to wait for another eight hundred years if they missed this opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For a moment, everyone frantically charged at the crater, but they were all too late. Lin Yun had already dived into the blazing lava.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hiss! Hiss!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the Xiantian Realm cultivators sucked in a cold breath and their faces paled. At the most crucial moment, they had jumped into the air. But when they landed on the ground, they could only gnash their teeth and look at the boiling lava.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a bastard! The Eighth Grade Lava Core only appears once every eight hundred years!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why did that bastard bring such a treasure to his death!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Damn it! If I knew this would’ve happened, I would’ve killed him beforehand!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone stood by the edge and started cursing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, there was nothing they could do about it. No matter how much they cursed, no one dared to jump down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Lin…” Zhang Yue endured the immense pressure of the lava and stood at the edge of the crater. Looking at the stirring lava, his face changed drastically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had just witnessed Lin Yun receive an attack from Senior Wang before he jumped into the crater. Even when Zhang Yu stood at the crater, he still couldn’t believe what had transpired.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was Lin Yun dead?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even at this moment, Lin Yun’s words echoed in his ears. He couldn’t accept that Lin Yun died just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Plop!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While everyone was cursing out at Lin Yun, a figure followed Lin Yun into the lava.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s Senior Wang!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man followed Lin Yun into the crater out of reluctance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When everyone saw this scene, their faces changed. Logically speaking, Lin Yun should be incinerated to ashes the moment he jumped in, which meant that the Eighth Grade Lava Core wouldn’t have sunk too deep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So if they jumped into the crater, there might be an opportunity for them to obtain the Eighth Grade Lava Core. However, they weren’t resolute enough to take the risk. In the end, they could only stomp their feet helplessly before moving away from the crater.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pressure at the crater was too great for the crowd, so they moved away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then again, it’s retribution for Lin Yun. After all, he had thrown Old Feng into the crater, so naturally it’s his turn to end up in the crater.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You know what, that youth is a really good sapling. He already wielded the Incomplete Sword Intent at such a young age along with the Fiery Demon Physique. If given time, his name will definitely resound throughout the Great Qin Empire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No point talking about that since he’s dead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Zhang Yue heard the surrounding discussion, he felt disappointed and frustrated. He still couldn’t believe what just happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How can you stand out if you don’t fight while everyone does?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Lin Yun’s words still echoed in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You might be right, Brother Lin. But did you really have to risk your life?” sighed Zhang Yue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A figure shot out from the crater. It was the old man. He came out covered in dirt and his facial expression was unsightly. Looking at him, everyone knew that he failed to get the Eighth Grade Lava Core…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But this was within their expectations. Even if the old man’s cultivation were in the seventh orifice of the Xiantian Realm, he wouldn’t dare to stay too long in the crater.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Profound Martial Realm cultivator might have better odds if they were here, but even then they wouldn’t be able to do anything if enough time passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But was Lin Yun dead? Of course not! After all, he had cultivated on the Flame Vein before. So as long as he didn’t venture too deep into the lava, his life wouldn’t be at risk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun was currently enveloped by the Violet Sacred Frostfire. It protected him from the lava’s high temperature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he wasn’t dead, he wasn’t exactly doing well. He was overwhelmed by exhaustion and he couldn’t even check his injuries. His eyelids were fighting to stay open.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Injuries would cause one to lose their consciousness if they reached a certain extent. Lin Yun knew that it was his body’s self-protection mechanism at work to conserve energy. He did not fight the exhaustion and allowed it to possess his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With my physique, I should be able to recover from 50-60% of my injuries by sleeping…</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Lin Yun’s thoughts slowly drifted and he fell asleep in the lava.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few days later, when he regained his consciousness, he had recovered a huge chunk of his energy. He looked at his caved-in chest and felt fortunate from the close call. When he was going after the Eighth Grade Lava Core, he had already predicted that the old man would come after him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So he expected that he would have to take an attack from the old man if he wanted the Lava Core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it was fortunate that the old man was injured from attacking the barrier earlier. If the old man could still execute his Wild Dragon Fist, Lin Yun wasn’t confident that he would survive. But seeing that he was fine, he knew that he had succeeded!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is this the Eighth Grade Lava Core?” Lin Yun curiously looked at the gem that was brimming with spiritual energy. Compared to the Fifth Grade Lava Core in his interspatial pouch, this one looked more spiritual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When things reached a certain level, they would give birth to a spiritual sense. With this Eighth Grade Lava Core, Lin Yun’s Fiery Demon Battle Physique could also reach the eighth grade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the Perfect Fiery Demon Battle Physique, Lin Yun could only dream about it. After all, a Perfect Lava Core was equivalent to a divine item.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Well, there’s no hurry to condense the Fiery Demon Battle Physique. It can wait till I’m out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for how he was going to get out of the crater, Lin Yun already had an idea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Flame Peak would erupt sooner or later. His departure would come with the next eruption. Otherwise, it would be too dangerous for him to leave now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the moment, a single cultivator in the sixth orifice of the Xiantian Realm was enough to deal with him. Lin Yun deposited the Eighth Grade Lava Core and took out the other Lava Cores. He wanted to cultivate while he was here. He was confident that the Fifth Grade Lava Core would help him reach the last stage of the Xiantian Pure Yang Art.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pushing his thoughts to the side, Lin Yun grabbed onto a Third Grade Lava Core and began cultivating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pure spiritual flame contained in the Lava Core gushed into his body and coursed through his veins. At the same time, his spiritual energy greedily absorbed the spiritual flame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to the spiritual essence, the pure spiritual flame was more nourishing to the Xiantian Pure Yang Art. Lin Yun felt a wave of satisfaction throughout his body. Every single cell in his body was enjoying this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This feels terrific! It’s no wonder so many fire elemental Xiantian Realm cultivators risk their life at the Heavenly Flame Peak.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">About a half month later, Lin Yun had refined the Fifth Grade Lava Core. His aura had grown abruptly, with strands of golden flames coursing through his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden flames continuously collided with each other and fused together. In the end, it had formed a golden cyclone inside his body that looked like a miniature sun. He had finally completed the Xiantian Pure Yang Art!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun opened his eyes with a glow flashing through his pupils. Sensing the terrifying power coursing through his body, Lin Yun was excited. At this moment, the spiritual energy coursing through his body even made him feel fearful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What immense power!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could feel the drastic difference in strength after he completed his cultivation technique. The density of his spiritual energy was a few times stronger than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was an urge rising in his heart. He wanted to slaughter his way out now and see how strong his spiritual energy had become. However, his rationale told him that it would be stupid. With a seventh orifice of the Xiantian Realm guarding the outside, he would have no odds of winning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At most, he would easily be able to face cultivators in the fifth orifice of the Xiantian Realm. He could contend with the fifth orifice cultivators due to the unique environment, while the other cultivators could barely exert 30% of their strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And unlike the others, the Fiery Demon Physique gave him an advantage of having no environmental restraints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Now it’s just a waiting game… there’s only one last thing left to do…” Lin Yun suppressed the excitement in his heart and calmly waited for the next eruption.</span></p>
