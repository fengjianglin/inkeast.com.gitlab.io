 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For the next few days, Lin Yun and Li Wuyou would carefully travel through the forest while cultivating during the day. They would let the Dragon Blooded Horse hunt for demonic beasts so they could enjoy a good meal and replenish their energy at night. Before they knew it, they had already spent half a month in the forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The candidates were more careful of the forest now that the battles had reached their peak. Everyone fought to snatch away jade pendants because the accumulation of their stars would be too slow if they only hunted the beasts. While this took place, in just half a month, Lin Yun had brought his cultivation to new heights with the help of two white pellets. Additionally, Li Wuyou had reached the seventh orifice of the Xiantian Realm with the help of another one of Lin Yun’s white pellets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, there was a Profound Martial Realm demonic beast, the Ghasthorn Bull, chasing after a youth deep in the forest. The Ghasthorn Bull was covered in injuries and was currently going insane, running with a loud rumble. The surrounding trees swayed under the minor quake that was created.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth, who was carrying a sword box on his back, showed no signs of panic from being chased by the Ghasthorn Bull. But all of a sudden, he came to a stop. He watched the Greathorn Bull, who was known for its brute strength, charge at him. Then, he turned around and threw a punch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Flying Dragon, Leaping Tiger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An imposing aura shot out from the youth as his fists manifested a dragon and tiger that bombarded the Ghasthorn Bull. The two loud impacts sent the Ghasthorn Bull flying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Die!” Another youth who had been lying in ambush had charged out with his sword, decapitating the demonic beast in the air. The pair was naturally Lin Yun and Li Wuyou. In the last two weeks, they learned to kill Profound Martial Realm demonic beasts together with the Dragon Blooded Horse’s support.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Clatter! Clatter! Clatter!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dragon Blooded Horse walked over, revealing its buck toothed grin and swallowed the Ghasthorn Bull’s beast core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Lin Yun, Li Wuyou commented with a wry smile, “Your physique is really powerful… I can’t imagine what heights you will attain when reaching the Profound Martial Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You don’t have to be envious of me. I’m sure you won’t be able to master the Thunderblitz Battle Physique, not to mention the perfect version of it.” Lin Yun smiled as he interrupted Li Wuyou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Wuyou chuckled. He naturally knew what sort of price he would have to pay to cultivate it. So he didn’t refute Lin Yun’s words and changed the subject, “This is the seventh one…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sure it will slowly get harder,” said Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were two things that they needed in order to complete the examination. The first was to have four stars in their jade pendants and the second was to walk out of the forest. But the deeper they went, the more dangerous the forest felt. They were barely halfway into the forest, but all the demonic beasts they were facing were in the Profound Martial Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they were unlucky and ran into a flock of Profound Martial Realm demonic beasts simultaneously, it would be troublesome for them. In addition to the demonic beasts, they also had to stay alert for other candidates. The Sword Firmament Pavilion was truly brilliant in this test. The forest journey acted as a filter, eliminating most of the weaker candidates. After dealing with the Ghasthorn Bull’s corpse, Lin Yun spoke out, “I think I heard something…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Me too. Let’s go and take a look.” Li Wuyou nodded as the two soared into the sky. It didn’t take long for them to discover what was causing the commotion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Wuyou was briefly stunned before he smiled, “Big brother, it’s an old friend…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They found Li Xiaotian’s group. Their luck could be considered terrible since they ran into a pack of Armored Fiendwolves. They were surrounded by over twenty Armored Fiendwolves, who were running in circles to envelop them. Occasionally, a few Armored Fiendwolves would break formation and pounce at Li Xiaotian’s group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Armored Fiendwolf was the weakest among the demonic beasts in the Profound Martial Realm. But they were fast and their claws were sharp. They could tear people into pieces. Li Xiaotian’s group was full of despair. They stood back to back as they struggled against the wolf pack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Though there were a few fresh corpses on the ground, the Armoured Fiendwolves didn’t go after them since they were well-controlled by an alpha. On a slope not far away stood the alpha, measuring nearly two meters tall. It looked at Li Xiaotian’s group coldly. Occasionally, it would issue orders to its pack through howls as the wolves were setting a deathtrap for Li Xiaotian’s group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These fellows are really unlucky.” Lin Yun said, rubbing his nose. The Armored Fiendwolves would study their prey for a long time, so their attacks would guarantee practically no chance for survival. They would even use tricks to direct human cultivators into their ambush.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So, are we going to save them?” Li Wuyou asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun thought about it briefly before he replied, “Let’s save them on behalf of Senior Sister Xin Yan. We’ll go after the alpha and run immediately if we can’t take it out in three moves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew that Xin Yan would definitely be sad if her seeded candidates died. But if they couldn’t take out the alpha in three moves, then they would have to face the full retaliation of the pack. They would be dead if they were surrounded. Although saving lives was important, their lives were more important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, we’ll go with that.” The two planned for a while before they made their moves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll go first.” Li Wuyou moved silently as he hid his aura, sneaking towards the alpha wolf. After Li Wuyou left, the Iris Flower in Lin Yun’s Dantian blossomed. The thirty-three petals blossomed and the spiritual energy boiled within his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Lin Yun made it sound easy, he didn’t dare to underestimate the alpha wolf. The alpha wolf was terrifying and it was comparable to a genius in the first pulse of the Profound Martial Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wfhooosssh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A wisp of crimson flame blazed in his pupils as he executed the Thunderblitz Battle Physique. The alpha wolf on the slope sensed Lin Yun’s gaze and turned its head over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun charged forward when the alpha wolf turned its head over, executing the Dragon-Tiger Might. In the next second, his aura rose to the seventh orifice and quickly approached the Profound Martial Realm. Using both tough and soft energy beneath his feet, Lin Yun seemed to travel through the air. He had crossed a distance of a few hundred meters in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In just a few breaths’ time, Lin Yun’s aura had enveloped the alpha wolf. The alpha wolf was howling to recall its pack. But when Lin Yun landed on the ground, he formed the Undying Vajra Seal with his hands and gathered boundless spiritual energy onto his hands. His hands were overflowing with power like an erupting volcano.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun unhesitantly threw the Undying Vajra Seal down. But the alpha wolf didn’t just sit there waiting. It retaliated, summoning a huge gale with its claws that smashed into the Undying Vajra Seal. The energy shockwave from the crash caused the alpha wolf to roar out furiously and stomp with its backfoot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Like a black lightning bolt, it pounced at Lin Yun with its claws brandished. The alpha wolf was strong and if Lin Yun were struck by it, he would die a terrible death. But Lin Yun fearlessly stared at the alpha wolf coming towards him. He charged forward after he landed on the ground and his fists unleashed a dragon roar. After his ninth step, he threw out a punch empowered by the Undying Vajra Seal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The strike from the alpha wolf forced Lin Yun back as he rolled on the ground. The spiritual energy within Lin Yun’s body rampaged, knocking his internal organs all over the place. Even his right arm felt numb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re pretty strong!” Lin Yun’s body trembled lightly, but he didn’t budge his feet. This displayed the strong advantage of the Thunderblitz Battle Physique. But just when the alpha wolf roared and wanted to charge at Lin Yun, it felt a warning from its senses. It turned around only to see a starry sky that contained three brightly lit galaxies that looked like eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe! Too late!” yelled Li Wuyou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Descending Moon and Stars</span><span style="color: rgba(77, 81, 86, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">—</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nine Nether Slash!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Wuyou roared, basked in starry radiance as his sword fell. Before the alpha could react, it received a sword on its neck. But the sword only managed to pierce half an inch into its skin. Blood flowed out from the alpha wolf’s neck as it roared out in pain and it brandished its claw at Li Wuyou’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A trace of blood flowed out from Li Wuyou’s lips. Right at this moment, the Dragon Blooded Horse charged out and gave a stomp on the alpha wolf’s head before the wolf could unleash another attack. Then, the Dragon Blooded Horse began to unleash a barrage of stomps on the alpha wolf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Phew! I nearly got myself killed!” Li Wuyou wiped the blood on his mouth and turned around. He was scared out of his wits and he exclaimed out, “Big brother, the wolves are coming over!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lin Yun turned around, he saw the wolf pack charging over in their direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You guys are courting death!” Lin Yun threw out two sword flashes from his fingertips, which struck two of the Armored Fiendwolves. They were knocked backwards and crashed into the other wolves. Lin Yun shook his arm and the sword box on his back opened, releasing a violent storm of petals. Lin Yun grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword, pulling it out from the scabbard and unleashed 81 sword flashes that overlapped each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His sword sounded like rumbling lightning as Lin Yun stabbed out three times. Although it only looked like three stabs, it was actually hundreds of stabs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wolf pack that was charging over was blasted away by Lin Yun’s sword, causing chaos to their formation. However, the wolf pack immediately got back on their feet, disregarding their injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The alpha wolf is already dead! Get lost!” Li Wuyou roared, not caring if the wolf pack understood his words. He grabbed onto the alpha’s wolf head and rode over on the Dragon Blooded Horse before he threw the decapitated head out. The head rolled on the ground and the wolf pack howled before running off with the decapitated head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Xiaotian and his group were dumbfounded by this scene. They had just witnessed two people chase off the wolf pack that caused them despair. Li Xiaotian was in deeper shock because he knew that he had ignored Lin Yun and Li Wuyou two weeks ago. He never expected that these two would come and save him today.</span></p>
