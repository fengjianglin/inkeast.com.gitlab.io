 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The journey back to the Sword Firmament Pavilion would take at least three days and at most seven days. No matter what, it would take them a few days to return to the sect. But one day after they left the capital, Luo Feng and Xin Jue instantly sensed something amiss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two didn’t say a word and quickened their pace back to the sect. But on the third day, Luo Feng and Xin Jue, who were leading the party, came to a stop. Tang Tong asked, “Elder Luo, what’s the matter?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Feng didn’t say a word and turned to look at Xin Jue. Xin Jue suddenly soared into the sky and disappeared. Lin Yun was shocked by Xin Jue’s sudden outburst. The tenth stage was truly formidable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Jue soared to a height where it was impossible for Lin Yun to reach, even with the Seventh Profound Steps. This was due to the difference in their cultivation. He could only do something like this if he had enough origin energy to support him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Xin Jue came back down, he returned with a bird in his hand. It was an ordinary bird and wasn’t even a demonic beast. However, when Xin Jue crushed the bird, the blood that everyone was expecting didn’t appear. The bird that looked so real was actually a puppet. After it was crushed, it revealed a second grade spiritual jade with lots of spiritual runes engraved on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun raised his brow. With just a glance, he could see that the spiritual runes were connected to each other to form an array.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is the Primal Origin Sect’s mechanism beast. This bird has been following us ever since we left the city. It appears that they have been targeting us ever since we left the Princess Manor,” sighed Xin Jue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Feng’s face was dark and contained a trace of murderous aura. He spoke out coldly, “Do they really think that we’re afraid of them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Feng then took out a token from his interspatial pouch and crushed it. Everyone’s faces changed as they wore a grave expression. They didn’t expect that the Primal Origin Sect would try to intercept them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the sky before them turned dark and countless black birds flew over. The birds shot down without any warning, just like the rain would.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Avoid it! That’s the Primal Origin Sect’s Blackblaze Crow!” barked Luo Feng. The party soared into the sky and retreated. Even their horses ran away in a panic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Blackflame Crows exploded when they hit the ground and soon the ground was covered in large craters. It was like the end of the world as the ground trembled from the ear-deafening explosions. If any of them were hit by the crows, aside from Luo Feng and Xin Jue, they would probably die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They couldn’t imagine how serious their situation would have been if they didn’t notice the spying puppet. Even just the fluctuation from the explosions was making Tang Tong and the rest uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun narrowed his eyes into slits as he peered through the cloud of dust. He was relieved after he saw the Dragon Blooded Horse safely leaving. At the same time, a cold killing intent flashed in the depths of his eyes. The Primal Origin Sect was ruthless. They would be dead if they weren’t careful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A sharp-piercing voice rang out and four figures descended from the sky. All of them emitted an unfathomable aura. There weren’t many of them, but they were all in the Violet Palace Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Feng’s heart sank when he saw the four of them. Could it be that the Primal Origin Sect had planned this assassination before the banquet started? After all, gathering four Profound Martial Realms in two days was too fast. His face sank, “The Primal Origin Sect never changes. You guys are still using this method even after a few hundred years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Primal Origin Sect? We’re not from the Primal Origin Sect. You just need to know that we’re here to kill you guys!” The black-clothed man spoke out with an eerie voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun’s heart trembled because the voice sounded like Wen Yanbo! This old geezer was clearly faking it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wen Yanbo swept his gaze around, it landed on Lin Yun. A murderous aura surged in his heart when he spotted Lin Yun. He spoke up, “I’ll hold this old geezer back. The three of you go and kill Lin Yun!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wen Yanbo drew a long saber and used it to slash at Luo Feng. His saber was emitting a cold aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Firmament Finger!” Luo Feng tapped his finger out and destroyed Wen Yanbo’s attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It has been a few years since we last fought. It looks like you got stronger,” smiled Wen Yanbo. Unfortunately, his attacks weren’t slowing down at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the two of them fought, the other three experts in the Violet Palace Realm pounced towards Lin Yun. Accompanied by a roaring lightning, Xin Jue drew his sword and said, “I’ll stop one of them. You guys try your best to drag the other two down. Don’t face them head-on and remember to protect our junior brother well. Our reinforcements will arrive soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Got it!” Tang Tong and the others might have been shocked, but they were also elites. They were able to quickly collect themselves and react by drawing their swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Protect our junior brother!” Xin Yan and the remaining disciples drew their weapons and surrounded Lin Yun to protect him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How naive!” The two black-clothed men sneered and launched their attacks. Their origin energy rippled and unleashed great pressure on the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s party.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Get lost!” One of them threw out his palm and unleashed a gigantic purple palm made of origin energy. The palm was like a small-scale mountain, causing the sky to turn dark and covering Xin Yan and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the palm exploded, everyone from the Sword Firmament Pavilion was blown away and blood dripped from the corner of their lips. Their internal organs ruptured when they landed on the ground. Lin Yun was kneeling on one knee as he clutched his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no way they could face the two Violet Palace Realms. After all, the two assassins were one realm above them, which meant that their attacks were futile when facing the two assassins’ origin energy.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So that’s what happens after forming the violet palace?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a bunch of idiots. You guys have no idea how terrifying the Violet Palace Realm is.” The two black-clothed men sneered. Instead of waiting, they pounced at Lin Yun immediately. They wanted to get rid of Lin Yun as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph. Do you think that I’ve never met a Violet Palace Realm before? You have to get past me if you want to kill my junior brother!” A cold aura surged from Xin Yan. In a split second, she stabbed her sword out three times with her blazing sword of crimson flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hold them back!” Xin Yan’s aura left Tang Tong and the others stunned before they also charged over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of the black-clothed men suddenly felt a chill run down his spine. When he raised his head, he saw Xin Yan and three other disciples fearlessly charging after him. He frowned his brows, “The Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples have guts. I really have to hand it to them. I’ll deal with these clowns, you go handle that brat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sure.” The two black-clothed men divided their duties as one of them pounced at Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lin Yun saw that Xin Yan and the other disciples were trying to hold back a black-clothed man without any concern for their lives, Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling worried for them. But very quickly his mind focused, he didn’t even have the luxury of time to worry about them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun executed the Seven Profound Steps and left behind nine afterimages. But the nine afterimages were all crushed when a palm flew towards him, sending Lin Yun flying a hundred meters away. Their origin energy wasn’t on the same level, so if it weren’t for the Dracophant Battle Physique, he would have been heavily injured by the attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No wonder the sect wants this brat dead. He actually managed to survive my attack.” The black-clothed man was surprised that Lin Yun managed to survive his attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Demoncloud Palm!” The black-clothed man soared into the sky and threw his palm down. His black origin energy gathered into a huge palm and descended like a huge mountain. This time, his attack was fully focused on Lin Yun since no one was distracting him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun faced the attack calmly. He summoned the Flower Burial Sword and executed the Overlord Sword without any hesitation. A domineering aura boiled in his body and gathered onto his sword before he slashed it at the black palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black palm was penetrated by the sword, but all the sword did was slow the palm down. Lin Yun spread his arms apart as the Golden Crow Seal condensed on his back and he flew into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ground cracked when the palm landed on the ground, shooting stone shrapnels into the surrounding like a violent storm. As Lin Yun flew away, he swung his sword and unleashed the Aquaselenic Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he landed on the ground, he was barely able to dodge the incoming attack. The black-clothed man’s eyes blazed with rage at this and he grabbed at Lin Yun. “Die!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had lost his patience and wanted to suppress Lin Yun with his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun sheathed his sword and gently patted his interspatial pouch. He retrieved the Scarletflame War Flag. When he took it out, he immediately changed it into its battle form. The flag that was covered in crimson runes suddenly turned into sickles with two hook blades.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the Scarletflame War Flag in his hand, Lin Yun was like a bloodthirsty beast. His aura changed in an instant. The blades on the Scarletflame War Flag looked like crescent moons. The bloodthirsty aura within the blade got excited when it sensed the killing intent in Lin Yun’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scene before Lin Yun’s eyes suddenly changed. It felt as if he was walking on a path covered with blood. This meant that the Scaretflame War Flag had taken tons of lives in the past. A cold light flashed in Lin Yun’s eyes as he stabbed the flag at the black-clothed man, “I’ve been waiting for you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wasn’t fond of killing, but he wouldn’t mind if someone tried to kill him. Since that was the case, he wouldn’t mind having his path to the summit being built on bones and blood!</span></p>
