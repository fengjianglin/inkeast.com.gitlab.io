 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a brutal scene and the cries lasted for a long time. The Demonflame Sect already suffered a huge loss in their battle with the Sword firmament Pavilion, so they couldn’t put up any resistance against the Divine Guards. As for their Grand Elder, he died with just one attack from Liu Feilong, which threw the entire Demonflame Sect into despair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Divine Guards had surrounded them, so there was no way they could escape. The cries echoed throughout the blizzard, but no one took pity on them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Demonflame Sect was no different from bandits and their disciples were all demonic cultivators. Their actions in the Demonlotus Realm had aroused everyone’s rage. So everyone was more than happy to watch this show.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was true that the Divine Guards never interfered in the affairs between sects. Even if they did, they would do it secretly. It was rare for them to butcher an entire sect so publicly. When the army retreated, they left behind a pile of corpses. The Bloodbone Gate and Sevendespair Sect were terrified by this scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Divine Guards left after they were done butchering the Demonflame Sect, which made the two sects feel relieved. It looks like the Divine Guards weren't coming for them. But their faces were ugly when they looked at the Sword Firmament Pavilion. They no longer had any intention of attacking with the lesson right in front of them. They had no courage to test the Divine Guards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“General Liu, thank you for getting us out of this mess,” said the Sword-Bearing Elder with his hands cupped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank me? Thank your disciple, Lin Yun, instead. If it wasn’t for him, Yue’er would have fallen into these people’s hands. They must be courting death to provoke my daughter. Since that was the case, all I did was fulfill their wish.” No one could see Liu Feilong’s expression behind the mask, but his words left everyone shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When all the other sects heard those words, it instantly caused an uproar in the Extermination Barrens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Demonflame Sect was really courting death…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve heard that the Demonflame Sect’s disciples were bold. But I never imagined that they would even dare to provoke General Liu’s beloved daughter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No wonder the Flying Dragon General infertered in this matter. If he didn’t, who knows what would have happened in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Demonflame Sect deserves it. But this also means that the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s crisis is resolved.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Demonflame Sect was truly courting death to provoke Liu Yue. It was good enough if she didn’t come after you, but weren’t you courting death to go after her too?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sword-Bearing Elder fell into deep thought after the Divine Guards left. Standing beside him, Luo Feng smiled bitterly, “This Liu Yue… We expelled her two months ago, but I never imagined that she would be the one to save us today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’re indeed lucky. But Liu Feilong’s strength has become even more unfathomable,” sighed the Sword-Bearing Elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even you can’t see through his strength?” Luo Feng was shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can’t. He’s at least on the same level as Guardian Plum,” said the Sword-Bearing Elder helplessly as he shook his head. At the very least, he couldn’t see how Liu Feilong killed the Demonflame Sect’s Grand Elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s return!” Wen Yanbo knew that there was no way they could do anything to the Sword Firmament Pavilion today and decided to leave. With that, the battle between the five sects had finally come to an end. But the strength Lin Yun displayed today left a deep impression on everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That brat is actually still alive… He’s pretty lucky,” sighed the Heavenly Profound Sect’s elder. “Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Wuhen turned around to look at Lin Yun and Xin Jue. He was also feeling a little helpless in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just who in the Great Qin Empire could stop the rise of those two after today?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Jue’s strength was terrifying and he could actually force an elder in the Violet Palace Realm back. This meant that he wasn’t far from the eight titles’ level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Jue had the potential to get into the top three in the Dragon Gate Competition at the end of this year. Even if Lin Yun didn’t participate in this Dragon Gate Competition, it wouldn’t be a problem for him to become the champion in the next competition. There was no way anyone could stop the rise of the Sword Firmament Pavilion now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone gradually started to leave, but before they left, they all looked at the Sword Firmament Pavilion with a complicated gaze. If only they had helped the Sword Firmament Pavilion earlier, they probably would have benefited from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But there was no ‘if.’ What was done was done. There was nothing they could do to change it. When the Divine Guards passed by Lin Yun and Xin Jue, Liu Yue saw the horrifying gash on Lin Yun’s chest. She hesitated briefly, but still decided to check on him. But she was stopped by Liu Feilong when she wanted to get down. In the end, she could only ask from horseback, “Lin Yun, are you alright?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I won’t die anytime soon.” Lin Yun nodded at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go,” instructed Liu Feilong. His gaze never stopped on Lin Yun, but he took a few more glances at Xin Jue. On the other hand, Liu Yue bit on her lips and left with an apologetic gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It looks like she’s interested in you. But aren’t you a little too indifferent?” smiled Xin Jue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun didn’t make a comment. He was only helping Liu Yue casually and had followed his heart. He believed that Xin Jue would also help if he was in that position. However, that didn’t mean that he had any favorable opinions of Liu Yue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no way he could change his attitude instantly, but he was indeed thankful that Liu Yue helped them. This caused Liu Yue’s image to start changing in Lin Yun’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, right. You can have your sword back.” Xin Jue sheathed the sword and handed it back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun stopped Xin Jue and said, “Senior Brother, please don’t do that. You saved me twice now, including once back in the Bloodbone Forest. I have no use for this sword and I initially intended on giving it to Senior Sister Xin Yan. But it looks more suitable in your hands.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Furthermore, you have already refused me once, so I won’t take no for an answer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Jue fell silent. He knew that Lin Yun was talking about the Bloodflame Fruit. He smiled, “Then I won’t be polite with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most of the sects had left within half an hour, but the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s party still remained. Half of their elders were heavily injured, which meant that they couldn’t fight again for at least half a month. Of the forty deacons, they lost eighteen of them. Lastly, they also lost eight Earth Ranking disciples. Of the Earth Ranking disciples, thirty-six were heavily injured and fifty were left with light injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Almost everyone from the Sword Firmament Pavilion had suffered a certain degree of injuries. If they didn’t have the Sword-Bearing Elder around, the Sword Firmament Pavilion probably would have suffered even more casualties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back in the camp, Lin Yun withdrew all of his harvest from the Demonflame Sect. Next to him, Xin Yan and the rest had already handed some of their harvest to the sect. Naturally, the sect would also compensate them with contribution points.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sect and disciples relied on each other to survive. Lin Yun took out a few hundred Demonlotus Cores, dozens of incomplete ancient martial techniques, a dozen bottles of spiritual pellets, five fruits, Jing Jue’s ancient cosmic artifact, a Dao Insight Diagram, a famous wine, an incense cauldron, a mat, the Hiddensword Gourd, and all sorts of other treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lin Yun took out hundreds of Demonlotus Cores, besides the Sword-Bearing Elder, everyone’s faces changed. But Luo Feng and the elder didn’t know that this was just the beginning. When Lin Yun took out the ancient cosmic artifact, incense cauldron, and the Dao Insight Diagram, the Sword-Bearing Elder’s face finally changed. He sighed, “No wonder the four sects joined hands. I would have done the same thing if I was in their position.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These treasures were truly too tempting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aside from the sword I gave to senior brother and the pellets I refined myself, all my harvest from the Demonlotus Realm is here,” said Lin Yun while he cupped his hands. There were some things he had no intention of handing over previously, but he changed his mind when Luo Feng was counting the casualties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no need for you to take it all out,” smiled the Sword-Bearing Elder bitterly. “According to the sect’s rules and regulations, you will be compensated with contribution points and spiritual jades. With all these treasures, I don’t even think the sect has enough spiritual jades to compensate you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then there’s no need for any compensation. I wouldn’t be able to leave here alive if it wasn’t for the sect.” Lin Yun knew that he would be dead if the sect didn’t protect him. Although his words made sense, it placed the Sword-Bearing Elder in a difficult position. The Sword Firmament Pavilion naturally wouldn’t take advantage of their disciples, but he didn’t know what to do since Lin Yun was so intent on giving them to the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, Luo Feng smiled, “Elder, what do you think of this? Let Lin Yun pick a few treasures and we’ll distribute the rest to everyone who’s injured in the battle. As for the sect, we’ll only take some Demonlotus Cores and incomplete martial techniques. I believe we can convert them into spiritual jades for Lin Yun.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Right. We’ll do it this way. Lin Yun, what do you think of sharing them with your fellow disciples?” The Sword-Bearing Elder smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun smiled helplessly because he knew he couldn’t reject this arrangement. He stepped forward and took the bottle of Coldcloud Pellets. Pellets wouldn’t have much effect on him since his cultivation would be stuck for a long time, but the Coldcloud Pellets matched the Iris Sword Sutra’s attributes well. Essentially, it was useful. Then, he took the Hiddensword Gourd and the jar of wine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sword-Bearing Elder frowned his eyebrows because Lin Yun had taken too little. He waved his hand and sent the ancient cosmic artifact to Lin Yun and said, “The sect doesn’t have anyone who uses sabers, so you can keep this. Right, what did you experience in the tenth level?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tenth level was a legend and this made everyone turn their attention to Lin Yun. However, Lin Yun pondered because he had no idea where to start.</span></p>
