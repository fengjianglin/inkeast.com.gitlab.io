 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone felt that Feng Jue’s declaration that every single pellet in the bottle had a 90% medical effect was unbelievable. But when Feng Jue revealed his cultivation in the seventh stage of the Profound Martial Realm, they had no choice but to believe it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, Feng Jue was only in the sixth stage of the Profound Martial Realm three days ago. But today, he appeared in front of everyone with his cultivation in the seventh stage of the Profound Martial Realm. It was difficult to condense more profound veins the higher your cultivation was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Feng Jue was in the sixth stage of the Profound Martial Realm for a long time, it was still astounding that he made a breakthrough in just three days. The only explanation would be that the Greater Profound Pellets had 90% medicinal effects!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, everyone recalled how oddly Feng Jue behaved when he took the Greater Profound Pellet on the first day. But at that time, everyone thought that Feng Jue was in a foul mood because he paid such a huge price for a Greater Profound Pellet. They even laughed at him for his stupidity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But now that they thought about it, they were the stupid ones. They allowed Feng Jue to take full advantage of the pellets for the past few days! After all, even Fu Guang, who was known to inscribe the best Aquacloud Spiritual Rune in the capital, could only produce Greater Profound Pellets with 70% medicinal effects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, the pellets produced by him were sold out the instant they went on the market. And after several rounds of circulation, these pellets would only get more expensive. So it was difficult to buy them even if you had the spiritual jades, unless you come from the prestigious or imperial clans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But today, Greater Profound Pellets with 90% medicinal effects appeared before them, which left everyone astounded. The silence lasted briefly in the hall before an uproar broke out as everyone rushed towards Hall Master Wei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hall Master Wei, sell them to me! I’ll pay 4... no, 5,000 spiritual jades for them!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You want them for just 5,000 spiritual jades? Get lost, I’ll offer 7,000 for them all!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t get in the way! Why are you calling out prices blindly? Do you even have the spiritual jades to pay for them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Get lost! Hall Master Wei, leave those Greater Profound Pellets for me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A group of customers started squeezing into the hall holding onto their interspatial pouches. The hall was suddenly thrown into chaos and Hall Master Wei was taken aback by this scene. But shortly after, a bright smile appeared on his face, “Everyone, calm down for now. This bottle of Greater Profound Pellets will not be sold for now. The Myriad Treasure Pavilion will be closed for today, so you guys can come back tomorrow!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hall Master, this way!” An outburst of murderous aura surged out, which opened a path for Hall Master Wei to get out of the crowd. Hall Master Wei was relieved when he made it out of the hall. His face was filled with ecstasy when he saw the jade bottle in his hand. He immediately headed towards Ku Yun’s residence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hall Master…” Qing Mei came over and looked at Hall Master Wei pitifully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hall Master Wei’s face sank when he saw Qing Mei. “Come with me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They swiftly headed towards the alchemy chamber. On the way, Hall Master Wei’s was dark as he said coldly, “Are you a fool? Do you know how much Feng Jue benefited? If it weren’t for me, wouldn’t you have sold this to him today?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“H-H-Hall Master… no one came to buy this bottle when we put it out. Many customers even scolded us for pricing it so highly. Only Feng Jue came to buy them.” Qing Mei lowered her head. She was on the verge of crying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s fine to let him take the advantage on the first day, but why didn’t you tell me when he came back the second and third day?!” Thinking about how Feng Jue bought those 90 pellets for 9,000 spiritual jades, Hall Master Wei immediately felt heartache.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing beside him, Qing Mei did not dare to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll settle this matter with you later. Come with me right now to see Master Ku Yun!” Hall Master Wei did not have the time to reprimand her right now. He just wanted to visit Master Ku Yun immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun, Li Wuyou, and Ku Yun were in a good mood in the alchemy chamber. The pellets they refined for the past few days had all been sold, which made the three of them very excited. After the Myriad Treasure Pavilion took 70% of the profits, they received 2,700 spiritual jades.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only three days and Lin Yun estimated that they could accumulate 10,000 spiritual jades in another ten days. At that time, he would be able to make a breakthrough in the Iris Sword Sutra to reach the seventh stage. Not to mention that it might even be possible for him to condense another profound vein.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a nutshell, cultivating required resources and talent. There was no way Lin Yun could defeat Ye Liuyun if Lin Yun couldn’t make a breakthrough in his cultivation technique and cultivation. Ye Liuyun’s cultivation in the third stage of the Profound Martial Realm alone could suppress him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master!” Hall Master Wei suddenly barged in. He was in a great mood right now. Walking over to Ku Yun, he smiled, “Master, you’ve really kept me in the dark. I’m Wei Yue, the person responsible for the third hall. Please forgive me for not recognizing you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qing Mei pays her greetings to Master.” Qing Mei bowed with a smile when she saw Ku Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun and Li Wuyou both exchanged a glance. They had no idea what was going on. Even Ku Yun was confused. He had no idea why Hall Master Wei changed his attitude all of a sudden. Turning his head to look at Lin Yun, Ku Yun turned back and probed, “Hall Master, what’s the reason for your visit?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please don’t address me by Hall Master. It just puts distance between us.” Wei Yue smiled. “You can call me Little Wei. This bottle of Greater Profound Pellets were refined by you, right? Wait, sorry about that. If they’re not refined by you, who can they possibly be refined by.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Yue looked a little nervous from his excitement. With a serious face, he continued, “Actually, we would like to advertise your pellets to let everyone in the capital know that you’re in the Myriad Treasure Pavilion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ku Yun instantly knew what Wei Yue wanted to do. The latter wanted to use him as a signboard, just like how the Glittering Pavilion invited Fu Guang. But for a brief moment, he had no idea how to reply. The pellets were refined by him, but the most crucial part, the spiritual rune was inscribed by Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Ku Yun’s face, Wei Yue immediately smiled, “I understand. Please be assured. The Myriad Treasure Pavilion won’t force you since you don’t wish to reveal your identity. Do let us know if you have any requests. From today onwards, Qing Mei will be responsible for serving the three of you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, there were some alchemists who did not like to become famous. Wei Yue was tactful and he instantly detected it when he saw Ku Yun’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then, I’ll be taking my leave. Qing Mei will be staying behind. Just give her any orders that you guys have.” Wei Yue bid farewell, after all, he still had to discuss with the Pavilion Master how they were going to market the Greater Profound Pellets with 90% medicinal effects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Someone had offered a high price back in the hall earlier, but he didn’t dare to agree to it so easily. After all, there were many influential figures that he didn’t dare to offend. The Pavilion Master would have to make the decision on how they were going to sell the pellets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master, I have accidentally sold a few bottles of the Greater Profound Pellets with 90% medicinal effects previously. Please forgive me.” Qing Mei immediately went up to Ku Yun to apologize after Wei Yue left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Wuyou rubbed his nose casually because he didn’t know what 90% medicinal effect meant, but Ku Yun was greatly shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s just a small matter. Master won’t get angry over something so small. Qing Mei, you can leave first. Master still has something to do.” Lin Yun stepped forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh of relief, Qing Mei smiled, “Then I’ll take my leave for now. However, I will be close by so don’t hesitate to call for me if you need anything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This woman is a seductress, but she’s naturally far behind Senior Sister Xin Yan,” Li Wuyou chuckled after Qing Mei left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh my god! 90% medicinal effect!” Ku Yun, on the other hand, was frozen to his chair. He turned his head and saw that Lin Yun was still calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master, is there a need for you to be so dramatic? After all, it’s just 90% medicinal effects,” smiled Li Quyou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Straightening his face, Ku Yun snorted, “What do you know? If what Qing Mei said is true, then the pellets will shock the entire capital in the next few days!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master, you don’t have to worry about it. The pellets were refined by you and I only helped out a little. If anyone asks you about it, just tell them that you refined it yourself,” Lin Yun smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That doesn’t seem appropriate, right? After all, it’s something that will shock the capital…” Ku Yun shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry about it. I don’t want to attract too much trouble for the time being. You must have learned something after observing me inscribe the spiritual runes over the past few days, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah. But there’s a unique grace that you have when you inscribe spiritual runes. I can’t achieve it. I’m also curious how you achieved 90% medicinal effects with the same Aquacloud Spiritual Runes.” Ku Yun was filled with doubts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was observing Lin Yun inscribe the spiritual runes and there was truly something unique about Lin Yun’s grace when he inscribed them. But he couldn’t see anything special from that. The brush was provided by him and the ink was also made of ordinary demonic beast’s blood. So how did Lin Yun manage to achieve a 90% medicinal effect?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun smiled and gave no explanation. He cultivated the Age Sutra, which was equivalent to the inheritance of ancient spiritualists. The spiritual runes inscribed by him contained age energy, so it would be embarrassing if he couldn’t compete with Fu Guang. Lin Yun did not know how to describe the logic behind it to Ku Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ku Yun didn’t ask more about it because everyone had their secrets. He was satisfied that his Aquacloud Spiritual Rune was improving by following Lin Yun. At the same time, the Myriad Treasure Pavilion had placed a signboard out that they would be closed for one day. But even so, the Myriad Treasure Pavilion was filled with people outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Damn it. I actually missed my chance to get the 90% medicinal effects back then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The same goes for me. Who could’ve guessed that those pellets would have 90% medicinal effects.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sigh, I actually missed my chance in buying them when they were at the counter…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I wonder how many people will come tomorrow when the Myriad Treasure Pavilion opens…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people sighed. Their gazes become complicated when they look at Feng Jue. Someone smiled bitterly, “Captain Feng, you’ve stumbled upon a huge benefit this time…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Captain, do you have any for sale?” Another person looked at Feng Jue with a fawning smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t bother thinking about it. I have my use for pellets. Even if I have extra ones, I will naturally give them to the brothers in the mercenary group. How could I possibly sell them?” Feng Jue was feeling pretty happy that he managed to benefit for the past three days. He spoke out solemnly, “I estimate that the Greater Profound Pellets will be sold in the form of an auction tomorrow for at least 300 spiritual jades.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone sucked in cold air. The tripling of the price in addition to not being able to buy from the counter was tough to imagine. But then again, there was indeed such a possibility when they thought about it. The Greater Profound Pellets with 90% medicinal effects could only be found here and all the elites in the capital would probably be attracted to them.</span></p>
