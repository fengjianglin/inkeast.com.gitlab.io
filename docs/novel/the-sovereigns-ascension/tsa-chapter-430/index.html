Everything ended the moment he drew his sword, which left many spectators shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Yun only used one sword to kill Luo Yuhang, who was ranked fifth on the Newly Risen Ranking?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Luo Yuhang’s words still lingered in the crowd’s ears, but he had died in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the eighth stage, the judge looked at Lin Yun in shock, “Lin Yun, you’ve already reached the manifestation stage in your Seven Profound Steps?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I guess,” replied Lin Yun. He didn’t give a direct answer, but it shocked the judge. The judge couldn’t believe that Lin Yun had really cultivated the Seven Profound Steps to the Manifestation Stage. In ancient times, people chased after the sun to find traces of the divine beast, the Golden Crow. Through that type of obsession and observation, the Divine Sunchasing Art was derived. The complete copy was long lost, so only incomplete copies were left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The incomplete copies gave birth to many movement techniques and the Seven Profound Steps was one of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The movement technique might only be a profound grade, but it was comparable to ordinary spiritual grade movement techniques because it had a high requirement on comprehension. It was hard for people to even reach lesser mastery, not to mention grater mastery. In the history of the Sword Firmament Pavilion, the number of those who reached complete mastery could be counted on one hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were none who reached the Manifestation Stage, so Lin Yun had created another legend without him knowing. Furthermore, no one in the Great Qin Empire had brought a profound grade movement technique to complete mastery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the shock Lin Yun brought to everyone wasn’t only because of the manifestation stage. Who would dare to say that Lin Yun was here to be killed now? Three years was too long of a wait and he expressed that to everyone with the sword in his hand. He proved that he could also shine brightly in this Dragon Gate Competition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Yu’s face flashed with killing intent and the faces of the Primal Origin Sect’s elders also turned unsightly. They hated Lin Yun deep in their bones. Wen Yanbo spoke out, “He’s just lucky. I don’t believe that he can turn the tables around since he revealed all his trump cards!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other titled figures also wore a complicated expression when they saw this scene. No one had expected that Lin Yun would turn the tables around with his movement technique. As for the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s party, they were naturally happy to see this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Junior Brother!” Twilight hugged Luo Yuhang’s corpse with a dark face. He knew that Luo Yuhang couldn’t be saved because Lin Yun had also cut his heart into two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lin Yun, it’s fine if you beat him, but why did you have to kill him?!” Twilight looked at Lin Yun with coldness flickering in his eyes. His gaze was like swords stabbing into Lin Yun and the aura he gave off was terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Normal people would be frightened to death by this gaze, but Lin Yun did not have any change in his expression as he replied, “Death is nothing to be surprised by in the Dragon Gate Competition. Are you saying that your junior brother is special? Even if you’re one of the eight titles, aren’t you being a little too demanding?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One must be prepared to kill or be killed, so no one would go easy just because Luo Yuhang was Twilight’s junior brother. Why would Lin Yun be bothered about a titled figure when he was fighting to be the champion?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m looking forward to encountering you on the stage.” Lin Yun’s words actually made Twilight’s eyes flare with flames and rage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re welcome to challenge me anytime,” replied Lin Yun as he left. His words shocked everyone. No one had expected to see such an exciting show after the battle. Lin Yun faced a titled figure’s threat head-on without taking a step back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was just a short episode as the competition resumed. All the participants were divided into eight groups and four participants would emerge from the eight groups at the end of the day. Only the thirty-two who made it into the second stage were qualified to compete for the titles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Yun observed that the groups were divided equally in terms of strength aside from the seven titled figures. Out of the seven other groups, there were three rather strong participants and they came from the Heavenly Profound Sect, the Divine Guards, and the Heavenly Qin Institute. All of their cultivation was in the pinnacle tenth stage of the Profound Martial Realm and there was a possibility that they also had trump cards up their sleeves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They weren’t any weaker than Luo Yuhang. Then again, that didn’t exclude the possibility that there were other darkhorses among the eight groups.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eighth group, Lin Yun VS Luo Yin!” Lin Yun descended on the stage with his Seven Profound Steps when he heard his name being called. Luo Yin was only in the ninth stage and he wasn’t particularly eye-catching in the eighth stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Yin’s eyes flashed with decisiveness when he saw Lin Yun on the stage. His opponent was a legend, who went from crippling his profound vein to killing Luo Yuhang. However, he wouldn’t give up so easily no matter what.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Excuse me.” Luo Yin moved the moment the judge called start. He gathered his origin energy into his palm and hacked down. This attack was accompanied by a terrifying momentum that could even split a mountain into two. The moment he attacked, his aura actually reached the tenth stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Anyone could tell that Luo Yin had reached high attainment in this attack and that he could easily split his opponent into two if he ran into someone else. But it was a pity that he ran into Lin Yun. Luo Yin had high attainment in this attack? So what? Lin Yun could just suppress Luo Yin with a punch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a dragon and tiger roar echoed in the air, Lin Yun leaped into the sky. He first formed an ancient seal with his hands before pushing the seal forward. It was naturally the Undying Vajra Seal. In just one encounter, Luo Yin was sent out of the stage throwing up blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The judge was briefly stunned before he announced, “Lin Yun wins!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s the Dragon-Tiger Fist!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s not even using his sword?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This Lin Yun is unfathomable. He’s not even using his sword!” The spectators were disappointed by how quickly Lin Yun ended the fight. The fight was so swift that Lin Yun hadn’t been given much time to rest. Before he knew it, he was on the stage facing his third opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His third opponent was also a nobody with a cultivation in the ninth stage. If it was in the past, Lin Yun would have to take some time to defeat an opponent in the ninth stage, but this was nothing to him after he restored his profound vein. At the same cultivation, he could suppress anyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lin Yun wins!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lin Yun wins!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><br></p>
 <hr>
 <p><br></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lin Yun wins!” Lin Yun continued this series of wins and before he knew it, he had already accumulated eight consecutive wins. Only those at the level of the titled figures could achieve this.</span></p>

The Dragon-Tiger Fist that swept waves through the Great Qin Empire was actually being used by a Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciple. This made the Heavenly Profound Sect’s elders and disciples’ faces look ugly.</span></p>

The Heavenly Profound Sect was a Buddhist sect. They had ordinary disciples, Buddhist disciples, and half-Buddhist disciples. The Heavenly Profound Sect did not force their disciples to become monks. This was something widely known in the Great Qin Empire.</span></p>

Even both Drifting Goblet and Trueorigin were both monks. There was another saying that the true inheritance of the Heavenly Profound Sect could only be bestowed to monks and Tong Yuan was a monk of the Heavenly Profound Sect.</span></p>

His Dragon-Tiger Fist was domineering, which was the true profundity of this fist technique. He had been cultivating bitterly in the Heavenly Profound Sect, so not many people knew about him. He was somewhat similar to the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s Ye Feng.</span></p>

He couldn’t accept that the Heavenly Profound Sect’s ultimate technique was being used by an outsider. In fact, Lin Yun’s victories so far were slaps to his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Yun landed on the stage and his eyes blazed with flames as he looked at his opponent. The aura of a dragon and tiger also started to emit from his body.</span></p>

To use the Dragon-Tiger Fist to fight Tong Yuan.”</span></p>
