A brief moment later, the plump old man smiled, “This brat just can’t settle down. It looks like you won’t have a chance to give out the Fish-Dragon Pearl…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Leave it all to fate. He should know the consequences since he made his choice,” said Lord Thirteen. With their cultivation, they had already sensed to violent energy fluctuation in the Sword Burial Diagram. The fluctuation was ten times stronger than normal, and even the two old men wouldn’t dare to underestimate it despite their cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without a doubt, Lin Yun was at the crucial moment of making a breakthrough, and the platform he was on was enveloped with all sorts of phenomena caused by sword intent. If someone looked at the platform from afar, the platform would look like a dazzling sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was all because Lin Yun was about to finish refining the beast core he swallowed down, but the core at the size of his nail was emitting a dazzling light. In the end, Lin Yun had underestimated the power contained in this beast core. This beast core belonged to a Violet Palace Realm demonic beast that Lord Thirteen kept for ten years. So this meant that the origin energy was extremely refined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When thunderclouds continued to tumble in the sky, sword intent was brewing up within the clouds that emitted a terrifying aura. The entire world was quiet aside from the tumbling violent energy. When the pressure spread out in this tiny world, Lin Yun’s face became grave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had a feeling that if he couldn’t make a breakthrough in his cultivation technique, what awaits him next would be reduced into ashes. With the radiance enveloping Lin Yun, his expression became grave as he frantically tried to refine the beast core. He knew that his only chance lies in refining the beast core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, the Iris Flower began to emit a violent sword intent from its petals and devoured the beast core. It felt as though the Iris Flower had a consciousness of its own, and it had also sensed the incoming danger. Within the flower, the beast core was swiftly being refined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the sword intent in the sky started to tumble around violently, the suffocating pressure got even heavier. Meanwhile, Lin Yun was anxiously waiting for the beast core to be refined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the last bit of the beast core was completely devoured by the Iris Flower, Lin Yun could sense his merigians lightning up as they gathered towards the Iris Flower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When all the radiance was gathered in the Iris Flower, Lin Yun saw the Iris Flower breaking apart before coming back together again. It didn’t take long for an entirely new Iris Flower to be formed. The new Iris Flower was like a violet crystal, and it looks more detailed than before. Aside from that, there was also a tiny crimson rune at the center of the flower that made the flower look alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Yun’s mind instantly blew because he couldn’t describe the sensation after he saw the flower. If he had to find a word to describe it, he could only say that it was bewitching. It was bewitching and noble, like the king of all flowers overlooking its kind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the petals bloomed entirely, an ancient voice shuttled through the ages of time and resonated in his mind. It was a purple-clothed old man who appeared in his mind. When the old man appeared, he swiped the body of his sword with his fingers, and he stabbed forth, “In the name of my sword, bloom!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A mysterious sword seal bloomed from the old man, and he emitted a terrifying sword intent from his body along with a gigantic Iris Flower manifesting behind him. The Iris Flower then slanted forth and bloomed in the direction of the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next second, a terrifying vortex was created. It felt as if everything in this world was being sucked into the flower, and the demonic being that was charging at the old man disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Yun was shocked by this scene, and he was filled with emotions in his heart. He figured that this purple-clothed old man was Iris Sword Saint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the old man’s image was constantly replaced within his mind, he suddenly gained a comprehension. What the old man used was the Dazzling Moment that he already grasped. But the Dazzling Moment would drain all his origin energy the moment he used it, and he could only use it as his ultimate move. This meant that the move was a gamble, either his opponent dies or he dies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Yun constantly pondered about the mysterious sword seal that the Iris Sword Saint used. Suddenly, a purple radiance bloomed from Lin Yun’s body on the platform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, a bloodthirsty roar suddenly appeared within this world. When the thunderclouds continued to tumble, it slowly formed into a crimson figure that looked like a demon and slashed down at Lin Yun’s platform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In front of the demonic being’s sword, everything was being destroyed. Even the platforms that were here for thousands of years were like paper in front of the sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Lin Yun opened his eyes to see this scene, his face changed. The crimson being was like a mountain, while he was like a small rift in the ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Damn it!” Lin Yun didn’t have the luxury of time to think about a solution and summoned his Flower Burial Sword. But for some reason, his heart finally calmed down when he held onto the Flower Burial Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old friend, I’m counting on you again…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had undergone too much with his sword, and his heart was already linked with it. Even without him uttering a word, the sword released a buzz that resonated with Lin Yun’s feelings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A smile rose on his lips briefly before it was replaced with the courage to face death.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I, Lin Yun, won’t be dying here!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when the crimson sword was about to reach him, Lin Yun swiped his fingers on his sword. At the same time, the Iris Flower in his dantian bloomed and emitted an unparalleled sword aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In the name of my sword, bloom!” When the Iris Flower bloomed, a bizarre scene took place. Lin Yun actually managed to block the demonic being’s sword, but his face was pale with blood seeping out from the corner of his lips. Cracks also began to spread out on the platform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Get lost!” Lin Yun roared. Taking advantage of this moment, Lin Yun bolted out to dodge this attack. With that, the crimson sword no longer had anything stopping it and stabbed into the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kneeling down with one knee on another platform, Lin Yun gasped for his breath. His state was terrible, with his hair scattered and blood oozing out from his nose, eyes, and ears. He was barely able to take that sword, but even so, his injuries were pretty heavy. However, there was a smile on his lips because he knew that he had survived that attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back in the Sword Burial Woods, the two old men were briefly shocked. After a long while later, Lord Thirteen stroked his beard with a smile, “How lucky.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Taking a sip of the Coldpool Dew, the plump old man smiled, “Yeah. He practically snatched his life back from the heavens. The Sword Burial Diagram is filled with bones, but he actually managed to survive.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The pot was filled with Snowdragon Carp’s meat. The two old men already ate one-third of the meat, but none of them touched the crescent moon meat that contained the essence of the Snowdragon Carp. The two were looking at each other, and they would strike each other’s chopsticks if any one of them dared to touch it.</span></p>
