 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Ning’s arrogant voice reverberated throughout the surrounding, amplified by his origin energy. If anyone else had yelled, the crowd would have sneered in disdain. Even Huangfu Jingxuan would be met with this treatment. However, Wang Ning was different. He represented the Wang Clan, who held a high position in the Firmament Sword Pavilion and offending the Wang Clan meant offending Wang Yan in the pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beside him, Leng Mo spoke out, “Clear the area. Teach anyone who resists a lesson. Make an example out of them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Understood.” The area was swiftly cleared out. Everyone had left this region, either on their own or by force. The tyranny of Wang Ning’s group naturally made everyone unhappy, but no one was foolish enough to go up against Wang Ning at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It will be hard for Lin Yun to escape now…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How pitiful. I saw Lin Yun and his companion in a pathetic state earlier.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I saw that too! Ten cultivators in the Profound Martial Realm have sealed off the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wang Ning is insane. He must have a grudge with Lin Yun to be doing this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shhh! Keep your voice down. It’s best for us not to provoke them.” The crowd did not go far after being chased away. They settled down into groups and discussed among themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leng Mo and Wang Ning rode on their horses, with over twenty Xiantian Realm lackeys beside them. They did not go too deep into this area, confusing everyone as to what they were planning. But shortly after, someone realized what Wang Ning was trying to do, “He’s planning to toy with Lin Yun!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Think about it. Killing a cultivator in the Xiantian Realm is as easy as lifting a finger for ten Profound Martial Realms. But why didn’t they kill Lin Yun directly?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I see. So Wang Ning is trying to force Lin Yun into a corner to deliver himself over.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That must be the reason why he’s guarding this place.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone immediately understood that Wang Ning didn’t intend to simply kill Lin Yun. He wanted to humiliate Lin Yun before killing him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Deep in the dense forest, Lin Yun and Li Wuyou both looked exhausted. Their hair was messy and their faces pale. Even the bloodstains on the corner of their lips were still wet. The two of them traveled through the forest and would occasionally encounter cultivators in the Profound Martial Realm. It was like someone had cast a net over them. No matter where they went, they were met with a dead end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blackflame Crows dispersed out from their area and they spotted Mo Qingyun. He held onto his bone flute and looked at Li Wuyou coldly saying, “Lil’ bastard, do you remember me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In their previous encounter, Li Wuyou had humiliated him by stepping on his face. Now, Mo Qingyun wanted Li Wuyou’s life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heh. Sorry, but I never remember the name of those who beg for mercy.” Li Wuyou casually brushed his messy hair. He smiled brightly and didn’t look the least bit depressed by his situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re courting death!” Mo Qingyun sneered and blew his flute, manipulating the Blackflame Crows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Flapping their wings, the Blackflame Crows dived like arrows in Lin Yun and Li Wuyou’s direction. Lin Yun faced this situation indifferently, unleashing a wisp of sword flash from his fingertips. The sword flash tore through the air, piercing through the flock of Blackflame Crows and headed towards Mo Qingyun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What speed!” Mo Qingyun’s face changed when he saw the sword flash. He immediately stopped what he was doing and rolled to the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Wuyou, who was bathed in starlight, held onto a longsword and forced his way through the flock of crows. His sword was aimed in Mo Qingyun’s direction and he yelled, “Die!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Mo Qingyun was ultimately still someone in the Profound Martial Realm. Facing Li Wuyou, his aura surged in the blink of an eye. Relying on his cultivation, he clamped his fingers together and caught Li Wuyou’s sword. Li Wuyou felt as though his sword had plunged into a mountain. He couldn’t pull his sword away no matter how hard he tried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“With your cultivation, you won’t even be able to hurt me even if I give you a chance.” Mo Qingyun sneered. His origin energy reverberated across the sword. But right before it was going to hurt Li Wuyou, a violet sword flash caught him by surprise and pierced through his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Qingyun wailed and was sent flying. Lin Yun rushed forward, blasting through the crows, and arrived next to Li Wuyou. But just as he was going to walk forward, he saw Han Mo and Han Feng in the depths of the forest. Both of them were charging at him, holding their swords. Even the surrounding trees were swaying from their momentum. Seeing them, Lin Yun and Li Wuyou’s faces changed. They had personally experienced how strong they were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This way!” The two of them immediately changed directions and started running. Lin Yun refused to believe that he couldn’t walk out of this dense forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But suddenly, a cold gleam descended from the sky, piercing through the mottled leaves and slamming down like a bolt of lightning. Lin Yun and Li Wuyou managed to avoid it by taking a step back. When they raised their heads, they saw a longsword plunged into the ground that was buzzing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Incomplete sword intent?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun’s brows twitched. He could sense the sword intent flowing on the sword. He noticed a person leaning against a tree, grinning at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I heard that you know the Dragon-Tiger Fist. What a coincidence. I happen to know some close combat techniques as well. I’m Huangfu Jingxuan, please enlighten me!” Huangfu Jingxuan dashed forward and threw a punch at Lin Yun. His punch was swift, reaching Lin Yun before he could even react.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun’s eyes blazed with flames. He activated the Thunderblitz Battle Physique and faced the attack with the Undying Vajra Seal. Huangfu Jingxuan’s murderous aura surged as they loudly collided. The people outside the region were shocked when they saw the murderous aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s the Breaking Fist!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huangfu Jingxuan finally made his move!” A massive shockwave started to spread out. The audience was shocked when they felt the shaking earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blood dripped from the corner of Lin Yun’s lips. Coughing violently, he looked at Huangfu Jingxuan in shock. This was the first time he was lacking when facing someone of the same generation. He wasn’t able to defeat his opponent, even with the Thunderblitz Battle Physique and the fusion of fist and sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huangfu Jingxuan wiped his lips and looked at the bloodstain on his hand. He glanced at Lin Yun, “You actually managed to injure me while being in the Xiantian Realm. I now understand why Wang Ning wants to kill you so badly. Even if you have a garbage Martial Soul, he won’t be able to feel at peace if you reach the Profound Martial Realm…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But before he could finish his words, a gust with flickering starlight flashed. Li Wuyou had found an opportunity to attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No!” Lin Yun immediately yelled out. He felt an uneasiness building up in his heart. Huangfu Jingxuan was in the Profound Martial Realm and grasped the incomplete sword intent. If he had his sword, his strength would reach a whole new level that was unimaginable to Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun had also grasped the incomplete sword intent, so he knew how terrifying it was. However, it was too late. Huangfu Jingxuan reached out to grab his longsword and retaliated. Although he made his move slightly later, his sword stabbed Li Wuyou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blood splattered and a trace of reluctance flickered in Li Wuyou’s eyes. The tip of his sword was only half an inch away from Huangfu Jingxuan’s heart. However, he could not close the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huangfu Jingxuan shook his hand slightly, causing the sword intent in his sword to explode. Li Wuyou was sent flying and he collapsed on the ground as he vomited blood. He could no longer get on his feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not bad. You seem to know the sword in my hand. If you were in the Profound Martial Realm, you might have been a worthy opponent. What a pity...” Huangfu Jingxuan took out his handkerchief and wiped off the bloodstains on his sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun took a deep glance at Huangfu Jingxuan before he picked up Li Wuyou and turned to run. Huangfu Jingxuan, however, sheathed his sword and stood still. He did not pursue Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lil’ Red!” Lin Yun yelled, summoning the Dragon Blooded Horse. It had run over like a crimson bolt of lightning. Getting on horseback, Lin Yun whipped the reins. He did not dare to think too much right now. He only wanted to break through the encirclement as soon as possible. Otherwise, there was a possibility that Li Wuyou might die. The incomplete sword intent that Huangfu Jingxuan left within Li Wuyou was lethal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the Dragon Blooded Horse ran, Lin Yun could see a faint gleam of sunlight up ahead. There was a spacious terrain up ahead that caused Lin Yun to rejoice. In a flat terrain without any obstructions, who could stop the Dragon Blooded Horse?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But just as he charged out of the dense forest, Lin Yun’s face suddenly changed. Wang Ning and Leng Mo were a kilometer away, riding on their horses. Furthermore, they had twenty-odd people around them that were formed into a row.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun realized he had been forced here. But there was no time left for him to think because a dark glow was bolting towards the Dragon Blooded Horse. It was Leng Mo who launched an attack with his spear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was too late for the Dragon Blooded Horse to dodge. As a result, the Dragon Blooded Horse was stabbed by the spear. Half of the spearhead plunged into the Dragon Blooded Horse, causing it to drop to the ground. Due to the Dragon Blooded Horse’s speed, Lin Yun and Li Wuyou were thrown off and rolled on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lil’ Red!” cried Lin Yun. He couldn’t be bothered with his injuries at this moment. He was more concerned about the Dragon Blooded Horse. Behind him, Huangfu Jingxuan, Han Mo, Han Feng, Feng Haoyu, Mo Qingyu, and the others descended on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aside from Huangfu Jingxuan, the others had suffered injuries to a certain degree. The ones with severe injuries were Feng Haoyu and Mo Qingyun. This scene was shocking to those who saw it. Who knew what sort of intense battle took place in the forest. At the same time, it was unbelievable that two Xiantian Realm cultivators managed to injure so many Profound Martial Realm cultivators.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun got on his feet and raised his head to look at Wang Ning. His face was full of mockery as he sneered at Wang Ning with the corner of his lips. Far away, thousands of newcomers that were participating in the test were standing on tree branches. All of them had looked at this confrontation with indifference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So sword slave, who’s the dog now?” Wang Ning looked down at Lin Yun, who was a mess, from high above.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The second young master is talking to you!” barked Leng Mo as he looked at Lin Yun.</span></p>
