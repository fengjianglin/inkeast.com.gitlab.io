 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Qiushan belonged to one of the four prestigious clans of the Great Qin Empire, the Lin Clan. She was a direct descendant and she was also ranked thirty-ninth on the Mortal Ranking. Not only was she talented, but she was also blessed with a delicate appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was currently returning to the group with Gu Beixuan. The two looked to be in a good mood because they just killed a sixth stage demonic beast together and obtained a second-grade Swordcloud Core. But their faces changed when they saw the scene before them, especially Gu Beixuan. Tian Fei’s head was buried in the ground by Lin Yun’s feet. Although a Profound Martial Realm cultivator wouldn’t die so easily, it was still a little too ruthless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Sister, that bastard slapped me!” Lin Yan immediately ran over when she saw that Lin Qiushan was back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Qiushan didn’t see her face because Lin Yan was covering it earlier. But when Lin Qiushan caught a clear glance of her younger sister’s face, her face turned ugly. Lin Yan was a beauty, but her face was swollen like a pig right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Chen Ling saw Lin Qiushan and Gu Beixuan coming over, he smiled bitterly. He knew that the matter today had blown up. He immediately went up and begged, “Boss Zhong, please let go of Tian Fei for now. These two are Lin Qiushan and Gu Beixuan, the leaders of the Will-o'-Wisp Alliance and Flamemoon Alliance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Lin Yun removed his leg, he didn’t say a word. But this still made Chen Ling feel relief in his heart. Then, he steeled his nerves and headed towards Gu Beixuan and Lin Qiushan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chen Ling, this is someone from your Shatterlegion Alliance?” asked Gu Beixuan while frowning. His voice was cold and he would’ve already attacked if Chen Ling wasn’t here. But even so, there was no way he would let this matter go so easily if Chen Ling didn’t give him an explanation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Lin Qiushan stood quietly at the side while she comforted Lin Yan. However, her gaze was on Chen Ling. Clearly, she was also waiting for an explanation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The atmosphere suddenly became peculiar. The Will-o'-Wisp Alliance and Flamemoon Alliance’s disciples quietly spread out and looked over with ill intentions. This made the four from the Shatterlegion Alliance nervous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Ling gnashed his teeth. He didn’t know how to explain this situation. In the end, he could only speak out, “He’s my friend that will temporarily be joining the Shatterlegion Alliance. But it’s a little troublesome to explain this situation. The situation is not what you guys think it is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then I’ll ask this friend of yours personally.” Lin Qiushan headed towards Lin Yun after throwing a glance at Chen Ling. She was clearly unhappy with Chen Ling’s reply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Beishan also shoved Chen Ling to the side and stepped forward. The two looked at Lin Yun and they seemed to be trying to see something. But they couldn’t see anything at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Qiushan asked in a solemn voice, “How may I address you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhong Yunxiao,” replied Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhong Yunxiao?” Lin Qiushan and Gu Beixuan exchanged a glance. They could see the doubt in each other’s eyes because they had never heard of this name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shouldn’t you explain yourself?” Lin Qiushan looked at the deep eyes beneath the mask.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no need for me to explain myself,” replied Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You!” Lin Qiushan immediately became furious because no one had ever spoken to her with such a tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You slapped Lin Yan and even stepped on a disciple of my Flamemoon Alliance. Brother Zhong, it looks like you have no intention of resolving this matter peacefully?” Gu Beixuan laughed while his eyes narrowed into slits. His eyes were deep and profound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But just when the atmosphere became intense, Chen Ling immediately came out. However, he was stopped by Lin Yun, who looked at Lin Yan, “Why don’t you ask the person involved if you want to know the truth? What are you guys trying to do by questioning me? As for you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun turned to Gu Beixuan and also smiled beneath the mask. However, his smile was chilling. He spoke out, “Do you really want me to resolve this issue and not in the ‘peaceful’ way? I highly recommend you don’t do that. Otherwise, this might be the last time you wish for something.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Lin Yun spoke, he unleashed his aura into the surroundings. Gu Beixuan and Lin Qiushan immediately felt pressured and a trace of panic filled their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Qiushan then turned to look at Lin Yan coldly and questioned, “Tell me everything. What did you do?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Facing her elder sister’s gaze, Lin Yan started to panic and she spoke in a soft tone, “I-I only wanted him to remove his mask. I didn’t do anything else…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She drew her sword,” interrupted Chen Ling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Qiushan’s face changed when she heard that. It was common knowledge that you don’t pull your sword unless you were going to engage in a life and death battle. Even if Lin Yun killed Lin Yan, it would have been fully justified and he wouldn’t be blamed for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the mask, Lin Yun naturally had a reason for wearing it. Lin Yan was asking for a beating by wanting to remove it of her own will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s not the case. Big Sister, this person is too hateful! He’s just a nobody, yet he actually dared to rebuke me when I asked him to remove his mask. He said that I’m not qualified to do so,” Lin Yan immediately tried to explain for herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s enough!” Lin Qiushan’s face sank. She rebuked Lin Yan and turned to look at Lin Yun. This time, her gaze softened, “I apologize on my younger sister’s behalf. It’s her fault for being disrespectful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s fine.” Lin Yun replied without any emotion in his tone. At the same time, Gu Beixuan was informed by Tian Fei of what transpired. His face immediately turned dark when he heard the explanation. It was fine if Tian Fei could defeat Lin Yun in order to protect the beauty, but he had his head stepped into the ground with one move. Tian Fei was simply the humiliation of the Flamemoon Alliance. In the end, Gu Beixuan still had to apologize to Lin Yun on Tian Fei’s behalf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My junior brother was a little too rash and I was in the wrong for failing to discipline him. But it’s fortunate that Brother Zhong isn’t injured or that would have been terrible,” said Gu Baixuan as he cupped his hands together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Watching from the side, Chen Ling was trying his best to hold back his laughter.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could someone like Tian Fei possibly injure Lin Yun?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thanks for your concern, but it’s impossible for him to even harm a strand of my hair,” replied Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Chen Ling heard that, he finally lost control and immediately covered his mouth because he nearly burst into laughter. Gu Beixuan was just trying to ease the atmosphere, but no one had expected Zhong Yunxiao to be so honest to give a slap without any hesitation. In the end, Gu Beixuan could only chuckle dryly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can have this Swordcloud Core as an apology.” Lin Qiushan knew that her younger sister was at fault and she took out a Swordcloud Core without any hesitation. This scene made Gu Beixuan widen his mouth, but he ultimately didn't say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They obtained this Swordcloud Core with great difficulty by killing a demonic beast together. However, it was worth giving it up if it could resolve the conflict.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun merely glanced at Lin Qiushan before he took the Swordcloud Core. He didn’t say a word. With that, the conflict had finally come to an end. At the same time, the four from the Shatterlegion Alliance’s eyes changed when they looked at Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They only knew that Lin Yun was strong, but they didn’t know that Lin Yun was so domineering. Both Lin Qiushan and Gu Beixuan were famous figures in the outer sect, but they suffered a loss in Lin Yun’s hands. They even started to wonder if everyone else from the three alliance-unions were extras in the team. After all, Lin Yun was probably enough by himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They never expected that the strongest from the two alliance-unions would actually take a loss before Lin Yun. Lin Yun slapped Lin Yan, trampled Tian Fei, and the other party actually decided to give him a Swordcloud Peak as compensation? Was there anyone more domineering than Lin Yun?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When night fell and everyone planned to rest, Chen Ling pulled Lin Yun to the side. He spoke with an insightful expression, “Boss Zhong, I’ve told them that you will be joining us on this mission, but I’m not too confident about it since Lin Qiushan and Gu Beixuan didn’t give me a reply.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go and sleep. They will definitely agree to it,” replied Lin Yun confidently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why?” Chen Ling was confused. Lin Yun wasn’t willing to remove his mask and even injured Lin Yan and Tian Fei. Furthermore, he even embarrassed Gu Baixuan and Lin Qiushan. So even if the two had a wide breadth of mind, how could they possibly allow Lin Yun to follow them?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun merely glanced at Chen Ling and closed his eyes. He didn’t say anything more because it was tiring to talk to someone so stupid. Four people sat around the campfire, Lin Qiushan, Gu Beixuan, Lin Yan, and Tian Fei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother Gu, what do you think about it?” The bonfire’s light illuminated Lin Qiushan’s face as she frowned and looked at Gu Beixuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s strong. He can defeat Tian Fei with a single fist and that’s without using any martial techniques. There’s only one possibility. It’s his cultivation technique. He might be near or he might have already reached complete mastery. This allows his origin energy to far surpass ordinary disciples…” replied Gu Beixuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I was merely careless to be defeated,” muttered Tian Fei, but no one paid any attention to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“To accomplish this feat, one must either be an inner disciple or someone who cultivated a spiritual cultivation technique. There’s only one person I know in the outer sect that can accomplish this feat.” Lin Qiushan nodded in agreement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Third on the Mortal Ranking, Jiang Feng!” said Gu Baixuan in a solemn tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One year ago, Jiang Feng defeated the disciple who challenged him with a single palm, displaying his profound cultivation technique in greater mastery that was close to complete mastery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tian Fei and Lin Yan both changed as they exclaimed out, “That's impossible!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s naturally impossible that he’s Jiang Feng. He definitely has some gap compared to the top ten on the Mortal Ranking. After all, his cultivation is only in the fourth stage of the Profound Martial Realm. But it’s undeniable that he’s powerful. It’s just that he’s a little too mysterious. I’ve never heard of his name.” Gu Beixuan shook his head with deep confusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve also never heard of this person’s name. But there are some disciples that aren’t on the ranking. They’re all cultivating madmen who are either going through life and death experiences to strengthen themselves or cultivating bitterly in the Myriad Sword Diagram and the Cloudy Sword Pavilion. They will only pay attention to their strength. Senior Brother Gu, do you think we should take someone like him into our team?” asked Lin Qiushan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I already know your answer because you gave him the Swordcloud Core. You know that I will never go against your decision. Furthermore…our greatest rivals are the Fire Alliance’s Xiao Feng and Upstream Alliance’s Wei Songhan. Those two have a higher ranking than us and we’ve also suffered quite a bit because of them,” smiled Gu Beixuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When dawn rose, Chen Ling hazily saw two figures walk towards him. They were Gu Beixuan and Lin Qiushan. Before he could even greet them, Lin Qiushan turned to look at Lin Yun and said, “Brother Zhong, if you can put down what happened yesterday, we would like to ask for your help with the Imperial Sword Herb.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Ling’s sleepiness disappeared. He was shocked that Lin Qiushan and Gu Beixuan actually agreed to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll do my best,” replied Lin Yun. There wasn’t any expression in his eyes.</span></p>
