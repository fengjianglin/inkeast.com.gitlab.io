 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you guys really that confident that my origin energy is exhausted?” Lin Yun narrowed his eyes into slits after asking his question. The strength he displayed had shocked everyone, so whoever came up first would definitely die if his origin energy wasn’t completely exhausted. This meant that the first to act would be the foolish one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Yun, I’m giving you a choice. You can keep the interspatial pouches belonging to the one-eyed wandering cultivator and the skinny wandering cultivator. However, you have to leave Xue Feng’s interspatial pouch behind!” Bu Chen listed his demands, but his eyes flashed with uncertainty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can also give us your sword if you don’t wish to leave the interspatial pouch behind,” added Xiao Ran. His gaze was filled with greed for the ancient sword box behind Lin Yun. He saw how Lin Yun used the sword to cut the quasi-cosmic treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, the clattering of horse hooves sounded out. It was the Dragon Blooded Horse returning with Gao Yu and Bai Qiushui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you guys trying to do?” asked Bai Qiushui coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lady Bai, it’s good that you’re here,” responded Bu Chen. Without any changes in his expression, he continued, “We killed the wandering cultivators together, but Lin Yun wants to take their interspatial pouches for himself. There’s no way this makes sense.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’re only trying to reason with him to receive what we deserve. But a certain someone actually turned around and ridiculed us instead,” said Xiao Ran.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xue Feng is dead?” In surprise, Bai Qiushui looked around and discovered Xue Feng’s corpse. She came back because she was worried about Lin Yun, but she never expected that Xue Feng would be dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, she didn’t believe Bu Chen or Xiao Ran’s words. The two were utterly defeated by Xue Feng. They couldn’t even put up any resistance against him. In fact, they even kneeled to beg for mercy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bullshit!” roared Gao Yu in rage. “You people have been ridiculing Young Master Lin the whole time and even cursed him to die when he went into the valley. I personally heard all of this. Furthermore, weren’t you guys on your knees begging for mercy? Why would you guys be kneeling if you were capable of killing Xue Feng? You guys are simply shameless! Xue Feng must have been killed by Young Master Lin. Who else can accomplish it aside from him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re merely garbage from the Gao Clan. Plus, there are many people here who can be witnesses for us. Lady Bai, I only want to know what you think about this matter?” said Bu Chen coldly. Everyone’s attention fell on Lady Bai because of his words. After all, she had the authority here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I agree with Gao Yu’s view. You guys have suffered a great loss this time, so I will increase all your rewards by half when we get back,” replied Bai Qiushui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You bitch! I’ve done my best to protect you, but you’re helping that bastard? In my view, there’s no need for you to return. The scenery here is pretty good and it’s rather suitable to bury a beauty like you here!” Bu Chen completely lost it because he never expected that Bai Qiushui would be on Lin Yun’s side. As a result, he dropped his disguise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who says you can touch her?” Lin Yun’s cold voice suddenly rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You still dare to speak with your origin energy exhausted? You must be courting death!” Bu Chen’s origin energy surged and he started painting a dragon with his arms. As he painted, the dragon’s aura emitted and slowly formed into a painting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This move again? Well, I happen to know it as well…” Lin Yun also executed the Dragon Painting, but his version was more delicate and a boundless aura emitted from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two Dragon Paintings formed at the same time, but Lin Yun’s version was a lot stronger than Bu Chen’s. Lin Yun had comprehended the true profundity of this move after sparring with the golden tiger and his version even contained the pressure of a hundred beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they clashed, Bu Chen’s attack instantly shattered while Lin Yun was shrouded with the image of a roaring dragon. Then, Lin Yun’s fist landed on Bu Chen’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bu Chen’s internal organs were instantly torn apart. He fell onto the ground and coughed blood up. He raised his head and looked at Lin Yun with fear in his eyes. At the same time, Xiao Ran looked at Lin Yun in shock because of how Lin Yun took Bu Chen down. He never expected that Lin Yun still had the strength to fight, so Xiao Ran didn’t dare to stand up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Ran debated what to do before yelling out, “Damn it! I’ll kill you!” But just when he made his decision to attack, a crimson bolt of lightning charged over and slammed into him. He was sent flying from the impact. Before he could even get on his feet, the Dragon Blooded Horse rushed over and stomped on him. The stomp broke Xiao Ran’s ribs, which made him miserably cry out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This scene made those who were threatening Lin Yun earlier turn pale. When Lin Yun swept his glance over them, they were terrified and immediately fell on their knees without a second thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not interested in killing you guys. Get lost.” Lin Yun wasn’t interested in those people. After all, would a human show any interest in a fly?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Gao Clan and other sects’ disciples were relieved by Lin Yun’s words and immediately ran away. They were afraid that Lin Yun would take back his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun waved his hand and the Dragon Blooded Horse removed its hooves from Xiao Ran with reluctance. He then turned to Bai Qiushui and asked, “What are you planning to do with them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two had accepted the mission as guards for Bai Qiushui, but they were so deranged to the point of wanting to kill their employer. So Lin Yun had to ask Bai Qiushui how he should deal with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lady Bai, please spare us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’ve done our best throughout the trip to protect you and keep you safe. Please let us off.” Bu Chen and Xiao Ran begged for mercy since their lives depended on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qiushui looked at them with disgust and replied to Lin Yun, “You can deal with them as you wish.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her words made Bu Chen and Xiao Ran tremble in fear. With Lin Yun’s previous actions, they knew that their outcome wouldn’t be good. On the other hand, Gao Yu sneered inwardly at this scene because these two bastards had courted death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What Young Master Bu said makes sense. The scenery here is great, but it’s not suitable to bury a beauty here. Why don’t you two kneel here for three days and comprehend your martial techniques instead? Remain kneeling like how you kneeled before Xue Feng,” said Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Bu Chen and Xiao Ran were both stunned. This punishment was even more humiliating than death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s the matter? Are you unhappy with this punishment?” Lin Yun swept a sharp gaze at the two of them, causing a chill to run down their spines. His sword intent even made their blood freeze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, we’re happy. Of course we’re happy.” Bu Chen and Xiao Ran gnashed their teeth and buried their heads deep into their trousers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gao Yu shivered when he saw this scene. He was intimidated by Lin Yun’s ruthlessness. Lin Yun might seem friendly, but that was under the premise that no one provoked him.</span></p>
