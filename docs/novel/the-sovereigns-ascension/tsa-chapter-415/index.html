Could it be that he could even return to the ninth stage of the Profound Martial Realm. His ninth profound vein was shattered, which, generally speaking, would take two years to reforge without divine pellets or the help of experts. However, Guardian Plum’s words made his heart jolt, but at the same time, he could feel that there was something amiss about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve already sensed the three seals back in the Repent Cliff, but I wasn’t able to do anything about it. My entire body aches the moment I try anything and the eight other profound veins show signs of shattering. Clearly, I can only inherit the three seals after reaching the ninth stage of the Profound Martial Realm,” said Lin Yun. The three cultivation origins were too massive, so it wasn’t something he could currently bear. He would only be playing with fire if he tried anything now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I won’t repeat my words again. Diligently comprehend it here for the next one month,” replied Guardian Plum as he turned around and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Yun fell into deep thought. Guardian Plum left too decisively, which was unlike his usual style.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be that there is a secret behind it?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Suddenly, Lin Yun thought of something and he locked his brows together, “Guardian Plum, you never hoped that I would comprehend something from it since the beginning, right? You just want to trap me here and make me miss the Dragon Gate Competition.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason was naturally clear. Lin Yun could be courting death if he participated in the Dragon Gate Competition right now. So it would be better for Lin Yun to wait for the next competition three years from now. At that time, his shattered profound vein would’ve recovered and he could also refine the three seals at that time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Yun's words suddenly made Guardian Plum stop. He sighed, “Lin Yun, sometimes, being too smart isn’t a good thing. Why are you so stubborn? You’re only eighteen. Can’t you wait three &nbsp;more years? Why are you so insistent about participating in the Dragon Gate Competition at the end of this year?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can’t wait three years,” replied Lin Yun. “I already promised Big Brother Xin Jue that I will participate in the Dragon Gate Competition no matter what. Big Brother Xin Jue gave his life to save mine, so it’s my turn to fight on his behalf. Qin Yu still has something on Senior Sister Xin Yan and I don’t want this thorn to be in her heart for another three years. So I have to participate in this Dragon Gate Competition no matter what!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Yun’s gaze was stubborn with a steely determination to never take a step back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re stubborn!” barked Guardian Plum. “I won’t stop you since you’re seeking death. But it’s impossible for me to tell you the secrets behind the three seals!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Guardian Plum waved his hand, the entire place trembled and a terrifying pressure emitted out from Guardian Plum that made Lin Yun take several steps back. At the same time, countless plum trees exploded in the direction that Guardian Plum waved his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Lin Yun regained his sight and the ground no longer trembled, he could no longer see Guardian Plum’s silhouette.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have already left a restriction here. You won’t be able to go anywhere unless you comprehended the three origins I left behind. You’re on your own now.” Guardian Plum’s emotionless voice echoed by Lin Yun’s ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Patting the dust on his body, Lin Yun muttered, “It looks like Guardian Plum is really furious this time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had known Guardian Plum for some time now, but he had never seen Guardian Plum so furious. Guardian Plum wasn’t even this furious when he killed Wang Yan and violated the sect’s rules back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then again, he had embarrassed Qin Yu greatly. So there was no way Qin Yu would let him off in the Dragon Gate Competition, not to mention that he was only in the eighth stage of the Profound Martial Realm. Even if he was in the ninth or tenth stage, he still might not be able to defeat Qin Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since Lin Yun was famous in the Great Qin Empire now, many people wanted to use him as a stepping stone. So he might die before he could even encounter Qin Yu in the Dragon Gate Competition. Thus, it wasn’t surprising that Guardian Plum was so furious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Lin Yun had no reason to give up on the decision he made. Suddenly, he turned to look at the plum woods. Guardian Plum’s palm had destroyed nearly half of the woods. Guardian Plum loved the plum woods a lot, so he could tell how furious Guardian Plum was by looking at the destroyed woods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Weird.” Lin Yun gradually found something unusual as he walked towards the woods. The trees might be broken, but new saplings were actually growing on the cut surfaces. Shortly after, the plum woods gradually came back to life before Lin Yun’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“New lease on life…” This scene was bizarre and Lin Yun wouldn’t believe it if he hadn’t witnessed it personally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Lin Yun’s face changed and he fell into deep thought. He seemed to have caught onto something. The palm from Guardian Plum had given him a clue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Lin Yun’s brows slowly relaxed, a faint smile appeared on his face, “I see… Guardian Plum really has a soft heart to reveal the profundities to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Lin Yun still couldn’t comprehend the three origins with this clue, then he would be too stupid. Guardian Plum had already given a clue stating that the three origins also had the same effects as the trees. It could give new life to his snapped profound vein.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This probably has something to do with Guardian Plum’s Martial Soul. Then again, his control over his Martial Soul must have reached an unbelievable height.” This was probably where Guardian Plum’s thesis on the Martial Soul came from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Yun found a place to sit down and began to look inside his body. The three origins left by Guardian Plum in his body were like three golden seals that radiated like three blazing suns.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It looks like I’m right!” Now that Lin Yun had a direction to work in, he penetrated his origin energy into the seals, but there was naturally no way his origin energy could compare to Guardian Plum’s. He felt as though his origin energy had entered the ocean and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Lin Yun didn’t give up there. He tried hundreds of times and when his origin energy finally reached the depths of the seal, he saw a wisp of gentle green radiance brimming with vitality. When he saw that, a smile rose on Lin Yun’s lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Yun then circulated the Iris Sword Sutra and continued to pour his origin energy into the three seals. When his origin energy was poured into the seals, the seals’ radiance began to grow with wisps of green energy leaking out from the seals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the green energy fell onto his shattered profound vein, Lin Yun could see his profound vein being repaired at a visible speed. Simultaneously, he could also feel warmth coursing through his body. It felt as though a blind person had suddenly regained their vision. It might sound exaggerated, but it was a perfect example for Lin Yun who had shattered his own profound vein.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that, his profound vein began to brim with vitality under the nourishment of the green energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three days later, when Lin Yun reopened his eyes, his origin energy fluctuated and his ninth profound vein was also activated. A domineering aura arose from his body once more. At this moment, Lin Yun had regained his cultivation in the ninth stage, yet it was even stronger than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It feels good to be back in the ninth stage…” Lin Yun clenched his fist and poured his origin energy into his hand. He could clearly feel that this was his true strength.</span></p>

He had only absorbed the green essence to fix his profound vein, so now that he was in the ninth stage, he could start refining the three cultivation origins.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During this time, a thought crossed Lin Yun’s mind. He believed that Guardian Plum would’ve been in the Heavenly Soul Realm by now if he hadn’t given the three cultivation origins to Lin Yun. Losing the three origins, Guardian Plum’s breakthrough would be delayed by at least five years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Guardian Plum could’ve repaired his profound vein for him, but he didn’t. Was that because Lin Yun wouldn’t be able to fight the eight titles even after he absorbed the three origins?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Yun’s heart sank when he thought about that. The eight titles were like an indomitable mountain that stood before him. Then again, could the height of a mountain surpass heaven? Defying heaven was what he ought to do as a swordsman. If there was a mountain in front of him, then he would split it into two with the sword in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Calming his heart, Lin Yun turned around and gave three bows. He knew that he could only repay Guardian Plum in the Dragon Gate Competition. Since he had comprehended the three origins, this place could no longer stop him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Yun didn’t stay here and returned back. He believed that Guardian Plum must be observing him from somewhere and had removed the restriction the moment he recovered his cultivation.</span></p>
