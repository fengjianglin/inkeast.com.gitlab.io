 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ten days passed in the blink of an eye, and Lin Yun had practically completely recovered from his injuries thanks to the Dracophant Battle Physique. But he failed when trying to reform his ninth profound vein several times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It should be easy for him to form the ninth profound vein with the density of his origin energy. After all, he had previously refined a Bloodflame Fruit and a Yin-Yang Pellet. Those were treasures that even the eight titles would fight for.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun still had his foundation and his origin energy wasn’t any weaker than those in the tenth stage of the Profound Martial Realm. But he had shattered his own profound vein, which meant that his breakthrough wasn’t the same as others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he gave it several attempts and failed, his injuries worsened. In the end, he could only spend more time nourishing his profound vein with his origin energy. Even if he made some progress, the progress was good for nothing. He had no idea when he could reform his ninth profound vein.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Others might feel despair if they were in his position, but Lin Yun soon recollected himself and started cultivating the Age Sutra. As he refined his origin energy, he was also trying to make a breakthrough in this technique to the second stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he had nothing to do, he would look at the stars and moon in the sky. The Repent Cliff was so quiet that he could even hear the echoes of his heartbeat. Without him even keeping track of time, one month had passed in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The arrival of autumn had made the Repent Cliff even colder, but staying here for a month felt like a year. He was isolated from the outside world and this made time felt even longer. During this period, Bai Lixuan made a breakthrough and reached the ninth stage of the Profound Martial Realm, displaying to others how terrifying the Saint Physique’s potential was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cultivators emphasize two things, aptitude and comprehension. Aptitude determined how fast a cultivator could cultivate. With similar resources, the cultivator with the Saint Physique was naturally faster. If Bai Lixuan was given more time, he would show the Great Qin Empire the true meaning of shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Lixuan had disappeared for too long and the Great Qin Empire had nearly forgotten about him. But his reappearance attracted everyone’s attention because he was too dazzling. But there was no way for Lin Yun to know about this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On this day, Lin Yun suddenly felt an explosion in his mind as boundless information gathered into golden runes. Thanks to his photographic memory, Lin Yun memorized the runes with just a glance. His Age Sutra had reached the second stage. The ancient runes were second grade spiritual runes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spiritual runes were rare and they weren’t easily found. Even if they managed to gather together, it was practically impossible for anyone to memorize them all. But when Lin Yun made a breakthrough into the second stage of the Age Sutra, countless second grade spiritual runes appeared in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Blaze Rune…” Lin Yun picked up a dried-up tree branch and started drawing on the ground. As he gathered his origin energy, he drew with powerful strokes. It didn’t take long for him to complete an entire spiritual rune that started burning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun let out a breath as he looked at the Blaze Rune on the ground and fell into deep thought. He finally had a harvest from the Age Sutra after forty days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was in a good mood, so he continued to draw more second grade spiritual runes. The Thundercloud Rune, Wildgale Rune, Agegold Rune, and the Azurewood Rune…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More spiritual runes began to take form on the ground as they brimmed with spiritual energy. The spiritual runes were profound existences. They could be used to refine pellets, artifacts, and set up arrays. Lin Yun wondered if they could be used to kill as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This thought merely flashed in Lin Yun’s mind before he shook his head. He sat with his legs crossed and looked into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Iris Flower in his dantian had seventy-one petals, and he was one petal away from achieving the ninth stage in the Iris Sword Sutra. But it wasn’t easy to make a breakthrough. Beneath the Iris Flower were runes that glowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were a total of eighteen runes and each of them represented an age energy. After the Age Sutra reached the second stage, the age energy mixed into his origin energy and had manifested into runes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lin Yun looked at his ninth profound vein, he noticed that it had recovered a little. But at this rate, it would take him two years to make the breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Two years…” Lin Yun muttered to himself. Was he going to stay here for two years? The Repent Cliff was a cage. In fact, it was just a big cage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Staying here made Lin Yun feel like a caged tiger and only those who were here could feel the bitterness of being caged up. He could even see scratch marks left on the wall by disciples who were previously here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Walking to the cliff, Lin Yun could sense a cold chill rising up from the abyss. He couldn’t see anything in the abyss and just taking a few more looks sent fear into his heart. After all, the unknown was always terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I wonder if senior sister has woken up,” said Lin Yun with concern flashing through his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was naturally most worried about Xin Yan right now. Just thinking about her made him feel a strong urge to leave the Repent Cliff. But so what if he managed to leave? Xin Jue was already dead. Did he have the courage to meet Xin Yan?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun felt bitter as he looked at the boundless clouds. Right at this moment, faint zither music rang out from the abyss that stirred his heartstrings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Again?” Lin Yun could hear zither music occasionally after he came here. He was tempted to go down and take a look, but he still held himself back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He frowned his brows and became fidgety. It was fine if the music was great, but the chaotic music without any rhythm stirred a fire in his heart. Just like that, half a month passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A youthful figure faced the blazing sun on the Repent Cliff. It looked like there were two people fighting, but they were both using the same martial techniques, Luminous Moon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the two radiant moons clashed, the two continued with the Myriad Frost and Moon Reflection. After the three ultimate moves were executed, the cold rays from their sword radiated under the sun like flowers hovering in the clouds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After this was all over, Lin Yun was only the one on the cliff. His ‘opponent’ was just himself. He could do this once the Seven Profound Steps reached the pinnacle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was alone by himself here. There weren’t any demonic beasts or cultivators, so he could only spar with himself. But if someone was here, they would surely be shocked to witness this scene. After all, this could only be accomplished when the sword technique and movement technique reached a high achievement. But Lin Yun was already used to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There seems to be more potential in the Aquaselenic Sword for me to excavate. But I’ve clearly reached complete mastery. Can it be that there’s another stage above complete mastery?” Lin Yun was baffled. All martial techniques were known to have four stages, initial, lesser, greater, and complete. However, the zither music sounded once again and disrupted his thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let me take a look at who you are!” Lin Yun couldn’t stand it any longer. He could put up with the loneliness, but he couldn’t put up with the horrible music disrupting him all the time. He took a step forward and looked down at the abyss with his brows knitted.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Should I jump or not?</span></p>
