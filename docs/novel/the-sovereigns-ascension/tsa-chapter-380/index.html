 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun fell into deep thought when he saw the azure lotus. But when he tried to grab at the azure lotus, it suddenly burst and disappeared like a bubble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, an image appeared before him. It felt as if he had gone back in time since he appeared on a boundless battlefield. But all of this had nothing to do with him, so he was like an outsider observing everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a majestic sect with battles breaking out all around. He could hear screams and warcries from all directions, along with many people dying. But even so, none of them gave up fighting. They fought fiercely and defended a towering palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The palace looked familiar and caused Lin Yun’s eyes to light up. The palace was clearly the Black Lotus Palace. The clouds that surrounded the palace looked like a shattered mirror. Lin Yun could see broken buildings and piles of corpses everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But there was still a group of people defending the Black Lotus Palace. The palace was the sect’s inheritance, so they were using their lives to protect the inheritance. Even as an outsider, Lin Yun wished that he could help out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But in the end, there was nothing he could do about it. He could only watch as the disciples died one after another. FInally, there was only one person left standing in front of the Black Lotu Palace. But the only thing that waited for him was death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Figures shrouded in demonic miasma dashed forth and stabbed their weapons into that person’s body. But just before he died, he suddenly raised his head and swung his sword out, “Eternal glory to my sword!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man swung out the last attack of his life to kill all the enemies in front of him before turning into an azure sword ray that enveloped the Black Lotus Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun managed to see the person’s face when he raised his head. He had the same appearance as the white-clothed man back on the ninth level. The scenes started to blur and Lin Yun could see the demonic beings trying to charge into the palace, but there was nothing they could do about the azure barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even after the scene disappeared, Lin Yun was dazed for a long time before he woke up from the dream. When he looked around on the tenth level, there was nothing. The lake or palace were nowhere to be seen. He was the only one on the tenth level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Lin Yun hadn’t comprehended the final ultimate move of the Aquaselenic Sword from the battle, he would have doubted if the lake and the palace were real. But there was nothing on the tenth level, no clouds or rain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was only a sentence left behind by a man many years ago, “Eternal glory to my sword.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A sword, a dream,” muttered Lin Yun. He finally understood what happened to the Demonlotus Realm. The Black Lotus Palace was only preserved because a group of people fought with their lives on the line. As long as the inheritance existed, their glory would too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black-clothed man and white-clothed man were the same person. Since there was no treasure on the tenth level, Lin Yun knew that it was time for him to leave. But he wasn’t disappointed because he had already gotten enough from the Demonlotus Realm, “Time to leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the elders and disciples of the Great Qin Empire’s sects were nervously staring at the black lotus in the center of the array. The Demonlotus Realm should’ve closed by now, which meant that Lin Yun was still alive in the tenth level. Since time continued to pass, there was a high chance that Lin Yun might pass the test.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The core disciples of the various sects wore complicated expressions. The tenth level was legendary. Were they going to witness a legend today?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Demonic Moon Villa’s Shui Wuhen stood without any expressions on his face. But his face suddenly changed as he stretched his palm out and caught onto a falling snowflake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s snowing?” Shui Wuhen was surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What the hell? The Extermination Barrens is hot during the year, so why is it suddenly snowing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s weird.” The sudden snow left all the sects baffled. Only some of the mature elders were emotional.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It looks like the legend is true! Snow will fall the moment someone gets through the tenth level, enveloping the entire Extermination Barrens.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Does this mean that Lin Yun made it through the test.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He must have. Otherwise, it makes no sense for this phenomenon to take place. The Sword Firmament Pavilion is really lucky. I wonder what kind of treasures are in the tenth level.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The snow was sparse in the beginning, but it got heavy a moment later. In just a brief moment, the Extermination Barrens was covered in a thick layer of snow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, a huge uproar exploded because everyone had personally witnessed a legend today. After all, no one knew when the snow would descend on the Extermination Barrens again. A hundred years? A thousand years? Maybe ten thousand years?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s out!” Right at this moment, Lin Yun appeared before everyone after crushing his jade slip. Countless gazes were directed at him. The Demonic Moon Villa’s Shui Wuhen also looked at Lin Yun. He could sense that there weren't any changes in Lin Yun’s cultivation or sword aura. But for some reason, he could sense an inexplicable change in Lin Yun’s temperament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could no longer gauge Lin Yun based on his cultivation.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Just that did Lin Yun experience in the tenth level?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Brother!” Lin Yun was still looking around to see if he was in the right place. He finally felt relieved when he heard a familiar voice. His figure flashed and he appeared in the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s camp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Brother, you’re finally out!” Xin Yan smiled with her eyes narrowed into slits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Brother, you’ve created a legend!” Tang Tong was beyond excited. He was practically running over when he saw Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire Sword Firmament Pavilion was also cheering at Lin Yun’s return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Legend?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;The tenth level was just a dream, but Lin Yun smiled when he saw how happy everyone was. He didn’t tell them about what happened on the tenth level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Feng and Xin Jue came over with a group of elders and smiled, “Lin Yun, are your injuries serious?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Being injured was unavoidable when making it to the tenth level, but Lin Yun had already recovered from his injuries when he came in contact with the azure lotus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, Elder. I’m great,” replied Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s good that you’re fine,” replied Luo Feng. But Luo Feng suddenly thought about something and he asked, “Lin Yun, were you the one who injured Shui Wuhen and Jing Jue?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, that was me.” The two had nearly forced him into a dead-end on the ninth level, but it was fortunate that he had refined the Yin-Yang Pellet. The Yin-Yang Pellet brought his cultivation to the ninth level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun didn’t hide anything from Luo Feng because he believed that the sect wouldn’t blame him for it. His words caused Luo Feng and the surrounding elders to look at him in surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you the one who defeated the Demonflame Sect’s Bai Yue too?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Were you also the one who killed the three core disciples of the Primal Origin Sect - Zhang Yan, Zhao Quan, and Xiao Ming?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I only did that since I ran into them,” replied Lin Yun. His words made everyone suck in a cold breath. Even their gazes changed when they looked at him. Those were impressive achievements, but Lin Yun had answered everything so casually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Feng fell into silence for a long time before he smiled bitterly, “I finally understand why the Pavilion Master wanted you to enter the Demonlotus Realm…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was feeling both happy and vexed at the same time. Based on Lin Yun’s growth, he believed that Lin Yun would shine in the Dragon Gate Competition three years from now and that no one could stop him from becoming one of the eight titles. If Lin Yun worked a little harder, he might even have a chance in the Dragon Gate Competition at the end of this year.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Luo Feng was vexed that they had offended so many sects at once, especially the demonic cultivators. The Sword Firmament Pavilion had now become the focus of negative attention and no one might help them if anything happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Yun, did you kill the core disciples of my sect?!” Wen Yanbo came with the Primal Origin Sect’s elders and disciples. Wen Yanbo was furious because they lost three core disciples, not to mention that they were killed by Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wasn’t just a great loss for the Primal Origin Sect, but complete humiliation. Wen Yanbo already had rage pent up in his chest, so he immediately came over when Lin Yun appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You prevented Mu Xiuhan of my Bloodbone Gate from entering the Black Lotus Palace. Does the Sword Firmament Pavilion dislike the Bloodbone Gate that much?” The Bloodbone Gate’s party came over with Mu Xiuhan, who wore a dark face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My Demonflame Sect isn’t a pushover either. Lin Yun, you injured Bai Yue and snatched his Yin-Yang Pellet. Do you dare to admit it?!” Another group came towards the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s camp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three sects had come to surround the Sword Firmament Pavilion, which caused an uproar in the Extermination Barrens. However, the bystanders weren’t too surprised by this scene. This occurred because their interests were affected. This situation might seem dangerous, but it could be easily resolved by handing some treasures over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Otherwise, a battle would be unavoidable. After all, cultivators spoke with their strength and the strong preyed on the weak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Sevendespair Palace has grievances too!” It was shocking enough that three sects came to question the Sword Firmament Pavilion, but no one had expected that another sect would join in the conflict too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sevendespair Palace’s group didn’t utter a word, but their faces were unsightly. Jing Jue’s interspatial pouch was stolen by Lin Yun, which actually included an ancient cosmic artifact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Feng sighed inwardly. What was to come would ultimately come. When the four sects came to surround them, the Sword Firmament Pavilion was instantly placed in an unfavorable position.</span></p>
