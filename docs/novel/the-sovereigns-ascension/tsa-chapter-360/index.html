 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun was left alone to search by himself once Feng Ye left. He would encounter many corpses along the way, but they seemed rather old. Some were killed by others, some by arrays, some by demonic beasts, and some by demonic corpses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It looked like there was more than one entrance to this passage. However, this passage still seemed rather secretive, so Lin Yun was expecting to have some kind of harvest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The corpses on the ground naturally belonged to the disciples who came into the Demonlotus Realm in the past. The Demonlotus Realm would open once every two decades and it represented both danger and opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After looking at the corpses on the ground, Lin Yun understood why the sect’s elders were so cautious about this opportunity and why Xin Yan begged him to give up the quota. These people were geniuses of their own era, but they were all lying here as corpses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun could only say that the path of cultivation was a brutal one. The one who succeeded would become the king, while the one who failed would be turned into a pile of bones. The cultivation path never pitied the weak and stared indifferently from the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun was filled with emotions. But he was a swordsman, so he would tear anything that stood in his way with his sword. Maintaining his caution, Lin Yun relied on his knowledge in spiritual runes to avoid the traps in the passage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, it was a safe journey. With his strength, it wasn’t a problem for him to deal with the traps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A door?” Lin Yun saw a door at the far end of the passage. This was something fresh because he never encountered any doors along the way. The door had ancient beasts engraved on it. The ground was littered with bones, and there wasn’t a single complete corpse to be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the beast on the bronze door came to life and roared at Lin Yun. But Lin Yun was already cautious, so he drew his sword before the beast got close to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His sword emitted a radiance in the darkness that seemed like moonlight. Simultaneously, he released his quasi-xiantian sword intent. When the radiance faded away, something heavy fell onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun focused his gaze over and saw that the head of the beast engraved on the door was gone. It became a headless shell. He soon figured it all out. The corpses on the ground must be left by disciples who were brutally murdered by the beast on the door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This made Lin Yun even more cautious about this palace. If he hadn’t been cautious earlier, he also would have ended up as one of the corpses on the ground. Lin Yun stood before the door and continued to swing his sword at the door. “Break!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The door broke into pieces when Lin Yun sheathed his sword and then it shot towards him. But before the door fragments could get close, they were all torn into pieces by his Iris Sword Sutra. Then again, this was only the beginning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the door shattered, countless beasts made of spiritual runes charged out from the hall. Lin Yun faced the beasts calmly and gathered his origin energy into his fist before unleashing the Soaring Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the dragon flew out from Lin Yun’s fist, it charged forward like a sword and destroyed all the beasts coming towards him. After Lin Yun was done with everything, he strode into the hall after a brief moment of hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind the door was a massive chamber. The moment Lin Yun stepped into the chamber, he felt a faint fluctuation coming from an array. In the next second, countless beasts dashed out from the walls and charged at him from every direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blink of an eye, Lin Yun manifested a dragon mountain on his left fist and a tiger mountain on his right fist. Bumping his fists together, the two mountains formed a larger mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the strongest defensive move from the Dragon-Tiger Fist. Lin Yun stood firmly like a mountain under the attacks. But the beasts were endless and Lin Yun’s face soon changed when he noticed a crack on the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no stop to the surrounding attacks and not even his defensive means could do anything about it. The split second when the mountain broke apart, Lin Yun gathered a huge tiger image and threw his punch forth. He used the Hundred Beast Wave this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The chamber trembled violently and all the beasts charging at him shattered under his punch. But before he could rest, the surrounding wall glowed and another endless wave of beasts came again. This made Lin Yun’s face change. He figured that he must be trapped in an array and he would die if he did nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ignoring the surrounding beasts, Lin Yun closed his eyes and tried his best to recall the Azure Transcript. Just when the beasts were about to devour Lin Yun, Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes and drew his sword. He looked down and swung his sword at the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun’s body rotated as he swung his sword, forming a lotus made of afterimages from sword intent that destroyed the spiritual runes hidden in the ground. This caused a chain reaction and the beasts charging at Lin Yun disappeared like vaporized water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sheathing his sword, Lin Yun let out a long breath, “That was dangerous.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew that he was a little reckless to step into the chamber earlier. If it weren’t for the comprehension he got from the Azure Transcript, he would probably be dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun stood around for an hour to ensure there were no more dangers before he started his search. There was a hidden compartment in the wall and there were many martial technique plaques inside it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun’s face was plastered with joy when he saw the plaques. They represented completed ancient martial techniques, which would save the elders time trying to complete them. After all, the damaged ones would take years to be completed. The jade plaques not only represented the resources he could get from the sect, but they would also strengthen the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s foundation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun waved his hand and stored them into his interspatial pouch without any hesitation. When he looked around at the shattered jade bottles in the corner, he felt heartache because they probably represented ancient pellets. Even the weakest ancient pellet was a priceless treasure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s this?” Lin Yun found a yellow gourd after sorting through the mess. Looking at the gourd, Lin Yun opened it up, and a boundless sharp aura started pouring out from the gourd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun raised his brow and closed the gourd with joy flashing in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is a Hiddensword Gourd!” He had seen it on ancient records. It was a rare artifact that could be used to store and nourish the sword. He even read that someone once stored a hundred thousand swords in a gourd. This meant that a hundred thousand swords would be unleashed when the gourd was opened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But storing so many swords in the gourd wasn’t always the best option. Different gourds had different uses, so the user had to spend time examining it. But all gourds shared a common characteristic in that they could be used to nourish swords. As long as there were enough spiritual jades, they could even help swords to rise in grade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll look into it after I return.” Lin Yun carefully stored the gourd. He really had to thank Feng Ye for this. If Feng Ye didn’t forcibly snatch the other path, Lin Yun would have no connection with this treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun continued his search for treasures and found a five petal Demonlotus Core on a stone platform in the corner. Lin Yun fell into deep thought and figured that this place's owner must have encountered a calamity and chose to die peacefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, I’m sorry.” Lin Yun bowed before keeping the five petal Demonlotus Core. When he came out of the chamber, he continued his journey forward, slaughtering his way and obtaining many Demonlotus Cores in the process. However, he didn’t have any more surprises like the Hiddensword Gourd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two days later, he finally reached the end of the passage and was teleported out of the underground palace. Compared to him, Feng Ye was very unfortunate. The path he went through was one that no one had gone through, unlike the one Lin Yun took, which was littered with corpses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun already had people scouting the way for him, but Feng Ye didn’t. He was quickly trapped in an array. In the beginning, he didn’t pay any attention to it and charged through everything with brute strength. However, he had some difficulty maintaining this process. Not only did he miss out on any harvests, but his injuries got worse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Ye wasn’t able to bear it even with his powerful physique. By the time he wanted to treat, he had already forgotten his path back. In the end, Feng Ye collapsed and started hammering at the wall before him and charging through it like a bull.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two days later, he finally appeared in a hall after charging through countless walls. He had joy revealed on his exhausted face, “I’m finally out! There must be treasures here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he was surprised to discover that there were many people gathered in the hall looking back at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Get lost!” Feng Ye walked over and pushed away the crowd. But he nearly fainted when he got a clearer look at the hall. This was the exact same hall that he started his journey in. The depression made Feng Ye throw out a mouthful of blood and his face turned even paler.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Feng Ye, your injuries seem serious.” A voice rang out, and Feng Ye turned around to see a bunch of people looking at him with malice in their eyes.</span></p>
