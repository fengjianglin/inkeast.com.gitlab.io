 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the saying goes, bad news travels faster than good news. So in just one night, the entire sect knew that Lin Yun encountered the Bloodbone Wandering Cultivators in the Bloodbone Forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Lei wasn’t the only one who was unhappy with Lin Yun. Everyone else on the top ten was also unhappy. They were the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s best and it was practically certain that they would enter the Earth Ranking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were prideful and they couldn’t stand any annoyances. Lin Yun had drawn their rage by accepting the five star A-rank missions. They were naturally unhappy that a newcomer broke an unspoken rule.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only did this matter concern their face, but it also affected their resources. Every single mission represented an ample reward, which included precious second-grade spiritual jades. After all, the rewards were meant for them by the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s upper hierarchy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were all sorts of fights in the sect and most of them were linked to resources. Resources were also separated into different grades. Everyone could obtain the low-graded resources and they could even obtain mid-grade resources if they worked a little harder. But second-grade spiritual jades were high-graded resources that everyone went crazy for.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So for the top ten, not receiving face didn’t matter as much as having their resources taken away. In a pavilion located somewhere in the Sword Firmament Pavilion, two people emitting a powerful aura sat together. Judging from their aura, they were stronger than Zhang Lei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their aura was imposing and anyone could tell that they were extraordinary with just one look. The two of them were famous in the Sword Firmament Pavilion and many people from the Earth Ranking didn’t dare to look down on them. They were Jiang Feng and Ye Xiu, ranked on the second and third respectively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were always in the top three on the Mortal Ranking and they’d been in the sect for two years now. Not only were they famous in the Sword Firmament Pavilion, but they even had a reputation in the Great Qin Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No arrogance could be seen on their faces, unlike other disciples. Rather than arrogance, they wore the look of experience. While they might seem composed, their actions were full of pride.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ye Xiu, have you heard the news?” asked Jiang Feng with a smile. The two were friends and rivals at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xiu smiled as he sipped on his tea, “Of course.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m surprised that even a cultivating lunatic like you has heard of it. This Lin Yun is quite a figure,” smiled Jiang Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How can I not pay any attention to him since he snatched the A-rank missions away?” Ye Xiu’s eyes flashed with killing intent when he spoke because the mission to kill Xue Feng originally belonged to him and Jiang Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You know what, I heard that most people who encounter the wandering cultivators in the Bloodbone Forest die,” replied Jiang Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t think that’s the case this time. How can someone who is capable of practicing the Overlord Sword be ordinary? He’s only seventeen, so his arrogance to accept all the five star missions was unavoidable. But given his ability, I believe that even if he couldn’t fight against the wandering cultivators, he still has the capability to escape,” said Ye Xiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Ye, you appear to have a good opinion of this person,” said Jiang Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Good opinion?” Ye Xiu smiled, “I can understand if he’s young and arrogant, but it’s an entirely different matter if he’s trying to climb on my head. I won’t let this matter rest and I’ll teach him a lesson when he comes back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Feng’s heart tensed when he heard that. Ye Xiu was known as a cultivating madman with an erratic temper. But this was the first time he had seen Ye Xiu reacting so strongly. He shared a different view from Ye Xiu on this matter and he wasn’t hopeful that Lin Yun could survive such an ordeal. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But if Lin Yun managed to come out of this alive, he really wanted to meet the person who killed Wang Ning, managed to practice the Overlord Sword, and snatched away all the five star A-rank missions. At that point, he wouldn’t mind teaching Lin Yun some ‘rules.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s one more thing. Wang Yan came in contact with Chu Haoyu when he came back and it appears that he’s trying to pull Chu Haoyu into the Gentlemen Union. You’re in the Lone-Star Alliance together with Chu Haoyu. Do you know what he thinks?” asked Jiang Feng to change the topic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can’t you guess? Chu Haoyu is even more of a fanatic when it comes to cultivating and he doesn’t like restrictions. Of course he won’t agree. But it’s uncertain for the rest of the top ten. After all, the Wang Clan’s name still holds some weight,” replied Ye Xiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Haoyu had joined the sect for two years. He was nameless during the first year, but he shocked everyone when he challenged the Mortal Ranking. It’s even said that he possesses the strength of an inner disciple. But he didn’t challenge the ranking anymore after he was defeated by Bai Lixuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were rumors that Chu Haoyu wanted to enter the Earth Ranking by trampling on Bai Lixuan. Chu Haoyu was a genuine monster that both Jiang Feng and Ye Xiu were respectful of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Placing down his cup, Jiang Feng fell into deep thought, “According to what I know, Wang Yan has gone to look for Chu Haoyu again and he seems confident in getting Chu Haoyu to join the Gentlemen Union. Wang Yan will definitely try to get back at the Locket Mountain after suffering such a huge humiliation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Somewhere else in the Sword Firmament Pavilion. There was a long-haired youth sitting down while cultivating. His grey clothes were free from dust, but his presence was so small that he was easily neglected. At the very least, he wasn’t as eye-catching as the sword beside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But no disciple would underestimate him. Aside from elders, only monstrous elites of the sect could stay in such a great location.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, there was someone climbing up the mountain. He was quickly discovered when he was a hundred feet away from the grey-clothed youth. The grey-clothed youth’s eyelids trembled and he opened his eyes with a cold flash while drawing his sword. His gaze was sharp, which was a huge contrast to his simple clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother Wang, I already said that I’m not interested in joining the Gentlemen Union. This is the third time you’ve come here. Were my words unclear?” The grey-clothed youth was naturally Chu Haoyu, who was first on the Mortal Ranking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Yan smiled in response. His aura was robust and no one could tell that he had just recovered from grave injuries. Furthermore, he even seemed stronger than before. He looked at Chu Haoyu and said, “I’ve long heard that Junior Brother Chu has strength comparable to those in the Earth Ranking. But I don’t think that’s the limit of your strength.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t like to repeat myself. Senior Brother Wang, please leave.” Chu Haoyu was calm and composed even when facing a famous expert like Wang Yan. There were no fluctuations in his eyes. He didn’t seem to care that Wang Yan was the Wang Clan’s direct descendant and possibly even the next patriarch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his view, Wang Yan was only someone who had joined the sect earlier than him. In fact, he was confident that he could catch up to Wang Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As the saying goes, things shouldn’t be repeated more than three times. You’ve rejected me three times, but I’m here today anyway. Naturally, I have some confidence today.” Wang Yan didn’t seem to be affected by Chu Haoyu’s attitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mhm?” Chu Haoyu raised his brow and smiled, “Then where did you get your confidence from? What, is it because you’re a direct descendant of the Wang Clan? Don’t give me that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Someone gave me a token and said that you wouldn’t refuse me if I showed it to you.” Wang Yan then took out a jade plaque with an exquisite bird engraved on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wang Yan took out the jade plaque, the smile on Chu Haoyu’s face froze. He took the jade plaque and examined it carefully before speaking, “I never expected that Senior Brother Wang was working for ‘that’ young master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young master is a dragon among men, so it’s naturally my honor to be working for him. He values you greatly. This jade plaque belongs to you as long as you nod your head,” Wang Yan smiled. He was satisfied with Chu Haoyu’s response right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Haoyu began to hesitate. He knew what the jade plaque represented. One year ago he fought with a person who was also wearing a similar jade plaque.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I agree.” Chu Haoyu’s hesitation disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Yan rejoiced when Chu Haoyu finally agreed. He was confident in the Alliance-Union Battle now that Chu Haoyu was around. He was really looking forward to seeing the expression on Xin Yan’s face. Suddenly, the Gentlemen Union’s disciples who were waiting outside rushed over in a hurry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Yan’s face became angry as he questioned them, “Can’t you see that I’m talking to Junior Brother Chu right now?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s fine. It’s an official business matter, so let him talk,” replied Chu Haoyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Yan turned to the disciple and said, “Go ahead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the disciple started to hesitate and glanced at Chu Haoyu. Chu Haoyu smiled and responded, “I’ll be taking my leave for the moment then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Brother Chu, you don’t have to consider yourself as an outsider. Junior Brother Chu is now a member of the Gentlemen Union starting from today and he doesn’t have to listen to anyone aside from me. Now speak,” said Wang Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The disciple who came in was surprised before he quickly reported, “Senior Brothers, there's urgent news from our other brothers that Lin Yun was seen outside the Sword Firmament Pavilion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s impossible!” Wang Yan’s face contorted. After all, rumors said that Lin Yun was killed by Bloodbone Wandering Cultivators. How on earth could Lin Yun come back so quickly? Even if Lin Yun managed to survive, he should return only after completing his missions. Wasn’t he concerned with the punishment of returning so early?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nothing is impossible. He nearly lost his life, so why would he dare to carry on with the missions? He will only be able to acknowledge his own incapability after experiencing some ordeals. The A-rank missions aren’t something that anyone could accept as they please,” explained Chu Haoyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right! That must be the case! It’s good that he’s not dead!” Wang Yan’s eyes lit up and he smiled. But instead of being a warm smile, his smile grew colder and colder.</span></p>
