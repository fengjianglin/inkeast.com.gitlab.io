 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Black Lotus Palace had nine passages that led to the second level. All the disciples who made it through the test wanted to find an opportunity in the Black Lotus Palace. But all of them had undoubtedly received a wake-up call.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They could rely on luck on the outside, but they couldn’t do that in the Black Lotus Palace. Only the experts could take the treasures, but the monstrous geniuses suppressed everyone by themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before anyone knew what was going on, they suffered a setback. Multiple geniuses were facing off against each other and the ordinary people couldn’t do anything. There were even those who were implicated from the attacks between the geniuses and actually died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But this was only the beginning. After all, the number of lotus stages would decrease the higher you went. It would gradually decrease from nine to one, so eventually all the monstrous geniuses would gather together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, they would face greater obstructions with each new test. Lin Yun successfully passed through the Lotus Treasure Stage and entered the second level. It didn’t take long for spiritual energy to gather and form an azure lotus. There was a person seated on the lotus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For this level, the figure stood up with two sword rays shooting out from his eyes. One of the rays was real and the other was fake. But being hit by the ray would end in elimination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun had the quasi-xiantian sword intent, so he could naturally sense which was the fake one. The first one was fake and it was just that afterimage of the sword ray behind it made it look real.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun drew his sword and shattered the second ray, successfully getting through the test. But the others weren’t as lucky as him. Some of them failed to differentiate the rays or they differentiated it too late. All of a sudden, a bunch of people appeared in the Extermination Barrens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun, who made it through the second passage, suddenly heard the sound of fighting coming from the distance. He thought of something and dashed forward with the Seven Profound Steps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it was a pity that he was too late. There was blood splattered in the hall, along with a chaotic origin energy fluctuation. The treasure on the lotus stage had already been taken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Looks like I was unlucky.” Lin Yun shook his head and stepped on the lotus stage and headed to the third level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun was unlucky, but Tang Tong’s luck was even worse than being unlucky. He ran into someone he didn’t wish to see on the second level’s lotus stage, the Sevendespair Palace’s Jing Jue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were dozens of people fighting for the treasure. When Jing Jue appeared, he unsheathed his saber and swept his saber around. After he swept through the hall, the momentum fell into his hands. Looking at the ground, there were about ten people lying on the ground, covered in blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Tong also had three wounds on his chest. Jing Jue looked at him and smiled, “What a coincidence. Are you going by yourself or do you need me to send you off?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Tong glanced at everyone else who was lying on the ground before he crushed his jade slip and disappeared. “I’ll leave by myself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had nothing to say since he had lost. But his eyes fluctuated with reluctance. When he crushed the jade slip, the world suddenly spiraled and he quickly disappeared. When he reopened his eyes, he was standing in the Extermination Barrens’ teleportation array. Many elders from the various sects were standing around it to wait for their disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Brother Tang.” Someone called out to him. When Tang Tong raised his head, he saw Luo Feng and Xin Jue coming over. They both asked anxiously, “How’s the situation?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I ran into the Sevendespair Palace’s Jing Jue on the second level and was forced to crush my jade slip,” replied Tang Tong helplessly. If he didn’t run into Jing Jue, he might have been able to stay longer in the Black Lotus Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s good that you’re alright. What about the others?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I was with everyone else before we entered the Black Lotus Palace, but we split up as soon as we went in. So I’m not too sure about their exact situation.” Tang Tong’s words gave relief to Luo Feng and Xin Jue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They both wore a smile on their faces because entering the Black Lotus Palace meant having an added layer of security. The disciples could crush the jade slip and leave if they ran into danger. After all, the Demonlotus Realm would end in a few days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? My Blackgold Sect’s disciples are all dead?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All ten core disciples died?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three raised their heads and saw a grey-robed elderly man with despair on his face. When Tang Tong, Luo Feng, and Xin Jue heard him, they let out a sigh. The Demonlotus Realm was brutal and it had a high death rate. Even total annihilation was normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The strong prey on the weak. Why the hell are you wailing…” Wen Yanbo said with ridicule on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In total, the four major sects had six disciples who were eliminated during the second level, but there were none from the Primal Origin Sect. The Primal Origin Sect sent three core disciples this time, so at the very least, they could reach the fifth level if they ran into each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The face of the elder from the Blackgold Sect was filled with rage. However, he knew that his sect couldn’t compare to the Primal Origin Sect. The loss they suffered today meant that they would have an even more miserable future. So he didn’t dare to utter a single word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wen Yanbo sneered and his gaze turned cold when he looked at Luo Feng. He heard Tang Tong’s words that Lin Yun was still in the Black Lotus Palace. This meant that the three core disciples from his sect might run into Lin Yun in the palace. All he had to do was wait for good news.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That old thing.” Luo Feng’s face had unhappiness as he looked at Tang Tong, “Tang Tong, how was Lin Yun’s performance in the Demonlotus Realm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Tong pondered for a bit because he didn’t know how to describe it. After all, he knew that no one would believe his words. After a brief moment later, he smiled, “There’s no need to worry about him. Let him tell you about it personally after he comes out. Junior Brother might have a fortuitous encounter in the Black Lotus Palace. So I don’t dare to come up with a conclusion so easily.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Feng was briefly stunned. He could tell from Tang Tong’s words that Lin Yun must have had an encounter in the Demonlotus Realm. He smiled, “Okay. I’ll wait for him then. I’ll look at his improvements after he comes out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tsk, tsk. That depends on him coming out alive.” A weird voice sounded out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Jue frowned his brows and spoke coldly, “Wen Yanbo, watch your words. Wasn’t the previous lesson enough for you? You want to suffer another palm from Elder Luo Feng?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you even qualified to talk to me?” Wen Yanbo’s chest began to ache the moment Xin Jue mentioned it. Not only did he fail to ambush Lin Yun, but he even lost an elder in the Violet Palace Realm. There was simply no respect for him when Xin Jue publicly mentioned his failure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not qualified to talk to you? Hmph, my sword naturally has the qualification.” Xin Jue suddenly took a step forward and faced the Primal Origin Sect’s elders. This made Wen Yanbo shocked because he never expected that Xin Jue would really dare to step forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wen Yanbo, do you think that my Sword Firmament Pavilion is a pushover like the Blackgold Sect? You should be lucky that we’re not slapping your face. Do you dare to come at us?” Luo Feng stepped forward too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wen Yanbo noticed the peculiar gazes from the elders in the surroundings, he knew that it wasn’t the time to start a conflict with the Sword Firmament Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can’t be bothered to talk to you. Let’s see if your previous Lin Yun makes it out alive!”Wen Yanbo quickly left with the Primal Origin Sect’s elders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Interesting. The enmity between the two sects are rather deep.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They’ll fight sooner or later in the Extermination Barrens.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tsk, tsk. But looking at Wen Yanbo’s reaction, it seems that he suffered quite a bit of loss not too long ago.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe. It’s best if they fight more fiercely.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The various sects’ elders were anxiously waiting for any news of their disciples, hoping that their disciples could win glory for their sects. Naturally, they weren’t bothered by the Primal Origin Sect and Sword Firmament Pavilion’s conflict. The grudges between the two sects ran deep, so it would be abnormal if there was no conflict.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, Lin Yun had just passed through the fourth level smoothly. He finally ran into trouble when he arrived at the fifth level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stab me and you win,” said the figure on the azure lotus as he left the lotus for the first time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun raised his brow and drew his sword the moment the figure moved. He stabbed his sword three times, but failed every time. He suffered a cut on his arm instead. But it was fortunate that he dodged quickly or the sword would have gotten his face instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun looked at the figure. The figure was also dressed in white, but there was a layer of mist on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What swift speed!” Lin Yun’s heart throbbed violently when he recalled the sword from earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stab me and you win.” The figure spoke out once more and charged towards Lin Yun. His sword bolted forward like lightning that constantly pushed Lin Yun backwards. He was clearly right in front of Lin Yun, but Lin Yun couldn’t catch the figure. After ten-odd moves, Lin Yun took a strike on his chest and was blown away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stab me and you win.” The white-clothed man pointed his sword at Lin Yun, who was kneeling on the ground, and repeated the words again.</span></p>
