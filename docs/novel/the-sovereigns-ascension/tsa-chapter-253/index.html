 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The five sword gleams sent Xia Tengfei flying and pinned him on the wall before he fell after three breaths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Condensing aura into a sword!” Everyone finally recovered from the shock and looked at Lin Yun with shock. They were like Gao Yangyu. They couldn’t figure out how Lin Yun managed to condense his aura into a sword when he was only in the third stage of the Profound Martial Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, even a spiritual martial technique required the cultivator to be in the sixth stage of the Profound Martial Realm to condense aura into a sword. ButLin Yun was doing exactly that right now. Everyone thought that they could easily trample Lin Yun and that he would be the first eliminated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another huge thump sounded out and the wall shattered due to the sword energy, reducing the entire wall into dust. However, the sword intent continued to buzz and lingered in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What terrifying sword intent! Xia Tengfei was directly pierced. He must be dead, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s not dead, but he’s definitely crippled. This Lin Yun is really ruthless.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“At least I didn’t offend him. He dared to cripple Xia Tengfei. If we were the ones who went up, we would definitely be dead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The remaining disciples on the stage felt fearful. Lin Lan from the Heavenly Qin Institute gulped down a mouthful of saliva when he saw this scene. He knew that there was no way he could defeat Lin Yun, who could defeat Xia Tengfei in a few moves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lin Yun saw that Xia Tengfei could no longer get up, he turned to look at Lin Lan. He never forgot this person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Lin Lan suddenly sneered and spread his arms out, “You can wait for the next lifetime to hurt me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one imagined that Lin Lan would leave the stage directly, giving up on the mission. All Lin Yun did was glance at him to intimidate him into leaving the stage. Lin Lan didn’t want to be pinned to the wall like Xia Tengfei. That was a greater humiliation than dying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You think you can leave?” Lin Yun suddenly poured his origin energy into his arms, seeing that Lin Lan was about to leave the stage. In an instant, his two arms became heavy, filled with origin energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pouring his origin energy into his arms, he executed the Seven Profound Steps–Golden Crow Wings. Lin Yun took a step out and left behind seven afterimages. Each afterimage threw out a punch that overlapped and slammed against Lin Lan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aquamist Art!” Lin Lan’s face changed drastically and his azure origin energy spread out like mist. When the seven punches bombarded the cloud of mist, the power was greatly reduced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the punches landed on Lin Lan’s body, he was only blown away and not heavily injured. Lin Lan patted his interspatial pouch and retrieved his spear, planting it into the ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re too much! I’ll kill you…” roared Lin Lan as he charged at Lin Yun with the Berserk Python Spear. In Lin Lan’s hand, the spear stabbed out like a poisonous python.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spear streaked across the stage and the sheer force behind the stab left cracks on the ground that raised a violent gale aimed at Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spear was domineering and couldn’t be avoided. Even Lin Yun wouldn’t have an advantage facing this attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Lin Clan’s Berserk Python Spear with the Aquamist Art is truly extraordinary!” Everyone on the stage had a trace of fear flash through their eyes. They knew how terrifying this attack was and they immediately distanced themselves in case they got dragged in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shadowless!” roared Lin Yun and he pushed the Seven Profound Steps to the limit. In the critical moment, he avoided the spear just before he was hit. In the blink of an eye, he appeared above Lin Lan like a blazing sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was like a sun hanging high in the sky. He threw a punch down, causing Lin Lan’s face to drastically change. Lin Lan immediately pulled back his spear to defend himself, pushing the Aquamist Art to the limits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun’s fist bolted out like a sword and Lin Lan was forced to retreat. Every step he took back would cause the ground to explode and blood to leak out from the corner of his lips. After seven steps backwards, he was blown away and spit up a mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun landed on the ground. Then, he tapped the ground with his foot and soared into the air like a dragon. He was executing the Dragon-Tiger Fist–Dragon Brandishing Tail. He created a violet streak in the air and his foot slammed against Lin Lan’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several teeth flew out of Lin Lan’s mouth as he was sent flying once again. He was like a sandbag as he fell on top of Xia Tengfei. Letting out a long breath, Lin Yun retracted his fist and landed on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Seven Profound Steps and Dragon-Tiger Fist exhausted a great deal of his origin energy. It was fortunate that he practiced the Iris Sword Sutra to the seventh stage because it could support his exhaustion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Lan and Xia Tengfei had both overestimated themselves. Lin Yun might only be in the third stage of the Profound Martial Realm, but his origin energy wasn’t any weaker than those in the fourth stage because of the age energy refinement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t even need to draw his sword to deal with those two. When he looked around the stage, he noticed that everyone was looking at him in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He defeated two elites from the four great sects without even drawing his sword!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s Xia Tengfei and Lin Lan we’re talking about! Even fifth stage elites like us are nothing compared to the two of them!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since when did the Sword Firmament Pavilion have such a monster? Won’t he be even more terrifying when his cultivation goes up?” The other disciples from the Primal Origin Sect and Heavenly Qin Institute looked at Lin Yun with fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Still not leaving?” Lin Yun glanced at them. Xia Tengfei and Lin Lan were both dealt with, so there was naturally no reason for these people to remain. Otherwise, who knows what would happen when they went to the Bloodbone Forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You want us to leave? Based on what?” The disciples of the Primal Origin Sect and Heavenly Profound Sect gnashed their teeth furiously with indignance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph!” Lin Yun snorted coldly and raised his hand to use the Flying Dragon, Leaping Tiger. The one who spoke immediately bled from his seven orifices and was sent flying away. This scene left the remaining few startled and their faces turned pale. They no longer dared to speak and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Profound Sect’s Bu Chen and Demonic Moon Villa’s Xiao Ran exchanged a glance. They could see the shock in each other’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bu Chen, how’s his Dragon-Tiger Fist compared to yours?” Xiao Ran asked after looking at Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stronger… This fellow’s Dragon-Tiger Fist is orthodox. I have no idea where he got the complete manual of the Dragon-Tiger Fist from. Unbelievable!” Bu Chen replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gao Yangyu felt bitter in his heart. He immediately ordered someone to treat Xia Tengfei and Lin Lan’s injuries. He then turned to look at Lin Yun with awkwardness on his face. He had now offended all three elites from the four great sects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Tengfei and Lin Lan were crippled under his watch, so he would definitely be in trouble. At the same time, he missed such a monstrous genius and even ridiculed him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go. The candidates are already out.” The lady smiled and went on the stage with Gao Yangyu. As of this moment, there were only eight people left on the stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Gao Yangyu recalled how he treated Lin Yun previously, his face froze. He braced himself and followed behind the young lady. The gentle lady smiled, “Young Master Lin, you’re still as domineering as before. You have me filled with admiration.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun swept a glance at the young lady and was stunned.</span></p>
