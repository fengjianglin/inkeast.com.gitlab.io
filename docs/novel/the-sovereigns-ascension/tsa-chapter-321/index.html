 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The one who attacked was in the sixth stage of the Profound Martial Realm. He was one stage above Lin Yun. As the wind blew, purple rays shot out from his body. He stomped his foot on the ground and left a few large cracks on the ground. When he attacked with his palm, his palm split the air and tore the air apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with cold light. He faced the attack head-on and the aura around him suddenly changed from indifferent to sharp. Waves of his aura from the Dragon-Tiger Might gushed out from his body like a volcano. He was like an ancient beast once he started accumulating his strength into his fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Pitiful tricks!” Lin Yun threw his punch out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What cultivation technique is Lin Yun practicing?” With a huge clash, the attacker was sent flying, leaving the surrounding disciples shocked. The attacker was in the sixth stage of the Profound Martial Realm and his cultivation was higher than Lin Yun by one stage. The Profound Martial Realm had ten stages and every stage would strengthen a cultivator’s power several times. Especially after the fifth stage, the difference in every stage was great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But not only did Lin Yun manage to take the palm, he even sent the attacker flying away. The face of the one who attacked looked ashamed as rage built up in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let me handle it!” The playful expression on Fu Lingtian’s face disappeared. It was replaced with a cold grim look as he attacked Lin Yun. His aura swept out when he stepped forward. He was in the pinnacle sixth stage of the Profound Martial Realm and he was half a step away from the seventh stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I once told you that the Sword Firmament Pavilion wasn’t the ruler of the Great Qin Empire. I don’t mind repeating it to you. No matter how brightly you shine in the Sword Firmament Pavilion, offending the Gentlemen Union will only result in death sooner or later!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fu Lingtian’s attack was aimed at Lin Yun’s head. In the past, Lin Yun did not understand what Fu Lingtian’s words meant. But after he got to know about the Azure Association from Guardian Plum, he knew that the crown prince was behind the Gentlemen Union.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These people wouldn’t dare to kill him in the Sword Firmament Pavilion. At best, they would only teach him a lesson. After all, there weren’t many people that they didn’t dare to offend. In the blink of an eye, Lin Yun executed the Seven Profound Steps and easily avoided Fu Lingtian’s attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You think that you can avoid this?” Fu Lingtian laughed. His palm changed into claws as he tried to grab Lin Yun’s throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun raised his hand and performed the Dragon Painting, unleashing a roar as he punched the &nbsp;claw. When the punch and claw collided, an explosion like rumbling lightning sounded out. Fu Lingtian was surprised when he saw that Lin Yun was still standing there firmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Firmament Sword!” Fu Lingtian joined his two fingers together to form a sword and tried to stab Lin Yun’s chest. Fu Lingtian’s aura erupted like a volcano as he stabbed at Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people’s faces changed when he saw this scene. The Firmament Sword was one of the forbidden techniques in the Sword Firmament Pavilion. Fu Lingtian truly deserves to be an inner disciple. His attainment in the forbidden technique wasn’t low.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His first attack was directed at Lin Yun’s head, his second attack was at Lin Yun’s throat, and his third attack was directed at Lin Yun’s chest. His attacks were fatal and they would cause heavy injuries if they struck Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Lin Yun faced the attacks calmly. Two rays burst from his eyes and a golden dragon manifested when his fingers moved. When he clenched his fist together, the dragon roared. Torrential energy poured out when he threw his punch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the two attacks collided, the ground cracked and the rocks flew around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fu Lingtian’s eyes widened with shock. He could sense the origin energy in his fingers sinking into a swamp, negated by Lin Yun’s punch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But just when Fu Lingtian was about to step back, the energy behind Lin Yun’s punch surged forward once more. This time, blood oozed out of Fu Lingtian’s lips as he took a few steps back. When he landed on the ground again, his face was black.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll kill you!” Fu Lingtian flew into a rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother, we’ll help out!” Two figures among the Eight Vajra dashed towards Lin Yun from the left and right, sandwiching him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mountainbreaker Fist!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bloodwolf Rage!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cloudshattering Palm!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three attacks arrived at the same time as five other people watched by the side with murderous aura brewing in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even after Lin Yun sent Fu Lingtian flying with a punch, it didn’t change the situation. On the contrary, it made the situation worse. If the three attacks connected, they would tear Lin Yun into pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Great timing!” Lin Yun stood his ground with a dragon and a tiger manifesting in each of his fists. The forty-seven petals of the Iris Flower bloomed in his Dantian. Just when the three attacks were about to reach him, Lin Yun slammed his fists together, producing a lightning rumble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A dragon mountain and a tiger mountain manifested before merging together into a colossal mountain that shrouded Lin Yun. It was the Hidden Dragon, Crouching Tiger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wind started to gather from the surrounding as the three attacks landed on Lin Yun. However, Lin Yun stood his ground firmly, unfazed by the attacks. Before the three of them could step down, Lin Yun’s aura exploded. His eyes glowed brightly as a colossal tiger manifested behind him with its eyes closed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lin Yun threw his punch out, the tiger suddenly opened its eyes, unleashing the aura of a king. This punch contained the prestige of a king and Lin Yun poured his sword intent, origin energy, and physical energy into it. It might seem like a simple fist, but it was domineering with the might of a hundred beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three attackers were sent flying as they threw up blood. When they landed on the ground, their eyes radiated with fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Lin Yun stopped his attack and faintly released his aura. He looked around, and his gaze intimidated everyone he looked at.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How is this possible…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Holy shit! Lin Yun just joined the inner sect and yet he’s already so powerful!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is too unbelievable! The Eight Vajra are ranked in the top two hundreds and they’re not someone the disciples in the Alliance-Union Battle can be compared to!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Monster, he’s simply a monster! His strength improved again!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He probably benefited a lot from being the final winner of the Alliance-Union Battle.” No one had expected that the Eight Vajra would actually lose to Lin Yun. This made those who were worried for Lin Yun feel relieved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t difficult for Lin Yun to leave, but it would be troublesome if the Eight Vajra ganged up on Lin Yun. When they looked at Lin Yun, he still looked the same as before, without any changes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the surrounding disciples pointing their fingers, Fu Lingtian’s face became unsightly. He felt humiliated. He had no idea how Lin Yun cultivated. Lin Yun only joined the sect for six months, yet he had already surpassed them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fu Lingtian then made up his mind that he couldn’t allow Lin Yun to leave today no matter what. Otherwise, the Eight Vajra’s reputation would be ruined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Yun, you’re shameless!” Fu Lingtian’s sudden roar startled everyone. He continued, “We restrained our strength seeing that you’ve just been promoted to an inner disciple. We’ve barely used 30% of our strength, but you were so ruthless with your attacks. What are you trying to do here? Do you not have the Sect’s rules in your eyes? Are there any Sword-Bearing Elders around? If we weren’t strong enough, wouldn’t we be killed by you?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His voice left everyone in the surrounding shocked. They didn’t know what to say about Fu Lingtian’s shamelessness. After all, they had never seen someone as shameless as Fu Lingtian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Lin Yun kept his silence and didn’t utter a single word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kneel down and apologize. Otherwise, don’t blame us for teaching you how to behave today,” demanded Fu Lingtian</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kneel down!” The Eight Vajra roared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a playful gaze, Lin Yun replied, “I wonder how you guys are going to teach me to behave?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fu Lingtian drew out his sword. It was clearly a transcendent grade profound artifact. The remaining seven also drew their swords as they separated themselves to surround Lin Yun. The eight swords were all transcendent grade profound artifacts, so the fluctuation coming from the spiritual runes was horrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fu Lingtian grinned. Even if Lin Yun had ten times the guts, there was no way he would dare to face the eight of them altogether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But did Lin Yun really not have the guts? Lin Yun waved his hand and took out the Scarletflame War Flag from his interspatial pouch. He waved the flag in his hand and it transformed into the close-combat mode. The dual moon scythes at the tip of the flag looked terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You want to teach me how to behave?” Lin Yun snorted and slammed the blade into the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Eight Vajra’s faces changed when they saw this scene. Their legs started to tremble as fear rose in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then let me see how you are going to teach me to behave!” Lin Yun swung the Scarletflame War Flag at the eight of them.</span></p>
