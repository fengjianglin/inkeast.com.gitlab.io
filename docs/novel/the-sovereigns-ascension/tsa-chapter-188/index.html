 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Wuyou was heavily injured, the Dragon Blooded Horse could no longer get on its feet, and ten Profound Martial Realms were guarding the rear. Lin Yun was forced into a dead-end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thousands of eyes were indifferently gazed from afar. Even if Lin Yun was stubborn and refused to admit defeat, this situation made him despair. Ignoring Leng Mo’s bark, Lin Yun turned around and walked towards the Dragon Blooded Horse. The horse trembled from the pain of having a spear plunged into its body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bear with it.” Lin Yun patted the Dragon Blooded Horse and grabbed onto the spear. Blood splattered when he pulled the spear out, drawing a huge wail from the horse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Ning turned to look at Leng Mo beside him. Knowing what Wang Ning wanted, Leng Mo nodded with a sinister smile and retrieved another spear from his interspatial ring. This spear was thrown towards Lin Yun. If Lin Yun avoided this attack, the spear would head towards the Dragon Blooded Horse once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun, who was dealing with the Dragon Blooded Horse’s wound, didn’t even need to turn around to hear the sound of the spear tearing through the air. He took his time dealing with the Dragon Blooded Horse’s wound before he stood up and turned around. Tilting his body slightly, the spear avoided his vital spot, stabbing into his spear instead. Thanks to the Thunderblitz Battle Physique, this spear did not cause him any critical injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the massive force behind the spear had caused him to drop to his knees. Wang Ning spoke out from his horse, “Lin Yun, no one will save garbage like you who can’t even summon his Martial Soul. I’ll give you two choices. Beg for mercy or die. I’m willing to let you live if you’re willing to become my sword slave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahahaha!” Lin Yun began to laugh madly with a face that was covered in blood. He glanced at the strand of hair tied around his finger and sighed. The smile gradually faded from his lips, “I can’t beat ten Profound Martial Realms. If I lose, I lose. I might be young, but I’m not someone who fears death. Come and fight if you want to kill me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun was betting his life on this battle. He was given a chance at living, but if he took it, he would be at Wang Ning’s mercy. He knew that he couldn’t fight the ten Profound Martial Realms, but it was impossible to make him beg for mercy. Regardless of how reluctant he was, he had to be worthy of the sword in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Count me in. At least if we die, we will have a companion by our side.” Li Wuyou coughed and tried to get up. He wiped his face and placed his hand on Lin Yun’s shoulder before he started laughing. The two of them had utterly disregarded Wang Ning’s threat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Ning’s face turned dark from their attitudes. He snappily yelled, “Still so stubborn even when facing death. If that’s what you want, then so be it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kill them!” Leng Mo dismounted the horse and charged over with a dozen Xiantian Realm cultivators. But right at this moment, the Dragon Blooded Horse unleashed a terrifying aura. Its coat ignited in raging flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Profound Martial Realm!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Holy shit! The horse managed to make a breakthrough under the pressure of such dire straits.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one had expected the Dragon Blooded Horse, who was lying on the ground, to make such a transformation. It neighed and charged at Leng Mo, creating a dust cloud behind it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leng Mo was caught entirely off guard and was stabbed by the Dragon Blooded Horse’s horn. He was blown away and his organs were ground into pieces. If he wasn’t in the Profound Martial Realm, he would’ve died immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun’s eyes lit up at this scene and he leapt into the sky, smacking the ancient sword box at Wang Ning’s face. The thirty-four petals of the Iris Flower bloomed and started pouring into the sword box. The sword box felt like a mountain made of sword intent instead in Lin Yun’s hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Ning was frightened out of his wits and he immediately abandoned his horse. He dropped to the ground and started rolling around, disregarding his image. As a result, the sword box smashed into Wang Ning’s horse, turning it into a mush of meat. But at the same time, Wang Ning was blown away by the force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the ten Profound Martial Realms saw this scene, they were stunned. Han Mo and Han Feng finally reacted and immediately stepped in to protect Wang Ning. As for the rest, they unleashed their auras. They all knew what kind of trouble they would get into if Lin Yun managed to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a bunch of garbage. Why are you guys still standing here?! Stop him!” Wang Ning immediately started cursing out at the Xiantian Realm cultivators who had shrank back. As a result, the dozen Xiantian Realm newcomers bit the bullet and charged at Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Patting the Ancient Sword Box gently, the Flower Burial Sword flew out from the box. Looking at the ones that were charging at him, Lin Yun grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword and started infusing his sword intent. He waited for them to be ten steps within his range before he pulled the sword out of its sheath, unleashing his incomplete sword intent at his enemies. Before the dozen Xiantian Realm cultivators could even react, they were blown away and covered in wounds. They could no longer get on their feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big brother, hop on!” Li Wuyou took advantage of the chaos and climbed onto the Dragon Blooded Horse. After breaking through the encirclement, he immediately headed towards Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Grabbing the sword box casually, Lin Yun returned his sword to its sheath and jumped onto the horse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh no, you don’t!” The strongest among the ten Profound Martial Realms, Huangfu Jingxuan, charged over. He only needed to stop Lin Yun for a moment so the others could arrive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How stubborn!” Lin Yun truly hated this person. If it weren’t for Huangfu Jingxuan, he wouldn’t be forced into such a desperate situation. And now that he had a glimmer of hope, Huangfu Jingxuan came chasing after him again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun immediately fused the sword gleam from his Martial Soul, the broken sword, into his fingertips. He unleashed the Divine Flicking Finger—Flashing Aura, Flicking Fingers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sword gleam wasn’t made of spiritual energy, but from the broken sword inside of him. So it had brought the Divine Flicking Finger’s power to a whole new level. When Huangfu Jingxuan saw the sword flash, his face changed drastically and he immediately dodged. But even though he had tried his best to avoid it, his right shoulder was still pierced by the sword flash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huangfu Jingxuan, I will settle this with you sooner or later!” Lin Yun’s face was terrifyingly pale after using his last trump card.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I can’t let him go!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Huangfu Fengxun furrowed his brows. Ignoring the injury on his shoulder, he commanded in a deep voice, “Chase after him! The Dragon Blooded Horse is injured, so it won’t be able to run far!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the Profound Martial Realms immediately grabbed a horse. With gloomy expressions, they chased after Lin Yun. They followed the bloodstains left behind by the Dragon Blooded Horse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These bastards!” Li Wuyou glanced at their rear and gnashed his teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun turned to look at him. Li Wuyou’s face was so pale that he didn’t seem like a living person anymore. He knew that if Li Wuyou’s injuries weren’t treated in time, he would die. However, with the pursuers chasing closely behind, there wasn’t any opportunity for them to take a break to recover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the Dragon Blooded Horse’s initial outburst gradually came to an end, it started to feel exhausted. After all, it was still injured from Leng Mo’s spear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Over there!” A green bamboo wood suddenly came into Lin Yun’s view. The bamboo was nearly a hundred meters in height. The woods were shrouded by a fog and looked extremely peculiar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s the Sword Burial Woods!” Huangfu Jingxuan and the others immediately came to a stop as their facial expressions drastically changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don't they know about the Sword Burial Woods?” Mo Qingyun looked at the woods in fear. The Firmament Realm was massive and there were many forbidden grounds. They were marked as forbidden grounds for a reason. Anyone who stepped foot in there would definitely die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sword Burial Woods was one such forbidden ground. Many people had gone inside by mistake, but not a single one of them came out alive. This was how the infamous reputation of the Sword Burial Woods had come to be. The elders responsible for supervising the test had warned them over and over again not to enter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where are they?” Wang Ning and Leng Mo rushed over without much rest. The two of them suffered pretty serious injuries, but they still bit the bullet and rushed over. If Lin Yun wasn’t dead, the two of them wouldn’t feel at ease. No one responded to Wang Ning’s question as they silently opened a path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Sword Burial Woods!” Wang Ning’s face changed drastically when he took a look at what was up ahead. He immediately commanded the horse to move backwards. Before he entered the Firmament Realm, his elder brother had told him that the Sword Burial Woods was extremely dangerous. Many Profound Martial Realm elders and disciples lost their lives there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They’re definitely dead after entering the Sword Burial Woods. There’s no need for you to worry about them anymore,” said Leng Mo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wang Ning felt uncertain. This outcome was certainly not what he wanted. He couldn’t feel at ease unless Lin Yun died in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s someone who survived the Yin Wind Stream…” The gloom between Wang Ning’s brows lingered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Huangfu Jingxuan smiled, “Second young master, there’s nothing to worry about. The Sword Burial Woods is famous for its danger. Even experts in the Violet Palace Realm die there, not to mention a Xiantian Realm piece of garbage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Furthermore, even if he doesn’t die, he definitely won’t be able to complete the test. If he doesn’t become a disciple of the Sword Firmament Pavilion, how difficult will it be for the Wang Clan to kill him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Listening to what Huangfu Jingxuan said, Wang Ning’s face gradually improved. He sneered, “Even if he survives, there’s nothing I have to be afraid of. He just can’t become a Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciple.”</span></p>
