 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun’s declaration shocked the disciples in the surrounding. Everyone knew that the Sword Firmament Pavilion requested their disciples to be like their swords, to break rather than bow. But they were shocked that this youth could make such a declaration even when he was facing the elders. Not only the disciples, but even the elders standing behind Bai Ting were shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Bai, let’s wait for Guardian Plum to arrive before making a decision.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’re still unsure of the cause. It’s improper to kill Lin Yun before we find out about the case.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Yun has violated the rules, but we should do an investigation. After all, wouldn’t the truth be hidden if we kill him before we even conduct an investigation?” Several elders spoke out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whosoever kills must be killed. That was the sect’s rules, but Lin Yun wasn’t the same as an ordinary disciple. Guardian Plum had placed a great importance on Lin Yun. Not to mention that Lin Yun’s growth in the Demonlotus Realm was simply monstrous. In no way was he just an ordinary disciple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Speaking of which, this was a hot potato. If they allowed Bai Ting to kill Lin Yun, none of them would be able to escape when Guardian Plum handed down punishment. If it was another disciple who dared to rebuke an elder without any signs of repentance, that disciple would’ve already been killed by them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Lin Yun was a special case. But there was something else that they didn’t reveal. Wang Yan was Bai Ting’s disciple, so Bai Ting already had an enmity with Lin Yun. This was the real reason why Bai Ting wanted to kill Lin Yun right now. However, the other elders weren’t related to Wang Yan, so they did not wish to be involved in this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Ting wore a grave expression, but he suddenly smiled eerily, “You guys think that he only killed Wang Yan? No. He killed eight more from the Gentlemen Union, no one can excuse his sins!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words made all the elders’ faces change. None of them could believe it because no one had ever tried to kill someone in the Sword Firmament Pavilion. Not only did Lin Yun kill someone, he killed a total of nine disciples…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Yun, am I right? You still dare to say that you don’t regret your kills?” Bai Ting barked at Lin Yun while looking at him coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why would I deny it since I did it? But you can dream on if you want me to beg you for mercy. Who the hell do you think you are? You’re just Wang Yan’s lackey. I even dared to kill your owner, so do you think that I’ll be afraid of you?” Lin Yun pointed at Bai Ting, but he didn’t draw his sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he was strong enough, he wouldn’t mind slaying this old goat as well. This old goat had tried to kill him several times since he joined the sect. Bai Ting was only an elder in the Violet Palace Realm. He must be dreaming if he thought that he could make Lin Yun kneel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When all the disciples in the surroundings heard Lin Yun calling Bai Ting a lackey of Wang Yan, they wore expressions of mockery. Everyone knew that Bai Ting was the reason why Wang Yan could act so arrogantly in the sect. If it wasn’t for Bai Ting’s support, there was no way Wang Yan would dare to act so rampantly. So Lin Yun wasn’t exactly wrong when he called Bai Ting a lackey of Wang Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Ting’s face instantly turned dark and he barked, “It looks like there’s no need for me to wait for further instructions. Just based on the fact that you killed nine people and you dared to insult an elder, I can kill you right now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Ting soared into the sky and sent a palm at Lin Yun before he even finished his words. The power of his palm instantly caused the plaza to tremble. This was the power of the Violet Palace Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Ting’s face was sinister. His hatred for Lin Yun was so deep that it was engraved in his bones.This was a perfect opportunity for him to get rid of Lin Yun. But he planned to toy around with Lin Yun before killing him. He wanted Lin Yun to know the consequence of going against him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His palm caused the faces of many in the surroundings to change. Bai Ting was a genuine cultivator in the Violet Palace Realm and he had been in that realm for many years. This was also the reason why he had such a revered position in the Elders Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blink of an eye, the palm descended onto Lin Yun. Although Lin Yun tried to retaliate, the difference between them was too huge. The moment he made contact with Bai Ting’s attack, he threw up a mouthful of blood and was sent flying. His face was pale when he landed on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You don’t regret your killings? Then let me see what capability you have!” Bai Ting laughed as he appeared before Lin Yun once more. He pushed out another palm, which shattered Lin Yun’s Dracophant War Armor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the armor shattered, Lin Yun took another three steps back, throwing up a mouthful of blood with each step. Lin Yun wouldn’t be in such a terrible state if he was facing an ordinary Violet Palace Realm, but who knows how long Bai Ting had been in the Violet Palace Realm. His cultivation was strong and far surpassed Lin Yun’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kneel!” Bai Ting wore a sinister smile as his face turned even darker. His third palm descended and caused the ground beneath Lin Yun to crack. Lin Yun was under great pain even with the Dracophant Battle Physique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re still not kneeling? Sword slave, you’re pretty stubborn.” Bai Ting looked at Lin Yun, who was trying to get up on his feet, with even more rage. He strode forward and raised his leg. He wanted to shatter Lin Yun’s knees.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with a cold light. Just when Bai Ting raised his leg, Lin Yun tapped his interspatial pouch and retrieved the Scarletflame War Flag. He instantly willed it to transform into the close-combat mode and stabbed it at Bai Ting’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had no choice other than getting Bai Ting to lower his guard if he wanted to deal a heavy injury to his enemy. This was the reason why Lin Yun took three attacks from Bai Ting. He was actually waiting for this opportunity. Bai Ting was too full of himself, so Lin Yun wanted to use the Scarletflame War Flag to catch him by surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the flag fluttered in the wind, it emitted a powerful glow because Lin Yun poured his origin energy into it. Bai Ting’s face quickly changed and he immediately retreated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You think you can escape?” Lin Yun poured his origin energy into the cosmic artifact frantically before swinging the Scarletflame War Flag like a dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Scarletflame War Flag destroyed everything within its path and the origin energy protecting Bai Ting’s body shattered in an instant. Simultaneously, the flag also stabbed into his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But when Lin Yun wanted to pull the flag out, Bai Ting suddenly grabbed onto the tip of the flag tightly. Lin Yun raised his brow. He circulated his origin energy and swung the flag to break free from Bai Ting’s grip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under a loud wail, the Scarletflame War Flag stabbed into Bai Ting’s chest once more. This time, Bai Ting was sent flying away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’LL KILL YOU!” Bai Ting pulled out the Scarletflame War Flag when he landed on the ground and charged at Lin Yun. This scene left everyone shocked. No one had expected that Bai Ting would suffer such a huge loss in Lin Yun’s hand. This was practically a stain on his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Ting no longer held back at this moment. His hair fluttered in the wind, his face was distorted, and his eyes were painted with deep hatred as he charged over. His aura was like a sweeping tsunami. Under his aura, the youth before him looked so tiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But even under his pressure, that youth still remained firm and continued to stand upright. He would rather die than to cower. The Iris Flower in his dantian revolved one complete cycle with great difficulty. At the same time, an illusory Iris Flower appeared beneath Lin Yun’s foot that emitted a dazzling glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As his hair fluttered in the wind, Lin Yun pushed his palm out. A terrifying shockwave swept out from his palm. The plaza exploded and countless trees in the surroundings were instantly reduced to ashes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Ting’s lips twitched when he saw this scene.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is Lin Yun going to commit suicide with me?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;He instantly changed his mind in facing the attack head-on.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun was like a flower. A flower might have a short lifespan, only shining briefly like a meteor, but it was still a representation of his passion. Lin Yun gave Bai Ting no chance to escape and sent his palm forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Ting gathered his origin energy to protect himself since his life was on the line. But the layers of defenses he created with his origin energy were ultimately shattered and Lin Yun’s palm landed on his body. “No…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Ting threw up a mouthful of blood and flew out like a cannonball, slamming and shattering the rocks in his way. When he fell to the ground, he constantly coughed and he could feel that there were cracks in his internal organs. This scene left the other elders shocked as they examined Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dazzling Moment had instantly drained all his origin energy, leaving him with no paths of retreat. But Lin Yun did not hesitate to use it because he would rather die than to be humiliated. Anyone who tried to humiliate him would have to pay the price. Not even an elder was exempt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Ting struggled to get on his feet and took in a cold breath when he looked at the youth before him. He could feel a chill run down his spine as he sensed his heavy injuries.</span></p>

He no longer dared to attack Lin Yun personally. He was giving his order to his subordinates, but the elders present all wore conflicting expressions.</span></p>

No one can save him. Why aren’t any of you making a move? Can it be that all of you are his accomplices?!” Bai Ting barked when he saw that no one moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want to see who dares to make a move!” While the elders hesitated under Bai Ting’s threat, Luo Feng rushed over along with another group of elders.</span></p>
