 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two months ago, Lin Yun clashed with the top ten on the Mortal Ranking. He wouldn’t have been able to get away so easily if Xin Yan hadn’t arrived with the Locket Mountain. Those who were offended could get revenge by killing him in the Alliance-Union Battle. After all, deaths were unavoidable and there was no punishment for this. The Alliance-Union Battles were a brutal tradition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun gave the top ten on the Mortal Ranking a slap on the face back at the Contribution Hall when the Phoenix Plum rang. It was extremely humiliating for the top ten since they had enjoyed a high status in the outer sect for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone knew that the grudge for this matter would be resolved in the Alliance-Union Battle. SInce then, the Sword Firmament Pavilion had been quietly brewing in anticipation of this storm. Currently, many disciples were heading in the direction of the Burial Sword Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sword Firmament Pavilion’s Alliance-Union Battle didn’t just affect the sect. It was a famous event throughout Heavenly Qin County. After all, whoever could perform well in the Alliance-Union Battle would become famous in Heavenly Qin County. So much so that the disciples of other forces would come to watch the Alliance-Union Battle. So, it wasn’t just another Sword Firmament Pavilion event. Rather, it was an important event in Heavenly Qin County.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Burial Sword Peak was heavily guarded. The outer region was a dense forest filled with towering trees. A Sword Tomb was located at the center with countless ancient swords plunged into the ground. This place was shrouded in a haze throughout the year, which added a mysterious color to this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only the ancestors who reached the Violet Palace Realm could have their swords buried here. In fact, every single owner of the abandoned swords were famous swordsmen in the Great Qin Empire. There were even rumors that swords belonging to Heavenly Soul Realm ancestors were also buried here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was unknown if there were any Heavenly Soul Realms in the Great Qin Empire now, but the Great Qin Empire definitely gave birth to many Heavenly Soul Realms in its history. Those who reached the Heavenly Soul Realm would definitely leave the Great Qin Empire, which meant that they returned here to be buried as members of the Sword Firmament Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is the Burial Sword Peak?” Lin Yun looked down from a high platform with shock. The Burial Sword Peak was larger than he had imagined. He never expected there to be a dense forest. He could also sense the sword intent emitting from the sword tomb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Locket Mountain’s core disciples stood behind Lin Yun while he followed the one leading the team, Xin Yan. Looking down at the Burial Sword Peak, Xin Yan nodded her head, “We’re here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She looked at Lin Yun and noticed that the haze that once shrouded Lin Yun’s forehead had disappeared and was replaced with fighting spirit. She was happy to see that Lin Yun was more energetic now. The disciples from the other alliance-unions looked at her as she smiled, causing them to swallow their saliva. However, no one dared to look at Xin Yan differently because they were intimidated by her title as the Bloody Rose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe. Big Sister Xin Yan, are the bones and personal swords of Heavenly Soul Realm powerhouses really buried here?” Li Wuyou found an excuse to talk with Xin Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Xin Yan merely glanced at him. She naturally knew what he was trying to do. She then turned her gaze back to the Burial Sword Peak and spoke out, “Of course. The Burial Sword Peak was founded by the ancestor, Jian Wuming. He was a rare talent in the last ten thousand years. Many ancestors returned to the pavilion before their deaths to be buried here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cultivators in the Heavenly Soul Realm were powerful and their strength alone rivaled the entire empire. But this power was out of reach for Lin Yun right now. Even the eight titles were still trying to enter the Violet Palace Realm, not to mention the Heavenly Soul Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The forest outside the Sword Tomb is linked to the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s mountain range. There are lots of demonic beasts living in it. The demonic beasts living near the sword tomb have possessed sword intent in their blood since birth. They’re a lot stronger than other demonic beasts found outside the sect. The demonic beasts are the first difficulty you guys will face.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Everyone participating in the Alliance-Union Battle will be given a violet crystal jade plaque. There will be an additional star in the jade when you obtain a jade plaque from others. Those who lose their jade plaques will lose their qualification to participate in the Alliance-Union Battle and will be asked to leave,” said Mo Chen, interrupting from the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But that’s only the first round. The second round will be held in the Sword Tomb and you will need thirty stars in your jade plaque if you want to obtain the qualification to enter the second round. The rankings will be determined in the second round,” continued Xin Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her words made everyone feel a chill run down their spine because they could only imagine how intense the battle would become. There were probably thousands of people participating in this Alliance-Union Battle, so the battles surely would be intense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just this alone was enough for everyone to feel how brutal the Alliance-Union Battle would be. They first had to defend themselves from the demonic beasts in the forest and then they had to prevent their jade plaque from being seized by fellow disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How will the rankings be determined in the second round?” asked Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’re still not sure about that right now. Elder Luo Feng and Elder Bai Ting will be announcing the rules for the second round. But for some reason, there is something strange about this Alliance-Union Battle. Not only is it taking place in the Burial Sword Peak, but they’re also handing out a hundred inner disciple spots.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, why bother asking so much? After all, you might not even be able to come out of the Sword Tomb alive.” A voice interrupted, which made Xin Yan and everyone else frown their brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lin Yun directed his gaze over, he saw the Gentlemen Union walking over. Wang Yan and Chu Haoyu were leading the group. Chu Haoyu still looked as prideful as ever and nothing could be seen aside from his horrifying cultivation. He was also looking at Lin Yun with indifference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Haoyu is here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So he really joined the Gentlemen Union! The rumors are actually true!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no doubt that the Gentlemen Union will be taking the first with Chu Haoyu around!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Locket Mountain is probably doomed now. Chu Haoyu is famous for being decisive when it comes to killing. It has always been his principle to leave no one alive if he makes his move.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the disciples in the high platform looked at Chu Haoyu. He was naturally the center of attention. After all, he was first on the Mortal Ranking and was someone who vied for supremacy with Bai Lixuan back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’ll be interesting if the person who killed Xue Feng can’t even reach the sword tomb.” &nbsp;Another group arrived when Wang Yan was finished speaking. There weren’t many people in this group, but all of them emitted powerful fluctuations. It was the Asura Alliance and Jiang Feng, the one who spoke, was ranked third on the Mortal Ranking. His words were harsher than Wang Yan’s since he was stating that Lin Yun would die in the first round.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He clearly still held a grudge against Lin Yun for stealing his mission. A murderous aura surged from his body when he sensed Lin Yun’s gaze. He didn’t bother concealing the murderous intentions in his heart. He was already determined to take care of Lin Yun if he had a chance to do so in the Alliance-Union Battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Those with strength will make it out alive. The reputation of killing an evil cultivator has no use in the Burial Sword Peak.” This time the words came from Feng Chuan. He was from the Lone-Star Alliance and was leading Ye Xiu who was ranked second on the Mortal Ranking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With that, the Locket Mountain, Gentlemen Alliance, Asura Alliance, and Lone-Star Alliance had arrived. The four of them represented the four strongest alliance-unions in the Sword Firmament Pavilion and all of them showed enmity for Lin Yun. The atmosphere was intense and the Alliance-Union Battle hadn’t even started.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These people are too arrogant…” muttered Li Wuyou unhappily. But he didn’t dare to be too wanton in the face of Chu Haoyu, Jiang Feng, and Ye Xiu’s cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thanks, but there’s no need for you guys to worry about my junior brother. Anything can happen in the Sword Tomb, so we’ll just have to wait to see,” said Xin Yan coldly. She then led everyone from the Locket Mountain to the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll see how long you can stay smug for! This brat offended so many people. It’s uncertain if he can even reach the top ten in this Alliance-Union Battle.” Wang Yan gnashed his teeth with a gloomy gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shortly after, the others from the top ten on the Mortal Ranking arrived. When they appeared, they glanced at Lin Yun with hostility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Yun is finished… everyone in the top ten is coming after him…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There are no consequences for killing in the Alliance-Union Battle, so they will definitely not miss this opportunity to get rid of Lin Yun. You guys have no idea how humiliated they were two months ago in the Contribution Hall.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, now that you mention it, that really was an interesting show. They initially went after Lin Yun, only to have their faces slapped when Phoenix Plum rang.”</span></p>
