 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four great halls of the Sword Firmament Pavilion - the Elders Hall, Contribution Hall, Martial Hall, and Pellet Hall - all held an important position in the sect. They were the halls that maintained the sect’s operation, not one of them could go missing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But if anyone had to ask which was the most important one, the answer would be the Pellet Hall. All cultivators require pellets if they wish to progress in their cultivation. Unlike cultivation techniques and artifacts, pellets were something needed every day. It didn’t matter how talented you were, you wouldn’t be able to make progress in your cultivation if you didn’t have any pellets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun wasn’t an exception to this, but he had nothing at the moment. He needed resources for his Iris Sword Sutra and Age Sutra, plus his daily cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Pellet Hall held a special position in the Sword Firmament Pavilion and every single one of the alchemists in the Pellet Hall held a respected position. No one would be foolish enough to offend them unless you had no intention of interacting with the Pellet Hall in the future. But was that even possible?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Pellet Hall’s interior was divided into different sections. There was the Refining Lounge, the Earthly Fire Pavilion, Spiritual Rune Chamber, and many others. There were also many branches in the Pellet Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But throughout the entire Sword Firmament Pavilion, from the Pavilion Master to the disciples, everyone had to interact with the Pellet Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun wanted to try his luck and see if he could find an alchemist here to be his master. He possessed the Violet Sacred Flame and even grasped many spiritual runes, he even had the Age Sutra. Lin Yun cultivated a few strands of age energy into his origin energy, so he would definitely be able to make a fortune if he could learn alchemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s have a look at your Sword Firmament Token,” a guard standing outside the Pellet Hall said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Done. Wait over there.” The guard casually pointed a direction to Lin Yun after looking at his token.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Uhh… But I haven’t told you why I’m here,” said Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Isn’t it obvious? You have a zero grade Sword Firmament Token. You’re clearly a poor rookie and what do people like you come for? If you’re not here to find a master, are you here to swap for pellets? Wait over there. I’ve seen many people like you,” the guard said impatiently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pondering over the guard’s words, Lin Yun had no idea how to refute his words. The direction that the guard pointed at had at least a thousand people, and aside from rookies, there were also many senior disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun’s forehead was immediately covered with black lines. None of these disciples were stupid, so they must be the reason why that guard was so impatient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Yun.” Someone called out to him when he went over. When Lin Yun turned around, it was Huangfu Jingxuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun never expected that this fellow would also be at the Pellet Hall. He had even called Lin Yun to grab his attention. Huangfu Jingxuan did this even though there was bad blood between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Lin Yun only hesitated briefly before walking over. Huangfu Jingxuan was also shocked to see Lin Yun here.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wasn’t Lin Yun being punished at Herbal Peak for three months?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So what was Lin Yun doing here when only a month had passed?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;But when he thought about it further, he had it all figured out. It would be weird for the sect to lock up a genius like Lin Yun for three months.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sorry about what happened in the forest.” Huangfu Jingxuan cupped his hands together before Lin Yun spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a calm smile, Lin Yun brushed it off, “It’s fine. What happened back then is over and I have already taken my revenge against you. But, you can come find me if you’re unhappy. However, if you do, I won’t go easy on you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If someone else heard what Lin Yun said, they would definitely think he was arrogant. But Huangfu Jingxuan knew that Lin Yun had a straightforward personality, beating around the bush was not his style. Back in the Nine Stars Contest, Lin Yun was fully capable of slaughtering him. Having Lin Yun as a friend was way better than having him as an enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry about it. It won’t happen again. If you look at my union emblem, you can tell that I did not join the Gentlemen Union.” Huangfu Jingxuan pointed at the emblem on his chest and continued, “But you have to be careful. Wang Yan will definitely act against you if he knows that you’re out. There are rumors recently that he’s summoning everyone in the Gentlemen Union back to the sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thanks,” responded Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You don’t have to be polite with me. Speaking of which, why are you here in the Pellet Hall? It’s not easy to become an apprentice,” said Huangfu Jingxuan who looked at Lin Yun oddly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s the matter? Is there anything behind this matter?” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Those who are here have no backing. But alchemy is also based on knowledge and it’s not any easier than cultivating. Not to mention that you even need to grasp spiritual runes to become an alchemist.” Huangfu Jingxuan smiled bitterly. “Rather than becoming an apprentice, you’re here to handle the odd jobs instead. After all, not everyone has the talent and patience to become an alchemist.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun immediately understood what Huangfu Jingxuan was trying to say and asked, ”Then why are there so many people here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s because it’s not embarrassing to handle odd jobs here. If you have the talent to become an alchemist, then this is an opportunity for you,” Huangfu Jingxuan explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But all of a sudden, the two could sense the commotion in the surrounding settling down. Their attention was directed at the commotion. When they raised their heads, they saw two women slowly walking over to them. It was Liu Yue!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun was briefly stunned because he never expected to run into Liu Yue here. After all, it had only been half a day since they last met back in the Herbal Peak. Liu Yue had changed her clothes and makeup. The lashes on her body were covered with her new dress. But her walking posture was strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sword slave!” Liu Yue gnashed her teeth at Lin Yun. She looked as if she wanted to gobble Lin Yun up on the spot. “And here I was wondering what kind of background you had. So it turns out that you’re just a beggar. Did your Senior Sister Xin Yan not support you financially?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since they parted, Liu Yue had found out more about Lin Yun and how he killed Wang Ning back in the Nine Stars Contest. She was at the Pellet Hall to get some pellets to treat her scars, so she never expected that she would run into Lin Yun here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun immediately became furious when Liu Yue involved Xin Yan. He replied indifferently, “Clean your mouth. Did you forget about the three lashes I gave you earlier?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Presumptuous!” Liu Yue’s face changed. Her gaze was cold when she looked at Lin Yun. She had been treated as a treasure ever since she was young. No one had ever touched her. But now, Lin Yun was exposing her to the public. When she yelled, her face twitched in pain from her lashes on the back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was shocked by Lin Yun’s words. An uproar burst out when they recalled Liu Yue’s walking posture. They felt that Lin Yun was too bold to lash Liu Yue three times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Presumptuous? Who’s being presumptuous here? Don’t mess with me. Otherwise, don’t blame me for exposing what happened to you back at Herbal Peak,” Lin Yun retorted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Good!” Liu Yue’s face turned green. Pointing at Lin Yun, she continued, “Then I’ll see how long you can keep laughing. Don’t you want to find yourself a master? I’ll fulfil your wish then!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the capital, she was a famous lady, basking in the attention of everyone around her from a young age. Not to mention that she had never suffered such grievances since her father possessed huge authority.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she left, Huangfu Jingxuan immediately asked, “Brother Lin, how did you offend her? And what is this about giving her three lashes?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who is she?” Lin Yun frowned his brows. He recalled how the faces of the four guards turned pale when he gave her three lashes. So after listening to Huangfu Jingxuan’s reaction, he couldn’t help his curiosity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you know about the capital’s Divine Guards?” asked Huangfu Jingxuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun nodded, “I do. That’s the Imperial City’s army who is responsible for keeping order in the capital. Even experts in the Violet Palace Realm wouldn’t dare to mess around in the capital because of their existence.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“And here I thought you knew nothing about it. Liu Yue’s father is Liu Longfei, the Divine Guards’ Commander. He was bestowed with the Violet-Golden Battle Armor by His Majesty and given the title of Soaring Dragon General. Not only is he powerful and possesses huge authority, but he’s also the emperor’s favourite official.” Huangfu Jingxuan paused briefly before he continued, “So in a certain sense, offending her is even more terrifying than offending Wang Yan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun smacked his lips together. He never expected that his luck would be so ‘great.’ Xin Yan should know about Liu Yue’s background. She didn’t say a word to him so he thought that there was nothing great about Liu Yue’s background.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then again, Lin Yun wouldn’t let her have her way regardless of her background since she wanted the Dragon Blooded Horse. Not to mention that he was forced to give her three lashes back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who’s Lin Yun?!” A roar sounded out. When Lin Yun turned his head over, he saw Liu Yue coming over with a deacon from the Pellet Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless gazes fell onto Lin Yun. Many of them were rejoicing inwardly because they knew that this brat would be doomed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Lin Yun calmly responded, “I am.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re here to find a master?” asked the deacon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right.” Lin Yun knew that there was no way he could take a step back now that things had come to this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Very well. Master Ku Yun just so happens to lack helpers. Come with me.” The deacon looked at Lin Yun coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Master Ku Yun’s name sounded out, everyone’s faces changed with a trace of fear in their eyes. Even Huangfu Jingxuan’s face had changed. He wanted to say something, but Lin Yun was already brought away before he could even speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Master Ku Yun was famous for having a bad temper. You could bear with a deacon’s temper because all alchemists had fiery tempers.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the problem is…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, Huangfu Jingxuan could only shake his head helplessly and wished Lin Yun good luck. When Liu Yue looked at Lin Yun’s departing silhouette, a cold light flickered across her eyes.</span></p>
