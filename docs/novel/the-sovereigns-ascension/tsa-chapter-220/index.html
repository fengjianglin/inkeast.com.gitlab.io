 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The capital’s Myriad Treasure Pavilion had three Hall Masters. In addition to the pellets, they also took responsibility for techniques, artifacts, and treasures. The things found in the first two halls were more expensive, but the hall selling pellets was more popular. After all, there was a limit to how many cultivation techniques a person could learn and a profound artifact could be used for decades on average.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, pellets were considered to be daily consumables for cultivators. Even if they weren’t used for daily cultivation, everyone would have some just in case. The hall for pellets was majestically decorated, filled with gorgeous lamps that lit up the entire hall. On the counter, many different pellets were on display.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Anywhere from tens of thousands to millions of people would show up every day. The hall was enormous, equipped with four floors to handle the huge crowds. At this moment, a group of cultivators in the Profound Martial Realm strode into the hall. The leader was a tall and burly man with a heavy sword on his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s the Bloodwolf Mercenary!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They must’ve gotten another huge harvest from the desert!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How could they fail with Wolf King Feng Jue personally leading the team?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The group was instantly recognized as soon as they came in. They were from the Bloodwolf Mercenary and their leader, Feng Jue, had a famous reputation in the capital. There were many elites gathered in the Great Qin County. There were also many fugitives working for the various clans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among them, some of the stronger ones would form teams to establish a mercenary group. It was a profitable profession despite the high mortality. As long as one order was complete, they would be rewarded with a large sum of spiritual jades. The Bloodwolf Mercenary just so happened to be one of the stronger mercenary groups.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were regular customers to the chambers of commerce. Whenever they had a huge harvest, they would come in to acquire cultivation resources. They brought a large amount of income for the chambers of commerce.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where are the Greater Profound Pellets?” Feng Yue frowned while looking around. For some reason, there was a huge shortage of Greater Profound Pellets in the chambers of commerce. He only managed to acquire about a hundred of them after visiting several chambers of commerce. It was only enough for ten people to cultivate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the Bloodwolf Mercenary had close to a hundred members and a hundred Greater Profound Pellets weren’t enough for them. The maid who was serving him smiled, “The Greater Profound Pellets have been popular on the market recently. They almost sell out the moment they’re placed on the counter. Captain Feng Jue, you have to come early tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone in the mercenary group looked disappointed when they heard that. But as Feng Jue was looking around, his eyes suddenly lit up, “Don’t you have some over there? Thirty pellets… that’s a decent amount.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The maid’s face changed slightly. She wanted to stop Feng Jue, but it was already too late. Feng Jue went over to take a look at the thirty Greater Profound Pellets and his face changed, “100 spiritual jades? The Myriad Treasure Pavilion really knows how to do your business. Greater Profound Pellets only cost 10 spiritual jades on average, while the better ones go for 30 spiritual jades.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe. Captain, this Greater Profound Pellet has been here for an entire day and no one is interested in buying it at all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Some random alchemist must be greedy trying to find someone to take advantage of.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right. Captain, don’t be the fool who buys it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other mercenaries smiled. This bottle of Profound Greater Pellets had attracted many people’s attention and they were all mocking the ridiculous price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aside from Master Fu Guang, I’ve never heard of anyone daring to sell Greater Profound Pellets at this price. This bottle of Greater Profound Pellets here alone is worth two months of our income. How ruthless!” The mercenary members were all unhappy when they saw the price.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spiritual jades were different from spiritual stones. Ordinary people mainly used spiritual stones as their currency. But everyone in the Great Qin County had a noble status. Anyone who could enter the Myriad Treasure Pavilion were in the Xiantian Realm, so they naturally used spiritual jades as their currency.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, spiritual jades were spiritual stones that had been refined. They could be used to cultivate, set up arrays, practice alchemy, and even forge artifacts. So 100 spiritual jades wasn’t a small amount.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The maid who was responsible for serving the group looked awkward. Suddenly, Feng Jue asked, “Did you guys get a new alchemist?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. He wasn’t here in the past and only the Hall Master knows his identity,” replied the maid. At this moment, she made up her mind to tell the Hall Master how the ridiculous price was ruining their reputation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Give me a pellet,” said Feng Jue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” asked the maid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The maid was surprised, thinking that she had heard him incorrectly. However, she immediately recovered from her shock and smiled, “Okay.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Jue was considered a distinguished guest in many major chambers of commerce. So they naturally didn’t have to worry about his reputation. The maid immediately retrieved one pellet and gave it to Feng Jue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Holy shit… Is Feng Jue going to be the fool who buys it?” Everyone in the surrounding was surprised. They never expected that Feng Jue would really buy such a ridiculously priced Greater Profound Pellet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the surprised looks of everyone, Feng Jue tossed the Greater Profound Pellet into his mouth and started refining it. His aura of the sixth stage of the Profound Martial Realm gradually spread out. His cultivation was deep and powerful and it wasn’t any weaker than the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s Wang Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the surging medicinal effect dispersed within his body, Feng Jue was secretly surprised by the pellet. However, it still wasn’t worth 100 spiritual jades. But just when Feng Jue thought that he had finished refining it, another surge of medicinal power rose from the depths of his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The medicinal power kept rising, leaving Feng Jue shocked. The medicinal effect boosted to 60%. For reference, ordinary Greater Profound Pellets only had 30% medicinal effects, while better ones had 50%. However, the medicinal power did not stop surging in Feng Jue’s body and rose to 70%. The effects didn’t stop there and continued to rise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Jue was ecstatic because he could feel a slight increase in his cultivation after consuming the Greater Profound Pellet. Furthermore, the medicinal effect still hadn’t ended. He instantly knew that he had to leave right now or people would start to realize the changes. Relying on his powerful cultivation, he forcibly suppressed the Greater Profound Pellet’s medicinal effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without any change in his expression, Feng Jue spoke out, “Not bad. It’s not as bad as I imagined. Anyways, it’s not easy to buy Greater Profound Pellets right now, so I’ll take all 30 pellets.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother!” The mercenary members immediately called out. At the same time, everyone in the hall was dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wow, the alchemist who refined it really managed to find a fool to buy them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The demand for Greater Profound Pellets had been really high recently. Captain Feng Jue probably has something urgent to handle, so he doesn’t want to waste time finding Greater Profound Pellets.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An uproar broke out in the surrounding. Everyone was saying how lucky the alchemist was. In the end, a person from the mercenary group took out 3,000 spiritual jades reluctantly and gave it to the maid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Everyone says that Captain Feng Jue is generous. I’ll boldly make an exception and give you a discount of 200 spiritual jades.” The maid was happy to sell the thirty Greater Profound Pellets and even went as far as giving a discount. After all, every chamber of commerce had the privilege to try and win over honored customers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The maid, Qing Mei, felt that what she did was justified and that Feng Jue was definitely worth it. On the other hand, Feng Jue laughed inwardly. Looking at the bright smile on the maid’s face, he wondered how she would look a few days from now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But as someone experienced in life, he was able to keep himself composed. Raising his brows, he pretended to be pleased and replied, “Great! The Myriad Treasure Pavilion is truly worthy of its reputation. Since you guys are going as far as giving me a discount, then I’ll be back tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sure. That’s great! Captain Feng Jue, please remember to find me again tomorrow!” Qing Mei smiled cheerfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the mercenary group left, the smile on Feng Jue’s face disappeared. He muttered, “Hurry up!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone else in the mercenary group was baffled. They could sense that there was something wrong with their captain. However, they did not dare to say anything and quickly followed Feng Jue into a remote alley. The moment they walked in, Feng Jue could no longer suppress the Greater Profound Pellet’s medicinal effect. His aura began to rise and his hair fluttered in the wind. The sheer outburst of his aura alone pushed the two people standing beside him away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Captain?” they asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Jue ignored them and focused on refining the pellet. After a long time, Feng Jue finally opened his eyes and there was a bright glow in them. He could sense a slight improvement in his cultivation in that short amount of time. This left the members of the group dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahaha!” Feng Jue began to laugh wildly. Feeling pleased, he yelled, “Great! That feels great!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a while, someone asked cautiously, “Captain, you spent 3,000 spiritual jades at once. What are we going to do at Master Fu Guang’s Pellet Opening Ceremony ten days from now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Screw him. All thirteen of you will take one of these Greater Profound Pellets. Keep its medicinal effect to yourself. It’s strictly confidential!” Feng Jue said in a deep voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Early in the next morning, Qing Mei’s eyes lit up the moment she saw Feng Jue. Walking over to her, Feng Jue smiled, “Lady Qing Mei, I’m here as promised.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Mei was briefly taken aback before she smiled, “Captain Feng Jue, please come inside.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For three days in a row, Feng Jue came every day and bought all the highly priced Greater Profound Pellets, which shocked everyone. Everyone was wondering if Feng Jue was trying to empty the Bloodwolf Mercenary’s wealth. They could feel that something was amiss when Feng Jue came again on the fourth day, but they didn’t know why.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Feng Jue came up to the counter this time when he noticed that Hall Master Wei was holding onto a bottle of pellets, “Captain Feng Jue, you’re here for the Greater Profound Pellets again?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hall Master Wei looked at Feng Jue with his squinting eyes and a bright smile. On the other hand, Feng Jue’s eyes were glued onto the bottle. Hall Master Wei was the person responsible for this hall and it was rare for him to be around. But when Feng Jue saw Hall Master Wei, he instantly knew that his luck had run out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It seems that Hall Master Wei has discovered the secret of this pellet.” Feng Jue smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Hall Master Wei wore an odd expression when he heard what Feng Jue said. He had no idea what secret Feng Jue was talking about. He only thought that it was odd for such expensive Greater Profound Pellets to sell out three days in a row. The reason for his appearance was to see who was buying the pellets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What secret?” asked Hall Master Wei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Jue was briefly stunned before he asked, “As the Hall Master, don’t you know that these Greater Profound Pellets have 90% medicinal effect?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire hall became silent the moment Feng Jue said that. Hall Master Wei instantly felt his mind blowing up and asked, “What did you say?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Jue smiled bitterly when he heard that because he knew that he made a mistake. But now that things had come to this, he no longer hid it and replied, “Every single pellet in this bottle of Greater Profound Pellets has 90% medicinal effect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right after he spoke, he unleashed his aura, which caused a violent gale in the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Seventh stage of the Profound Martial Realm!” someone exclaimed. Everyone was dumbfounded by this scene.</span></p>
