Twilight was donned in black as he faced three opponents by himself. The three were deacons from the Sword Cloud Pavilion, and they were all in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm, possessing the battle prowess of Violet Palace Realm. With the three of them combined, it wasn’t difficult for them to kill Violet Palace Realm cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But they only barely managed to defend themselves under Twilight’s sword. When Twilight swung his sword that radiated like a dazzling sun, an explosion occurred and the three deacons were sent flying away, throwing out a mouthful of blood. All of them were easily crushed by Twilight’s sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, Lin Yun will never have imagined that Lil’ Ye has already achieved quasi-xiantian sword intent, and he has also reached complete mastery in the Supreme Radiance Sword. Although it’s still far from the manifestation stage, it’s more than enough to suppress Lin Yun. Furthermore, the explosive prowess of the Supreme Radiance Sword attacks through sending shock into the opponent’s body, and not even that brat’s physique can take it,” sneered the elders who were watching the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Twilight sheathed his sword, he emitted out a heroic aura coming from him. Right at this moment, a masked man appeared all of a sudden and sent his palm at Twilight without any warning. The terrifying aura emitted from the masked man was in the Violet Palace Realm, and this made many people shocked. The spectators exclaimed out, “Watch out!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However. Twilight did not have any changes on his face and sent out his palm. The pressure emitted out from him wasn’t any weaker than the attacker. When the two palms clashed, cracks began to spread out on the ground, and the shockwave resonated out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But that wasn’t all as Twilight was enveloped in a radiance formed with his sword aura. When the two sword rays crossed together, it formed into a gigantic ‘十’ as Twilight pushed it out with a roar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Taking the attack head-on, the masked man was sent flying away while Twilight remained where he was standing. When the elders saw this scene, they exclaimed out, “Lil’ Ye’s Supreme Radiance Sutra has reached the eighth stage!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha! Great!” The elder who led the team, Luo Han, walked out with a burst of laughter, “Lil’ Ye is truly worthy of being the genius of the millennia in our sect to be able to face such a situation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the masked man removed his mask, a familiar face was revealed within everyone’s sight as he cupped his hands together with a smile, “Lil’ Ye, congratulations for reaching the eighth stage in the Supreme Radiance Sutra.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, everyone finally realized that the sudden assault was a test and revealed a smile on their faces. With Twilight’s current strength, it was more than enough for him to kill Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Han walked up, and he asked, “Do you know what’s the day today?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The day I kill Lin Yun and take revenge for junior brother,” said Twilight calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Back then, Jian Wuming chased us out of the Heavenly Qin County and created the Sword Firmament Pavilion to replace us. It’s time for us to get back at them,” said Luo Han with indignance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cold smirk rose on Twilight’s face, and he replied, “He should surrender if he’s smart. Otherwise, I’ll kill him if he dares to show up on the stage and embarrass the Sword Firmament Pavilion thoroughly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t have to dwell too much in Lin Yun. You have a high chance of obtaining the top three in this competition.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s right. You might even be able to become the champion if you’re lucky,” the other elders echoed. All of them had already considered Lin Yun a dead man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go. Time to get going.” Not only the Sword Cloud Pavilion, but the other sects have also started making their way to the Dragon Gate Plaza, and it only took half an hour for the plaza to be filled with people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Emperor Qin made his appearance, the princess and prince also appeared on his sides. As for the thirty-two disciples who made it into the second round, they were long prepared. Emperor Qin swept his glance out, and the princess stood up from her seat when Emperor Qin nodded in her direction. She announced, “The rules of the second round will be the same as the first, an elimination round to determine the best sixteen. At that time, the envoy will personally host the quarterfinals.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone’s eyes flashed with a peculiar light when they heard about the envoy. Everyone knows that the mysterious envoy was the person presiding over the competition, and his authority far exceeded the empire and the four major sects. But the envoy would only show up at the quarterfinals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What tempted everyone was the fact that the champion of the competition could make a request at the envoy, and the envoy would fulfil it as long as it’s reasonable. Someone once made a request for a cosmic artifact, and the envoy took out dozens of them to have the champion pick it. Some even wanted his clan to be promoted to a prince clan, which the envoy fulfilled that wish as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The envoy’s words were more useful than Emperor Qin in the Great Qin Empire. After the princess explained the rules, Li Wuyou whispered, “Big Brother, how confident are you in winning Twilight?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You went to place a bet again?” asked Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“N-no. Definitely not. I only went there to take a look, and you will never imagine that someone bet a third grade spiritual jade on you becoming the champion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who is it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Drifting Goblet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Wuyou’s words made Lin Yun stunned briefly before he smiled. Drifting Goblet has always been unexpected, and he even had someone as precious as a third grade spiritual jade. It would be a pity if it lost it to a bet, but Lin Yun was happy that Drifting Goblet believed in him. According to his knowledge, his rates were horrendous, and no one was optimistic about him defeating Twilight, not to mention becoming the champion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But Big Brother, how confident are you?” asked Li Wuyou. This made everyone else from the Sword Firmament Pavilion to raise their ears as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll only know when we fight.” Lin Yun felt that his odds of winning was at least 50%, but he couldn’t make any confirmation before they fought. They were both at their strongest state, except Lin Yun’s Aurora Dragon had gone into slumber after devouring the demonic soul. This meant that he wouldn’t be able to use it in this fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let the second round begins!” The princess continued, “The first battle will be between the Primal Origin Sect’s Heartcliff and Heavenly Profound Sect’s Tang Yuan!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two figures then descended on the stage. Tang Yuan was a core disciple in the Heavenly Profound Sect, and he had his own encounter in the Demonlotus Realm that greatly boosted his strength. But no one felt that he could be comparable to Heartcliff, and there was no suspense in this battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The result was just as everyone had expected. After ten moves, Heartcliff began to unleash his dracophant energy and threw out a punch with ten cauldron’s worth of strength and saintly music echoing into air. He used his brute strength to crush Tang Yuan’s Dragon-Tiger Fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Heartcliff only used ten moves to defeat Tang Yuan, no one was sure about his exact strength. He gave of an unfathomable feeling, and he didn’t even seem to have used half of his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heartcliff wins!” announced the judge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heartcliff’s lips rose, and he looked down at Tang Yuan on the ground with a smile, “Is that all the Dragon-Tiger Fist got?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shortly after, he turned to look at the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s direction. Lin Yun could sense his gaze, but he wasn’t too bothered by it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s a pity that I can end that brat personally,” muttered Heartcliff as he went down the stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This fellow sounds as if junior brother will lose to Twilight,” snorted Xin Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s what everyone else thinks,” replied Lin Yun. But he wasn’t able to see through Heartcliff strength. Ten cauldron’s worth of strength? Could it be that Heartcliff’s Dracophant Battle Physique was at the sixth stage? But that didn’t seem possible to Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the prerequisite to reach the sixth stage was a Heavenly Soul Realm’s beast core, and it was impossible for the Primal Origin Sect to kill such a powerful demonic beast for Heartcliff. So Lin Yun could only conclude it as Heartcliff had a fortunate encounter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the battle continued, aside from the fights of titled figures who could suppress their opponents, many of the fights were filled with suspense to the last minute. This not only proved that the titled figures were powerful, but this also proved that everyone who made it to the second round were strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if the titled figures could suppress their opponents, they were only able to do it after ten moves at least, and it was no longer like the first round where they could instantly sweep their opponents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eighth battle, the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s Bai Lixuan VS the Primal Origin Sect’s Zuo Yun!” This announcement instantly caused an uproar. This was one of the main focuses for the second round, aside from Qin Yu’s fight with Erget and Lin Yun’s fight with Twilight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two were newly risen geniuses, and Bai Lixuan even had the Saint Physique, known as the strongest beneath the eight titles. Zuo Yun wasn’t weak either as he was the strongest among the Primal Origin Sect’s youngest generation. So many people felt that he was qualified to fight Bai Lixuan, and their fight would be interesting.</span></p>
