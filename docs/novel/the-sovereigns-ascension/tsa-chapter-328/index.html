 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two days later, in the capital, the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s party arrived outside the Princess Manor on their horses. The Princess Manor was a few hundred miles in radius, decorated with an endless mountain range. The mountain range was gathering spiritual energy from the surrounding. There was also a huge lake that created the perfect scene as peach and willow trees decorated the shores.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun was shocked by the scene he saw. In his opinion, the Sword Firmament Pavilion was majestic, but it was lacking when compared to the Princess Manor. But the spiritual energy here was naturally incomparable to the Sword Firmament Pavilion. Lin Yun’s horzion was being widened by what he was seeing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“An island in the middle of the lake and many buildings. The princess really isn’t simple,” commented Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s for sure. The princess has a noble status and she’s not inferior to the crown prince in any way. Otherwise, her birthday wouldn’t have shaken the entire empire to the extent that even the four sects would participate,” smiled Tang Tong as he appreciated the surrounding scenery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” Lin Yun was curious. “Could it be that there’s a story about this princess?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother Tang, you must be knowledgeable. Why don’t you tell us about it?” Wang Zheng and Yan Ding also turned to look at Tang Tong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s not a secret. I only got to know about this since I was born in the capital.” Tang Tong coughed. He then smiled embarrassedly, “I heard that the princess is a genius of the royal family. She was taken as a disciple at a very young age and the sect that she belongs to is extremely mysterious. It’s so mysterious that not even the royal clan dares to offend it. There are even rumors that the emperor might pass the throne to her. But it’s a pity…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s wrong? Stop keeping us in suspense!” Wang Zheng cursed at Tang Tong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There was a problem with the princess’ body that left even the imperial physicians helpless. Then, she gradually disappeared from everyone’s eyes and rarely made any appearances,” smiled Tang Tong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not even the royal clan can do something about it?” Wang Zhong and Yan Ding exchanged looks filled with shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But I heard that the princess is the prettiest woman in the Great Qin Empire. Senior Brother Tang, have you seen her appearance?” The two asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It should be true, but she rarely shows her face. She will mask herself even when she goes out,” said Tang Tong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cut it out.” Luo Feng turned around and glared at Tang Tong, “Trouble comes from the mouth. We’re already at the Princess Manor, so watch what you’re saying.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, I’m sorry.” Tang Tong smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Yan turned around and she looked at Lin Yun, “Junior Brother Lin, I’ve seen the princess’ appearance before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ve seen it before?” he asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I did. She’s indeed the prettiest in the Great Qin Empire,” responded Xin Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How is she compared to you?” Lin Yun didn’t believe it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Yan blushed. Her eyes rolled before she smiled, “Junior Brother, your mouth is becoming sweeter. But the princess is indeed more beautiful than me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, a butler came out with several maids. He cupped his hands together, “I’m sorry to keep our guests from the Sword Firmament Pavilion waiting. I sincerely apologize.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The butler’s aura was powerful, so he should have a rather high position in the Princess Manor. Then again, it made sense. After all, the four sects were coming, and they were stronger than the aristocratic clans. The one to receive them must have some strength and influence, otherwise it would a little too rude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Feng returned the greeting with a smile. But just when he was about to speak, a heavy rumble rang out. Horses galloping on the ground could be heard as a faint pressure spread out. Luo Feng’s face changed and he turned around to see the Primal Origin Sect’s arrival.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The one leading the Primal Origin Sect grinned, “Elder Luo, it has been a long time. I wonder if you have recovered from my palm three years ago?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Feng had anger on his face. This middle-aged man was Wen Yanbo, a core elder in the Primal Origin Sect. The hostility between the two sects went way back. So the elders and disciples of the two sects were affected to a certain extent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three years ago, Luo Feng fought with Wen Yanbo in the Extermination Mountain Range. They were evenly matched. Wen Yanbo took a sword from him back then, but he also gave Luo Feng a palm. But Wen Yanbo had the Dracophant Battle Physique, so his injuries recovered quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, it took Luo Feng two years to recover from the injuries left by the palm. He spoke out coldly, “I don’t need Elder Wen to care about that. I recovered long ago.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is that so? It looks like Elder Luo made some progress in his cultivation. Let’s spar again sometime.” Wen Yanbo continued to provoke Luo Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You think I’m afraid of you?” Luo Feng snorted. The two of them were in the Violet Palace Realm. They usually enjoyed a high position, so it was surprising that they fought the instant they met. When the spectators saw the two of them, they instantly understood what was going on and continued to watch with a playful gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seems that the enmity between the two sects was real. It was so real that they even dared to provoke each other in the Princess Manor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The butler frowned, “Elders, do you really want to fight in the Princess Manor? This isn’t appropriate. After all, the princess’ birthday is tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then let’s talk about it tomorrow,” sneered Wen Yanbo. His gaze fell onto Lin Yun and he revealed a deep smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go.” Luo Feng regained his composure and entered the manor following the maids. When Lin Yun turned around, his gaze clashed with Zuo Yun. The two nodded their heads at each other as a form of greeting. Since they had different stances based on their sects, they couldn’t talk to each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It didn’t take long for them to part ways. They all received an individual room in the manor. Looking out at the lake, they could see many guests arriving. Aside from the four prestigious sects, everyone with fame in the Great Qin Empire had received an invitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How grand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no way the sect can compare to this. After all, the princess has a significant position in the royal clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It has been five years since her birthday banquet. So it’s natural that everyone will come.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, this birthday banquet will be interesting. Just a moment ago, the elders of the Sword Firmament Pavilion and Primal Origin Sect nearly fought.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you serious? It looks like there will be a great show tomorrow. It will naturally be interesting when the four prestigious sects and the Heavenly Qin Institute come together.” Lin Yun fell into deep thought when he heard about it. It looked like the princess was more influential than he had imagined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, a group walked over. Their aura was drawn into their bodies and they were all above the sixth stage of the Profound Martial Realm. There was a youth with defined features that held onto a fan, looking quite elegant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t say a word, but he was treated as the center of attention in the party. Everyone was pale compared to him, so you could tell that he was someone important with just a glance. Even Lin Yun was surprised when he saw him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young Master Lin, we’re arriving at your residence,” smiled the maid as she bowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay. Thank you.” Lin Yun recovered from the shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A moment later, the youth in the group who was leaving suddenly frowned and stopped walking. He folded the fan in his hand and looked back at Lin Yun’s figure disappearing into the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Situ Yi recognized Lin Yun as the youth he met back in the Azure Sun Realm. At that time, that youth disregarded his death and rescued Yue Weiwei from Bai Lixuan by jumping into the Yin Wind Stream.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He never expected that this youth would survive the Yin Wind Stream and even joined the Sword Firmament Pavilion. Didn’t he know that Bai Lixuan was also from the Sword Firmament Pavilion? But Situ Yi wouldn’t be shocked if that was all. He was shocked that Lin Yun’s cultivation reached the sixth stage of the Profound Martial Realm when he was in the Xiantian Realm just one year ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, the temperament that Lin Yun emitted was also different. Situ Yi could sense the immense sword intent contained in Lin Yun’s body.</span></p>

He was looking forward to seeing how Bai Lixuan would react when he came out of seclusion. He bet that Bai Lixuan’s reaction would be interesting. Situ Yi felt that the trip to this birthday banquet was worth it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Brother Situ, do you know that person?” The female disciple was surprised. She rarely saw Situ Yi revealing shock on his face. Everyone from the Demonic Moon Villa looked at Situ Yi curiously. After all, it was rare for this genius to lose his composure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t,” smiled Situ Yi as he opened his fan.</span></p>
