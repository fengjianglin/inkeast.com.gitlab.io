 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Lan fell onto the ground as his ribs were entirely shattered. He threw up blood from the aftermath. Even with his cultivation, he was heavily injured by this attack. If he had been an ordinary cultivator in the tenth stage, he would have already been severed into two by this sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The origin energy he summoned to protect himself had shattered under this attack. This shocking scene had caused a commotion in the crowd as everyone looked at Lin Yun in a different light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun wasn’t killed and Han Lan was heavily injured instead?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just how did Lin Yun manage to do that? Wasn’t Lin Yun already crippled? Shouldn’t Han Lan easily defeat him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, the old man’s exclamation had jolted everyone awake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The legendary manifestation stage?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How is that even possible? How can a cripple reach the manifestation stage in his sword technique? That makes no sense!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It was already hard to bring a sword technique to complete mastery. But he actually managed to reach the manifestation stage at such a young age…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How terrifying. No wonder he was able to contend with Han Lan while he’s only in the eighth stage.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The manifestation stage was a legend in the empire, so not many people had heard about it, not to mention witnessing it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re courting death!” One of the members who called out to Lin Yun to stop flew into rage when he saw that Han Lan was nearly killed. A figure flew out along with a terrifying aura that shattered all the snowflakes in the sky. He was a quasi-Violet Palace Realm expert from the Divine Guards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw a crimson light blossoming in the sky. It slowly turned into an ancient seal before it came crashing down at him. The attack was too quick and Lin Yun immediately retaliated. But he only managed to resolve 80% of the power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the remaining 20% landed on him, Lin Yun threw up a mouthful of blood and was sent flying away. He wouldn’t be so heavily injured if he still had his cultivation in the ninth stage. However, his current cultivation had a huge gap compared to someone in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, he had just unleashed an ultimate attack. So he was caught off guard against this attack. But as the Iris Sword Sutra circulated within his body, the energy that was wreaking havoc within his body calmed down. At the same time, Lin Yun also took three steps back before he regained his footing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Brother!” Xin Yan’s face was drained of all color. She struggled to get up on her feet, but she soon revealed a painful expression. Qin Yu had sealed off her cultivation to prevent any accidents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu was looking at this entire scene from the side with a cold smirk on his face. He didn’t make a move, so no one knew what he was thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Sister, I’m fine.” Lin Yun wiped the blood off the corner of his lips and he squeezed out a smile. But the smile looked desolate under the blizzard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Impressive. You actually managed to smile after taking my Bloodprint Palm.” When the attacker landed on the ground, Lin Yun saw that he was wearing the Divine Guards’ uniform and that he looked to be in his thirties. Lin Yun also noticed that his eyes were vicious like a python.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s Han Tianming, the captain of the Dracoscale Guards…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That fellow has a strong fame and he’s known to be the strongest among the quasi-Violet Palace Realm. He’s invincible as long as he isn’t facing someone in the Violet Palace Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Yun will suffer greatly now. Then again, he wouldn’t have to take the Bloodprint Palm if he didn’t swing out that sword.” The crowd quickly recognized this person in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm. He was an expert in the Divine Guards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re courting death to ruin the crown prince’s wedding!” The ruthlessness of a soldier was on display by Han Tianming. He didn’t give Lin Yun the chance to breath and instantly ordered the Divine Guards to move out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Riding on their horses, the Divine Guards charged at Lin Yun. This time, it wasn’t just eight Dracoscale Guards, but a hundred heavily armored cavalry. They were elites of the Divine Guards and their killing aura had combined together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The warhorses sped in a formation and the commotion created by them was massive. This left shock in the eyes of the spectators. There was no way the Divine Guards’ elites could compete with a sect’s genius one-on-on, but it was different when hundreds of them combined to create a formation. Even someone in the tenth stage of the Profound Martial Realm would die under this attack, not to mention Lin Yun who was only in the eighth stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun’s eyes glowed and the Flower Burial Sword began to buzz in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Golden Crow Seal blossomed on his back and Lin Yun dashed forward like a golden streak. When he was gradually approaching the hundred elites, his figure suddenly became blurred. This left the elites from the Divine Guards confused because they couldn’t find their target.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Over there!” When they found Lin Yun, they were shocked to discover that he was above them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the sky, Lin Yun unleashed his killing aura. When he drew his sword, a loud cry echoed and many people lost control of their weapons. This instantly threw the hundred elites into chaos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lin Yun dove into the crowd, he killed anyone who stood in his path. The snow was soon dyed red and in a breath of time, all the elites were lying on the ground. All of them were practically dead and their blood dyed the snow in a terrifying manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, none of the Divine Guards’ soldiers were deterred by this. They were soldiers and their duty was to heed orders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When more cavalry of the cavalry stepped forward, Lin Yun began to gather his origin energy for his next attack. With his hair fluttering in the sky, he unleashed the Luminous Moon when he accumulated his energy the max.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sword in his hand revolved like a moon that instantly overshadowed everything. The new batch of cavalry who came instantly plunged into chaos as wails sounded out from the formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But before Lin Yun could even react, he saw a crimson streak flashing in his face. Han Tianming had appeared before him with a sneer as he sent out another crimson palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Lin Yun was able to avoid being hit in his fatal spots, he still took the palm to his shoulder. His shoulder was instantly covered in blood as he was blown away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How shameless!” Many people gnashed their teeth when they saw this scene. Han Tianming had an advantage in his cultivation, but the way he fought was so despicable that it made everyone look down on him. Before that, he was watching the Divine Guards’ elites die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun fell onto the ground and the Flower Burial Sword left his hand. This time, he was more injured than before. After all, it wasn’t easy to take a fully charged attack from a quasi-Violet Palace Realm unprepared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Yun, leave! Don’t care about it!” Xin Yan cried out in pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More Divine Guards were still gathering behind and the crown prince was watching this scene without any expression on his face. As for the guests from the Azure Association, they were merely watching this scene with indifference. They were looking at Lin Yun as though they were looking at a dead person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone took pity on Lin Yun. The crown prince was a prince for a reason. He didn’t even need to lift his hand to cause Lin Yun to fall in this state. So what if Lin Yun’s sword technique was in the manifestation stage? So what if he slaughtered his way through the Divine Guards? There was nothing he could do as long as Han Tianming chose not to fight head-on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kill!” Han Tianming’s face revealed a cold smirk with disdain reflected in his eyes. He enjoyed toying with a genius like Lin Yun. Ten years ago, he was also a genius, but it was a pity that he failed to reach the Violet Palace Realm. He had been stuck in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm until now, which caused him to have such a twisted hatred for geniuses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Horses galloped and more Divine Guards charged forth under Han Tianming’s orders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Quick, leave!” sobbed Xin Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Sister, there’s no way I will leave since I’m already here. My blood hasn’t turned cold. So there’s no reason for me to sheath my sword.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had decided not to turn back the moment he drew his sword. Slamming his palm onto the ground, Lin Yun got back on his feet and he barked, “Sword!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Flower Burial Sword buzzed and it returned to his hand. Facing the hundreds of elites from the Divine Guards, Lin Yun unleashed a boundless chill the moment he grasped his sword and froze everything within his path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Myriad Frost!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The snow was cold, but his heart was colder. His sword would never turn back and when the ice cracked, hundreds of elites from the Divine Guards threw up blood. Additionally, all of them were sent flying by Lin Yun’s attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go and die!” Han Tianming appeared before Lin Yun right at this moment. With a sinister smile, he sent out his palm that was aimed at Lin Yun’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spectators all drew a cold breath and exclaimed inwardly at how ruthless Han Tianming was. He was even more vicious than a viper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Han Tianming unleashed his attack, he suddenly felt a chill down his spine when he saw Lin Yun’s calm gaze. It was as though Lin Yun was looking at a dead person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s going on?” Han Tianming began to feel doubtful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within Lin Yun’s body, the spiritual runes began to light up like stars in the sky and ultimately formed a painting. Lin Yun also emitted a dazzling brilliance as his aura instantly shot through the ninth stage, tenth stage, and the quasi-Violet Palace Realm. But his aura didn’t stop there and it actually reached the Violet Palace Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Tianming wasn’t able to push his palm forward anymore when it was half an inch away from Lin Yun’s head. The Violet Palace Realm’s aura coming from Lin Yun made his body tremble and he was deeply shocked in his heart. He didn’t dare to believe what he was seeing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, a tiger roar echoed and a massive tiger palm descended from the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No!” Han Tianming panicked and he wanted to retreat, but it was already too late. Lin Yun had been waiting for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the palm landed on the ground, Han Tianming was reduced to meat paste. The street exploded and the ground trembled under the power. Countless people were being thrown into the sky under the turbulence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come with me!” Lin Yun’s gaze fell onto Xin Yan who was in the carriage and he soared into the sky without any hesitation.</span></p>
