 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They didn’t come after us?” Li Wuyou was confused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nope, but there’s something unusual about this place…” Lin Yun looked at the bamboo woods that were shrouded in mist. At first glance, he found this place to be strange. However, there was something familiar about this place that made his heart palpitate. Lin Yun took a gamble when he dove into the woods. He gambled that his pursuers wouldn’t follow him. It was clear that he won his gamble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it appeared that the danger wasn’t over yet. The Dragon Blooded Horse ran around the woods and led to the discovery that they were lost. They ran around blindly, and before they knew it, they discovered that the exit was nowhere to be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Wuyou let out a cough. There was a trace of blood dripping down from his lips, which made him look even weaker.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come down. I’ll help you get rid of the sword intent lingering in your body,” said Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But this place…” responded Li Wuyou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry about it right now,” replied Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun instructed the Dragon Blooded Horse to stay where it was and he helped Li Wuyou down. If it was someone besides Lin Yun, there would be no hope for Li Wuyou. However, Lin Yun was different. His incomplete sword intent was stronger than Huangfu Jingxuan’s. So much so that he wasn’t far from obtaining a complete sword intent. All Lin Yun had to do was destroy the sword intent lingering in Li Wuyou’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bear with it. I’ll remove the sword intent to prevent any harm done in your body,” said Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry too much. Although my physique can’t compare to your Thunderblitz Battle Physique, I've been nourishing it for years.” Li Wuyou smiled to assure Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then I’ll start.” Lin Yun placed his hand behind Li Wuyou and poured his sword intent in. When Lin Yun’s sword intent poured into Li Wuyou’s body, it started to clash with Huangfu Jingxuan’s sword intent. Li Wuyou could feel the two sword intents battling within his body, which tormented him enormously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire process lasted for half an hour before Lin Yun finally got rid of the sword intent in Li Wuyou’s body. Raising his hand, Lin Yun retracted his sword intent back into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll take a short rest…” Li Wuyou weakly spoke out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go ahead.” After Li Wuyou fell asleep, Lin Yun instructed the Dragon Blooded Horse to stay while he examined their surroundings. The bamboo around them towered over like swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This must be a forbidden ground that Huangfu Jingxuan and the others don’t dare to enter. But why does it feel familiar?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Lin Yun closed his eyes and sensed the surroundings. There was a crisp noise ringing in his ears. Opening his eyes, Lin Yun now knew why this place felt familiar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were runes on the bamboo. The runes were extremely similar to those recorded in the Age Sutra. When he noticed that, the fog started to clear up in his eyes. A short moment later, a stone tablet appeared in his vision, with the words ‘Sword Burial Woods’ written on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he saw the words on the stone tablet, Lin Yun’s face changed. The words were like dragons as they were written with powerful strokes. Once glance sent a chill in his heart. It felt like he was stabbed by a sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind the stone tablet was a bamboo forest that looked extraordinary. Cautiously taking a step back, Lin Yun returned from where he came. He joined the Dragon Blooded Horse and Li Wuyou, who had regained his consciousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Lin Yun, Li Wuyou’s eyes lit up, “Big brother, have you found the way?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Lin Yun replied, “I have a rough idea on how to return.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Return?” Li Wuyou shook his head. “Going back is a dead-end for us. With Wang Ning’s personality, he will definitely send someone to guard the exit, waiting for us. We need to find another exit out of this woods.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun pondered briefly and didn’t say a word. Li Wuyou was right. Even if they went back, they would face the same situation all over again. Lin Yun did not want to experience it all over again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come with me,” Lin Yun spoke out as he led Li Wuyou and the horse over to the stone tablet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sword Burial Woods?” Li Wuyou’s face changed when he saw the words on the stone tablet. Looking at the densely packed bamboo woods, his face had an ugly expression. He could tell that this was a forbidden ground. The fog behind them could only make them lost, but the bamboo woods before them meant death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So it’s still death either way…” Li Wuyou shrugged with a bitter smile. Whether they were going back the same way or setting foot in the forbidden ground, neither of the options were good choices.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Well, this might be an opportunity,” said Lin Yun optimistically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you mean?” asked Li Wuyou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Take a look for yourself,” responded Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the Sword Burial Woods, Lin Yun flicked his finger and unleashed a wisp of sword flash. In an instant, thousands of sword flashes exploded on the bamboo woods. Every single bamboo became crystal clear and shined brightly as they were permeated with boundless sword intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woods didn’t seem normal. Instead, they seemed like thousands of swords that were stuck in the ground. Each of them contained powerful sword intent. When the sword intent connected together, it suddenly formed into an ocean of sword intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Wuyou’s breathing sped up. “What terrifying sword intent. I’m afraid that even a Violet Palace Realm cultivator would be turned into a hornet’s nest under the sword intent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But when he turned around, he noticed that Lin Yun had disappeared. Looking around, Li Wuyou found Lin Yun walking towards the Sword Burial Woods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Yun, don’t be impulsive!” Li Wuyou suddenly became nervous. However, Lin Yun waved his hand in response, motioning for Li Wuyou to stay put.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before Lin Yun even set foot in the woods, he could sense countless complicated runes that were buried in the area. The runes were a hundred times more complicated than the ones he had grasped. Even the runes he used to imprint the Xiantian Pellets were incomparable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Complete sword intent!” Lin Yun was certain that the sword intent within these runes were complete. Unlike the incomplete sword intent, only the completed one could be considered genuine sword intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Otherwise, there would always be a flaw in the incomplete sword intent. Lin Yun only grasped the incomplete sword intent and he was only one step away from completing it. The Sword Burial Woods might turn out to be an opportunity for him to grasp the complete sword intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What should I do…” Li Wuyou was worried by Lin Yun putting himself in danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lin Yun took ten steps into the bamboo woods, the sword intents had brewed up to an incredibly dense level. They were like ferocious beasts, swaying in the woods that enveloped Lin Yun.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Wuyou did not dare to take a look and even the Dragon Blooded Horse was feeling uneasy. But suddenly, Lin Yun unleashed a burst of sword aura, which gradually formed into pure incomplete sword intent. His sword intent was like the ocean, rippling around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun seemed to be stepping on the air and a dazzling radiance emitted from him. His hair and clothes were fluttering in the wind. The Dragon Blooded Horse’s patience had run out and it wanted to charge in. But before the Dragon Blooded Horse could move, Li Wuyou pulled on the reins, “Don’t go. He’s trying to comprehend something.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was curious how Lin Yun managed to enter the Sword Burial Woods. If he was in Lin Yun’s shoes, he would be turned into a beehive by now. But thinking back to how Lin Yun managed to resolve the fog, Li Wuyou knew that Lin Yun must have a trump card.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Stepping on the ocean of sword intent, Lin Yun continued walking forward. However, each step he took was filled with danger. Layers of runes were fluctuating. The boundless sword intent was blowing in his direction like tidal waves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Li Wuyou squinted his eyes, he finally saw what was going on. Lin Yun was cultivating his sword intent. He wanted to hone his incomplete sword intent through the Sword Burial Woods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a big heart he has…” Li Wuyou was shocked. He knew how difficult it was to comprehend a complete sword intent. After all, there weren’t many people who could even comprehend an incomplete sword intent in the Xiantian Realm. As for the complete sword intent, it was simply a pipe dream.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There weren’t many disciples in the Sword Firmament Pavilion who could comprehend the complete sword intent, not to mention the newcomers. If Lin Yun could grasp the complete sword intent, then he could be compared to the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s Bai Lixuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Lixuan was only in the seventh orifice of the Xiantian Realm, but he had comprehended the complete sword intent. He even managed to defeat many Profound Martial Realm cultivators. However, Bai Lixuan was a special exception. After all, he was trying to promote his Ninth Grade Spiritual Physique into the Saint Physique. This was the only reason why he stayed in the Xiantian Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Deep in the Sword Burial Woods, Lin Yun closed his eyes and continued walking forward. He could sense the powerful sword intent released from the runes around him. To create such an array, not only was sword intent required, but comprehension for runes were also necessary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun felt that he had stepped onto the path of no return. If he couldn’t comprehend the complete sword intent here, he would surely lose his life.</span></p>
