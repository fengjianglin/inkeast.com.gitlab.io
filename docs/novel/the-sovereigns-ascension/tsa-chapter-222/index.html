 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Great Qin Empire’s capital was where the prestigious and the nobles gathered. When the news got out that the Myriad Treasure Pavilion possessed top-tiered Greater Profound Pellets, it instantly caused a huge commotion. Greater Profound Pellets provided a great advantage for cultivators trying to unlock their profound veins and the difference between the pellets would greatly affect their cultivation speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then again, the body would build up resistance if it refined too much of the same pellet. In a nutshell, the first Greater Profound Pellet would provide the best effect as the effects would gradually decrease over time after repeated consumption.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Also, the Greater Profound Pellet’s effects would significantly decrease after reaching the third stage of the Profound Martial Realm. The pellets had to be high-quality with at least 50% medicinal effect in order to be effective. As for pellets with 70%, it naturally went without saying. So what was the concept behind the 90% medicinal effects?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It could boost the cultivation of a sixth stage Profound Martial Realm into the seventh stage. Taking it would have the same effect as consuming the Greater Profound Pellet for the very first time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So one could imagine what effect it would bring to those who had consumed Greater Profound Pellets for a long time to the point that the medicinal effects dropped to zero. Those cultivators would naturally go insane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, Feng Jue of the Bloodwolf Mercenary was the greatest example. His cultivation had stopped in the sixth stage of the Profound Martial Realm for a long time, but he entered the seventh stage after consuming the Greater Profound Pellets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything went just as Feng Jue had expected. The Myriad Treasure Pavilion sold the Greater Profound Pellets in the form of an auction. Bids were placed on bottles that contained three pellets and the sales were limited to just three bottles a day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The remaining 18 pellets would be mixed with ordinary Greater Profound Pellets for auction. Each bottle would have one Greater Profound Pellet with 90% medicinal effects and 100 ordinary Greater Profound Pellets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Honestly speaking, this sort of method was the same as robbery. But even so, the Myriad Treasure Pavilion was still crowded. The fourth floor space was full almost every day and the sales of the other pellets got better because of this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Yue was extremely excited about the Myriad Treasure Pavilion’s popularity. The business in the Myriad Treasure Pavilion wasn’t just good. The revenue from the last few days was equivalent to the revenue that they gained in a single month.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With this, Ku Yun was promised 50% of sales. The increment might not seem like a lot, but the materials, alchemy chamber, and sales channels were all provided by the Myriad Treasure Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So it was an optimistic income for Ku Yun, Lin Yun, and Li Wuyou. Naturally, it was undoubtedly a piece of good news to Lin Yun. Cultivating the Iris Sword Sutra required an enormous amount of resources. So the more spiritual jades, the better. But for the time being, Lin Yun still had no intention of using Greater Profound Pellets to cultivate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His pellets were popular because the elites in the capital had developed a strong resistance towards the regular Greater Profound Pellets. Furthermore, upon reaching the late phase of the Profound Martial Realm, cultivators would have to rely on stronger Greater Profound Pellets to increase their cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun had just entered the Profound Martial Realm, so he didn’t want to start relying on pellets so early. Ku Yun also gave him the same suggestion not to start consuming pellets and only consume them when reaching a bottleneck in order to make a breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It might be slower to rely on spiritual jades, but the sheer amount would make up for the speed difference. Lin Yun could naturally tell which was more beneficial to him. During his free time in the Myriad Treasure Pavilion, he didn’t waste a single minute and spent every time he had to cultivate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blink of an eye, ten days had passed. A third of the time remaining to his fight with Ye Liuyun had passed. During this period, Lin Yun was cultivating with an unimaginable amount of spiritual jades. In just ten days, his cultivation rapidly progressed and he reached a critical moment. He was just one step away from the second stage of the Profound Martial Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back in the Glittering Pavilion. Fu Guang and Liu Yue had harvested greatly after ten days of refining. They had refined a total of 400 Greater Profound Pellets with 70% medicinal effects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m afraid that we will cause a huge sensation in the capital the moment these pellets flow into the market.” Liu Yue looked at the bottles on the table with a grave expression. Aside from being an alchemist, she was also a cultivator. So she naturally knew the temptation of these Greater Profound Pellets with 70% medicinal effects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fu Guang also had an unconcealable joy flashing on his face. He spoke out, “This time, the Glittering Pavilion intends to monopolize the market and increase the price of Greater Profound Pellets. These 400 pellets can sell for at least 50,000 spiritual jades in which you will have a share. After all, I wouldn’t be so fast without your help.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I dare not. I’m just an apprentice and I’m grateful enough that I can help you,” said Liu Yue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fu Guang nodded his head gently. He was satisfied with how Liu Yue, the daughter of the Flying Dragon General, behaved before him. He laughed, “Today is my Pellet Opening Ceremony and every alchemist in the capital will be here. You will soon be able to inscribe one star spiritual runes, so it is fortunate that you accompanied me this time. I’ll introduce you to them and lay out a path for you in advance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Yue couldn’t help rejoicing when she heard that. After all, it wasn’t easy to join the social circle of alchemists. This was undoubtedly an opportunity for her to have Fu Guang bring her in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master, will this ceremony be very lively?” Liu Yue asked. She had not experienced this kind of ceremony in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’ll be beneficial for you to experience more. I still remember how the Glittering Pavilion was packed in the previous ceremony. If I remember correctly, the Glittering Pavilion’s sales on that day were five times greater than normal,” Fu Guang smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Five times!” Liu Yue smiled. “Master, you are truly worthy of your reputation. And to think, Ku Yun still wants to be compared to you. What wishful thinking!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fu Guang’s face turned dark at the mention of Ku Yun. “That idiot. Not only is he a piece of trash, but he nearly embarrassed me before the Glittering Pavilion. Once we’re done with the ceremony, I’ll reprimand him when we return to the Pellet Hall.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Yue rejoiced when she heard that. Ku Yun had humiliated her in public previously in the Pellet Hall, not to mention that he was close to Lin Yun. This fact alone had left her unhappy for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go. It’s time to go to the main hall.” Fu Guang cleaned up the Greater Profound Pellets on the table and led Liu Yue out. But when they came out, they saw Hall Master Mo standing outside with a bitter expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It looks like you’ve been waiting for a long time, Hall Master Mo. Come, lead the way!” Fu Guang smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Hall Master Mo heard that, his face turned ugly and he stuttered, “M-M-Master Fu Guang… I’m afraid that the ceremony will have to be canceled…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Canceled?” Fu Guang’s face sank. He questioned, “Hall Master Mo, are you messing with me here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I dare not, but how can we continue with the ceremony without a single soul outside?” Hall Master Mo replied with a bitter smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s impossible!” Fu Guang said in a deep voice. “Did you not advertise that I’m here? Aside from me, who else can refine such excellent Greater Profound Pellets in the capital?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I already advertised that you were here ten days ago. But there’s really no one in the main hall…” Hall Master Mo replied truthfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How can that be?!” Fu Guang harrumphed with disbelief clearly written on his face. He was dumbfounded when he came out to the main hall. The hall was empty and there wasn’t a single soul in sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This…” Fu Guang’s face turned pale. Today should be his ceremony, but there wasn’t a single soul here. There was no way someone as prideful as him could bear it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s going on?” Fu Guang said coldly with a trembling voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master Fu Guang, we made a blunder this time. The Myriad Treasure Pavilion invited an alchemist who can refine Greater Profound Pellets with 90% medicinal effects. It started seven days ago and every single day has been a huge blow to the Glittering Pavilion’s business,” Hall Master Mo replied bitterly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Everyone has gone there and I even heard that the Myriad Treasure Pavilion is hosting their last auction today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fu Guang was briefly stunned before he sneered, “90% medicinal effects? How can that be possible? My Greater Profound Pellets are the best. Forget 90% medical effects, it’s impossible to even get 80% medicinal effects!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hall Master Mo wanted to cry at this moment. He wasn’t an alchemist, so how would he know about that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He now had a backlog of 300,000 ordinary Greater Profound Pellets that he couldn’t sell. The business was all taken away by the Myriad Treasure Pavilion. The Pavilion Master even gave him a death order that the 300,000 ordinary Greater Profound Pellets had to be cleared by this month. If he failed his task, then he would have to take full responsibility for the losses. But there was no way he could pay the Glittering Pavilion back even if he became a slave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Liu Yue, come with me to take a look at the Myriad Treasure Pavilion,” Fu Guang said with a darkened face. “Let’s take a look at who has such great skill!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With that, the two immediately rushed to the Myriad Treasure Pavilion. When they arrived, the scene surprised them. There was a long queue outside the Myriad Treasure Pavilion. Aside from those of nobility, everyone had to queue in the long line. This scene was entirely different from the Glittering Pavilion that was completely empty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I heard that Master Fu Guang’s Pellet Opening Ceremony is today. Why didn’t you go there?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why the hell would I go there? I took a peek earlier and there wasn't a single soul present.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha. Screw the Glittering Pavilion. They’re just a bunch of merchants without conscience to price. They sell Greater Profound Pellets with 70% medicinal effects for 300 spiritual jades. The highest auction in the Myriad Treasure Pavilion only amounted to 400 spiritual jades.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Furthermore, today is the last day of the auction. We might not be able to buy it anymore if we don’t come today.” The crowd was chatting among themselves while they waited. It was inevitable that they would talk about Fu Guang’s Pellet Opening Ceremony and the Myriad Treasure Pavilion’s auction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Things wouldn’t be so bad without a comparison. Fu Guang’s face turned dark instantly when he saw this scene, and he snorted, “Good! Myriad Treasure Pavilion! They’re trying to slap my face on purpose to place their last auction on the same day as my Pellet Opening Ceremony!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Liu Yue’s face was dark with anger. She spoke out, “Master, I’ll get the Divine Guards to seal the Myriad Treasure Pavilion!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Calm down.” Fu Guang continued in a deep voice, “Greater Profound Pellets can’t have 90% medicinal effects. There must be some heretical techniques being used. I’ll teach them a lesson after exposing them. Since they want to slap my face, I’ll make sure that this alchemist won’t be allowed to stay in the capital!”</span></p>
