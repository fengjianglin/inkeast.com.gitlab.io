 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a long time later, Xin Yan sighed with a smile, “Junior Brother, you’re really unfathomable. You scared us again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You don’t need to exaggerate...” replied Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three core disciples of the Primal Origin Sect were strong. If he faced them before entering the Demonlotus Realm, he would just barely protect himself after using all his trump cards. But they were weaker than Feng Ye, who received a ranking in the previous Dragon Gate Competition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were elites, but not monstrous geniuses. His eyesight was now on a whole new level and he was no longer a small fry like how he was back then. He might still be weaker than the eight titles, but he would soon catch up to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battle with Feng Ye had increased his confidence. With the quasi-xiantian sword intent, Lin Yun could walk out of the Great Qin Empire and make a name for himself sooner or later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xuanjun looked at Lin Yun deeply. He had truly underestimated Lin Yun. Xin Yan and the other disciples of the Sword Firmament Pavilion didn’t witness how Lin Yun fought the three core disciples. But Chen Xuanjun had witnessed Lin Yun’s temperament and it was the same as the eight titles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Lin Yun’s strength was still lacking, his courage wasn't inferior to any of the eight titles. He couldn’t imagine the level Lin Yun would reach when he grew as old as the eight titles. At that time, the entire Great Qin Empire would be dull before his sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xuanjun now knew why the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s Pavilion Master ordered Lin Yun to the Demonlotus Realm, despite the danger. The Pavilion Master had probably noticed the courage and potential in Lin Yun. Lin Yun wasn’t an ordinary monstrous genius, but he was a true dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Demonlotus Realm was like a pool for Lin Yun to transform into a dragon. This was his fate, even if he were to die here. Lin Yun would either rise or die an earth-shattering death. Someone like him couldn't be ordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother, how are your injuries?” Lin Yun noticed that Chen Xuanjun’s complexion wasn’t well. The injuries he suffered must be more serious than Lin Yun had imagined. Chen Xuanjun was also the reason why Lin Yun was able to defeat the three core disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then again, Lin Yun was confident of defeating the three core disciples even without Chen Xuanjun. However, it might take a bit longer for him to accomplish that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My injuries are fine. But it’ll take four to five days for me to recover my full strength. However, the Black Lotus Palace will be opening soon.” Chen Xuanjun was depressed when he looked at the black beam slowly dimming. The Black Lotus Palace was a great opportunity for him, so it was a great blow to him that he couldn’t enter the Black Lotus Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If Senior Brother can’t enter the Black Lotus Palace, then the Primal Origin Sect can also dream of entering!” Xin Yan said in a solemn voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This isn’t the first time they’ve done this!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’re lucky to have junior brother by our side this time. I have no idea if we’ll be this lucky the next time around.” Tang Tong and everyone else expressed their fury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xuanjun smiled, “What are you guys talking about? You guys can’t lose this opportunity just because of me. Otherwise, what’s the meaning of us coming to the Black Lotus Palace?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no need for us to enter in such a hurry. We can wait till senior brother recovers from his injuries. As for the Primal Origin Sect, I can guarantee that their injuries are more serious than Senior Brother Chen,” said Lin Yun. Removing Lin Yun’s quasi-xiantian sword intent from their bodies wasn’t easy. Most likely, Zhang Yan wasn’t in a good condition after receiving Lin Yun’s sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief pause, Lin Yun continued, “Furthermore, it’s not necessarily a piece of bad news to enter a few days later. I don’t believe that the first to enter will receive the opportunity in the Black Lotus Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words left everyone stunned. Everyone knew that logic, but who could control the temptation?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Jing Jue’s here.” A youth’s appearance attracted everyone’s attention. The Sevendespair Palace’s Jing Jue was ranked nineteenth in the previous Dragon Gate Competition when he was only sixteen and was famed for his Sevendespair Saber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Tong’s face turned cold when he saw Jing Jue, “That fellow’s here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother Tang, you ran into him previously?” asked Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I nearly got killed by him. Luckily, my reinforcements came just in time,” said Tang Tong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Jue didn’t show any intention of stopping when he fought Xin Yan. He only left when the other senior brothers arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mu Xiuhan is here!” A cold aura suddenly appeared out of nowhere and Mu Xiuhan appeared before everyone with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone began to distance themselves from Mu Xiuhan when they saw him. Mu Xiuhan had built up a notorious name for himself in the Demonlotus Realm. Almost everyone who ran into him had died. Many people even felt that Mu Xiuhan was unquestionably the strongest in the Demonlotus Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bai Yue and the Demonflame Sect are also here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Feng Ye too!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tang Yi, who was ranked twentieth in the previous Dragon Gate Competition, is also here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“More and more experts are gathering.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The atmosphere slowly reached the climax as everyone started to gather. Everyone gradually forgot Lin Yun’s mighty feat of defeating three core disciples. When more people came, everyone’s focus gradually shifted to the Black Lotus Palace. All of them were guessing who would be the ultimate winner in the Black Lotus Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the black beam that connected heaven and earth suddenly crumbled, and a majestic palace appeared in everyone’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The beam is gone!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We can enter the palace now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’re right on time.” Everyone unhesitantly flew towards the Black Lotus Palace in excitement. It was a shocking scene to see everyone executing all kinds of movement techniques.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In just fifteen minutes, the bustling crowd disappeared in the blink of an eye. The rest also rushed towards the palace in a hurry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lin Yun saw that Chen Xuanjun was about to speak, he interrupted, “Senior Brother Chen, there’s no need for you to be in such a hurry. Who can take the responsibility if something happens to you while we go in?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right. Senior Brother, you can rest assured and heal your injuries here. We’ll protect you,” smiled Xin Yan. All the other disciples also smiled along.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun patted his interspatial pouch and took out a jar of Monkey Wine. “This wine is called Monkey Wine. It should allow all your strength to grow stronger after refining it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Monkey Wine?!” Tang Tong and the other disciples’ eyes lit up when they saw the wine. “This is a famous wine that you can’t even buy with spiritual jades.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only was Monkey Wine known for its taste, but it would also benefit one’s cultivation. Drinking it allowed one’s strength to improve. Then again, the effects had already been weakened for Lin Yun. He already drank it several times, but Tang Tong and everyone else hadn’t tried it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xuanjun knew that Lin Yun was making compensation on his behalf. With that, he no longer argued and circulated his cultivation technique to treat his injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once the jar was uncovered, a wine fragrance traveled out and Yan Ding quickly took out several cups. The Monkey Wine piqued everyone’s interests.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Brother, where are you going?” Xin Yan quickly asked, seeing that Lin Yun was suddenly leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry about me. I’ll be back shortly. Just leave me a cup.” Lin Yun soon disappeared from Xin Yan’s sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Yan smiled when she saw this scene. She knew that Lin Yun had truly grown up, so she didn’t have to worry about him because of his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother, you can treat your injuries here. We’ll take our leave first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, the Black Lotus Palace is open, so we can’t stay with you any longer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Yan’s face was ugly when he saw this scene. The Black Lotus Palace had just opened, but these people were already so impatient to enter. Zhao Quan and Xiao Ming only took a fist from Lin Yun. Although they also suffered injuries, it was nothing compared to the injury on Zhang Yan’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two took Lin Yun’s attack together, so they were naturally in a better condition than him. After everyone left, Zhang Yan’s face was dark when he saw the wound on his chest. It was all Lin Yun’s fault!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His injuries weren't serious, but he couldn’t remove the sword intent left in his wound. His wound would hurt whenever he circulated his origin energy. It wasn’t suitable for him to enter the Black Lotus Palace in this state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Yun, I’ll make you pay the price. Even if I can’t kill you, I’ll make everyone around you suffer the pain I suffered today!” declared Zhang Yan. But a sudden breeze blew and his face changed. When he raised his head, he saw someone unexpected. It was a youth carrying a sword box on his back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re here to kill me?” asked Zhang Yan in a cold voice. His face twitched and he couldn’t contain the fear and uneasiness in his heart. However, Lin Yun didn’t reply to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“One must be prepared to kill or be killed. I’m not surprised that you’re here to kill me, but I advise you against it.” A Blackflame Crow appeared in his hand and he poured his origin energy into it. Seeing that Lin Yun wasn’t speaking, a smile appeared on Zhang Yan’s face, “The consequences of killing a core disciple from one of the four major sects isn’t as simple as you imagined. Being able to defeat me doesn’t mean that you can kill me, even if I’m heavily injured now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even a rabbit will bite when it becomes anxious, not to mention that Zhang Yan was a core disciple of the Primal Origin Sect. But Lin Yun still didn’t say a word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Die then!” Zhang Yan raged and threw the Blackflame Crow out of his sleeve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun merely raised his hand and unleashed the Flicking Divine Sword. The Blackflame Crow was pierced by a violet ray and fell to the ground. At the same time, Lin Yun drew the Flower Burial Sword and dashed past Zhang Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As blood splattered, Zhang Yan took his last breath as his eyes opened wide. His decapitated head fell behind Lin Yun. Zhang Yan punched Lin Yun, but he also took Lin Yun’s sword. Everything was within Lin Yun’s grasp. Lin Yun had purposely revealed a weakness to Zhang Yan to obtain the sure-kill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun wasn’t afraid of Zhang Yan’s attack before his death. He was only afraid of Zhang Yan escaping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun’s attack split the rock up ahead in two, revealing a bewitching flower in the shadow. Looking at the flower, Lin Yun gently bent down and plucked it. Putting it up to his nose, Lin Yun took a deep sniff, “You also have a pitiful life. No one can see how gorgeous you are. Then again, you’re also unfortunate since no one can admire you.”</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s gathering location, Tang Tong was carefully pouring wine. The Monkey Wine was precious. He poured so carefully because he didn’t want to spill even a single drop. After the sixth cup, Tang Tong smiled, “Let’s leave the seventh cup for junior brother. Don’t forget about him. He will be touched if he knows about it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thanks.” Lin Yun suddenly appeared and gulped down the cup of wine. This made everyone else shocked by Lin Yun’s quick return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Brother, did you go to pluck a flower?” Xin Yan smiled as she looked at the flower in Lin Yun’s hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun was briefly stunned by Xin Yan’s words before he smiled, “Yeah. Here, it’s for you.”</span></p>
