 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Iris Sword Sutra was given to Lin Yun by the Iris Sword Saint. It was a cultivation technique, but at the same time, it was also a key.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ancient times were also known as the Golden Age, where monstrous geniuses were seen everywhere vying for supremacy. It was a glorious age that showed how extraordinary the Iris Sword Saint was since he could run wild during that time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It made sense that the Iris Sword Sutra that he left behind was extraordinary. The sword sutra had sixteen stages. The first six stages were the foundation to refine origin energy and manifest the Iris Flower. So regardless of how powerful the first six stages were, they were just the foundation. The seventh stage and onwards was the true beginning of power, allowing the cultivator to manifest the Iris Sword aura within the body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun had just made his breakthrough into the seventh stage and he still had a long way to go to reach the pinnacle. However, he now had 150,000 first-grade spiritual jades. He had an abundance of resources, but he had no idea how many spiritual jades he would need in the remaining twenty days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The body was only the vessel. This meant that there was a limit to how much his vessel could absorb within a short period or else he would explode. No one could refine resources endlessly. Lin Yun couldn’t even do this with the Sky Devourer Art.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“With the Dracophant Battle Physique, my body is akin to a beast. I might as well give it a try and see if I can refine 100,000 first-grade spiritual jades in twenty days.” After all, how would he know unless he tried?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun placed his hand on the interspatial pouch and retrieved a pile of spiritual jades. The spiritual jades were emitting spiritual energy and a bright glow. The spiritual energy in the spiritual jades looked like liquefied crystals. Anyone would laugh if someone said that he or she wanted to refine so many spiritual jades in twenty days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun leaped into the sky and landed on the pile of spiritual jades with his legs crossed. He began circulating the Iris Sword Sutra through his hands. The Iris Flower in his Dantian began to bloom and violet origin energy starting to course through his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While circulating the Iris Sword Sutra, the pile of spiritual jades beneath Lin Yun’s body began to pour into his body as spiritual energy. It was like a river converging into the sea or like demonic beasts charging into Lin Yun’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If someone else did this without having a strong enough physique, they would either suffer from the backlash or their bodies would explode if they were being careless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Lin Yun’s cultivation and cultivation technique were both making rapid progress, the process didn’t exactly feel comfortable. But as the dracophant energy started to permeate his internal organs, meridians, flesh, and bones, it began to help Lin Yun fight the impact of spiritual energy entering his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I endured it?” Lin Yun rejoiced when he saw that he managed to endure the heavy load he was putting on his body. It was all thanks to the Dracophant Battle Physique. If he didn’t have such a powerful physique, he wouldn’t dare to do something like this even if he had balls of steel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun continued guiding the spiritual energy into his body and gathered them on the Iris Flower. It didn’t take long for another petal to appear on the Iris Flower, bringing the number to forty-three petals. If Lin Yun could really refine 100,000 first-grade spiritual jades, he might even be able to make a breakthrough into the eighth stage in the sword sutra.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, he was benefiting from Xue Feng’s wealth. Lin Yun suppressed the excitement that was glowing deep in his eyes and focused on refining the spiritual jades. Even though he had the Dracophant Battle PHysique, he couldn’t be so careless. What he was doing now was equivalent to gambling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time passed quickly during the refinery. However, Lin Yun was too focused to discover the boiling atmosphere in the Sword Firmament Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did you hear?! The Alliance-Union Battle will be held in the Burial Sword Peak!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s one of the four great lands and it’s the most mysterious one! It’s tough to enter, even for inner disciples. Yet the sect is actually going to use it for the Alliance-Union Battle?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I heard that the demonic beasts living in the Burial Sword Peak possess sword intent. Refining their beast cores can increase our sword intent directly. The effects are even better than the Myriad Sword Platform!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Alliance-Union Battle is going insane this time around. Not only will it be taking place in the Burial Sword Peak, but the sect even took out a reward of a hundred inner disciples’ quota!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Inner disciples are those who can practice spiritual cultivation techniques and the resources they receive every month is a hundred times greater than ours! Under normal circumstances, you have to undergo several tests if you want to become an inner sect disciple.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s nothing. The champion will even be rewarded with a cosmic artifact. I’ve been in the Sword Firmanment Pavilion for so long and I’ve never heard of the sect rewarding cosmic artifacts…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">People would generally become more courageous when larger rewards were available. In the past, many people feared death and didn’t dare to join the Alliance-Union Battle. However, the temptation was too great this time. As a result, the number of people signing up for the Alliance-Union Battle was ten times more than in past years. Many disciples even rushed back from their missions for the Alliance-Union Battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no doubt that this would become the biggest Alliance-Union Battle over the past hundred years. Time gradually passed and only three days were left until the Alliance-Union Battle. The current excited atmosphere even suppressed the news of Lin Yun killing Xue Feng and ringing the Phoenix Plum.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On a lone peak in the Locket Mountain, the sun shined on a violet crystal statue. When you looked at it carefully, the statue revealed a youth that was sitting with his legs crossed. And if you moved even closer, you would realize that the statue was actually an ice statue created from solidifying spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, a powerful heartbeat could be heard from inside the statue. It sounded like something was trying to break free. The heartbeat grew louder and louder, causing the ice sculpture to shatter. After being shattered, a youth emerged from inside the ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the youth opened his eyes, a violet glow flickered across his pupils. This youth was Lin Yun. Lin Yun balled his fists together to sense the power surging through his body. He could feel that he was much stronger than before and that his cultivation had reached the pinnacle fourth stage of the Profound Martial Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a breath, the youth smiled as he muttered to himself, “I’m never doing something like this again. I nearly suffocated myself. If that actually happened, I would have become the biggest joke in the Sword Firmament Pavilion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The density of the spiritual energy that he was refining from the spiritual jades was too high and it actually stuck to his body. The spiritual energy gradually accumulated and shocked Lin Yun because he discovered that he had been trapped in an ice sculpture. If he hadn’t broken out, he would have died from suffocation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“At least the harvest this time isn’t bad. The Iris Sword Sutra reached the pinnacle seventh stage and the Iris Flower now has forty-seven petals. I’m only one petal away from reaching the eighth stage…” His Iris Sword Sutra went from the initial seventh stage to the pinnacle seventh stage in twenty days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this was an ordinary cultivation technique or even an ordinary spiritual cultivation technique, it would be nothing impressive. However, this was the Iris Sword Sutra. It was the Iris Sword Saint’s cultivation technique and he was a powerhouse that vied for supremacy in ancient times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The improvement made Lin Yun excited and he even wanted to shout for joy. But fortunately, he managed to maintain his composure. He clenched his fists and threw out a punch. His sword intent merged with the Dragon-Tiger Fist and caused the entire peak to tremble. At the same time, his fist released a brilliant violet radiance with sword intent that buzzed into the surrounding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not bad. My punch is at least two times stronger than before.” Joy could be seen in Lin Yun’s eyes when he sensed his improvements. “I wonder if I can circulate the Iris Flower now…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, Lin Yun was only able to move the Iris Flower by half an inch. But even then, the power that came from it was shocking. According to what was recorded on the sword sutra, there would be a phenomenon if he could make a complete circulation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun placed his palm on the ground and the Iris Flower started to bloom in his Dantian. As soon as the flower bloomed, Lin Yun attempted to move it. He could sense the immense origin energy coursing through his body. He gnashed his teeth and let out a roar, bearing the harm brought by the adverse current in his origin energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Iris Flower circulated half a cycle before cracks started to spread out on the ground beneath his palm. In the next moment, a chunk of the peak fell off, making it a thousand meters shorter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun slowly floated into the sky and looked at the sea of clouds. He could sense that he had exhausted all the origin energy within his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Although I didn’t manage to get the Overlord Sword to greater mastery, it’s enough that I managed to get the Iris Sword Sutra to the pinnacle seventh stage. It even brought my cultivation to the pinnacle fourth stage of the Profound Martial Realm,” muttered Lin Yun with his hands behind his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, he had Xin Yan to thank for all of this.
