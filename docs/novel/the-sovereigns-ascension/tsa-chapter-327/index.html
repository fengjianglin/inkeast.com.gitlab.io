 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The group left the Sword Firmament Pavilion. At the same time, the other sects and the Heavenly Qin Institute also started to move out. The Heavenly Profound Sect was one of the four prestigious sects of the Great Qin Empire and they had the strongest foundation. Their Dragon-Tiger Fist was famous throughout the entire Great Qin Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They also obtained the best result in the previous Dragon Gate Competition among the four sects. In addition to Drifting Goblet, they had another disciple named Truecloud, who also received a title. They were the only sect in the entire Great Qin Empire to have two titles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Profound Sect had five people heading to the capital. The one leading the party was a bald man in his forties. He wore a kasaya that emitted faint spiritual rune flickers. If one looked at the kasaya carefully, they would realise that it was a powerful cosmic artifact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Profound Sect emphasized Buddhism, so half of their disciples were monks. They also accepted regular disciples, but they took in a lot of monks. Standing beside the bald man were two young disciples, one of which looked incredibly young. But despite being so young, that youth was already in the seventh stage of the Profound Martial Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth had an ordinary appearance. He wore white clothes that made him seem ethereal. His eyes would shock the souls of others, making him look extraordinary. At the same time, his eyes also contained the aura of a dragon and a tiger. Evidently he was the newly emerging genius from the Heavenly Profound Sect, Bai Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Profound Sect had the same thoughts as the Sword Firmament Pavilion. They wanted Bai Yu to broaden his horizon while suppressing the other sects if possible. As for the other three, they were different looking. There was one who looked ferocious and robust. He was one of the four experts in the third sequence, Wang Han.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Walking beside him was a young disciple who wore an indifferent expression that made him feel unfathomable. His name was Han Gang. He was like Xin Jue, a disciple in the second sequence, with the ability to compete with the eight titles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The four sects have always competed, so we can correctly anticipate a dispute to occur at the banquet. Our Heavenly Profound Sect is a Buddhist sect. Although we’re not interested in fame, we can’t embarrass the reputation that our seniors and senior brothers have built,” said Wang Han with narrowed eyes. Due to his ferocious looks, his smile looked terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Gang, who remained quiet throughout the journey suddenly spoke up, “That’s right. As disciples of the Heavenly Profound Sect, we’re naturally obliged to uphold the sect’s reputation, especially at an event like the princess’ birthday. All the famous people in the sect will be gathered there, so we can’t embarrass ourselves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The middle-aged man who was leading the party revealed a gratified smile upon hearing that. He spoke up, “The Heavenly Profound Sect might’ve received two titles during the Dragon Gate Competition, but we’re also declining. However, the three other sects and the Heavenly Qin Institute have shown promising juniors, especially the Sword Firmament Pavilion. They first had Bai Lixuan, and now, there’s Lin Yun. I heard that even though he is only seventeen, he became the champion of the Alliance-Union Battle and rang the Phoenix Plum.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Bai Yu’s eyes lit up when he heard this name. Bai Yu was a genius in the Heavenly Profound Sect, with great achievements in the Dragon-Tiger Fist. The Sect Master acknowledged him as someone with the highest chance of bringing the Dragon-Tiger Fist to complete mastery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Martial techniques were separated into four stages, the initial, lesser, greater, and complete mastery. But according to legend, there was another stage above that, the manifestation stage. However, it was rare for anyone to reach it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Han grinned, “I heard that Lin Yun uses the Dragon-Tiger Fist. I have no idea what’s wrong with Senior Brother Drifting Goblet for him to give it to an outsider.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun practised the Dragon-Tiger Fist and was good at it, which caused an uproar in the Heavenly Profound Sect. The sect’s upper hierarchy was furious. After all, the Dragon-Tiger Fist belonged to their sect. But when they discovered that it was Drifting Goblet who gave it to Lin Yun, they left the matter unsettled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Drifting Goblet was an oddball in the Heavenly Profound Sect. It was baffling that the sect didn’t pursue the matter any further. When the middle-aged monk and Han Gang heard Wang Han’s words, they smiled bitterly. They both had insider information. Although they were unhappy, there was nothing they could do. After all, it was Drifting Goblet that they were talking about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Outside the Primal Origin Sect, six people were riding their horses to the capital. The demonic beasts that they were riding all had black fur with spiritual eyes. It was a unique demonic beast that could only be found in the Primal Chaos Sect, the Blackscaled Horse. The Blackscaled Horse was rumoured to possess a trace of Qilin bloodline and they were demonic beasts that had a chance of reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a youth among the six who had defined features and a powerful aura. His clothes couldn’t conceal his powerful physique and his bulging muscles were filled with explosive power. At the same time, he was also releasing a powerful blade intent. If Lin Yun were here, he would’ve recognised this person. This youth was Zuo Yun, whom he met back in the Demoncloud Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Brother Zuo has been in seclusion ever since he returned from the Demoncloud Mountain Range. He’s already in the seventh stage of the Profound Martial Realm. Not only did he reach the third stage with the Dracophant Battle Physique, but his blade techniques are also terrifying. I bet he’ll soar like a phoenix at the banquet and let everyone know that the Sword Firmament Pavilion isn’t the only one with a monstrous genius.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’re just in time to crush Lin Yun at the banquet and humiliate the Sword Firmament Pavilion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Sword Firmament Pavilion has been acting mighty lately and they even rang their Phoenix Plum. They’re trying to flex their muscles.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among the four sects, the Sword Firmament Pavilion and Primal Origin Sect were the two that had been at each other’s throats. Their grudge ran deep. When they mentioned Lin Yun and the Sword Firmament Pavilion, the disciples and elders of the Primal Chaos Sect were filled with hostility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Zuo Yun smiled bitterly and kept his silence. Unlike his senior brothers, he had come in contact with Lin Yun. He had a good impression of Lin Yun, so he wasn’t surprised when Lin Yun became famous. But he didn’t have a choice. He couldn’t speak up for Lin Yun due to the Primal Origin Sect’s stance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been a few months since they last met and Zuo Yun was curious about Lin Yun’s growth. When he thought about Lin Yun, he was filled with anticipation for the birthday banquet. His eyes flared with a fighting spirit.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Oh Lin Yun, please don’t disappoint me…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuo Yun suffered a setback in the Demoncloud Mountain Range, which drove him to cultivate like a madman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a huge boat flew above everyone. There was a youth standing at the helm as he held onto a fan, looking elegant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elder leading the Primal Origin Sect looked up, and he muttered, “It’s the Demonic Moon Villa.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aside from the mysterious Demonic Moon Villa, no other forces dared to travel in the sky with boats in the Great Qin Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder, is that person Situ Yi?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The eyes of the Primal Origin Sect’s eyes lit up. That was a name that shook the empire just like Bai Lixuan’s had. The two of them were known as the Twin Stars of Great Qin. One of them went into seclusion while the other rarely left the sect. It had been a long time since anyone heard their names in the empire. But that didn’t mean that people would look down on them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Situ Yi is also participating in the birthday banquet?” Zuo Yun was shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aside from them, the various forces in the empire who were invited also began to move out. All of them were heading for the Princess Manor, and the clamor in the Great Qin Empire also became greater. No one could guess what would happen with so many geniuses gathered together.</span></p>
