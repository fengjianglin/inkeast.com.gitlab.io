 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Yue and Hu Xingyang’s faces turned pale when Lin Yun spoke, especially Hu Xingyang, who was trembling with fear. When the Second Hall Master, Leng Ya, heard Lin Yun’s words, his face turned cold and he looked at Hu Xingyang, “Is that true? Tell me honestly. Don’t try to lie.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Xingyang instantly felt a huge pressure on him. In the end, he could only be honest and replied, “H-H-Hall Master, please let me go this time…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You bastard!” Leng Ya roared. “A mere deacon like you dares to boss people around? You must be tired of living! You want to degrade someone to a herb slave? Great! I’ll satisfy you right now. Men, cripple his cultivation, he is to be punished as a herb slave for ten years. He’s not allowed to leave the Herbal Hall for the next ten years!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Xingyang’s heart nearly jumped out of his chest when he heard that, fear was enveloping him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why are you guys still standing around?!” yelled Leng Ya.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Understood!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon receiving their orders, the Herbal Hall’s guards stepped forward and struck Hu Xingyang twice with their palms. The first palm attack destroyed his Dantian and the second palm attack destroyed his Martial Soul. After receiving the strikes, Hu Xingyang instantly seemed to have grown a lot older.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, no one felt sympathy for him. The alchemists even applauded inwardly because a deacon like Hu Xingyang deserved to be abolished. Otherwise, they wouldn’t even know if they got into trouble because of Hu Xingyang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Take him away,” Leng Ya spoke out with an indifferent voice. Shortly after, several people stepped forward and dragged Hu Xingyang away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Liu Yue!” Leng Ya called out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Yue trembled and cupped her hands together, “I’m here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re even bolder than him! A deacon from the Herbal Hall like you dares to threaten an alchemist in the Pellet Hall?” Leng Ya reprimanded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Facing Leng Ya, Liu Yue could only gnash her teeth silently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your father sent you to the Herbal Hall because you have some talent in the ways of an alchemist. We’ve treated you well, especially the Third Hall Master. Tell me, has the Pellet Hall let you down?” Leng Ya continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I know my mistake. Please hand me my punishment.” Liu Yue lowered her head. She had lost her temper at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Leng Ya continued, “It’s good that you recognize your mistake. Go and apologize to Master Ku Yun and Lin Yun.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as Leng Ya spoke, everyone instantly knew that the Second Hall Master wasn’t going to punish Liu Yue. After all, Liu Yue was the daughter of the Divine Guard’s Commander.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Lin Yun was already satisfied with this outcome. After all, getting Liu Yue to apologize to him in public must’ve felt worse than being whipped.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Liu Yue’s face was unsightly. She never expected the matters today to develop in this way. Not only did she fail to make Lin Yun a herb slave, but she even had to apologize to Lin Yun in public.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite her reluctance, she knew that the Second Hall Master had been lenient. If she continued to cause trouble, it would only make things more complicated. At that time, she knew that she would suffer even more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Liu Yue apologizes to Master Ku Yun and Junior Brother Lin Yun. I’m sorry for what I’ve done.” When Liu Yue raised her head, her face was dyed purple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun merely smiled and accepted her apology calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay. THis matter is done now that she has apologized. In addition, Liu Yue will no longer serve as the deacon of the Herbal Hall and focus on her cultivation. Before she grasps the one star spiritual rune, she will not take up any positions,” said Leng Ya.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words were like a bolt of thunder falling upon Liu Yue. As a deacon in the Herbal Hall, Liu Yue didn’t have to do anything to receive benefits. But now, she smashed her own foot with a rock and lost her position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay, disperse.” Leng Ya waved his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Yue’s face was dark. She took a deep glance at Lin Yun before she left with her teeth gnashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huangfu Jingxuan’s heart nearly collapsed from what he just saw. The twists and turns today were too thrilling for him. He initially thought that Lin Yun would be relegated to a herb slave, but the situation had suddenly changed. Lin Yun did not receive any punishments and instead forged a relationship with a two star alchemist. His relationship with Ku Yun would guarantee that he wouldn’t have to worry about cultivation resources in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun even made Liu Yue lose her position as a deacon. As for Hu Xingyang, who seemed awe-inspiring three days ago, his outcome was even more miserable. He had his cultivation crippled and was relegated to a herb slave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Yun, I don’t know what to say right now. You dared to contend with Liu Yue and won,” Huangfu Jingxuan smiled bitterly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In the end, this is the Sword Firmament Pavilion. There’s nothing she can do here. I even dared to kill Wang Ning, so why would I be afraid of a lass like her?” Lin Yun replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Leng Ya left, Ku Yun returned and looked at Lin Yun, “Lin Yun, come with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun knew what Ku Yun wanted to say. So he cut his conversation short with Huangfu Jingxuan and followed Ku Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they returned to the Alchemy Chamber, Ku Yun wore a bitter smile and said, “Lin Yun, what am I going to do now since you said that I successfully refined the Firecloud Pellets. If the truth is exposed, not only will I be a laughingstock, but I might have a similar ending to Hu Xingyang…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He hadn’t grasped the Firecloud Spiritual Rune since it was done by Lin Yun. He was still far away from being a two-star alchemist. There was no way anyone could fool their way through the spiritualist profession. The truth would definitely be exposed in a few months.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Relax. Since I dared to say it, then I naturally have an idea to let you stay in this position firmly,” Lin Yun replied calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you mean?” asked Ku Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve gained insight to some things in the past three days. It’s too troublesome for me to refine pellets, so I’ll teach you the spiritual runes. Your talent isn’t bad, it's just that you’ve just taken some detours. I guarantee that you will surely improve with my teachings.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You teach me?” Ku Yun asked with disbelief. Although he knew that Lin Yun was a talent who could inscribe the Firecloud Spiritual Rune so quickly, Lin Yun was way too young whereas he had been on the path of a spiritualist for the past five decades.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You don’t believe me?” Lin Yun smiled and his aura suddenly changed. Using his finger as a brush, Lin Yun started drawing a Firecloud Spiritual Rune in the air. When he was done, Lin Yun let out a long breath. The exhaustion from drawing in the air with his finger was too great, it wasn’t like using a Spiritual Rune Brush. He actually consumed an entire wisp of age energy to do this, which Lin Yun wanted to use sparingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master!” Ku Yun was completely dumbfounded by what he saw and fell down on his knees. He had never heard that anyone could inscribe spiritual runes in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun quickly helped him up and smiled, “There’s no need for you to kneel again since you’ve done it previously. I only barely managed to inscribe in the air. It’s not as impressive as you think. But it should be more than enough for me to teach you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Enough. It’s absolutely enough!” Ku Yun nodded his head excitedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll teach you how to inscribe spiritual runes in the future when you refine pellets. We don’t need any rules between us. Speaking of which, we both have ‘Yun’ in our names, so this can be considered our fate.” Lin Yun smiled. Hiding behind the scenes would not only save him trouble, but he could also hide the Age Sutra’s existence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay. But where do I find you if I need help?” There was no reason for Ku Yun to refuse Lin Yun’s suggestion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun pondered briefly before he asked, “Do you know the Locket Mountain? I seem to be living in the rookie section of Locket Mountain. But I’m not sure where my residence is exactly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Locket Mountain? I know where it is. The Alliance-Union is pretty famous in the Sword Firmament Pavilion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, then I’ll be taking my leave first. I’ll come and look for you if I need anything.” Lin Yun had just come to the Sword Firmament Pavilion, so he wasn’t sure where he should go right now. He recognized the paths, but he wasn’t too sure about the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait.” Ku Yun stopped Lin Yun and handed a bag over, “Here are a thousand spiritual jades and a hundred Greater Profound Pellets. You can consider this as my gift to you for taking me in as your disciple.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun accepted the bag. This was the reason he decided to help Ku Yun become a two star alchemist. It was so that he could find a source to provide him with resources for his cultivation. Then again, Ku Yun was pretty tactful to give Lin Yun what he needed the most right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thanks. There’s no need to send me off.” Lin Yun was in a good mood when he came out of the Alchemy Chamber. He was confident that he would have indispensable resources in the future with Ku Yun around, not to mention that he could also make a lot of money.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, there was no way he could make any progress in his cultivation without resources. When he came to the lobby, he saw Huangfu Jingxuan waiting for him and asked, “Where are you going now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m going to the Myriad Sword Platform. It won’t be long before I comprehend the complete sword intent,” Huangfu Jingxuan smiled. There was a ray of confidence flickering between his brows. Aside from Lin Yun, Huangfu Jingxuan could be considered the most talented rookie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huangfu Jingxuan was supposed to shine brightly in the Nine Stars Contest, but Lin Yun’s appearance had overshadowed him. But even so, Huangfu Jingxuan still had his own pride.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun was shocked when he examined Huangfu Jingxuan. He could sense that Huangfu Jingxuan was only one step away from the complete sword intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Myriad Sword Platform is that amazing?” asked Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ll know if you come along,” Huangfu Jingxuan replied with a mysterious smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright. I also intended to make a trip there.” Then, the two of them left the Herbal Hall and chatted along the way. But suddenly, Lin Yun recalled something and asked, “The Huangfu Clan seems to have a deep background. It’s only slightly inferior to the four prestigious clans. You shouldn’t lack resources as a Huangfu Clan’s descendant. So why are you trying your luck in the Pellet Hall?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wearing a bitter smile, Huangfu Jingxuan sighed, “The clan is divided into the main line and branch line. For example, Wang Ning had no lack of resources because he was a descendant from the main lines. As for the branch line… well let’s not talk about it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun knew that this topic had hit Huangfu Jingxuan’s sore spot. He immediately changed the topic, “Right, I need information about someone from you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who is it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bai Lixuan. You should know this person, right? But why haven’t I seen him after entering the sect?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huangfu Jingxuan smiled and pointed at the emblem on his chest, “You’re asking the right person. I’ve joined the Lone-Star Alliance, which is the same as Bai Lixuan’s. This alliance only accepts elites and cultivation maniacs. I heard from the seniors that Bai Lixuan went into seclusion when he returned from the Azure Sun County.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Seclusion?” asked Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah. He’s a famous person in the sect, defeating many cultivators in the Profound Martial Realm while he was still in the Xiantian Realm. He even entered the Earth Ranking and was known as a monster. But he has gone into seclusion. This time, even if he can’t attain the Saint Physique, he will still have to make his breakthrough either way.” Huangfu Jingxuan’s face was written with admiration when he talked about Bai Lixuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun finally knew why he didn’t hear anything about Bai Lixuan ever since he joined the sect. With that, the two walked side by side towards the Myriad Sword Platform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It didn’t take long for Wang Yan to be informed of Lin Yun’s location. When he read the note given to him, his face turned dark, “You’ve finally come out. And here I thought that would stay holed up for the rest of your life!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Yan was emitting an uncontrollable surge of murderous aura. This caused many people in Wang Yan’s base to open their eyes. They were all elites who had been summoned back to the sect by Wang Yan. Compared to the small tricks used by Liu Yue, Wang Yan was Lin Yun’s greatest source of trouble.</span></p>
