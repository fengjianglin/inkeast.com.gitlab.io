Demonic beasts’ patience was limited. Half an hour after he left, a powerful roar echoed in the forest. It was a four legged beast with crimson fur and eyes. It was shaped like a tiger and equipped with sharp fangs and claws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shortly after, two more roars sounded out. It didn’t take long for the three beasts to arrive. The last demonic beast was rather sly as it chose not to move for now. It was ambitious and its target wasn’t only Lin Yun. Even the three other demonic beasts were its targets. The demonic beast licked its lips and revealed a sinister smile in the darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ground trembled under the three demonic beasts’ charge. Even the sword aura Lin Yun used to shield him against the three demonic beasts’ demonic aura had shattered instantly as his bones started to emit a crackling sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His body soon became deformed under the immense pressure. If it was someone else without the Dracophant Battle Physique, they would have been squashed to minced meat by now. But even though that wasn’t the case for Lin Yun, the pressure didn’t feel great. His face was pale and beads of sweat dripped down from his forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could hear the demonic beasts’ roar lingering in his ears, so he didn’t need to open his eyes to figure out his current situation. Facing death, Lin Yun forced all his potential out and scenes started to flash in his mind - the scenes started with the Ferocious Tiger Fist, moved on to the incomplete Dragon-Tiger Fist, and ended with the completed Dragon-Tiger Fist given to him by Drifting Goblet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three demonic beasts approached from three different directions. No one could save Lin Yun if the demonic beasts came within a hundred meter radius around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They gradually got closer to Lin Yun. A thousand meters, eight hundred meters, five hundred meters, four hundred meters, three hundred meters…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three demonic beasts revealed a sinister smile as they treated Lin Yun as a delicacy. The vigor emitted from Lin Yun was something they couldn’t resist. Still, the images flashed in Lin Yun’s mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, everything disappeared as they shattered like a mirror. The dragon and tiger no longer existed in Lin Yun’s mind. They were replaced by a sword. When the three demonic beasts were a hundred meters away from Lin Yun, he suddenly opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sword flashed in the depth of Lin Yun’s pupils and shortly after, thirty three swords bloomed. Looking at the three demonic beasts, Lin Yun didn’t have any panic on his face. He crossed his hands together and started to form a mysterious seal, the Heavenly Seal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he formed the seal, thirty-three swords condensed as origin energy appeared behind Lin Yun, which quickly arranged itself into a fan formation. At the same time, Lin Yun’s shattered sword aura instantly gathered and took form. He was like a speck of light in the darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the boundless sword aura of the Heavenly Seal, it felt as if Lin Yun had undergone nirvana. His aura forced the three demonic beasts back and the thirty-three swords buzzed behind him. At this moment, his sword intent began to surge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Yun swept a glance at the crimson four legged beast before him and unleashed an unparalleled aura. “Dragon-Tiger Fist—Hundred Beast Wave!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Yun stomped his foot on the ground and dashed forward with his punch. His sword aura instantly manifested into a hundred beasts roaring behind him. His attack was like a sharp sword and a ferocious beast, all at the same time. Everything occurred in the blink of an eye and the Heavenly Seal was already in the demonic beast’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the Heavenly Seal’s empowerment, Lin Yun sent the four legged beast flying. The demonic beast smashed against a rock, leaving cracks and blood. Clearly, the demonic beast did not suffer a fatal wound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Yun spread his arms apart and he landed on the ground. When he turned his head back, the two demonic beasts had just reacted to the scene of the four legged demonic beast flying away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nice.” Lin Yun smiled after he got out of the perilous situation. He had finally grasped the Heavenly Seal in the moment right before death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Time to retreat!” With a smile, Lin Yun turned around and left. He wasn’t stupid enough to fight three demonic beasts at the same time, not to mention that there was another one hidden in the darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Simultaneously, the two demonic beasts recovered from their shock and chased after Lin Yun. Behind them, the four legged demonic beast was also in hot pursuit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You guys want to compete with me in speed? Come!” Lin Yun revealed a confident smile and landed on a tree branch with great agility. Like a breeze, he traveled through the forest with great ease. But the three demonic beasts still chased after him. They didn’t want to give up on the prey that they had waited on for three days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the trees collapsed in their path, but Lin Yun didn’t seem concerned about the three demonic beasts chasing after him. Rather, he was feeling excited from comprehending the Heavenly Seal. He had finally grasped the Heavenly Seal, which meant that combining the four seals wouldn’t be far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the three demonic beasts wanted to chase after him, then he could make use of this opportunity to temper his Seven Profound Seals. If possible, he wanted to bring it to the Manifestation Stage, which would boost his strength greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A black Demon Runic Leopard slowly and gracefully came out of the darkness like a cat. It was the fourth demonic beasts who chose not to act and to wait instead. It was pitch black with a pair of emerald pupils. It narrowed its eyes into slits and looked around in the forest. Gradually, it finally saw Lin Yun who was leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The brimming vitality within Lin Yun’s body was of great temptation to the Demon Runic Leopard. The leopard narrowed its eyes with a cold flicker through its eyes as it followed behind. The leopard didn’t seem to be in a rush at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like that, ten days had passed in the blink of an eye. Only the crimson four legged beast continued to pursue Lin Yun. The two other demonic beasts lost their patience when they realized that they catch up to Lin Yun. Only the four legged beast was chasing after Lin Yun like a mad dog. It still held a grudge against Lin Yun because of the punch from ten days ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Yun would occasionally look back as he traveled forward with a smirk. This demonic beast was rather bold to chase after him alone, not to mention that it was still injured from his attack ten days ago. So Lin Yun was fully confident of taking it down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had the spiritual runes painting and the Scarletflame War Flag. But it would lose all meaning if Lin Yun utilized his trump cards. Just when Lin Yun was pondering what to do, a cold breeze blew against his face. When Lin Yun raised his head, he realized that there was a cliff up ahead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the four legged beast saw the cliff, it barked out in excitement, not knowing that its death was arriving. With a leap, it pounced towards Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since the path ran out, let’s fight here.” Lin Yun suddenly turned around and threw out a punch like a sword. After his punch sent the demonic beast flying, Lin Yun circulated the Iris Sword Sutra and the Iris Flower within his body bloomed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the demonic beast got back up on its feet, it looked at Lin Yun with shock after realizing the pressure this puny human was giving off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You must be courting death to come after me despite losing so much blood. You’re indeed a mad dog.” The demonic beast was weaker than Lin Yun had imagined. At this moment, the role between prey and hunter had changed.</span></p>
