 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bamboo woods were filled with dangers, but Lin Yun could no longer turn back. He still had a trace of life going forward and going back would mean certain death unless he could comprehend the complete sword intent. This was the only way to resolve the runes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The runes weren’t the same as those from the Age Sutra. The runes here were dangerous and contained boundless sword intent. It wouldn’t be an overstatement to call them sword runes. Worst of all, the runes here had formed into an array.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sword Burial Woods…</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;At this moment, Lin Yun finally understood why this place was called the Sword Burial Woods. This was a burial ground for swordsmen, which was why Wang Ning and the others did not dare to enter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Huangfu Jingxuan grasped sword intent, he knew nothing about runes. So it would be certain death for him if he came.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun did not dare to think about anything else with the dangers here. He could only toughen his scalps and continue forth. As he tried to comprehend the sword intent in this place, his sword intent was slowly being refined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The broken sword and nine chains would appear within his body from time to time, trembling violently. He could clearly sense the growth in his incomplete sword intent. Along with the growth of his incomplete sword intent, the nine chains were slowly loosening up. But no matter how his incomplete sword intent grew, it was still one step away from reaching completion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was so close that he could feel it with his own hands. But even when he tried reaching out, there was still some distance from him to cover. In the end, Lin Yun could only bite the bullet and continue walking forward, relying on the sword intent here to refine his incomplete sword intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Outside the Sword Burial Woods, Li Wuyou grew nervous looking at Lin Yun. Unlike Lin Yun, he could clearly sense the danger that Lin Yun was in. He could see the dangers manifesting into a sea of blood, taking on various forms. It seemed to him that Lin Yun would be devoured at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The swords on the blood ocean were all manifested from sword intent. Fighting them meant certain death. There was also a buzzing noise coming from the sway woods. It sounded as if someone was singing. Li Wuyou had no idea how long Lin Yun could last under this pressure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A bit more… why is it always a little more?” Lin Yun felt like he was walking on thin ice. Furrowing his brows, he seemed to be walking into a dead-end. He could feel that he was just one step away. Whenever he took a step forward, he could sense his own improvements. He was now one-fourth the distance away. He continued walking, one-eighth distance away… one-sixteenth distance away...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the distance between him and the complete sword intent had shrunk, it seemed infinitely far away. Eventually, the dangers and sword intent here swayed his confidence. At the moment, there was a break in his confidence. It was a flaw that amplified his heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun took another step forward and he knew that he was finished. The sword rune beneath his feet exploded. The rows of bamboos looked like spears, surging towards him with unparalleled sword intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun knew that it was the array’s backlash. His heart tightened up. He would be in danger if he turned around because the sides were filled with boundless sword intent. He felt that there was no place for him anywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Loneliness struck fear in his heart, along with the fear of being rejected by the world. The Sword Burial Woods was repelling him and wanted to bury him. Lin Yun had no idea where the problem stemmed from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He immediately closed his eyes at the juncture of life and death. The man from the painting flashed in his mind. Recalling every detail of that man swinging his sword, Lin Yun compared himself to that man, trying to find what he was lacking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scenes changed to the Iris Sword Saint. He recalled how that person suppressed the demonic ocean. The two of them were swordsmen that he looked up to…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes. He finally found common ground between the two and knew what he was missing. He turned around and leaped, ignoring the dangers and boundless sword intent pouring towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if he could crush mountains and stars, how could he be considered a swordsman if he didn’t have the heart of one? A swordsman needed the heart to be sharp. That was what he lacked. Since he was born for swords, why would he be afraid to die for swords?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Understanding that, Lin Yun’s sword aura condensed. The confusion in his eyes disappeared and was &nbsp;replaced with fearlessness.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Can’t look back? Then that’s exactly what I’ll do!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A swordsman needed the courage to fearlessly press forward. His heart started to throb. He leapt into the air and threw himself into the boundless sword intent. In the next second, he was devoured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No!” Li Wuyou yelled when he saw this scene. “Fuck! Screw the Sword Burial Woods. I’ll destroy you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Starlight started to emit &nbsp;from Li Wuyou as fury filled his eyes. Like a madman, Li Wuyou dove into the woods and started hacking at the bamboo. But the bamboo seemed endless no matter how he tried hacking them. There was no end to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But right before the boundless sword intent was about to devour Lin Yun, a bright radiance started to bloom from his body. Shortly after, pure and refined sword intent exploded from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bamboo woods started to sway from his sword intent, releasing a crisp sound whenever they collided. At the same time, one of the chains that bound the broken sword suddenly broke. A roar that sounded as if it came from ancient times rang out, along with a pair of prestigious eyes that stared into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is this… my Martial Soul?” Lin Yun opened his eyes and looked around. The bamboo woods no longer looked to be filled with danger. The bamboo woods were only swaying with elegance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It looks like the Sword Burial Woods was a testing ground left by a certain senior. Lin Yun was still ignorant about the true meaning of sword intent up until a moment ago when his confidence was shaken. Now that he finally comprehended a complete sword intent, this place could no longer pose any dangers to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, senior. Whoever you are.” Lin Yun sat cross-legged and clasped his hands together. When he stood up, he could sense that the sword runes had already disappeared. Aside from the fact that this place was still a little eerie, this place was now an ordinary bamboo wood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll hack you! Hack you!” Lin Yun suddenly heard someone yelling out, gasping for breath. When he turned around, he saw an exhausted Li Wuyou. The latter was holding onto his sword, swinging it around in the air furiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you trying to do?” Lin Yun frowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m taking revenge for you! We’ll talk again after I finish hacking these bamboos. Don’t let me know which bastard planted them here or I’ll slaughter him!” Li Wuyou casually replied while swinging his sword around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun placed his thumb on his middle finger and flicked. When the sword flash shot out, a buzzing noise came from the complete sword intent. When Li Wuyou heard the buzzing noise, he suddenly jolted awake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What was I doing? My wrist is feeling sour…” Li Wuyou sighed after regaining his consciousness. How could he not feel sour after swinging his sword thousands of times?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I also want to know what you’re doing,” Lin Yun smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big brother, you’re not dead?” Li Wuyou looked at Lin Yun in surprise. “Haha! Big brother, I saved you! I charged in when you got devoured earlier, hacking down all the bamboo.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rolling his eyes, Lin Yun pointed his finger around, “Look around. I don’t need to write it out for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you mean…” Li Wuyou looked around and finally realized that there was no broken bamboo on the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was that all an illusion?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;He was hacking the bamboos earlier, but there wasn’t even a single one on the floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dragon Blooded Horse stepped forward and snorted, looking at Li Wuyou in disdain before walking towards Lin Yun. Li Wuyou covered his face in embarrassment. Even the Dragon Blooded Horse was looking down on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leading the Dragon Blooded Horse by the reins, Lin Yun proceeded deeper into the woods. There were many secrets in this place. The path they traveled was long and Lin Yun only saw an ancient bamboo building thirty minutes later. The building was built on the water, with the cold lake covering one side and the mist shrouding it completely.</span></p>
