 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Primal Origin Sect’s camp wasn’t far from the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s. When they passed by, the two parties glared at each other coldly, with killing intent flashing in their eyes. Ever since the last assassination attempt, the two sects almost had a complete falling out. This was especially so for the Primal Origin Sect, who suffered the death of one of their Violet Palace Realm elders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only did they fail to kill Lin Yun, but they even allowed Lin Yun to obtain a secret technique, the Dracophant War Armor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wen Yanbo’s face sank when he saw Luo Feng. He could feel a faint aching on his chest. He nearly lost his life when he took that attack from Luo Feng. Before leaving, many of the Primal Origin Sect’s elders also looked at Lin Yun coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s something amiss about the Primal Origin Sect and Sword Firmament Pavilion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s normal. The sun will rise from the west the day they’re amicable with each other. I noticed that many of the elders looked as if they wanted to devour Lin Yun.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’ll be interesting if Lin Yun dies in the Demonlotus Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But if Lin Yun comes out alive, he’ll throw those in the same age as him far behind, even if he doesn’t have any fortuitous encounters.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The abnormality between the Primal Origin Sect and Sword Firmament Pavilion instantly attracted the attention of many sects. Everyone in the Great Qin Empire knew about the enmity between the two sects. Even the sects who weren’t in the Great Qin Empire’s territory had also heard of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Primal Origin Sect went straight to their camp without speaking a word. This made Luo Feng somewhat nervous. After all, a dog that bites isn’t the one that barks the loudest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Jue also seemed somewhat concerned. He spoke up, “They definitely wouldn’t give up so easily.. Junior Brother, you have to be careful in the Demonlotus Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Primal Origin Sect seems to have brought three of their core disciples. The performance of those three disciples was great in the previous Dragon Gate Competition,” said Chen Xuanjun as he looked at the Primal Origin Sect’s party.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They only have seven core disciples in total. If you exclude Heartcliff, they have actually sent out half of their core disciples. It’ll be an immense loss to them if all three core disciples die in the Demonlotus Realm,” said Luo Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling pressured, the Primal Origin Sect responded as seriously as they could. After all, they actually sent out three core disciples, who were naturally here for Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun listened quietly by the side. Everyone was still under the impression that he couldn’t be compared to the core disciples in the ninth stage of the Profound Martial Realm. But after defeating Ling Yan, Lin Yun had a new gauge of his strength. Perhaps the xiantian sword intent was more terrifying than he had imagined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the xiantian sword intent and Aquaselenic Sword, he might be able to hold his ground against some of these people. Lin Yun might even be able to defeat them. Then again, Lin Yun could only verify it in the Demonlotus Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two days later, two groups of people appeared in the Extermination Barrens. The two groups were at the empire’s borders and they bowed to the empire. The two sects seemed to have a good relationship since their disciples were mixed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among the disciples, two people attracted everyone’s attention. One was a robust man covered in muscles. He had an axe on his back and looked like a barbarian who had just come out of the mountains. The other had a fluctuating aura with a pair of cold eyes like a venomous snake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xuanjun’s face changed when he saw the two of them, “Those two actually came…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s the matter? Are they strong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not only are they strong, they were ranked eleventh and thirteenth in the previous Dragon Gate Competition. They have a high, but they would be among the eight titles if they didn’t encounter the same opponent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who did they lose to?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, they were both unfortunate to encounter Drifting Goblet,” smiled Chen Xuanjun. He felt pity for those two because they were unfortunate. They might still have a chance if they encountered any of the other titles, but they were truly unlucky to encounter Drifting Goblet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The one dressed like a barbarian’s name is Feng Ye, and the other one is Bai Yue. It has been three years, so they must’ve gotten more powerful. Those sects out of the empire are really ruthless. They’re not afraid of such geniuses dying in the Demonlotus Realm.” Chen Xuanjun felt a headache when he mentioned the sects beyond the empire’s territory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unlike the four great sects, who had to consider if they had to send in their best disciples, the weaker sects did not have such concerns. They wouldn’t give up on any opportunities to grow stronger regardless of the outcome. They never thought about what would happen if their best disciple died there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s so many people. But it’s a pity that none of them are interesting,” smiled Feng Ye when he looked at the various sects’ disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Yue replied, “Everyone’s useless aside from the eight titles. The Great Qin Empire’s sects are so timid.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Ye’s gaze fell on the Heavenly Profound Sect and he smiled, “Let’s kill some of the garbage from the Heavenly Profound Sect to train in the sect realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two didn’t try to suppress their voices at all and the Heavenly Profound Sect heard it all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What an arrogant barbarian. The two of you are not even Senior Brother Drifting Goblet’s match.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even if Senior Brother Drifting Goblet isn’t here, this is still not the place for you guys to create havoc.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The leader of the core disciples, Tang Yuan, spoke out, “Why are you guys angry about these demonic cultivators. We’ll teach them a lesson in the Demonlotus Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sects beyond the empire’s territory were brutal, so they were seen as demonic cultivators in many people’s eyes. The Heavenly Profound Sect had the Buddhism inheritance, so they were exceptional when it came to dealing with demonic cultivators. Tang Yuan wasn’t exaggerating right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night approached and many people were having a tough time enduring the Extermination Barrens' heat. Although they had origin energy to protect themselves, their mentality was still affected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several battles took place at night. After all, fighting was unavoidable with so many cultivators gathered together in this scorching land. But it was fortunate that every sect had its elders present. Although there were fights, they wouldn’t allow the fights to escalate since the Demonlotus Realm was opening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun was seated in the camp, cultivating with second-grade spiritual jades. After he obtained cold energy from the Iris Sword Sutra, he didn’t feel any discomfort from the environment. Even without the cold energy, he wouldn’t feel irritable because of his mentality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Tong and the others wanted to invite him for a drink, but they left when they saw that he was cultivating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Brother’s mentality is impressive. The Demonlotus Realm is opening. It’s tempting, but it’s also filled with dangers. There’s a danger of dying in there and there’s also a chance of soaring into the sky. It’s not a coincidence that he can rise so quickly in the Sword Firmament Pavilion because of his mentality.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go and cultivate. Who knows, perhaps it might save our lives if we cultivate a little more.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, that’s right.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone returned to cultivating when they looked at Lin Yun. But it was uncertain if they could actually calm themselves down to cultivate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two days later, a black lotus in the spatial crack suddenly appeared and a black radiance enveloped the entire horizon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is the secret realm opening?” The various elders and disciples could no longer hold themselves back. Their eyes were flickering with excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun came out from his tent and looked at the spatial crack. He saw a black lotus that seemed to be stuck in the void by a certain energy. The black lotus was emitting a demonic aura that looked like tentacles. But the stalemate didn’t last long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When someone from the Divine Guards activated the array that the four great sects joined forces to set up, it was like a painting that unfolded on the ground. The spiritual runes joined together and spread out like spilled ink.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It looked like someone was using spiritual runes to paint eighteen towering mountains. When the mountain range was formed, the black lotus in the void was dragged into the painting. This scene left Lin Yun shocked, but this experience had widened his horizon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He suddenly thought about the Azure Transcript. The two were somewhat similar, but the Azure Transcript was made with spiritual runes, so it was more profound. Could it be that Taoist Azure was better than the four sects?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If that was the case, then it wasn’t shocking that he couldn’t understand the Azure Transcript. When the black lotus was swept into the painting, a pillar of light soared into the sky with a tiny crack on it. Everyone could see a new world inside the crack. It was the Demonlotus Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Feng wore a grave expression as he said, “Go in. Remember that your safety is more important than anything else. The sect doesn’t lack a foundation, so nothing is more important than your lives.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had already repeated it countless times, but Luo Feng still couldn’t help giving another reminder when the secret realm opened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While he was talking, many of the other sect's disciples had already flown towards the entrance. For a moment, the sky was filled with countless people charging into the spatial crack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go.” Chen Xuanjun’s eyes blazed as he took the lead. The scene was overwhelming for everyone, including Lin Yun. The disciples were fearless, hoping that the passion in their hearts could get them through this ordeal for the slim chance that they could stand at the pinnacle of strength one day. They wanted this even if it was a path filled with blood and bones.</span></p>
