 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Yun, I hereby punish you to three months of odd jobs in the Herbal Peak. Do you have anything to say for yourself?” Bai Ting looked at Lin Yun coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m satisfied. I am willing to accept my punishment,” Lin Yun smiled indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could he not be satisfied? He killed Wang Ning and did not get expelled. Furthermore, Bai Ting was taking the fall for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Li Wuyou!” Bai Ting glanced over and repeated his words again without looking at Li Wuyou directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, I’m here! I’m here!” Apparently, Li Wuyou had been collecting the spiritual jades on the ground, which made everyone laugh. Li Wuyou was directly involved in the storm, but he was behaving as if nothing had happened. He was still in the mood to pick up the spiritual jades that were scattered on the ground. Then again, there were at least sixty to seventy of them on the ground, which was a lot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you oppose this?” barked Bai Ting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll follow wherever my big brother goes,” said Li Wuyou. He didn’t seem bothered by the punishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing to the side, Xin Yan covered her mouth and smiled. This brat was still quite loyal. He got more pleasing to her eye the more she looked at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Impudence!” Bai Ting snorted coldly. “Put the prison uniforms on them and escort them to the Herbal Peak immediately! If the two of you disobey any others there, don’t blame me for being ruthless!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two deacons stepped forward and dressed them in the white uniforms. The word ‘Sinful’ was written on the back of the uniforms. Anyone who wore this uniform would be marked as sinful and they would only wear it when they were being punished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the two of them wore the uniforms without any shame. This was especially so for Li Wuyou, who had a smile on his face. He even seemed pretty content. He made it seem as though it was more majestic than wearing the imperial robe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come, follow me.” The deacon looked at the duo coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait a minute. I have something to say to Big Sister Xin Yan.” Li Wuyou waved his hand and walked over to Xin Yan. “Big Sister Xin Yan, it’s best not to leave someone like him by your side. Who knows if he might backstab you one day.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Xiaotian and the others turned white when they heard that. They even started to panic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s the matter?” Xin Yan asked, puzzled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother Lin and I saved this group of ingrates from a pack of wolves. But when we were cornered into a dead-end, they didn’t even do anything or say anything to help. They only coldly watched from the side.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In order to save these fellows, Li Wuyou nearly took the alpha wolf’s claw head-on and lost his life. Naturally, he had no intention of letting these ingrates go so easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon hearing that, Xin Yan’s face turned cold. She looked at Lin Yun, “Is that true?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Lin Yun looked at Li Xiaotian and replied, “It’s best not to keep this person around. Even if he’s talented, someone without loyalty is still a hidden threat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Xiaotian and the others immediately dropped on their knees and started crying, “Senior Sister, please give us another chance!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Get lost! From today onwards, you guys will have nothing to do with me in the future.” Xin Yan was furious that she had chosen the wrong people. Her seeded candidates actually turned out to be a bunch of ingrates.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Li Xiaotian and his group heard that, their faces turned pale. With Xin Yan’s words, they wouldn’t have a bright future no matter who they took refuge in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t waste time.” The two deacons urged Lin Yun with a cold face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll deal with the two of you sooner or later!” Wang Yan snapped the sword in his hand furiously. The sword fragments dug into his hand and blood started dripping down from his hand. Then, he left and paid no attention to anyone else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you scared?” Lin Yun gently asked while following the two deacons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Wuyou smiled, “I am someone who will become the strongest swordsman in the Great Qin Empire. Why would I be afraid of him? If I was really afraid of him, I wouldn’t have kicked Wang Ning in the first place.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder, should we notify the Herbal Peak about this matter?” Xin Yan turned to look at Luo Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s fine. It’s good to let them suffer a little,” Luo Feng smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What about Lin Yun’s injuries?” Xin Yan expressed her concern.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I secretly gave him a pellet earlier. He only suffered some internal injuries, so it’s no big deal,” Luo Feng laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Bai, what about our scores for the Nine Stars Contest?” The rookies all looked at Bai Ting helplessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s get going too. Leave the troublesome matters to that old foggy.” Luo Feng and Xin Yan left, both were in a good mood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Ting’s face was ugly. Lin Yun and Li Wuyou left easily, but he was left with the mess. Something like this had never happened in the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s history. If he knew that something like this would happen, he wouldn’t have taken the responsibility over from Luo Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sword Firmament Pavilion was situated between a mountain range. The mountain range was enveloped in thick spiritual energy. The buildings here were ancient. They were the pavilion’s foundation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun and Li Wuyou were escorted to Herbal Peak. The entire journey took a few hours. Due to the fact that the two deacons were from Bai Ting’s faction, they did not engage in any conversation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun was busy treating his injuries with the pellet in his mouth. He left the talkative Li Wuyou depressed, with no one to talk to. When Lin Yun finally opened his eyes, Li Wuyou immediately spoke out, “Big Brother, you’ve really kept me in the dark here. Your Martial Soul is actually an Aurora Dragon!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun’s countenance was much better. The pellet that Elder Luo gave him was truly effective. Wang Yan’s sword had injured his internal organs, but the pellet had treated most of his injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he heard Li Wuyou’s words, Lin Yun had no idea what to say. He wasn’t keeping it from Li Wuyou on purpose. It was just that he really didn’t possess the Aurora Dragon Martial Soul until recently. He unlocked it after comprehending the complete sword intent, which actually snapped one of the chains on the broken sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Speaking of which, do you know anything about the Aurora Dragon Martial Soul?” Lin Yun looked at Li Wuyou. Even he did not recognize his Martial Soul. He could, however, sense that it was powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I know a thing or two about it. The Aurora Dragon Martial Soul can be categorized within the demonic beasts. There are also strong and weak Martial Souls among them. Wang Yan’s Demon Runic Tiger is one of the stronger ones, but it’s nothing compared to your Aurora Dragon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Aurora Dragon might not be the strongest in the primordial era, but it’s a genuine Primordial Chaotic Beast, possessing an infamous reputation. Legend has it that it could ignite everything in its sight, turning its surroundings into a purgatory. But your Martial Soul can only be considered a Primordial Chaotic Soul, not the physical beast itself. This is also the reason why it’s only ten feet in length. It’s way smaller than a Primordial Chaotic Beast should be. But you don’t have to worry about it. It will gradually awaken before reaching legendary heights.” Li Wuyou explained in great depth after being quiet for so long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two deacons also slowed their pace to listen to Li Wuyou’s explanation. When they heard Li Wuyou’s explanation, they were shocked. Evidently, this was the first time they heard about the Primordial Chaotic Beast called the Aurora Dragon. They finally had an idea of why Elder Bai suffered so greatly this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re pretty knowledgeable despite how you act.” Lin Yun was rather shocked by Li Wuyou’s knowledge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Scratching his head, Li Wuyou chuckled, “I just read a lot when I was a child. I’m also trying to tie myself to you before you grow. Big Brother, please don’t forget about me when you soar into the sky in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Soar into the sky?” The skinnier deacon sneered, “You’ve offended Wang Yan. It’s uncertain if you can even survive through this winter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey, watch your tone,” Li Wuyou rebuked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cut the crap. We’ve arrived at Herbal Peak. The two of you will wait while we handle the transfer procedures to Herbal Hall.” The other deacon snorted and flew into the hall. As for the skinny deacon, he stayed to watch over Lin Yun and Li Wuyou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey, bean sprout. What does the Herbal Peak do? You still haven’t explained it to us.” Li Wuyou looked at the skinny deacon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bean sprout? You brat, who the hell are you calling bean sprout?” The skinny deacon replied with rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wearing a serious face, Li Wuyou smiled, “Look at your scrawny build. You’re as skinny as a bamboo pole. If you’re not a bean sprout, then what are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The skinny deacon’s face was turning green from anger. But just when he was about to blow his top, the other deacon returned along with an old man from the Herbal Hall. The blue-clothed deacon pointed at the two youths and said, “Deacon Tang, these two are the ones from Elder Bai. They will be here doing odd jobs for the next three months. Go ahead and hand them any tough work.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man from the Herbal Hall narrowed his eyes into slits and nodded, “I understand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then the two of us will be taking our leave.” The two deacons didn’t stay long and left. But even after they left, their conversation could still be heard, “Do you think that I’m a bean sprout?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who said tha… well, you do look like one,” replied the other deacon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Get lost!” yelled the bean sprout.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The voice wasn’t loud, but it was heard by Lin Yun and Li Wuyou, who couldn’t help laughing. Lin Yun turned to look at the deacon and asked, “Senior, what does the Herbal Peak do? And what do I have to do here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Deacon Tang was slightly surprised by Lin Yun’s question. He asked, “No one told you about it? Actually, it’s nothing much. You’ll just be tasked with taking care of the herbal field. Let’s go, I’ll bring you over to the ninth herbal field.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, it has been a long journey for us. Aren’t you going to invite us into the Herbal Hall?” Li Wuyou looked at the hall far away and chuckled. The Herbal Hall looked simple and unadorned, but they could smell the strong medicinal fragrance coming from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The deacon smiled inwardly, finding these two who were wearing the prisoner clothes interesting. Ignoring Li Wuyou’s question, the deacon walked towards the herbal field.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They arrived at a spacious herbal field. Compared to the field, they seemed tiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ding Jiu.” Deacon Tang stopped when he arrived at a straw shack with ‘Ding Jiu’ written on it..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A group of ferocious-looking youths came out from the straw shack. The leader had a robust figure and his muscles stretched his clothes taut.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Niu Bingshun, these two people will be staying in this herbal field. Command them as you wish.” The deacon then went on asking some information about the herbal field before leaving Lin Yun and Li Wuyou behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the deacon left, Niu Bingshun and his group turned to look at Lin Yun and Li Wuyou with a sinister expression. Shortly after, two smelly buckets were thrown at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is this?” Li Wuyou frowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Isn’t it obvious? Two people left recently and we don’t have enough men. Scattering fertilizer is a great job, so the two of you can have it.”</span></p>
