 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A month ago, Li Wuyou didn’t understand what Lin Yun meant when he said the capital would be colder than the Northern Barrens. But now, Li Wuyou finally got it. It wasn’t that the snow was cold, but that the hearts of people were. The three of them stood in the blizzard, freezing cold and burning with rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A moment ago, Hall Master Mo said that they didn’t require any alchemists to settle in as there were too many pellets. But now, Liu Yue and Fu Guang were respectfully invited in. It was a slap to Ku Yun’s face. Even worse, Hall Master Mo even took out Fu Guang’s signboard to inform the entire city of his presence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wouldn’t be so bad if they did not witness it, but Fu Guang was invited in right after they were asked to leave. Ku Yun felt the pent up resentment in his chest and nearly fainted at what had happened. His wrinkled face was pale and his lips were trembling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, this won’t do! I’m going to confront him!” Ku Yun finally couldn’t take it anymore and ran back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master!” Lin Yun and Li Wuyou called out, but Ku Yun showed no signs of stopping. When they saw this, Lin Yun and Li Wuyou executed their movement techniques to chase him down. “Quick, get him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In front of the majestic Glittering Pavilion, Hall Master Mo lowered his head to welcome Liu Yue and Fu Guang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hall Master Mo!” Suddenly, an angry voice sounded out. When Hall Master Mo turned around, he saw Ku Yun helplessly standing in the lonely night with a pale face. &nbsp;A trace of embarrassment was on Hall Master Mo’s face when he saw Ku Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Fu Guang turned around to see Ku Yun, he locked his brows together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hall Master Mo, didn’t you say that there were too many pellets in the Glittering Pavilion and that there’s no need for any alchemists to settle in?” Ku Yun questioned. He wanted to make things clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was a Guest Elder in the Glittering Pavilion. Even though his status as a two star alchemist was fake, he was still a top-tiered one star alchemist. Not to mention that he had cooperated with the Glittering Pavilion for years, so why couldn’t Hall Master Mo make things right instead of humiliating him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Being put on the spot for his exposed lies, Hall Master Mo embarrassedly smiled, “Master Ku Yun, please don’t misunderstand. I invited Master Fu Guang over to reminisce about the past, so please don’t overthink…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re still trying to lie to me? I heard what you said!” Ku Yun roared. He couldn’t hold his anger anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What did you hear?” Fu Guang interrupted and barked, “Ku Yun, go back and practice since you’re not high leveled enough. Don’t embarrass the Pellet Hall. What do you want? You want Hall Master Mo to tell you that you’re a piece of trash who can’t even inscribe a two star spiritual rune?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You…you…!” Ku Yun’s mind buzzed. He instantly fell into the abyss when he heard what Fu Guang said. He felt so humiliated that he didn’t know what to say right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Behave yourself! I’m your senior! You’re nothing compared to me. You only refined the three Firecloud Pellets out of luck. I’m telling you politely to return to the Pellet Hall right now or do you want me to tell you to get lost?” Fu Guang was genuinely furious right now. So what if Ku Yun couldn’t take it? From Fu Guang’s point of view, Ku Yun was simply making things unreasonably difficult for Hall Master Mo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master, there’s no need for you to get angry. Some people are just stubborn and they have to be scolded, just like his disciple. They like to be humiliated,” Liu Yue replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bitch, who are you talking about?” Lin Yun scolded back when he rushed over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Raising her brow, Liu Yue sneered, “I’m naturally talking about you. Don't you and your master behave the same? Your master likes to be humiliated and you actually accepted Ye Liuyun’s challenge. I’ll see how you die a month from now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My big brother was right, you really are a bitch,” smiled Li Wuyou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why don’t you say that again if you have the guts. This is the capital and I have a hundred different ways to make you die a terrible death!” Liu Yue’s face turned dark.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun stretched his hand out to stop Li Wuyou from continuing. Glancing at Liu Yue, he said, “You don’t have to worry about me. We’ll know the results one month from now. Master, let us get going.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ku Yun was feeling down. Looking at Hall Master Mo, he asked, “Hall Master Mo, do you really think that I’m a piece of trash?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that they had been estranged, Hall Master Mo couldn’t be bothered to continue with pretense. With an indifferent expression, he replied, “You’re not exactly a piece of trash, but you’re nothing compared to Master Ku Yun. I'll be honest. I wasn’t lying when I said that the Glittering Pavilion had accumulated a large amount of pellets, but I need Master Fu Guang’s reputation to sell them out. So let me ask you honestly. Is your reputation worth any money?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gnashing his teeth, Ku Yun took out a jade token and threw it out. “Since that’s the case, then I’ll quit as the Glittering Pavilion’s Guest Elder!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hall Master Mo was briefly taken aback before he smiled, “So be it. We have no lack of two star alchemists with our financial resources. It doesn’t matter much, even if you go. You can scram now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He took the jade token from Ku Yun’s hand with a cold face. Then, he turned around and smiled, “Master Fu Guang, Lady Liu Yue, let’s not bother ourselves with trash. Please, come inside!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fu Guang and Liu Yue both looked arrogant. They didn’t even bother taking a look at Ku Yun and stepped inside the Glittering Pavilion. When they went in, the two guards at the door took a step forward, “Get lost! Don’t stay outside the Glittering Pavilion to affect our business!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What obedient dogs,” Li Wuyou insulted coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you courting death?” One of the guards stretched his hand out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lin Yun saw this scene, he looked at the two guards coldly and questioned, “Interesting. Are the two of you trying to touch us, disciples of the Sword Firmament Pavilion, by relying on the Glittering Pavilion’s influence?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The guard’s face changed as a trace of fear flickered in his eyes. The Sword Firmament Pavilion’s reputation was outstanding. In the end, the Glittering Pavilion was just a chamber of commerce and there was no way they could compete with the four great sects of the Great Qin Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Sword Firmament Pavilion is indeed powerful, but please don’t affect our business. Don’t get in our way.” The two guards became more polite after hearing what Lin Yun said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who the hell wants to stay in this broken place?” Li Wuyou was uncomfortable with how the two guards behaved. He turned around and left, with Lin Yun and Ku Yun following behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one talked throughout the journey. Ku Yun looked depressed and he acted like a walking corpse. What happened tonight hit him hard. The series of humiliating events were too much for him and he couldn’t let it go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother, I can’t let this go! Unfortunately, there’s nothing we can do about it. And that bitch is too much!” Li Wuyou cursed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s naturally a way, but just take a look at Master Ku Yun. With how he looks right now, there’s nothing I can do even if I have a plan,” Lin Yun replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m just a piece of trash. So why would I be important in your plan…” Ku Yun laughed at himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right. Why don’t you go and die instead?” Lin Yun snorted with sarcasm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ku Yun was stunned when he heard those words. He didn’t expect that Lin Yun would say those words to him. He immediately threw his temper and replied, “Even you’re looking down on me. Since that’s the case, then I’ll be leaving…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t give me that!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with a trace of anger. He continued coldly, “You can’t even bear the slightest grievance. Since you’re feeling so uncomfortable, wouldn’t it be better for you to die? Did your father wish for you to become a piece of trash? Where did all the courage you showed previously back in the Alchemy Chamber go?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun’s words left Ku Yun’s face red from all the pent up emotions. But there was nothing he could say to refute those words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Li Wuyou sighed, “Master, don’t bother arguing. Your grievance is nothing compared to big brother. You have no idea what we went through back in the forest. Big brother climbed out from the abyss to kill Wang Ning.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ku Yun was briefly stunned when he heard that. A brief moment later, he reacted, “You really have a way to deal with Fu Guang? He’s a senior two star alchemist. His reputation even stretches from the Pellet Hall to the capital…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why would I bother lying? Why don’t you raise your head and look where we are right now?” Lin Yun replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Ku Yun raised his head, he exclaimed, “The Myriad Treasure Pavilion!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Glittering Pavilion and Myriad Treasure Pavilion were both located at two ends of this prosperous street. Ku Yun suddenly thought of something and asked, “You’re not asking me to be a Guest Elder in the Myriad Treasure Pavilion to deal with the Glittering Pavilion, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s the matter? Do you really consider yourself to be a piece of trash? No matter what, you’re still a genuine one star alchemist. If you lower yourself to join as a Guest Elder, do you think that they will chase you away?” Lin Yun replied and walked towards the Myriad Treasure Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the door, Lin Yun said straightforwardly, “My master is Ku Yun, an alchemist of the Sword Firmament Pavilion. He’s here to ask for a position as a Guest Elder in the Myriad Treasure Pavilion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master Ku Yun? Who’s that?” The guard was a little suspicious when he looked at Lin Yun. Which alchemist would come knocking on the door to become a Guest Elder these days, especially one from the Sword Firmament Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It doesn’t matter if you’ve not heard of him. But you recognize the Sword Firmament Token, right?” Lin Yun smiled and turned around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ku Yun knew that he could not retreat now. Taking a step forward, he handed the Sword Firmament Token over. There was no way to fake a token created by the Pellet Hall, nor would anyone dare to forge one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sword Firmament Pavilion was famous, so when the guard saw the token, his face was instantly plastered with smiles, “So it’s Master Ku Yun. Please, come in!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything was going as Lin Yun had expected. Things would go smoothly as long as Ku Yun was willing to lower his status to ask. They entered the Myriad Treasure Pavilion and waited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling a little confused, Ku Yun asked, “Lin Yun, what are you planning?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master, do you know what pellets the Glittering Pavilion accumulated?” Lin Yun asked instead of answering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s easy to guess. The pellets they accumulated won’t be any precious pellets. They must have accumulated the commonly used ones,” Ku Yun replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are they?” Li Wuyou did not know any since he had never used pellets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xiantian Pellets for the Xiantian Realm and Greater Profound Pellets for the Profound Martial Realm… With the Glittering Pavilion’s status, they must have accumulated the Greater Profound Pellets,” Ku Yun explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you know how much they have accumulated?” Lin Yun nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ku Yun did not speak and only raised a finger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Wuyou immediately replied, “One thousand!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ku Yun shook his head. Li Wuyou then smiled and gave another confident answer, “Ten thousand!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wrong. A hundred thousand! The Great Qin empire’s influence stretches throughout the Great Qin County and many elites gather here. Given the Glittering Pavilion’s size, they will, at the very least, keep a hundred thousand if they’re going to stock up.” Ku Yun’s answer left Li Wuyou speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then we’ll make it so that they won’t be able to sell a single one! They’ll have to beg us for mercy!” Li Yun said, causing Ku Yun and Li Wuyou to turn around to look at him. At this moment, Lin Yun looked domineering when he made that declaration.</span></p>
