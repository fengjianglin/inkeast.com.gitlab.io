 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun saw a familiar figure when he headed towards the pillar of light. There was a slender figure among the Divine Guards’ party.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Yue?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun was surprised that Liu Yue was here. Then again, it wasn’t surprising that she would have a quota since the Extermination Barrens was controlled by the Divine Guards. But he was confused that Liu Yue was going somewhere as dangerous as the Demonlotus Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Didn’t the Divine Guards’ commander know that his daughter might die? Then again, this might be related to Liu Feilong’s mentality as a soldier. But this had nothing to do with Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhang Yan, Zhao Quan, and Xiao Ming. Don’t forget about the sect’s mission in the Demonlotus Realm. Don’t start a fight easily if you encounter Lin Yun unless you guys are confident in killing him,” said Wen Yanbo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Yan’s eyes flashed with killing intent as he sneered, “Don’t worry. I have common sense, but don’t deify him. You can’t use cosmic artifacts in the secret realm, so he can only die if he runs into us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not only will Lin Yun die in the Demonlotus Realm, but everyone else from the Sword Firmament Pavilion will also die.” The three were full of confidence because they were core disciples in the ninth stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s good then!” exclaimed Wen Yanbo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, the three of them headed into the Demonlotus Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lin Yun stepped into the pillar of light, his surroundings suddenly turned dark and he could sense space distorting. When he regained his vision, he found himself in a dried-up riverbed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun narrowed his eyes because his eyes still hadn’t adjusted. He looked around, but didn’t see anyone around him. This meant that everyone must have been teleported randomly and they were now separated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a piece of good news since everyone would have started fighting at the entrance if it weren’t the case. Lin Yun really didn’t see anyone around him. Then again, there was a possibility that they might’ve hidden themselves. No matter what, Lin Yun didn’t believe that he was the only one here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s…” Lin Yun saw a fruit growing on a rock a hundred meters away. The fruit looked like jade with a purple chill aura surrounding it. After quickly thinking about it, Lin Yun recognized the fruit, “It’s the Indigofrost Flame Fruit!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a unique fruit. The exterior might seem to be covered in flames, but it actually contained ice elemental spiritual energy. It could be used to temper the bones, internal organs, and skin. It was a treasure for those who practised the ice elemental cultivation technique. Aside from strengthening the cultivation technique, it could also save half a year of cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun was shocked when he saw this fruit. After all, this fruit cost at least 1,000 second grade spiritual jades on the outside and there was no supply in the market. He walked up without any hesitation and plucked the fruit. But all of a sudden, a hand stretched out and grabbed his wrist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun instantly executed the Seven Profound Steps. He grabbed the fruit and retreated quickly. Before he landed on the ground, he noticed a figure standing in front of him. That ‘person’ looked like a zombie, wearing tattered armor as a cold light flickered in its eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So it turns out that the Indigofrost Flame Fruit was growing on this demonic corpse. Lin Yun would have been caught if he was a second slower. The corpse was rotten and shrouded with three strands of black demonic miasma.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun frowned when he saw this scene because the consequences would be unimaginable for him if he was infected by the demonic miasma. The demonic corpse dashed forward and roared at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Storing the Indigofrost Flame Fruit, Lin Yun calmly threw out a punch. Three cauldron’s worth of strength slammed onto the demonic corpse and sent it a few dozen steps backwards. But it didn’t cause any injuries on the demonic corpse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Again!” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered. He balled his fist together and threw out a punch like a sword. This punch contained his full power and it was also like a sword that could tear apart everything. His punch drilled a hole in the demonic corpse’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun stepped forward and left behind nine afterimages. When the afterimages overlapped, the demonic corpse was blown apart by a bolt of rumbling lightning and it left behind a black lotus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Demonlotus Core?” Lin Yun waved his hand and pulled the Demonlotus Core over. When he observed it, he noticed that the energy contained in the demonlotus with three petals was shockingly pure. However, he had to remove the demonic miasma first before he could refine it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Storing the Demonlotus Core, Lin Yun continued to walk forward. But he soon encountered troubles once again. Densely packed worms shot at him like arrows. The worms were all equipped with sharp fangs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They look impressive, but they are lacking in strength.” Lin Yun balled his fists together and a dragon manifested around his fist. He was using the Soaring Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dragon roared and it flew out, sending all the worms in its path flying away. Unfortunately, none of the worms died. When the worms had a taste of Lin Yun’s strength, they immediately dispersed and went into hiding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun looked around and saw piles of bones in the surroundings. The bones should belong to the disciples who died to these worms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No wonder everyone says that the Demonlotus Realm is dangerous. The demonic beasts are weird and all of them have a strong vitality. They appear out of nowhere and you can die if you’re careless.” Lin Yun’s Soaring Dragon was strong and could even kill eighth stage demonic beasts. However, it wasn’t enough to kill any of the worms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had no idea what was at the end of the riverbed, but Lin Yun continued walking forward while encountering many demonic beasts along the way. Many of &nbsp;the demonic beasts were sent flying away by him. They would charge at him whenever they spotted Lin Yun, but they would immediately run away when they realized that they couldn’t put up a fight. Lin Yun hardly managed to get any actual kills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a headache for him because he only managed to obtain four Demonlotus Realm so far. One hour later, Lin Yun finally climbed out of the riverbed. When he climbed up the bank, the first thing he saw was the skeleton of a demonic beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hmm?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Lin Yun’s eyes lit up because he noticed something peculiar about this skeleton frame. There was a faint ripple in the skeleton frame that rippled occasionally. He wouldn’t have noticed it if he wasn’t proficient in spiritual runes.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Could this be an ancient cosmic artifact?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it really was a cosmic artifact, it would be extremely valuable, even if it was damaged. Even if the Sword Firmament Pavilion didn’t need it, he could get the sect to exchange second grade spiritual jades for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The resources he exhausted in his cultivation were immense and the monthly tribute he got from the sect was nothing. Lin Yun executed the Seven Profound Steps and disappeared. When he reappeared, he was already inside the skeleton frame. When he gave it a pull, the massive skeleton frame collapsed and the huge bones came crashing down on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Small tricks.” Lin Yun smiled and unleashed his quasi-xiantian sword intent to send all the bones flying away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Indeed…” Blowing the dust away from the ‘bone’ in his hand, Lin Yun confirmed his suspicions. It wasn’t actually a bone, but a spear. Judging from the fluctuating coming from it, it was a low grade cosmic artifact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just like martial techniques from the Golden Age, but the spiritual runes from back then were a lot stronger. Even if an ancient low grade cosmic artifact wasn’t very powerful, it was a lot stronger than modern cosmic artifacts. But it was a pity that most of the spiritual runes had fallen off. There were less than one-tenth of the spiritual runes remaining.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most importantly, the spear also had cracks. Lin Yun didn’t know how many times he could use the spear. However, he frowned when he discovered wisps of demonic miasma in the cracks of the spear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Demonic miasma?” Lin Yun could sense that he could still bring out the prowess of this spear by injecting his origin energy into it. However, the Scarletflame War Flag that he brought in was reduced to an ordinary weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So this meant that the problem was with the demonic miasma. All of the cosmic artifacts here had either been demonized or half-demonized. This meant that the cosmic artifacts had to adapt to the rules of the Demonlotus Realm. If the Scarletflame War Flag was placed here for a few hundred years, perhaps it would also be demonized, which would allow Lin Yun to use it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lin Yun poured his origin energy into the spear, he could sense a cold aura surging from it. He had no idea how powerful this spear would be in its complete form. But he knew that he must be powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Lin Yun raised his head when he sensed four figures dashing over with killing aura. He could tell that they were disciples that belonged to sects beyond the Great Qin Empire. Or rather, they were demonic cultivators. They must have been attracted by the commotion he caused earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the four of them arrived, their eyes lit up when they saw the spear in Lin Yun’s hands. “Hehe, this brat is pretty lucky to obtain a cosmic artifact as soon as he came to the secret realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, it doesn’t belong to him anymore though.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four of them were at the eighth stage of the Profound Martial Realm. When they walked forward, they were actually guarding themselves. However, Lin Yun was calm when he faced them. At the same time, he had a question for them in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Isn’t it tiring to live in this manner? But not anymore after today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun started pouring his origin energy into the spear and waved it. The spear drew a half-moon in the air and the four demonic cultivators were caught by surprise. They were all heavily injured and fear filled their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re courting death!” The four of them unleashed their crimson demonic aura. Judging from their aura, god only knows how many people they had killed. However, it was a pity that there was no way it would affect Lin Yun, who possessed the quasi-xiantian sword intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four were heavily injured, but they still had no intention of running away. They were simply courting death. When Lin Yun unleashed the aura of the Aquaselenic Sword, he released a ripple into the surrounding and he passed through the four of them like a breeze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four of them glared at the hole in their chests with wide eyes. Their eyes were filled with disbelief. Then, they fell to the ground as their vitality was robbed from them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lin Yun wiped the blood on the spear, he felt heartache. The cracks on the spear had grown bigger. It wasn’t easy for him to obtain this cosmic artifact and he wouldn’t have tested it on the four of them if he knew this would happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then again, this was a piece of good news for him. This meant that he could use the spear as a trump card in the Demonlotus Realm. When he was done cleaning the spear, he spoke out, “Even the venomous snake can’t hide the fishy smell on you. Don’t bother hiding.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A person flew out and landed in front of Lin Yun. He smiled, “Wow, I didn’t know that there was an expert in the Great Qin Empire…”</span></p>
