 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Ning was actually trying to convince the Elder to take Lin Yun’s life. Looking at the elder, Leng Mo spoke out, “Elder, you can’t allow a shameless person like him into the Sword Firmament Pavilion. He’ll only become the shame of the sect!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who’s being shameless here? Kill us if you want, but don’t try to distort the truth!” Li Wuyou was outraged when he heard their words. But he accidentally stretched his wound when he spoke and started coughing blood. He had been fighting the whole time and his injuries had already reached their limit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Yun, what do you have to say?” the Elder spoke. There weren’t any changes in his expression, so no one could guess what he was thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With mockery on his face, Lin Yun sneered, “What can I say? I indeed want to kill him. Didn’t you just witness it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Impudent!” the Elder barked from the Sword Condor and released his aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bullshit! What have I done? Do I have to stand still and get killed when someone is trying to kill me? Am I not allowed to retaliate? I only hate the fact that you came on time. Otherwise, I would’ve killed him!” Lin Yun spoke coldly as he faced the Elder. He showed no sign of giving in at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his opinion, it didn’t matter if he gave in or not. If the Elder were truly a reasonable person, he wouldn’t have listened to Wang Ning and the others to make a fair decision. But if the Elder weren’t a reasonable person, then anything he said would be futile. In summary, if he wanted anything, he would have to earn it through strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Elder had the strongest cultivation here. Even if everyone came together, they couldn’t defeat him. In that case, why did Lin Yun have to cower? Did he have to go as far as begging on his knees to change the Elder’s opinion? What a joke!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tsk, tsk! Your desire to kill me is so strong. But what a pity, I’m still standing here. Come and kill me in front of the Elder if you have the guts!” Wang Ning taunted when he saw how irritable Lin Yun was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fuck you!” Li Wuyou finally lost his patience, he wanted to charge at Wang Ning with his sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Scram!” Leng Mo threw out a punch before Li Wuyou could even get close to Wang Ning. Against Leng Mo’s cultivation, Li Wuyou couldn’t fight, especially with all the injuries. Li Wuyou spit out a mouthful of blood and his face twisted in pain. He laid on the ground, it was tough for him to get up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Yan’s lackeys drew their swords simultaneously and formed a human wall, protecting Wang Ning behind them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Step aside.” Wang Ning pushed the crowd aside and looked at Li Wuyou, who was struggling in pain on the ground and sneered, “Lil’ bastard, weren’t you capable before? Come and hit me then!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Damn it!” Li Wuyou’s eyes were bloodshot. He balled his hands into fists, but he couldn’t get up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Trash!” Wang Ning snorted and cupped his hands together at the Elder, “Elder, you’ve witnessed everything. So I don’t have to say much about how you’re going to deal with this matter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Yun and Li Wuyou killed their fellow disciples with no remorse. The two of you are hereby warned. If you two repeat it, you will be disqualified from the examination.” The Elder declared in an indifferent tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, Elder.” Lin Yun said indifferently as he picked up the Flower Burial Sword. When he bent down, he saw a foot stepping on his sword. Lin Yun raised his head and was met with Wang Ning’s sneer, “Remember who you are. You’re just a lowly sword slave. Coming to the capital will only make you seem more lowly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is that so?” Lin Yun pulled out the sword and placed it on Wang Ning’s neck before the latter could react. Feeling the cold touch on his neck, Wang Ning’s face instantly turned pale as he smiled awkwardly, “Lin Yun, don’t be impulsive…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Yun, are you courting death?” Leng Mo and the others looked at Lin Yun. This sudden scene had caught them by surprise. Leng Mo was cursing in his heart for what a fool Wang Ning had been. Wang Ning went up to Lin Yun to mock him despite knowing that he couldn’t defeat Lin Yun. But if Wang Ning were killed, Wang Yan would definitely not let him go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Staring at Wang Ning’s face, a smile rose on Lin Yun’s lips, “Don’t you feel that you’re a dog right now? You had a habit of following around Su Ziyao back in the Azure Sky Sect. Now, after coming to the Sword Firmament Sect, you’re following behind Wang Yan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You!” Wang Ning had never been so humiliated. His face had instantly turned green from anger, but the sword on his neck forced him to behave himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Get lost.” Lin Yun put his sword away and turned to look at the ones who were blocking his way. All of them immediately opened up a path when they saw Lin Yun’s glare. Lin Yun picked up Li Wuyou and threw him on the horse before leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Ning touched his neck; his face was gloomy. He suddenly thought of something and turned to look at the Elder on the Sword Condor. Smiling, he said, “Thank you for your help. I won’t forget it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Elder smiled, “You know better. The Wang Clan might be powerful, but you guys can’t do anything you want in the Sword Firmament Sect. You’re on your own now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you,” replied Wang Ning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fwhoooofooosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sword Condor raised a violent gale before disappearing. Leng Mo turned to look at Wang Ning. He could tell that Wang Ning’s injuries weren’t light so he asked, “Are you alright?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I won’t be dying anytime soon,” said Wang Ning. When he thought of the gaze in Lin Yun’s eyes earlier, he couldn’t help feeling a chill run down his spine. There was no way he could forget that gaze.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Did Lin Yun find out that Senior Hong was killed by me? His hatred for me doesn’t make any sense…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Leng, how many Profound Martial Realm geniuses are there among the seeded candidates?” asked Wang Ning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Leng Mo was baffled, he still replied honestly, “About a dozen?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s enough.” Wang Ning’s eyes flashed with resolve as he went over to whisper in Leng Mo’s ears. When Leng Mo heard his words, his face changed, “Are you serious? I don’t think we need that to deal with him...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do as I say. I want Lin Yun dead and I don’t want any accidents.” Wang Ning spoke with an indifferent and unquestionable tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Understood.” Leng Mo kept his silence after pondering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Damn it! My Bloodeyes Bear!” Mo Qingyun suddenly cursed out. He was shocked to discover that the Bloodeyes Bear wasn’t moving. When he went closer to take a look, he found out that the white bear was dead. The three stomps from the Dragon Blooded Horse had killed the white bear.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I should’ve killed that son of a bitch!” Li Wuyou grumbled while horseback. He felt indignant that Lin Yun allowed Wang Ning to go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Does it hurt?” Lin Yun asked, changing the topic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you think? Why don’t you try and get beaten up by someone in the Profound Martial Realm and see if it hurts? That bastard is at least in the first pulse of the Profound Martial Realm!” Li Wuyou had probably injured his internal organs when he took a punch from Leng Mo and it wouldn’t recover anytime soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then stop talking. With the Elder around, there’s no way I can kill Wang Ning even if I have my sword on his neck. Furthermore, what are you going to do if I kill him and run for my life? Are you going to hang around and be beaten to death?” said Lin Yun. This time, they had suffered a loss. Not only did they fail to kill Wang Ning, but they were even reprimanded by the Elder and were given a warning. He was still alright since he didn’t suffer any heavy injuries and only consumed a lot of spiritual energy, but it was different for Li Wuyou. Li Wuyou fought Wang Ning, faced the Blackflame Crows by himself, and received a punch from Leng Mo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, yeah. Now that I think about it, that Elder seems to be siding with us as well. He let us go without any punishment…” Li Wuyou scratched his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Siding with us? If he was really siding with us, then he wouldn’t stop me from killing Wang Ning. I’m afraid that he didn’t want to take it too far because of Senior Sister Xin Yan. He probably wouldn’t let us go so easily if we didn’t have any backing.” Lin Yun looked around in the surrounding before coming to a stop and leaned Li Wuyou against a tree. Then, he patted on the Dragon Blooded Horse’s neck and whispered in its ears, causing the Dragon Blooded Horse to grin and ran off.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay.” Li Wuyou nodded his head. He was exhausted and tired. He swiftly fell into a deep sleep when he closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Crackle! Crackle! Crackle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sounds of dried tree branches burning woke Li Wuyou up from his sleep. When he opened his eyes, he saw Lin Yun roasting meat on the fire while sprinkling seasonings occasionally. Since demonic beasts feasted on spiritual energy, their meat was tender and fresh. They provided great nourishment to the body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For someone injured, feasting on a high ranking demonic beast could aid their recovery. The Fiery Lion was what Lin Yun told the Dragon Blooded Horse to hunt. Since he had undergone a battle that exhausted his spiritual energy, he could only leave this task to Lil' Red. But he had to admit that the Dragon Blooded Horse had completed its task perfectly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe! Big Brother Lin, I had no idea that you’re so skilled when it comes to grilling meat. It should be something that women know…” Li Wuyou teased when he smelled the fragrance. The moment Li Wuyou woke up, he returned to his blabbering self again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You don’t want it? Then I’ll have it all to myself.” Lin Yun smiled, retracting his hand that was handing the meat to Li Wuyou. But shortly after he finished, the Dragon Blooded Horse bit on the meat that was supposed to be for Li Wuyou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s mine, you bastard!” Li Wuyou yelled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t scold Lil’ Red. He’s the one who went hunting since it’s inconvenient for me.” Lin Yun smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gurgle! Gurgle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Wuyou’s stomach started rumbling. He licked his lips and turned to Lin Yun pitifully saying, “Big brother, I know that I’m in the wrong now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Here,” said Lin Yun. He handed his portion to Li Wuyou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then… I won’t be polite any longer!” Li Wuyou chuckled as he took the meat and started stuffing himself. He exclaimed while chewing and slurred all his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun tore off a large piece of meat and started grilling it again. The fire illuminated his face, which added a hint of firmness to his look. After leaving the Azure Sky Sect, he had undergone several near-death experiences. He was no longer the impulsive brat of the past. But under the fire, there was a trace of reluctance on his face, which hadn’t changed since he left. He had hatred pent up in his heart and he would get his revenge sooner or later.</span></p>
