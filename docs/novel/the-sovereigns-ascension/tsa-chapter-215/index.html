 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ye Liuyun, hear that? Someone accepted your challenge,” Wang Yan said in a strange tone while looking at Lin Yun with a playful smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If I’m not able to slaughter this person one month from now, I won’t have any face to look at you,” replied Ye Liuyun, raising his voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahaha! Great! One month isn’t long, so I can let him live for another month. Lin Yun, I told you that would get you for Wang Ning’s death!” Wang Yan’s face was gloomy and his eyes overflowed with a murderous aura. He really wanted to kill Lin Yun right now, but the sect had its rules.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the clan’s seniors learned of Wang Ning’s death, almost all of them were furious. They were one of the four prestigious clans of the Great Qin Empire and it had been a long time since anyone dared to kill someone from the Wang Clan in public.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if one of their disciples had committed a grave mistake, most people would still give the Wang Clan some face. But Lin Yun had openly killed Wang Ning, which was equivalent to slapping the Wang Clan’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The clan had already issued a death order for Lin Yun, regardless of the methods. No matter what, they had to cleanse themselves from this humiliation, so everyone present could sense Wang Yan’s rage and killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xin Yan, Lin Yun has personally accepted the challenge. I didn’t force him to accept it. If you try to obstruct it, then Lin Yun won’t be the only one from Locket Mountain that will die!” Wang Yan snorted and waved his hand, “Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Get lost!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t block the way!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hundreds of elites from the Gentlemen Union left arrogantly. None of the surrounding disciples dared to block their way, nor did they dare to rebuke their words. This alone showed Wang Yan’s authority among the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Sister!” The Locket Mountain’s disciples immediately stepped forward when they saw the wound in Xin Yan’s hand. After her wound was bandaged, Xin Yan walked towards Lin Yun without saying a word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the wound on his chest, she muttered, “Does it still hurt?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m fine,” said Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Was it uncomfortable getting chased around and losing the fight even though we had logic backing us?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun nodded his head silently. His sword intent was nearly destroyed back in the Myriad Sword Painting and he was forced to accept such an unfair challenge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s good then. The sect never talks about reason because this is how the world is. It’s just like how Bai Ting took the fall when you killed Wang Ning back then.” Xin Yan stared at Lin Yun and continued, “But I don’t want you to die. So you must defeat Ye Liuyun one month from now. Since you’ve accepted the challenge, then kill Ye Liuyun like a man!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she spoke, her words resonated in Lin Yun’s mind. It took him a long time to recover from his shock. Lin Yun’s blood boiled in his body and he declared, “I will kill Ye Liuyun one month from now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Yan’s brows loosened up. When she stretched her palm out, a gentle and ancient aura started to converge. Thereafter, nine amber rays bloomed and condensed into a drop of water. It was the Ninth Grade Amber Martial Soul, Aquamoon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Yan controlled this droplet of Aquamoon into Lin Yun’s wound. The gentle energy flowed throughout Lin Yun’s body and his wound healed at a noticeable speed. At the same time, the sword intent left in his body also disappeared. Lin Yun’s injury was healed in the blink of an eye!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have faith in you.” Xin Yan’s face turned pale when she recalled the droplet of Aquamoon. What did she have faith in? She had faith that Lin Yun could kill Ye Liuyun!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun was briefly stunned before his eyes became watery. He had a tough personality, so he never shed tears despite all the trials he had been through. But today, Xin Yan’s words had touched the soft spot in his heart. Clenching his fist, Lin Yun trembled and bit his lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother, what’s wrong with you?” Li Wuyou brought the Dragon Blooded Horse over and asked. He looked worried after noticing that there was something peculiar about Lin Yun’s mood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go back.” Lin Yun mounted the Dragon Blooded Horse and traveled back to the alliance-union silently. Up in the horizon, above the vast white clouds, stood two people. It was an old man and an elegant middle-aged man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man was naturally Luo Feng, the Inner Elder who supported Locket Mountain and the mortal enemy of Bai Ting. Luo Feng had a high authority, and like Bai Ting, he had a chance to be promoted to a Sword-Bearing Elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But right now, he was being respectful to the middle-aged man standing beside him. The middle-aged man was donned in blue and looked elegant with delicate plum blossoms embroidered on his chest. He was one of the four Guardians directly beneath the Pavilion Lord. There were a total of four Guardians - the Plum, Orchid, Bamboo, and Chrysanthemum. He was the Guardian Plum.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is the youth who awakened the Aurora Dragon Primordial Chaotic Soul and killed Wang Ning back in the Nine Stars Contest?” Guardian Plum asked in a faint tone. His eyes were deep and no one could tell what was going on his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, that’s him. Guardian Plum, what do you think?” Luo Feng nodded and asked cautiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a faint smile, Guardian Plum replied, “He only comprehended the complete sword intent after leaving the Sword Burial Woods, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right.” Luo Feng felt &nbsp;uneasy. He had no idea why Guardian Plum was asking such a question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then he must have met ‘that’ person. Now then, it’s interesting that he made it out alive…” Guardian Plum smiled with his hands on his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then…” said Luo Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bring him to me if he’s not dead after a month,” said Guardian Plum, interrupting Luo Feng’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Feng felt bitter in his heart. He initially sought out Guardian Plum because he wanted to cancel this life and death battle. After all, now that both parties had accepted the challenge, not even the Sword-Bearing Elder had the authority to interfere. Only the Guardians could interfere with the challenge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Guardian Plum naturally knew what Luo Feng wanted, but he did not go along with it. Lin Yun’s sword intent, cultivation, and martial techniques were inferior to Ye Liuyun, not to mention that he had just joined the sect. This was why Luo Feng couldn’t see any possibility of Lin Yun winning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Guardian Plum had slowly shown an interest in Lin Yun, but he still allowed Lin Yun to court death. This made Luo Feng feel baffled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Gentlemen Union has been flourishing in recent years,” Guardian Plum sighed. He seemed to be dissatisfied with Wang Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Feng also felt the same way and replied, “After all, ‘that’ person is standing behind him…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Luo Feng mentioned ‘that’ person, Guardian Plum locked his brows together before he said, “Xin Yan is a good lass and she should be well-groomed. As for Lin Yun, you can leave it alone for now. The sect can help him once, but he needs to show us his worth if he wants us to help him again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Guardian Plum left right after he spoke. At this moment, Luo Feng also understood what was going through Guardian Plum’s mind. He would only start paying attention to Lin Yun if Lin Yun managed to survive through this ordeal. Otherwise, it wouldn’t matter even if Lin Yun died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The night was dark and an intense atmosphere filled the Gentlemen Union’s base. Today, the twelve elites failed to destroy Lin Yun’s sword intent and got theirs destroyed instead. The loss they suffered today was significant and it made Wang Yan feel distressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Ye Liuyun, Wang Yan asked, “It was an easy task, but you failed. Ye Liuyun, do you have anything to say about it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I was careless. But I promise that I’ll slaughter him a month from now!” Ye Liuyun replied in a solemn voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If I didn’t believe in your strength, do you think that you would still be standing here right now?” Wang Yan snorted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Liuyun knew that Wang Yan was wrong, but he did not dare to rebuke Wang Yan’s words. If it weren’t for the fact that he had underestimated his enemy, Lin Yun’s sword intent would’ve been destroyed by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Yan started to pace back and forth in the room with an uncertain expression. “No, I need to guarantee that nothing goes wrong one month from now. Take my token and head to the Wang Clan’s headquarters. You will stay there for the next month.” He finally stopped and made a decision, throwing a jade token over to Ye Liuyun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Liuyun held onto the cold jade token. He knew that Wang Yan was trying to improve his cultivation by using the Wang Clan’s enormous resources, but this made him unhappy. Furrowing his brows, he asked, “Senior Brother, you don’t believe in my strength? He was chased around by me like a dog today. If it wasn’t for the taboo of the sect, I would’ve already killed him by now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I already said that I want to ensure that nothing goes wrong. You have no idea how humiliated I am by my younger brother’s death,” Wang Yan replied indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Understood, I’ll head to the capital right away.” Seeing the hatred in Wang Yan’s eyes, Ye Liuyun did not dare to say anything and prepared to leave in the night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Simultaneously, there were many people crowded in Lin Yun’s residence back at the Locket Mountain’s base. All of them came nervously in a hurry at night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin…Master, are you alright? You actually accepted Ye Liuyun’s challenge?!” The person who spoke was naturally Ku Yun from the Pellet Hall. But just when he was going to ask more questions, his eyes met with Lin Yun. He could sense the coldness in Lin Yun’s eyes, which made him swallow down what he was going to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you’re here to persuade me, then you can leave right now,” said Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ku Yun was briefly stunned before he immediately replied, “I’m here to deliver you pellets. Wait...your injuries…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ku Yun was surprised. Lin Yun’s complexion was rosy and he didn’t seem injured at all. It was strange because he heard that Lin Yun was stabbed near his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun didn’t explain and stood up, “I’m relieved that you’re here to visit me. I might have something that requires your help.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ku Yun’s face became serious and he replied, “Go ahead and say it. I’ll help as much as I can.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Resources! I need resources! The more, the better!” shouted Lin Yun.</span></p>
