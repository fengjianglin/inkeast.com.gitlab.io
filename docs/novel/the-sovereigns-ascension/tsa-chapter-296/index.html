 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But when Lin Yun continued to circulate his sword sutra, he noticed that more origin energy was being produced within his body. The Iris Flower had undergone a thorough transformation after the Iris Sword Sutra reached the eighth stage and the recovery speed of his origin energy was unparalleled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Iris Sword Sutra is truly worthy of being a cultivation technique from the Golden Age. Every single improvement after the seventh stage is shocking.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Lin Yun sighed inwardly from the changes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His eyes were brightly lit and filled with boundless sword intent. He never felt so clear-headed before. The changes felt miraculous. Lin Qiushan said that those who refined the Imperial Sword Herb would have a short moment of connection with the sword and that it was beneficial to the comprehension of sword techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people could practice sword techniques that they couldn’t in the past and some monstrous geniuses could even have their sword technique reach complete mastery. She must have meant this very moment because Lin Yun could feel his mind becoming clearer than before and he found answers to many questions he had in the past.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Interesting...let me test out the Flicking Divine Sword first!” The Flicking Divine Sword was a secret technique left by the Iris Sword Saint. Secret techniques were hard to practice, not to mention one from the Golden Age.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The secret technique had five stages in total. The first stage being Flashing Aura, Flicking Fingers, which Lin Yun was using right now. He could condense his aura into sword gleams in this stage and kill others by flicking his finger. As for the latter stages, there was the second stage — Graceful Moment, Absolute Hit; the third stage — Heart Connection, Spiritual Sword; the fourth stage — Pinnacle Finger, Great Disaster; and the fifth stage — Fingers Flick, Descending Stars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun took out the jade strip and placed it on his forehead. He then closed his eyes and started to comprehend the secret technique. A brief moment later, Lin Yun slowly opened his eyes that were shining like the stars at night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The accumulation of his insights over the years instantly gave Lin Yun enlightenment. The origin energy in his meridians then started to circulate. A moment later, nine strands of violet origin energy gathered towards his right hand. When the nine origin energy clashed together, an Iris Flower appeared on the back of Lin Yun’s hand. It was like an Iris Sword Seal, which contained boundless origin energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lin Yun flicked his finger, the Iris Sword Seal on the back of his hand roared like an enraged dragon that shot out like a violet ray. Instantly, the violet ray reached a tree one thousand meters away, causing it to collapse. Lin Yun was shocked when he looked at the mess, “What speed!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tree collapsed practically in an instant when he flicked his finger. After reaching the second stage, the Flicking Divine Sword was ten times more powerful. The speed was the main thing that had been increased. Lin Yun even doubted if he could avoid the speed with the Seven Profound Steps. He couldn’t believe that he could unleash such lethality with just a flick of his finger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can’t waste any more time. This state won’t last long. Let’s put aside the Flicking Divine Finger’s third stage for now and go with the Overlord Sword!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with defeat when he thought of the Overlord Sword. At this point, he was just hoping that he could gain any insight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t believe that I can’t bring the Overlord Sword to greater mastery!” The defeat in his eyes gradually faded and was replaced with confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He picked up a tree branch and started to perform the Overlord Sword. He could sense that the Overlord Sword felt smoother than before as countless thoughts appeared in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time gradually passed as Lin Yun was fully immersed in the Overlord Sword. Compared to other sword techniques, the Overlord Sword only had a single sword and it was naturally a lot dryer than other sword techniques. Suddenly, the sword intent in Lin Yun’s eyes disappeared along with the endless insights appearing in his mind. At the same time, the state of connection also gradually faded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a pity. I’m only one step away from reaching greater mastery, but now I’m certain that the Overlord Sword given to me by Guardian Plum is incomplete. It might not have a single sword after all. But it doesn’t matter. Even if the state of connection didn’t disappear, I wouldn’t have been able to endure so many insights appearing in my mind.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Lin Yun didn’t manage to reach greater mastery with the state of connection, he was satisfied. Suddenly, several whistles were approaching. He could sense that the approaching auras were powerful and that they weren’t on the level as ordinary outer disciples. When he felt that, he couldn’t help having a trace of fear in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he soon figured out the reason when he looked at the tree that was reduced to ashes a thousand meters away. The elders supervising the Alliance-Union Battle must have been alerted by the commotion he caused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s time to leave for the second stage,” smiled Lin Yun. He tossed the tree branch away. The tree branch plunged into the ground and buzzed like a treasured sword. In the next second, he executed the Seven Profound Steps and disappeared like a Golden Crow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not long after he left, two elders appeared where Lin Yun previously stood. They were both shocked when they saw the ruins left on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s going on? Where did the trees in the surroundings go?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Could it be that an outer disciple’s cultivation increased after refining the Imperial Sword Herb and that they leveled this place to the ground?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Look!” The two elders soon noticed Lin Yun’s departing silhouette.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I remember him! He’s Zhong Yunxiao who obtained the first Imperial Sword Herb!” The supervising elders were familiar with Zhong Yunxiao, so they recognized Lin Yun with just a glance. They couldn’t help smiling bitterly. This brat probably had no idea what kind of shock he caused back on the observation platform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It involved a bet of 5,000 second-grade spiritual jades and his sudden appearance left all the elders shocked. After all, no one could guess that he would have been the first to obtain an Imperial Sword Herb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This tree branch seems to be left by him.” They could still see the tree branch buzzing on the ground. The supervising elder then walked over and pulled the tree branch out of the ground. The sword intent contained in the tree branch suddenly exploded, creating cracks on the ground that soon spread out with a domineering aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two elders exchanged a glance with a grave expression, “Let’s deliver this piece of news back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The atmosphere on the observation platform was still in a heated debate even after the fight for the Imperial Sword Herbs came to an end. Occasionally, news from the Burial Sword Peak would be released.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did you guys hear? Chu Haoyu only used a single move to kill a sixth stage demonic beast after refining the Imperial Sword Herb.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I already heard about that. That fellow is a monster. He has already transcended the Mortal Ranking with his strength.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t say that too early. Ye Xiu also killed a sixth stage demonic beast easily without drawing his sword!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right. Jiang Feng wasn’t any worse. I heard that his sword gleam was ten foot long after refining the Imperial Sword Herb.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s also Han Zhengyang. You can’t underestimate him. I speculate that he will enter the Earth Ranking after the Alliance-Union Battle. He might even be able to challenge the Sky Ranking in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many elites who obtained the Imperial Sword Herbs had undergone a shocking transformation. At this moment, some disciples started to regret that they didn’t join the Alliance-Union Battle. But when they thought about the high casualty number, they couldn’t help shaking their heads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Ting no longer frowned his eyebrows at this moment. He looked at the other elders and stroked his beard with a smile, “See? I’ve already said that those who obtained the Imperial Sword Herb will undergo a drastic transformation in their strength. So what if that sword slave hides for the first round? Let’s see how he continues to hide in the second round!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the elders here naturally knew about Bai Ting’s grudge with Lin Yun. They merely responded with a smile. After all, Luo Feng was around, and even if they agreed to what Bai Ting said, they didn’t want to get on Luo Feng’s bad side. But everyone knew that Bai Ting’s words were meant for Luo Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Feng wasn’t bothered by it and smiled, “Old geezer, there still isn’t any news about Zhong Yunxiao’s transformation after refining the Imperial Sword Herb. Why don’t you take a guess?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Ting’s face instantly became ugly upon mentioning Zhong Yunxiao. He sneered, “He’s just a nobody, so what transformation can he possibly have? Chu Haoyu relied on his talent and accumulation so that he could soar into the sky after refining the Imperial Sword Herb.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the elders nodded their heads inwardly. What Bai Ting said was right, the Imperial Sword Herb was useless to someone who wasn’t talented. Bai Ting sneered, “What does Zhong Yunxiao have? He’s just lucky. So what if he obtains an Imperial Sword Herb? Old geezer, you’re really naive to think that you can anger me with him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, a deacon came up and bowed to the elders before he gave his report, “Elders, I’ve just received news that after Zhong Yunxiao refined his Imperial Sword Herb, he leveled all the trees within a thousand meter radius!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he gave his report, he noticed that the elders had fallen into silence.

His hatred for Zhong Yunxiao nearly reached the level of hatred he had for Lin Yun. When the elders and disciples heard about what Zhong Yunxiao did, their interest was piqued. All of them wondered who Zhong Yunxiao was.</span></p>
