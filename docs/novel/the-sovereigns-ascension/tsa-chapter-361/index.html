 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire world was spinning. When Lin Yun opened his eyes, what appeared before him was a patch of void filled with fluffy clouds. The underground palace's exit was also a teleportation array, which transported him to a random location.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he knew that he wasn’t far from the underground palace. He was teleported on top of a mountain and then he jumped down without any hesitation. After all, he was unsure if someone else would be teleported here. So, it was unwise to stay here for long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun was actually in a mountain range. When he descended to the ground, he had raised a dust cloud. Raising his head, the first thing he tried to do was find a remote location. With a few leaps, Lin Yun appeared behind a few huge rocks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a rather secretive place. Lin Yun gently patted on his interspatial pouch and retrieved all the Demonlotus Cores, including the four and five petals core. Aside from the cores, he also took out the Indigofrost Flame Fruit and a few spiritual herbs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Time to make my breakthrough,” muttered Lin Yun to himself. He already planned to make a breakthrough as soon as he gathered enough resources. After all, strength represented your authority in the Demonlotus Realm. Strength was critical if you wanted to obtain more treasures or even to protect yourself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun first started by dispelling the demonic miasma. After all, the demonic miasma would affect his mental state if he didn’t dispel them. In the end, it would just turn him into someone who was bloodthirsty. In serious cases, he might even fall down the path of a demonic cultivator. The demonic miasma was only beneficial to demonic cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun sat with his eyes closed and circulated his Iris Sword Sutra, along with his quasi-xiantian sword intent. His hair started fluctuating in the wind created by his rippling energy and the Demonlotus Cores on the ground also started to float into the air. Looking from afar, it looked like the black lotuses were revolving around Lin Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the black radiance on the Demonlotus Core was shattered by Lin Yun’s sword intent. Since he possesses the quasi-sword intent and the Iris Sword Sutra, the process of him removing the demonic miasma was a lot faster than it was for others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In barely half a day, the black Demonlotus Cores were turned into jade green lotuses. After the four and five petals Demonlotus Cores were purified, Lin Yun opened his eyes and sucked the cores into his stomach. “Come!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun’s aura started to rise. When the four petal Demonlotus Core entered his body, he emitted a jade green glow, and his clothes also began to flutter. It practically took an instant for his cultivation to reach the pinnacle seventh stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the five petal Demonlotus Core entered his body, the jade green glow coming from his body grew even brighter. It practically took an instant for him to shatter his bottleneck and to reach the eighth stage of the Profound Martial Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He now knew why so many people wanted to enter the Demonlotus Realm despite knowing the dangers. After all, the Demonlotus Core was too tempting. But Lin Yun did not want to make a breakthrough right now and suppressed the energy fluctuating within his body while circulating the Age Sutra.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Age Sutra was like a sponge that absorbed the energy from the Demonlotus Cores. When he was done with the process, all the spiritual energy had been refined and purified. As Lin Yun continued to circulate the Age Sutra, the feeling of being bloated started to subside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After several circulations, the jade green glow emitted from him became refined and innate. Lin Yun just stabilized his cultivation in the pinnacle seventh stage of the Profound Martial Realm, so he wasn’t in a rush to form the eighth profound vein. Everything was under his control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then again, his objective, ultimately, was to make a breakthrough. But he didn’t want to make a breakthrough when his foundation wasn’t sturdy enough. This was the reason why he refined the boundless energy from the Demonlotus Cores in his body again and again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lin Yun opened his eyes, he opened his mouth and sucked the Indigofrost Flame Fruit and spiritual herbs into his stomach. What followed was a faint chill that spread out from Lin Yun and lowered the temperature around him. Even snowflakes started to fall out of nowhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Still, with his eyes closed, indigo flames started to blaze from Lin Yun’s body. Simultaneously, the Iris Flower seemed to be excited about the Indigofrost Flame Fruit’s energy. It didn’t take long for another petal to appear on the Iris Flower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he refined the spiritual fruit and herbs, Lin Yun easily made it through the seventh stage’s bottleneck and formed his eighth vein. Everything took place smoothly. When Lin Yun was done refining the Indigofrost Flame Fruit, the Iris Flower had seventy petals. Lin Yun was just two petals away from reaching the ninth stage in the Iris Sword Sutra.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun wanted a breakthrough in both his cultivation and cultivation technique at the same time. Opening his eyes, Lin Yun let out a breath. His temperament had undergone a drastic change. With a breakthrough in both his cultivation and cultivation technique, he was two times stronger than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two wisps of indigo flames blazed in the depths of his eyes. Before the flames disappeared, Lin Yun drew his sword and froze everything within a thousand meter radius. When he sheathed his sword, everything that was frozen shattered into fragments. This was the second ultimate move from the Aquaselenic Sword–Myriad Frost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Aquaselenic Sword’s ultimate moves are truly powerful. I wonder how powerful the last move is.” Lin Yun managed to comprehend one of the three ultimate moves, Myriad Frost, before the Indigofrost Flame Fruit effects were about to disappear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a lot stronger than Luminous Moon. Right at this moment, Lin Yun heard footsteps nearby and instantly hid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It didn’t take long for him to see the owner of the footsteps, Feng Ye. But Feng Ye didn’t seem to be in a great condition as he was covered in wounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Ye suddenly threw up a mouthful of blood. He then turned around and felt relieved when he saw that no one came after him. He had several close encounters with death when he was escaping from the underground palace. He was lucky to rely on his trump cards to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Lin Yun couldn’t imagine what exactly happened for an elite of the Myriad Beast Gate, the genius who had a high rank in the previous Dragon Gate Competition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Those bastards! You wait! I’ll butcher all of you after my injuries recover!” He entered the underground palace with absolute confidence, killing almost everyone he met. But he didn’t expect that he would be reduced to such a pathetic state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“And that brat, Lin Yun!” Feng Ye gnashed his teeth when he thought of Lin Yun. But all of a sudden, he shivered. He was shocked wide awake and looked around with disbelief from the cold temperature. Could it be that there was a treasure nearby?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a common scene in the Demonlotus Realm and Feng Ye started to look around with excitement on his face. But the smile disappeared on his face when he saw someone that he never imagined he would see.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Feng Ye, you seem to have a grudge against me?” Lin Yun walked out with the sword box on his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Feng Ye saw Lin Yun, the killing intent in his eyes flared up. But he soon calmed down and smiled, “What a coincidence. I never expected to see you here. I believe you must have taken the treasure here. Since that’s the case, then I’ll take my leave first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You have quite a bit of treasure in your interspatial pouch, right? Make your choice. Either you offer them to me or I’ll take them myself.” Lin Yun’s cold voice sounded out the moment Feng Ye turned around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Ye’s mouth started to twitch because those words sounded familiar to him. That was what he said to Lin Yun when they first met. He never expected that retribution would come so quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason he tried to escape was that he didn’t want his harvest to be snatched. But he never imagined that he would still have to give it away in the end. His eyes were filled with reluctance, but his face was plastered with a smile when he turned around, “I’ll do it myself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew that he would die if Lin Yun interfered personally, not to mention that Lin Yun now gave him an unfathomable feeling. Feng Ye had a feeling that he might not be able to defeat Lin Yun even if he wasn't injured.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Ye had quite a sizable harvest and gave Lin Yun dozens of Demonlotus Cores, three spiritual herbs, and one spiritual fruit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yun wasn’t polite and took them all. But seeing that Feng Ye stopped, he asked, “The mat?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can’t you leave me with some things?” Feng Ye smiled bitterly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Interesting. Is the mat more important than your life? Or perhaps you don’t need this chance of making a choice that I’m giving you?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You! Great!” Feng Ye ultimately handed the mat over.</span></p>
