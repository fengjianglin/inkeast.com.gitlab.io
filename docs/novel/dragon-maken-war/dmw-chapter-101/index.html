 <p>Chapter 101 - The Sword that Split the Heavens (4)</p>
 <p><span style>Pah-ah-ah-ah-ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kook!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jeffers was taken aback. &nbsp;Azell hadn't moved, yet a beam of light came down at angle from the sky towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Laura hadn't acted, he would have suffered a direct hit. &nbsp;When Jeffers realized this fact, he shuddered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell appeared in front of him like a phantom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jeffers lashed out with his sword in surprise. He was the descendent of Almarick, who was called ‘The Sword that parts a storm'. &nbsp;Instead of being a magician, he was a swordsman, who practised the Dragon Arts. &nbsp;The sword strike infused with powerful Dragon Demon Magic cut through Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Clone!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was a fake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-ah-ah-ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a flash, Azell was split into three. &nbsp;He attacked Laura, Kieren and Jeffers at the same time. None of the three Dragon Demon were able to locate Azell’s real body, so they lashed out against the opponent in front of them with their full strength. &nbsp;Amongst the three, the real Azell was the one to attack Kieren.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…or they were under that false assumption. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-haht!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-ahk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The terrifying sound of flesh being cut rang out as blood fountained into the air. &nbsp;Before the first scream could die down, the sound of steel being used was heard continuously followed by the the sound of destruction. &nbsp;Then the screams rang out one after another.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He wasn't aiming for us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kieren was a beat late in assessing the situation. &nbsp;The one to attack Kieren had also been a clone. &nbsp;The magic was very intricate, and there been enough resistance in cutting the clone's flesh that he had mistaken it for the real body. &nbsp;However while the three Dragon Demons were focused on the clones, Azell had attacked their subordinates in the rear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kieren no longer hesitated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dragon Demon Weapon: Bleeding Star!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A red light was emitted from him as Kieren revealed the Dragon Demon weapon passed down to him by Baldazark, who used to be one of the four great Dragon Demon generals. &nbsp;At a glance, it looked like a crystal ball, which was as big as a child's head. &nbsp;However, at the center of the weapon, one could see several thousand layer of threads made out of light. &nbsp;It was dizzying to see such a tangle of threads as they wriggled around. &nbsp;From the surface, it was letting out a blood colored light, and the threads of light started to rapid flow into the surrounding. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duke Almarick!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood. &nbsp;I order using the authority granted to me by my great name! &nbsp;Return form the Eternal Battlefield! &nbsp;Dragon Demon Weapon: Storm Blade!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Accompanying a blast of wind, a large sword appeared. &nbsp;It looked to be made from a transparent material like glass, and it started to burn with blue flame when Jeffers took hold of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell didn’t care if they brought out their Drag Demon weapons or not. &nbsp;He was creating havoc within the ranks of the Dragon Demon king worshippers. &nbsp;All the combatants gathered there &nbsp;had considerable amount of martial powers, but they were like scarecrows in front of Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three Dragon Demons carrying Dragon Demon weapons went forth to stop Azell. &nbsp;However, &nbsp;they were also swept up into the chaos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Which one...is the real one?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura mumbled as if she was groaning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was multiplying as time passed. &nbsp;Every time he used the Instantaneous Movement to evade, a new clone appeared. &nbsp;Moreover, all the clones possessed a presence that made it was impossible to tell which one was the real body. &nbsp;&nbsp;These clones were even able to use physical attacks to take down the enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What if they use the Dragon Demon weapon to discern the real body of Azell?</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was another foolish idea. &nbsp;The Dragon Demon weapon called the ‘</span><span style>The Sword that Split the Heavens’ was freely being passed amongst Azell’s real body and clones. &nbsp;Azell was using this special property to the fullest extent</span><span style> as he continuously moved the location of the Dragon Demon weapon as he continued his slaughter….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…I guess enough of you have gathered in one place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At some point, the Dragon Demon king worshippers heard Azell’s low voice, and they felt terror wash over them. &nbsp;In a flash, Azell’s clones collapsed on itself, and Azell appeared outside of the perimeter of the Dragon Demon king worshippers. &nbsp;He emitted a frightening &nbsp;lightning strike.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kieren was dismayed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We've been had! &nbsp;Everyone scatter!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had made several dozen clones, yet they hadn't been created to take down all the Dragon Demon King worshippers. Even Azell couldn't create and maintain such a high number of clones. &nbsp;There was a limit on how much offensive capability he could allocate to each clone. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, the elite troops of the Dragon Demon king worshippers were doing quite well in weathering Azell's surprise attack. &nbsp;The only ones to be taken down were the ones that came across the Dragon Maken. &nbsp;In the end, only 10 were taken out of battle, and the rest were injured.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had wanted to cause chaos. &nbsp;He used the chaos to control the movements of his enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell's plan was carried out perfectly. &nbsp;Kieren realized that his allies had been maintaining a perimeter for defense, but they were now concentrated in a single location.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is too late.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell put on a smile of satisfaction as he brought down his sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Horn of the Thunder Dragon!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The intense thunder, which was reminiscent of a Dragon's Roar, swallowed up the Dragon Demon king worshippers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ggwah-gwah-gwah-gwah-gwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>6</span></p>
 <p><span style>While her sight was burning white from the intense thunder strike, Laura was swept up by a strong sense of deja vu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her mission had been a failure when Azell had interfered. &nbsp;After the failed mission, she had returned to her family house to meet someone. &nbsp;This being was the oldest elder within the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;During the Dragon Demon war, this being caused fear and chaos within the ranks of humans just by appearing in front of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had talked to this being about Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Maybe this is the start of fate repeating itself again.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the time, Laura hadn’t fully understood what this being was talking about. &nbsp;Even amongst the standard of Dragon Demons, this being had lived a very long life, and the way he saw and thought about the world was very alien.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He smile as he looked at the conflicted Laura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Unfortunately, you are a child, who had everything taken away to mold you into Aunsaurus’ heir. &nbsp;When the day we’ve been waiting for come, I might be able to wake up from my sleep. &nbsp;At that time, you’ll have all your answer. &nbsp;At this time, I cannot tell you everything. &nbsp;Instead, I’ll show you a memory that you will need.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he showed her the far distant past by showing her his memory of the Dragon Demon war.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This knowledge wasn’t passed down to her by words. &nbsp;It hadn’t been shown through the records.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He pushed the memory from his mind into Laura. &nbsp;She experienced it as a daydream. &nbsp;This allowed Laura to experience the past as if she was actually there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had the memory of an experience she had never experienced before, but it made her feel a sense of deja vu right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man with the swirling red hair, the sword, and the overwhelming thunder strike….</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was identical to what she saw within the memory of the Dragon Demon war.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Azell Karzark… The man who will have the chance reverse the fate of the king.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her mumbled words were drowned out by the explosion created by the thunder strike. &nbsp;Even she couldn’t hear her own words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-goo-goo-goo-goo……!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white explosion created by the thunder faded away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kook… Shit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kieren's fists were shaking. He had been barely able to block the attack. &nbsp;If he hadn't called out his Dragon Demon weapon, and if Laura hadn’t used her Vitan’s Chalice, which had an insanely high defensive capability, their party would have been decimated from a single strike.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was only able to protect only his immediate vicinity. &nbsp;At that moment, Kieren hadn't realized it yet, but half of his troop of 100 was killed. &nbsp;Their corpses weren't even left behind. &nbsp;Moreover, even amongst the survivors, only half of them were able fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kieren mumbled to himself as if he couldn't believe what had just happened</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…could it be? &nbsp;Is he Azell Karzark reborn?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From an early age, he had heard countless stories about the Dragon Demon war. &nbsp;He was actually fed up with it. &nbsp;He was told about how great his grandfather Baldazark was. &nbsp;Moreover, he was told stories about Azell Karzark, who had killed Baldazark. &nbsp;He was told how frightening and terrible Azell was....</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Azell of right now reminded him of the Azell within the story. &nbsp;Each of the elements that had contributed to make Azell into such a powerful martial might could be seen now. &nbsp;It was as if the Azell of the past was reborn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, an explosion rang out from the side. &nbsp;Kieren looked towards the direction in surprise, and he saw Azell clashing with Jeffers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmm. &nbsp;It seems your mental fortitude isn’t too bad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell hadn’t let up after unleasing a calamity level attack on his enemies. &nbsp;He had killed several survivors, who were standing there dumbfounded. &nbsp;Then he ambushed Jeffers. &nbsp;However, Jeffers blocked the attack as if he had expected an ambush.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How dare you ambush me this way! &nbsp;Did you really think it'll work on me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still, your say those bold words but your expression says otherwise.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell taunted Jeffers. &nbsp;In truth, Jeffers was trying to hide his fear by using his bluster. &nbsp;Unlike his imposing voice, his expression was rigid as cold sweat ran down his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Anyways…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell suddenly tilted his head in puzzlement as he asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm really curious about this, so please don't misunderstand my intentions. &nbsp;Just here me out. &nbsp;I just want to confirm it again. Are you sure you are Almarick's descendent?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you spouting that nonsense again? &nbsp;Are you trying to insult me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No matter how I see it, it doesn’t seem like you are lying about it... &nbsp;At the very least, you believe it is true. &nbsp;How strange. &nbsp;I’m having a hard tim discerning the secret design behind this move.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you just say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kieren went over his thoughts as he looked at Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is it a clone or the real body?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Azell, who was clashing violently with Jeffers, didn't hold the blue Dragon Maken anymore. &nbsp;He held the Dragon Sword. &nbsp;Its white blade was made from dragon bone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he had been tricked time and time again, so it stopped him from coming up with a swift judgement. &nbsp;At that moment, Kieren thought he was being cautious with his actions, but even this hesitation was induced by Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he could come up with a plan of action, Azell moved first. &nbsp;More clones with substance appeared as they attacked the Dragon Demon king worshippers. &nbsp;On top of it all, Kieren’s worst case scenario came to pass.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What the hell! &nbsp;He can clone the Dragon Demon weapon!!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of Azell’s clones were holding the Dragon Maken. &nbsp;Each Dragon Maken was letting out a resonance of Dragon Demon magic, so one couldn’t tell, which one was the realy one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, one of the clone was aiming for the fallen Niberis, who was being attended by one of her subordinate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Niberis!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kieren moved without any thoughts on his own self-preservation. &nbsp;He let his own Dragon Demon weapon block the attack heading towards him, and he stood in front of Niberis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-ahk!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kieren felt a &nbsp;pain intense pain. &nbsp;He had received a deep wound. &nbsp;The pain was so intense that Kieren wasn’t able to let out a scream. &nbsp;He used his Dragon Demon magic indiscriminately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn't even have the time to properly shape his magic. &nbsp;He just formed powerful image in his mind, and he let out Dragon Demon magic like a whirlwind. &nbsp;This choice of action might lead to his death, but he didn't have the luxury to be picky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwah-kwah-kwah-kwah……!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, he recalled his Dragon Demon weapon, which was blocking Azell’s attack from where Kieren’s original locaation. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he had his Dragon Demon weapon, he would be able to block consecutive attacks from Azell!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the expected follow up attack never arrived. &nbsp;After a brief moment, Kieren was able to recover his senses, and he used magic to stop the bleeding. &nbsp;He assessed his surrounding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cheng! Che-cheng! Kah-ah-ah-ahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was in a fight against Jeffers. &nbsp;Jeffer’s Dragon Demon weapon and Azell’s Dragon Sword was being swung in a splendid style. &nbsp;Sparks and shockwave exploded forth when their swords impacted on each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At a glance, it looked like an even fight, but if one was more careful in one’s observation, one could tell this wasn’t so. &nbsp;Moreover, it was weird that these two beings were fighting in such a manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Duke Almarick. &nbsp;Why are you using your Dragon Arts?’</span></p>
