  <p><span style><span style>Chapter 10 - Dragon Demon Princess (4)</span></span></p>
  <p></p>
  <hr>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>“The Dragon Demon race wanted to take over the world about 200 years ago, so a war happened?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“So you know about that. After the hero Azell Karzark defeated the Dragon Demon King Atein in the Dragon Demon war…..”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After speaking to that point, Rick glanced at Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Now that I think about it, your name is also Azell.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“So what?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Moreover, Azell Karzark had crimson hair color too.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It can happen.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell felt guilty inside, but his outer appearance didn’t change. Rick spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No, I just feel sorry for the legendary hero, who has the same name as you. You are in a very sorry state.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Well, there were a good amount of humans that sided with the Dragon Demon race during the Dragon Demon war.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Dragon Demon King Atein gathered numerous Dragon Demons to conquer the world. He dreamed about an empire where the Dragon Demon race was held above every other race.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, not everyone from the Dragon Demon race sided with him. Those, who didn’t like Atein, claimed neutrality and some even sided with the humans.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell remembered them.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Now that I think about it they could still be alive.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Dragon Demon race lived far longer than humans. Therefore, those from the Dragon Demon race he fought along side with could still be alive after 220 years. He should have thought about this possibility, but since he didn’t have a grasp on the situation, it didn’t even reach his thoughts.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell’s heart started beating faster after he realized this truth.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Currently, Azell was trying to positively accept everything he saw, but in the corner of his heart, he was despairing. He was tossed into a unknown world by himself, and it was difficult for him to endure the loneliness.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However… There were others who might have been alive during his time, even if they aren’t humans. This fact planted a seed of expectation in Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘However…..’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Not too long after the Dragon Demon War ended, Azell retreated from the public eyes. The reason wasn’t known to the public, but his health had deteriorated rapidly from the curse of Atein.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Therefore, he was in the dark as to how the world operated after the Dragon Demon war ended, but he was able to find out about this truth.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The public sentiment turned against those from the Dragon Demon race, who had cooperated with the humans.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘What happened afterwards?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Even though they had fought with the humans, they were still from the Dragon Demon race. The Dragon Demon war instilled an unimaginable amount of fear and animosity towards the Dragon Demon race.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick’s story was talking about that part.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“After the Dragon Demon war, the Dragon Demons, who chose to help the humans, had no choice but to retire from most of the world. Then there were the half-breeds who had inherited their blood….</span></p>
  <p><span style>In other words, the persecuted Dragon Demons made trouble in various places.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>So that’s what happened.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Amongst the Dragon Demon race, there were those who had fallen in love with humans, so they had sided with the humans. While they were treated as comrades during the war, they were denied from becoming members of their society.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘No, even then….’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Even during the Dragon Demon war, they were isolated. They weren’t treated as true comrades, but a tool with great power. The humans couldn’t trust them, but they were treated as useful betrayers.</span></p>
  <p><span style>That is why the Dragon Demons treasured the relationship with those who came to them with open heart like Azell and Carlos. They wanted to trust the world, but it was only filled with animosity. It was very difficult for them to keep faith.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick continued with his story.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The situation changed after some time had passed. The Nadick Empire was in decline, and Duke Rulein couldn’t stand the tyranny that was spreading inside the war-torn empire. He gathered the surrounding lords, and they combined to form the Rulein Kingdom. Of course, after the Rulein Kingdom declared independence, the empire responded with military force.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Rulein kindom’s war of independence was the start of Nadick Empire’s demise.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, even if the Nadick Empire was impoverished by war, they were still the strongest in the world. From the start, the Rulein Kingdom was faced with desperate crisis.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was when Duke Rulein made a bold decision.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The decision was the Dragon Demon race. He decided to ally with the Dragon Demon race, and the mixed-blood Dragon Demons. By giving them social status and a chance to live a decent life, the Rulein Kingdom was able to get their hands on a very powerful force in return.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“He had to marry a female of the Dragon Demon race to confirm their will. The following monarchs must also mate with someone who had inherited the blood of the Dragon Demon race. This law was made to preserve the blood of the Dragon Demon race in the Royal Family. ”</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was how the existences called the Dragon Demon Princess and the Dragon Demon Prince was formed. They were the living symbol of the alliance between the humans and those with Dragon Demon blood, who were living alongside each other.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Since they cannot succeed the throne, it is impossible for them to threaten the royal authority. Until the new generation is born, they are required to fight for the the throne. That is why they are everyone’s hero.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“So that’s how it is….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was having fun listening to the history after he had bowed out.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He learned about what had happened to the Dragon Demon race after the Dragon Demon war had ended. His chest hurt from hearing about the collapse of the Nadick empire since it was his home country. However, he had a deep impression of the Ruelin Kingdom because of how they treated the Dragon Demon race.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘In the end, they exchanged the right to live in the human society for the strength of the Dragon Demon race.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>If he was cynical then he would interpret it that way. He needed to find out more information, but Azell didn’t think his guess was wrong. The fact that humans and Dragon Demon race cannot co-exist without such an arrangement made Azell feel a bit bitter.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell queried.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“So why is the Dragon Demon Princess coming here?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Of course, it’s the ruins.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It might be the ruins of Arch Mage Carlos. It is a possibility, so the Dragon Demon Princess was dispatched as the leader of the research team.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Arch Mage Carlos…..”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Before Azell fell asleep, Carlos had numerous titles. However, he wasn’t called an Arch Mage since he was still young.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, 220 years had already passed and he was recorded into history as a great man. Azell laughed bitterly at that fact.</span></p>
  <p><span style>6</span></p>
  <p><span style>There is only one Dragon Demon princess in each generation of the Rulein Kingdom.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The current Dragon Demon Princess’ name was Arrieta Weil Rulein. She was two years older than her sibling, the Dragon Demon Prince Seiga Weil Rulein.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmmm.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta had fallen asleep for a brief moment inside the royal carriage, and now her eyes opened.</span></p>
  <p><span style>She was still a 17 year old girl. Currently she didn’t have any armor on, so it was hard to see her as an existence, who had gained her fame in the battlefield.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Her long silver hair was partly braided beneath her ears, and her eyes were like yellow jewels that glowed of sunset. Her skin didn’t have any blemish, and her ears were slightly pointed like a fairy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Above her left ear, there was a bluish feather-like horn protruding, and it looked like it was sculpted from snow. If someone who didn’t know saw it then it could be mistaken for a unique accessory.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Accompanying the horn, she had two gems embedded on her hands, which gave away the fact that she wasn’t completely human. The gems were colored the same as her yellow eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>There was a blurry shadow energy inside the gem named Dragon Magic Stone. It looked like a dragon’s eyes, and the pupils were slit vertically. It gave off an eerie feeling as if a dragon was staring at you.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After staring at a blank space, she suddenly spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Enora.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The young servant sitting next to her was named Enora. She was around 14 years old. She had curly red blond hair with bright green eyes. She looked like a cute doll.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta queried.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Have we arrived yet?” (TLN: All her speeches are very formal.)</span></p>
  <p><span style>She spoke in an antiquated way. Enora replied back.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I heard that we are almost there.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I woke up for no reason. However… What is it?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arietta gave a slight frown. Enora queried.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What is wrong?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I thought I felt someone’s gaze…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Someone’s gaze?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It just felt like someone was watching me. I woke up, because it got on my nerve. So sleep well.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta closed her eyes again. Then she fell asleep before 3 seconds had passed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Enora laughed awkwardly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m not allowed to sleep…..”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The carriage was running slowly, but it wasn’t comfortable since they were on a forest road. However, Arrieta slept as if she was sleeping on top of her mattress inside her room.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After Enora watched Arrieta sleep like a doll, she shifted her gaze outside the window. There were only two of them inside the carriage, so she was bored. If Arrieta was a normal girl then she would have passed the time gossiping, but she was definitely not normal.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Still my Princess, how can you sleep so much?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Enora had become Arrieta’s exclusive maid only 2 month ago. At first, she was very nervous at the fact that she was the exclusive maid to the Dragon Demon Princess. Moreover, Arrieta didn’t show any emotion in front of other people, and her speech was very antiquated. She was very overbearing.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, after spending a lot of time with her, those sentiments were all gone. She found out Arrieta had a very loose personality. It even made her doubt if Arrieta was a high born.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘No matter what she doesn’t wake up.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>She frequently fell asleep during the day, so in the servant’s perspective, she didn’t have to walk around on eggshells.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Enora was bored so she was looking out the window, while wiggling her toes. Suddenly, the noise outside became loud. They must have arrived.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Princess. Princess.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“….oong?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>She started whispering in her ears, and Arrieta opened her eyes. She looked at Enora with sleepy eyes, while asking a question.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“We have arrived?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“We’ll arrive soon.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Then let me sleep a little bit more….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You can’t.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Why?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You said you can’t go out with sleepy eyes?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…did I say that?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta tilted her head. Enora nodded her head furiously.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You told me to stop you from falling asleep again.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Is that right. Mmm. Oh well. Please tidy up adequately.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta yawned and she closed her eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Enora moved quickly. She brushed the princess’ tangled hair, and applied make-up near her eyes after washing them. Then she handed her the clothes that was hanging next to her. Her outerwear was styled like a uniform, and she quickly helped her put on a coat. Even though she was young, she had the skills to be an exclusive maid to the Dragon Demon Princess.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Unless it was a social event, Dragon Demon Princess Arrieta didn’t wear dresses. The clothes that was similar to a uniform was comfortable to move around in. The coat had a white back ground with blue flame patterns, and it was a magical item made specifically for her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Soon a knight outside the window spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Princess, we have arrived.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I understand.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The voice that had answered the knight didn’t have a trace of sleepiness. The voice was mature and dignified.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Not too long after Arrieta had replied back, they had arrived at their destination.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Truthfully, I thought we would get ambushed at least once coming here….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Enora’s eyes widened in surprise.</span></p>
  <p><span style>They had traveled from the castle to the fortress of the western border guard. Then they left the fortress to the site of the ruins in the Balan forest. Their trip was very peaceful. Since there were a lot of people, the bandits or creatures didn’t dare to attack them lightly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>As a reference, about 30 people were dispatched by the royal family. There were 20 soldiers, who escorted the Dragon Demon Princess Arrieta. The rest were magicians, scholars, and servants.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It is none other than the Balan Forest. I had heard that it was a very dangerous place, so I surmised that there would be at least one confrontation. Unexpectedly, nothing happened.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Isn’t it better that nothing happened?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes. I’m just saying.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta descended from the carriage after finishing those words. Then suddenly her gazed turned towards a single location.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmm?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>(TLN: Description can always be tricky and hard to visualize. This pic shows the blue feather like horn above her left ear.)</span></p>

 <p><span style>“So you know about that. After the hero Azell Karzark defeated the Dragon Demon King Atein in the Dragon Demon war…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After speaking to that point, Rick glanced at Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now that I think about it, your name is also Azell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Moreover, Azell Karzark had crimson hair color too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It can happen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell felt guilty inside, but his outer appearance didn’t change. Rick spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I just feel sorry for the legendary hero, who has the same name as you. You are in a very sorry state.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, there were a good amount of humans that sided with the Dragon Demon race during the Dragon Demon war.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon King Atein gathered numerous Dragon Demons to conquer the world. He dreamed about an empire where the Dragon Demon race was held above every other race.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, not everyone from the Dragon Demon race sided with him. Those, who didn’t like Atein, claimed neutrality and some even sided with the humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell remembered them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Now that I think about it they could still be alive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dragon Demon race lived far longer than humans. Therefore, those from the Dragon Demon race he fought along side with could still be alive after 220 years. He should have thought about this possibility, but since he didn’t have a grasp on the situation, it didn’t even reach his thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s heart started beating faster after he realized this truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, Azell was trying to positively accept everything he saw, but in the corner of his heart, he was despairing. He was tossed into a unknown world by himself, and it was difficult for him to endure the loneliness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However… There were others who might have been alive during his time, even if they aren’t humans. This fact planted a seed of expectation in Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘However…..’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not too long after the Dragon Demon War ended, Azell retreated from the public eyes. The reason wasn’t known to the public, but his health had deteriorated rapidly from the curse of Atein.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, he was in the dark as to how the world operated after the Dragon Demon war ended, but he was able to find out about this truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The public sentiment turned against those from the Dragon Demon race, who had cooperated with the humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What happened afterwards?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though they had fought with the humans, they were still from the Dragon Demon race. The Dragon Demon war instilled an unimaginable amount of fear and animosity towards the Dragon Demon race.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick’s story was talking about that part.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“After the Dragon Demon war, the Dragon Demons, who chose to help the humans, had no choice but to retire from most of the world. Then there were the half-breeds who had inherited their blood….</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words, the persecuted Dragon Demons made trouble in various places.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>So that’s what happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amongst the Dragon Demon race, there were those who had fallen in love with humans, so they had sided with the humans. While they were treated as comrades during the war, they were denied from becoming members of their society.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No, even then….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even during the Dragon Demon war, they were isolated. They weren’t treated as true comrades, but a tool with great power. The humans couldn’t trust them, but they were treated as useful betrayers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That is why the Dragon Demons treasured the relationship with those who came to them with open heart like Azell and Carlos. They wanted to trust the world, but it was only filled with animosity. It was very difficult for them to keep faith.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick continued with his story.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The situation changed after some time had passed. The Nadick Empire was in decline, and Duke Rulein couldn’t stand the tyranny that was spreading inside the war-torn empire. He gathered the surrounding lords, and they combined to form the Rulein Kingdom. Of course, after the Rulein Kingdom declared independence, the empire responded with military force.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Rulein kindom’s war of independence was the start of Nadick Empire’s demise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, even if the Nadick Empire was impoverished by war, they were still the strongest in the world. From the start, the Rulein Kingdom was faced with desperate crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was when Duke Rulein made a bold decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The decision was the Dragon Demon race. He decided to ally with the Dragon Demon race, and the mixed-blood Dragon Demons. By giving them social status and a chance to live a decent life, the Rulein Kingdom was able to get their hands on a very powerful force in return.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He had to marry a female of the Dragon Demon race to confirm their will. The following monarchs must also mate with someone who had inherited the blood of the Dragon Demon race. This law was made to preserve the blood of the Dragon Demon race in the Royal Family. ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was how the existences called the Dragon Demon Princess and the Dragon Demon Prince was formed. They were the living symbol of the alliance between the humans and those with Dragon Demon blood, who were living alongside each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since they cannot succeed the throne, it is impossible for them to threaten the royal authority. Until the new generation is born, they are required to fight for the the throne. That is why they are everyone’s hero.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So that’s how it is….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was having fun listening to the history after he had bowed out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He learned about what had happened to the Dragon Demon race after the Dragon Demon war had ended. His chest hurt from hearing about the collapse of the Nadick empire since it was his home country. However, he had a deep impression of the Ruelin Kingdom because of how they treated the Dragon Demon race.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In the end, they exchanged the right to live in the human society for the strength of the Dragon Demon race.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he was cynical then he would interpret it that way. He needed to find out more information, but Azell didn’t think his guess was wrong. The fact that humans and Dragon Demon race cannot co-exist without such an arrangement made Azell feel a bit bitter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell queried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So why is the Dragon Demon Princess coming here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, it’s the ruins.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It might be the ruins of Arch Mage Carlos. It is a possibility, so the Dragon Demon Princess was dispatched as the leader of the research team.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Arch Mage Carlos…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Azell fell asleep, Carlos had numerous titles. However, he wasn’t called an Arch Mage since he was still young.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, 220 years had already passed and he was recorded into history as a great man. Azell laughed bitterly at that fact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>6</span></p>
 <p><span style>There is only one Dragon Demon princess in each generation of the Rulein Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The current Dragon Demon Princess’ name was Arrieta Weil Rulein. She was two years older than her sibling, the Dragon Demon Prince Seiga Weil Rulein.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta had fallen asleep for a brief moment inside the royal carriage, and now her eyes opened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was still a 17 year old girl. Currently she didn’t have any armor on, so it was hard to see her as an existence, who had gained her fame in the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her long silver hair was partly braided beneath her ears, and her eyes were like yellow jewels that glowed of sunset. Her skin didn’t have any blemish, and her ears were slightly pointed like a fairy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Above her left ear, there was a bluish feather-like horn protruding, and it looked like it was sculpted from snow. If someone who didn’t know saw it then it could be mistaken for a unique accessory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Accompanying the horn, she had two gems embedded on her hands, which gave away the fact that she wasn’t completely human. The gems were colored the same as her yellow eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a blurry shadow energy inside the gem named Dragon Magic Stone. It looked like a dragon’s eyes, and the pupils were slit vertically. It gave off an eerie feeling as if a dragon was staring at you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After staring at a blank space, she suddenly spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enora.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young servant sitting next to her was named Enora. She was around 14 years old. She had curly red blond hair with bright green eyes. She looked like a cute doll.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta queried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have we arrived yet?” (TLN: All her speeches are very formal.)</span></p>
 <p><span style>She spoke in an antiquated way. Enora replied back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard that we are almost there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I woke up for no reason. However… What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arietta gave a slight frown. Enora queried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is wrong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought I felt someone’s gaze…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Someone’s gaze?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It just felt like someone was watching me. I woke up, because it got on my nerve. So sleep well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta closed her eyes again. Then she fell asleep before 3 seconds had passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enora laughed awkwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not allowed to sleep…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The carriage was running slowly, but it wasn’t comfortable since they were on a forest road. However, Arrieta slept as if she was sleeping on top of her mattress inside her room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Enora watched Arrieta sleep like a doll, she shifted her gaze outside the window. There were only two of them inside the carriage, so she was bored. If Arrieta was a normal girl then she would have passed the time gossiping, but she was definitely not normal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Still my Princess, how can you sleep so much?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enora had become Arrieta’s exclusive maid only 2 month ago. At first, she was very nervous at the fact that she was the exclusive maid to the Dragon Demon Princess. Moreover, Arrieta didn’t show any emotion in front of other people, and her speech was very antiquated. She was very overbearing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, after spending a lot of time with her, those sentiments were all gone. She found out Arrieta had a very loose personality. It even made her doubt if Arrieta was a high born.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No matter what she doesn’t wake up.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She frequently fell asleep during the day, so in the servant’s perspective, she didn’t have to walk around on eggshells.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enora was bored so she was looking out the window, while wiggling her toes. Suddenly, the noise outside became loud. They must have arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Princess. Princess.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“….oong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She started whispering in her ears, and Arrieta opened her eyes. She looked at Enora with sleepy eyes, while asking a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We have arrived?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll arrive soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let me sleep a little bit more….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You said you can’t go out with sleepy eyes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…did I say that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta tilted her head. Enora nodded her head furiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You told me to stop you from falling asleep again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that right. Mmm. Oh well. Please tidy up adequately.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta yawned and she closed her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enora moved quickly. She brushed the princess’ tangled hair, and applied make-up near her eyes after washing them. Then she handed her the clothes that was hanging next to her. Her outerwear was styled like a uniform, and she quickly helped her put on a coat. Even though she was young, she had the skills to be an exclusive maid to the Dragon Demon Princess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unless it was a social event, Dragon Demon Princess Arrieta didn’t wear dresses. The clothes that was similar to a uniform was comfortable to move around in. The coat had a white back ground with blue flame patterns, and it was a magical item made specifically for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon a knight outside the window spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Princess, we have arrived.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The voice that had answered the knight didn’t have a trace of sleepiness. The voice was mature and dignified.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not too long after Arrieta had replied back, they had arrived at their destination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Truthfully, I thought we would get ambushed at least once coming here….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enora’s eyes widened in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had traveled from the castle to the fortress of the western border guard. Then they left the fortress to the site of the ruins in the Balan forest. Their trip was very peaceful. Since there were a lot of people, the bandits or creatures didn’t dare to attack them lightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a reference, about 30 people were dispatched by the royal family. There were 20 soldiers, who escorted the Dragon Demon Princess Arrieta. The rest were magicians, scholars, and servants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is none other than the Balan Forest. I had heard that it was a very dangerous place, so I surmised that there would be at least one confrontation. Unexpectedly, nothing happened.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t it better that nothing happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. I’m just saying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta descended from the carriage after finishing those words. Then suddenly her gazed turned towards a single location.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>(TLN: Description can always be tricky and hard to visualize. This pic shows the blue feather like horn above her left ear.)</span></p>
