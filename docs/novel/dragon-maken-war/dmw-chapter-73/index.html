 <p><span style>Chapter 73 - Hero's Training (4)</span></p>
 <p><span style>He trained to the extreme for 30 days, and he rested for 10 days. This was his optimal training cycle, but he didn't have to keep to the schedule. &nbsp;The important part was the ratio. &nbsp;If he wanted to reduce the training time, he could train to the extreme for four days, then he would need only a single day of rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The training he performed up until now had stimulated every single inch of his body. &nbsp;This was true for his bones, muscles, nerves, blood vessels... Every single one of his cells were stimulated as he drove them to move. &nbsp;As he became more aware of his own body, the job of consolidating his body occurred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the stimulation would cause the creation of extra magic, and he sent it into his Energy Pulse. &nbsp;He worked on expanding his Energy Pulse. This resulted in his magic being able to flow to every inch of his body, and his body was strengthened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The act of recovering from injury was also part of this process.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An injured body worked differently from one's normal body, and Azell even put this phenomena to use.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the true worth of the Body Strengthening technique that had been passed down to Azell by Liglan. &nbsp;When one trains the mind, one has to find out the basic anatomy of the mind. &nbsp;Usually, one used one's body without doubt. &nbsp;This process allowed him to understand his body, and it brought his body under control.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Half a year's time should be enough.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt endlessly thankful toward Kairen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell suddenly asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm have some questions I want to ask you, Mr. Havanz.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I would like to ask you about you grandfather. It is about the Dragon Demon Duke Rogan Aludin, who fought with Azell Karzark.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had lied to Kairen about seeing Rogan's portrait. The books Azell had read had only brief passages describing Rogan as one of the heroes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why he wanted to hear about Rogan from his descendent. &nbsp;He wanted to hear what kind of life Rogan had lead after the Dragon Demon War ended...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm guessing Mr. Havanz never met him personally?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. He passed away long ago. He passed away long before Sir Azell was born....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha ha ha.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, that wasn't possible. &nbsp;Azell let out a bitter laugh inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Havanz asked him a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How old do you think I am?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm. &nbsp;Let's see. I'm guessing you are in your mid-60s. &nbsp;”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Havanz had a surprised expression at his words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are amazing. &nbsp;I've never met someone, who guessed my age so accurately on the first try. &nbsp;People get confused whether I am a Dragon Demon or a Dragon Majin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A Dragon Majin's age is hard to estimate just based on their outer appearance. &nbsp;However, I formulated my guess based on your occupation. &nbsp;No matter how talented you are, you would need more than 10 years to be trained as a steward. &nbsp;This was why I guessed that age. &nbsp;I thought you couldn't be older than mid-60s.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sometimes, Sir Azell doesn't act like a young person. &nbsp;Your insight is amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Havanz continued speaking as he burst out into laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These are words I heard from my father. &nbsp;Grandfather was someone, who lived for over 300 years, so he was like a living history book. He loved telling stories. &nbsp;My father and the elders of my household relayed many of his stories to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Like what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“After the Dragon Demon war ended, he had started a business. &nbsp;He lost all his fortunes in that venture, and he had gone into bankruptcy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell's eyes turned round. Rogan was quick and facile in calculating profit and loss. &nbsp;He had been very efficient in managing the army's supply. &nbsp;A person like that drove his business into bankruptcy?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Havanz spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandfather had started his first business after the Dragon Demon war had ended. &nbsp;At the time, he had thought the world was his oyster... Or that was what he had said. However, the aftermath of the Dragon Demon war resulted in humans holding animosity towards the Dragon Demons. &nbsp;Even though my grandfather had fought for the humans, he wasn't free from receiving their scorn.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unlike his management of the army in the Dragon Demon war, he had to act ruthless against his trading partners. &nbsp;At times, he would have to act like a demon, but that was easier said than done.... There were also some high profile figures, who held ill feelings towards the Dragon Demon race. &nbsp;In the end, he lost all the money he had saved up, and he had gone into debt. &nbsp;At the time, he said his future had looked very bleak. &nbsp;He hated the humans enough where he had thought about killing them all. &nbsp;He had put his life at great risk to save the humans in the Dragon Demon War. &nbsp;If another Dragon Demon war broke out, he thought about siding with the other side...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was speechless as he felt an ache inside his heart. &nbsp;Azell had thought Rogan would have lived well as a hero of the Dragon Demon war. &nbsp;However, reality wasn't that kind. &nbsp;It was common to see many wartime heroes fall into being useless humans when time of peace arrived. &nbsp;It seemed &nbsp;Rogan held similar risk factors that lead to the downfall of the former heroes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Havanz continued to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, humans were also the ones, who had saved him. &nbsp;Even during those tough times, my grandmother never left his side, and she supported him... Then there were the humans he had befriended during the Dragon Demon war. &nbsp;He was able to get back up on his feet with the help of the people, who received his help during the Dragon Demon war. Then he came to an understanding.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What was it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He shouldn't dream about becoming a great merchant unless he was prepared to become a demon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Basically… He couldn't bring himself to become a demon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;I feel the same way as him. I wanted to be in a position where I'll be allowed to run an organization. I can invest my feelings into each member of the organization. &nbsp;In business, one have to see the people making up one's organization as interchangeable parts or a number. &nbsp;If one can't do this, it would be best to stay clear from being a merchant. &nbsp;One would have to find a different path. &nbsp;Grandfather found that different path. He passed on the family's business to his children after making sure it would run adequately. When my grandmother died, he lived a very busy life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Busy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. He was our Duke's teacher, and he also played the game of being a hero as he traveled to various regions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He played a game of being a hero?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This was how grandfather described it with his word. He didn't like putting humans in difficulty through his business dealings. It would cause the humans to hate him. &nbsp;Instead, he preferred saving people in trouble. &nbsp;He'd rather hear gratitude from humans after saving them, so he took up saving people as a hobby. &nbsp;He traveled far and wide, so you'll be able to hear stories about my grandfather from various parts of the continent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha ha ha.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell couldn't help, but laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was really a story befitting Rogan. This was really like the Rogan Azell had known. &nbsp;Rogan had been very talented at running an organization, but he was very compassionate. &nbsp;He had a bleeding heart. &nbsp;Even as the army was running short on supplies, he gave food to the children of the refugee groups the army ran across. He would say he could do without food for awhile as he gave the children his portion of the food. How could someone like him become a great merchant, who were like cold-hearted devils?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It seems you lived a merry life, Rogan.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was unfortunate that he'll never meet Rogan again. &nbsp;However, he felt consoled by the fact that Rogan had lived a rich life. &nbsp;He was someone Azell had trusted to protect his back in a fight. &nbsp;He was also a friend, who shared nonsensical stories with him as they shared drinks... &nbsp;He was also Azell's savior. &nbsp;Rogan had been at the site of his teacher's death, and he allowed Azell to put his life on the line for the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Don't act like a child, young human. &nbsp;A great man like him just entrusted you with the future. &nbsp;Even if it feels dirty, live on to become a hero. If you don't, you will despise yourself for the rest of your life.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell remembered wrapping himself in those words as he charged into the hailstorm of arrows and magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that day, Azell took time at odd intervals to hear about Rogan from Havanz. &nbsp;Azell buried his memory of Rogan in his mind until he would be able to look back and see his smile. </span></p>
 <p><span style>6</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beorein spoke in a tired manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The shape has somewhat taken form.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were in their third month of dedicating themselves to manufacturing the Dragon Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The process of making the Dragon Weapon was strictly a magical process. Even the act of carving the Dragon Bones into the shape of the desired weapon wasn't done by hand. &nbsp;It had to be done by magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still, I'm more comfortable at doing this compared to the first time we tried this out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It had been a long time since we made the first one. &nbsp;Of course, the production process has been much improved. &nbsp;Moreover, if the maker has a Dragon Weapon at one's disposal, the process become that much easier.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jeez. &nbsp;We have to pour in Dragon Demon magic as if we are pouring in water.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Weapon was seeped with Dragon Demon magic. &nbsp;Even a human would be able to use Dragon Demon magic with this weapon. This was why a Dragon Demon or a Dragon Majin had to pour in an incredible amount of Dragon Demon magic from the start of the manufacturing process.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, the production of Azell's Dragon Sword had gone smoothly, so they were at the halfway point. However, the unfinished Dragon Weapon floating atop the magic circle didn't look anything like a sword. It looked like a stone had been half-halfheartedly chipped away. &nbsp;It had the rough shape of a sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it ok for you to vacate your seat for too long? I thought you would travel back couple times during the process.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My friend. Isn't it a bit too late to ask that question now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, I'll admit I am a bit late in asking the question.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Anyways, it isn't a problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beorein had already appointed his successor to the title of Count Michael. &nbsp;He had created a great system where everything would run smoothly even if he was absent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn't a problem as a lord or a member of the Guardian Shadow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm. &nbsp;Were your disciples entered into the Guardian Shadow?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. The number of Guardian Shadow members have increased drastically with our country.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Archmage Beorein had seven disciples excluding his descendants. He had entered four of his most trusted and talented disciples into the Guardian Shadow. &nbsp;For the near future, it would alleviate the shortage of manpower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beorein spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It took a long time. &nbsp;It really....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was quite odd for him to be so active in the affairs of his land. &nbsp;He should have seceded his title of count to his descendant already. Dragon Majin lived longer than humans, but their lives were short-lived compared to the Dragon Demon. &nbsp;At Beorein's age, he should have been retired from the society of nobles. Even those of the Dragon Demon race retired after an adequate amount of time passed. They married a little bit later than humans, but the title of nobility was passed on unless there was a special circumstance that prevented it like Kairen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was also an unusual circumstance behind Beorein's long reign as the Count. Around 30 years ago, Beorein had lost all his heirs to this title. &nbsp;He had lost all his children and grandchildren to the Dragon Demon Worshippers. Everyone's sympathy towards Beorein lasted for a brief moment. Every one of his relatives came at him for his title of Count, so his household and lands was put in a very bad spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the time, Beorein didn't even know who he should blame for the deaths. &nbsp;Even as he fell into despair, the Dragon Demon worshippers continued their work to destroy him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was at that point when the Guardian Shadow appeared in front of Beorein. &nbsp;The Guardian Shadow repelled a trap set by the Dragon Demon worshippers, and Beorein had willingly became a member of the Guardian Shadow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It took a long time to stabilize his domain, and he had groomed another successor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a brief moment, Beorein had fallen into his old memories. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beorein spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let's put the issue of marriage aside. &nbsp;You should try a little bit harder to grow the membership of the Guardian Shadows.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm actually eyeing some of my more competent subordinates. I'm also thinking about entering Arrieta and Seigar into the organization.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm sure the Dragon Demon Queen will oppose it. Moreover, those two have too much burden on their shoulders. &nbsp;We need members, who can travel around freely. &nbsp;Princess Arrieta and Prince Seigar are tied to the throne, so they aren't suitable candidates.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is true, but...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon Queen was a member of the Guardian Shadow. &nbsp;Her children and the King didn't know about this fact. &nbsp;However, she had basically retired when she entered the throne as the Dragon Demon Queen. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beorein spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you really believe the words spoken by our friend, Azell?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My friend. &nbsp;Isn't it a bit too late to ask that question now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You turned my exact words against me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe him. &nbsp;I'll admit there are a lot of dubious parts to his story, but in spite of those facts, I still believe him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are completely taken with him. Tsk tsk. &nbsp;This is why you are still a bachelor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How are those two things related?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I've never seen you completely taken with anyone. &nbsp;Your tastes are so eccentric that it is too hard to find a woman that you'll be able to live your life with. It would have been great if Azell had an older sister or a younger sister.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beorein smirked as he changed the subject.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, okay. You are blind to love, but I'll agree that you have a discerning eye for humans. &nbsp;Anyways, he is endlessly fascinating when seen through the eyes of a magician.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beorein was in awe of the various techniques displayed by Azell. He spoke to Azell deep into the night, and he was gaining so much from those conversations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If that friend really the descendent of Azell Karzark... I'm really curious about that fact.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you curious about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder why Azell Karzark hid himself in the latter years of his life. Moreover, what is the his descendant, who inherited all the techniques forgotten in this era, trying to accomplish? &nbsp;I can't help, but wonder.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maybe, he foresaw a danger in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He prepared a descendant for the trouble that'll come in the future?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn't that likely?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I sincerely hope not. &nbsp;However, if that does happen, do you think our friend will be the vessel to stop the threat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe in him. Somehow, I feel as if he'll pave a path into the future no matter what happens in the future... &nbsp;He generates such belief in me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had never tried to dazzle Kairen with his words. &nbsp;It didn't matter if Azell's words were believed or not. Azell proved his worth through his actions. He liked that attitude, and it had moved Kairen's heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beorein smirked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As a Dragon Majin, you are considered young, but you have gotten older. &nbsp;You are talking about entrusting the future to the young.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really do sound like an old man. &nbsp;Shit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen frowned.</span></p>
