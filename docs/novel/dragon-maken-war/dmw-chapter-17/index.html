  <p></p>
  <hr>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>“The P, Princess has always been able to sleep well in any place.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Enora spoke nervously.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Enora was just a normal girl, so today’s events had taxed her physically and mentally. She felt like she could fall over any second from fatigue. However, she couldn’t sleep because she was afraid and nervous.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell laughed bitterly, while looking at Enora.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Being able to sleep anywhere is a merit. Especially on the battlefield….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“……”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Little lady should also sleep a little.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>While speaking kindly, Azell touched Enora’s forehead with his fingers. This caused Enora to suddenly feel sleepy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Ah, how come….?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Such a question occurred to her, but it didn’t last long. She fell asleep just like that.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick queried.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What did you do?</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I made her sleep.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You can do that?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It’s easy. Should I do it to you?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Is there any side effects?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“None.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Please do so. I don’t think I’ll be able to fall asleep…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After saying those words, Rick fell asleep once Azell’s hand touched him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell looked at the night sky through the trees as he mused.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘The stars are still the same.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was the only thing that was intact from his memories.</span></p>
  <p><span style>3</span></p>
  <p><span style>Curiously, Azell hadn’t dreamed once since he woke up. It was as if he had dreamed a life time worth of dreams during his long sleep….</span></p>
  <p><span style>Of course, he couldn’t have. This was proven when Azell slept after he had rotated with Arrieta.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Azell’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell heard someone calling his name inside his dream.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Azell’</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was the sound of an unfamiliar man’s voice. However, there was some nostalgic sound mixed in there.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Who are you?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>While thinking this, Azell looked towards the owner of the voice.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Is it because it was a dream? The process of finding him wasn’t needed. The moment Azell thought he wanted to see the person, the person appeared in front of him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Is this a dream?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Yes. It is your dream.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Who are you?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Those are the most disappointing words in the world.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>The other person smiled wryly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, he couldn’t see the other’s face. It was as if his gaze wouldn’t reach above the other’s mouth….</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘You have to know who I am. Only then can you see me.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was momentarily lost in his thoughts, when he was given this unreasonable requirement. Then he suddenly thought of this one person, and he was shocked.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘…Carlos?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>He was recorded in history as an arch mage, and he was Azell’s best friend.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Then his face was revealed. In front of his eyes, there was an old man with crooked features.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘You….’</span></p>
  <p><span style>For a moment, Azell looked him over with surprised eyes. Carlos laughed playfully. Azell spoke while looking at him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘…you lost all your hair?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Is that the only thing you can comment on!’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Carlos flew into a rage.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Yes. The man who was called an archmange, Carlos, was bald. All of the hair on his head was gone, but he had a robust beard. Azell smirked, while watching him fume.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘What can I do when that’s the most visible thing. Anyways, you have aged.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I’m different from you. I’m guessing you haven’t aged at all?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Thanks to you. Can’t you tell by looking at me?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I can’t see you.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘What?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘You are seeing a remnant I left in your energy pulse(TLN: think of it as his dantian). I’m just talking and moving like the Carlos you knew. However, I am not him. Also, I don’t share the same time as you. I can only have a conversation with you.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘The Carlos I knew wasn’t a bald headed old man…’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Is that the only thing you have to say!’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Carlos flew into a rage again. Azell burst out in laughter.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Poot.(TLN:sound of suppressed laughter) You must have become very temperamental when you aged? Carlos had a cold intellect. He was famous for being a cold and patient magician, who always made the right judgements. I don’t know how he became a bad tempered bald old man…. Tsk tsk. He must have swapped his precious thing for an archmage’s reputation. ‘</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘When you said precious thing, what are you trying to say to me? Huh? Surely, you aren’t talking about my hair? You aren’t, right?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘You are well aware of it yourself?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell had a fun time teasing him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Carlos, in front of his eyes, was not the real. It was only the remnant of his thoughts he left behind. He must have made it to deliver a message to his friend who would wake up in an unknown period in the far distant future….</span></p>
  <p><span style>Still, it was quite enjoyable to make conversation with him. Even if he was a mere illusion, his memory of the time he spent with Carlos was revived.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘By looking at your appearance, you must have made this remnant long after I fell asleep.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Yes. I was 78 year old.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>The voice was different from Azell’s memories, because he had aged. However, there was a similar sound akin to the voice Azell remembered.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Even his appearance was like that. He had lost his hair, grown a thick beard, and the wrinkles were everywhere…. Still his eyes was very similar to the Carlos he knew.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell asked.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘When did you start losing your hair?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Stop talking about that.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Jeez. Just tell me. If you don’t, then I’ll find out about it by looking through the history books.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Do what you want. I’ll exercise my right to remain silent on the subject. Young kids have no manners.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Jeez. I might look young, but I’m way older than you. I’ve woken up after sleeping for 220 years.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘The human age isn’t about how long you have existed. It is about how long you have lived.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘However, shouldn’t we include sleep as living?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I guess so.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Then acknowledge my age.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘If a person mimics an animal’s hibernation and sleeps then it isn’t included.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘You are forcing it.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell laughed. Then he spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Maybe you can’t react to facts you don’t know or wasn’t able to correctly predict?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Yes.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>For example, Azell told the remnant of Carlos’ remnant that 220 years had passed yet he didn’t show any surprise. Maybe, it was an information that couldn’t be entirely processed by the old remnant, so it couldn’t be respond to it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell asked.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘How long do you have?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Not long. Most of the time had been wasted having a conversation with you.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘So we can’t have a long conversation.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Maybe if I was a ghost, but I’m a remnant left inside someone else’s energy pulse.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>This meant that once Azell started circulating the magical energy through his magical pulse his own sense of self would become stronger, and the remnant would continue to fade.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It probably was disappearing even at this moment.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell queried.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Then I’ll ask you something important. You exist to give me what message?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Carlos wouldn’t have made a remnant of his spirit to just stroke at his memories. There must be something he wanted to pass on to Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Carlos spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I don’t know when you woke up. Also, I have no idea what the situation at that time period will hold.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>He just felt relieved that it didn’t happen during his life time. The remnant of Carlos’ spirit said so.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I can only talk about the news based on when I lived. Azell, Atein is alive.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘What?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was taken aback.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Dragon Demon King Atein was alive? This can’t be. Azell had killed him directly. Azell had killed him after setting up a situation where he couldn’t have survived the final battle!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Carlos spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘To be precise, he didn’t die all the way. Before you killed him, he prepared a method that’ll allow him to revive himself. Moreover, this method is being secretly carried out by his followers, who follow his will. This has been going on for a couple decades.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘If a dead person resurrects, then this sounds a bit different from the Undead body?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Undead body uses black magic to recall the reaper above ground. However, they aren’t actually alive. They are corpses moving with the help of magical energy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Carlos answered.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Yes. It isn’t the Undead body. This is a true rebirth.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Is it possible? Even if it is Atein….’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I’ve concluded that it is possible, but even I can’t replicate it.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Mmmm. If you concluded that it could happen then I guess it’s possible.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell trusted Carlos’ judgement. At the very least, his predictions never missed the mark when it was related to magic.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell asked.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Then he could have already resurrected by the time I woke up?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I don’t know. He could have revived or he could have failed to revive.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘What kind of an irresponsible answer is that?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘This will happen after I die, so why should I care? You have to live in the future, so I have to overcome my annoyance to give you a warning. Be thankful.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘That is really like you.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell laughed bitterly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Carlos spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘When you woke up, I don’t know how many of the arrangements I made had survived. I hope most of it survived, and it’ll be a help to you.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘So there is no guarantee any of it have survived?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Just think about what you did while you were living. You robbed many ancient ruins and mazes. After I am dead, how can I guarantee the arrangements I made won’t meet the same fate? If one buries a treasure, then someone will always dig it back up.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Mmm. That is true….’</span></p>
  <p><span style>The ruin, where Azell was asleep, was placed where not many humans would travel. However, the ruin was eventually found and a massive excavation work began. Didn’t Azell wake up because of it?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Suddenly Azell asked a question.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Why have you appeared now? Why didn’t you show up when I first awoke?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I guess it is because you didn’t come out of the ruins using the normal procedure.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Huh?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘You didn’t get any of the items I prepared for you before coming out?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘…correct.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Since it is none other than you, I thought that possibility would be high. Without the power of the ruin, this remnant wouldn’t have shown up in front of you.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>It wasn’t an easy task to maintain the remnant inside someone else’s magical pulse for around 200 years. It was only possible for Carlos, who was an arch-mage.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Inside the ruin, I left a map indicating where all the items you have to earn is located at. However…’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘However?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘The fact that the remnant of my thoughts have appeared, it means the ruin is slowly losing its defensive powers, and it is transitioning into an emergency state.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘What?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Someone broke through the protective system from the outside, so I appeared here to tell you the important informations. Also… When you are really in trouble, something you need will appear once and lend a helping hand..’ (TLN: it’s either something he needs or something that is needed – he is making a vague statement)</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘What do you mean by something I need?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘You will find out soon. Therfore… Live well.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>While laughing bitterly, Carlos disappeared from Azell’s dream.</span></p>
  <p><span style>4</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I can’t believe he became bald……”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell’s eyes naturally opened, and he muttered.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The words he muttered came out of nowhere, so Arrieta asked.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What are you talking about?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Never mind. I was talking about my dream.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Carlos’ apppearance in the dream was shocking. He used to be a cold handsome man who used to steal the heart of numerous ladies. However, he lost all his hair when he grew old.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Moreover, the fact that he had aged was shocking in itself. He had never thought he would be able to live and see his friend get old. Azell had never imagined it before.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Suddenly, this made him realize anew that he (TLN:Carlos) had died, while he slept.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell thought about the fact that he had been thrown into the far future by himself, and it made him feel lonely.</span></p>

 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“The P, Princess has always been able to sleep well in any place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enora spoke nervously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enora was just a normal girl, so today’s events had taxed her physically and mentally. She felt like she could fall over any second from fatigue. However, she couldn’t sleep because she was afraid and nervous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell laughed bitterly, while looking at Enora.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Being able to sleep anywhere is a merit. Especially on the battlefield….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“……”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little lady should also sleep a little.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While speaking kindly, Azell touched Enora’s forehead with his fingers. This caused Enora to suddenly feel sleepy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Ah, how come….?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Such a question occurred to her, but it didn’t last long. She fell asleep just like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick queried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you do?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I made her sleep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can do that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s easy. Should I do it to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there any side effects?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“None.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please do so. I don’t think I’ll be able to fall asleep…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying those words, Rick fell asleep once Azell’s hand touched him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell looked at the night sky through the trees as he mused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The stars are still the same.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the only thing that was intact from his memories.</span></p>
 <p><span style>3</span></p>
 <p><span style>Curiously, Azell hadn’t dreamed once since he woke up. It was as if he had dreamed a life time worth of dreams during his long sleep….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, he couldn’t have. This was proven when Azell slept after he had rotated with Arrieta.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Azell’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell heard someone calling his name inside his dream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Azell’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the sound of an unfamiliar man’s voice. However, there was some nostalgic sound mixed in there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Who are you?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>While thinking this, Azell looked towards the owner of the voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Is it because it was a dream? The process of finding him wasn’t needed. The moment Azell thought he wanted to see the person, the person appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is this a dream?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Yes. It is your dream.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Who are you?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Those are the most disappointing words in the world.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other person smiled wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he couldn’t see the other’s face. It was as if his gaze wouldn’t reach above the other’s mouth….</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You have to know who I am. Only then can you see me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was momentarily lost in his thoughts, when he was given this unreasonable requirement. Then he suddenly thought of this one person, and he was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘…Carlos?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was recorded in history as an arch mage, and he was Azell’s best friend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then his face was revealed. In front of his eyes, there was an old man with crooked features.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a moment, Azell looked him over with surprised eyes. Carlos laughed playfully. Azell spoke while looking at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘…you lost all your hair?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is that the only thing you can comment on!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos flew into a rage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes. The man who was called an archmange, Carlos, was bald. All of the hair on his head was gone, but he had a robust beard. Azell smirked, while watching him fume.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What can I do when that’s the most visible thing. Anyways, you have aged.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m different from you. I’m guessing you haven’t aged at all?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Thanks to you. Can’t you tell by looking at me?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can’t see you.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You are seeing a remnant I left in your energy pulse(TLN: think of it as his dantian). I’m just talking and moving like the Carlos you knew. However, I am not him. Also, I don’t share the same time as you. I can only have a conversation with you.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The Carlos I knew wasn’t a bald headed old man…’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is that the only thing you have to say!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos flew into a rage again. Azell burst out in laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Poot.(TLN:sound of suppressed laughter) You must have become very temperamental when you aged? Carlos had a cold intellect. He was famous for being a cold and patient magician, who always made the right judgements. I don’t know how he became a bad tempered bald old man…. Tsk tsk. He must have swapped his precious thing for an archmage’s reputation. ‘</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘When you said precious thing, what are you trying to say to me? Huh? Surely, you aren’t talking about my hair? You aren’t, right?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You are well aware of it yourself?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had a fun time teasing him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Carlos, in front of his eyes, was not the real. It was only the remnant of his thoughts he left behind. He must have made it to deliver a message to his friend who would wake up in an unknown period in the far distant future….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, it was quite enjoyable to make conversation with him. Even if he was a mere illusion, his memory of the time he spent with Carlos was revived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘By looking at your appearance, you must have made this remnant long after I fell asleep.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Yes. I was 78 year old.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The voice was different from Azell’s memories, because he had aged. However, there was a similar sound akin to the voice Azell remembered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even his appearance was like that. He had lost his hair, grown a thick beard, and the wrinkles were everywhere…. Still his eyes was very similar to the Carlos he knew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘When did you start losing your hair?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Stop talking about that.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Jeez. Just tell me. If you don’t, then I’ll find out about it by looking through the history books.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Do what you want. I’ll exercise my right to remain silent on the subject. Young kids have no manners.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Jeez. I might look young, but I’m way older than you. I’ve woken up after sleeping for 220 years.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The human age isn’t about how long you have existed. It is about how long you have lived.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘However, shouldn’t we include sleep as living?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I guess so.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Then acknowledge my age.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If a person mimics an animal’s hibernation and sleeps then it isn’t included.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You are forcing it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell laughed. Then he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Maybe you can’t react to facts you don’t know or wasn’t able to correctly predict?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Yes.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>For example, Azell told the remnant of Carlos’ remnant that 220 years had passed yet he didn’t show any surprise. Maybe, it was an information that couldn’t be entirely processed by the old remnant, so it couldn’t be respond to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How long do you have?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Not long. Most of the time had been wasted having a conversation with you.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘So we can’t have a long conversation.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Maybe if I was a ghost, but I’m a remnant left inside someone else’s energy pulse.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This meant that once Azell started circulating the magical energy through his magical pulse his own sense of self would become stronger, and the remnant would continue to fade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It probably was disappearing even at this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell queried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Then I’ll ask you something important. You exist to give me what message?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos wouldn’t have made a remnant of his spirit to just stroke at his memories. There must be something he wanted to pass on to Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I don’t know when you woke up. Also, I have no idea what the situation at that time period will hold.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He just felt relieved that it didn’t happen during his life time. The remnant of Carlos’ spirit said so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can only talk about the news based on when I lived. Azell, Atein is alive.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon King Atein was alive? This can’t be. Azell had killed him directly. Azell had killed him after setting up a situation where he couldn’t have survived the final battle!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘To be precise, he didn’t die all the way. Before you killed him, he prepared a method that’ll allow him to revive himself. Moreover, this method is being secretly carried out by his followers, who follow his will. This has been going on for a couple decades.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If a dead person resurrects, then this sounds a bit different from the Undead body?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Undead body uses black magic to recall the reaper above ground. However, they aren’t actually alive. They are corpses moving with the help of magical energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Yes. It isn’t the Undead body. This is a true rebirth.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is it possible? Even if it is Atein….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’ve concluded that it is possible, but even I can’t replicate it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Mmmm. If you concluded that it could happen then I guess it’s possible.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell trusted Carlos’ judgement. At the very least, his predictions never missed the mark when it was related to magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Then he could have already resurrected by the time I woke up?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I don’t know. He could have revived or he could have failed to revive.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What kind of an irresponsible answer is that?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This will happen after I die, so why should I care? You have to live in the future, so I have to overcome my annoyance to give you a warning. Be thankful.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘That is really like you.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell laughed bitterly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘When you woke up, I don’t know how many of the arrangements I made had survived. I hope most of it survived, and it’ll be a help to you.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘So there is no guarantee any of it have survived?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Just think about what you did while you were living. You robbed many ancient ruins and mazes. After I am dead, how can I guarantee the arrangements I made won’t meet the same fate? If one buries a treasure, then someone will always dig it back up.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Mmm. That is true….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ruin, where Azell was asleep, was placed where not many humans would travel. However, the ruin was eventually found and a massive excavation work began. Didn’t Azell wake up because of it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly Azell asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why have you appeared now? Why didn’t you show up when I first awoke?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I guess it is because you didn’t come out of the ruins using the normal procedure.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Huh?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You didn’t get any of the items I prepared for you before coming out?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘…correct.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Since it is none other than you, I thought that possibility would be high. Without the power of the ruin, this remnant wouldn’t have shown up in front of you.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t an easy task to maintain the remnant inside someone else’s magical pulse for around 200 years. It was only possible for Carlos, who was an arch-mage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Inside the ruin, I left a map indicating where all the items you have to earn is located at. However…’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘However?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The fact that the remnant of my thoughts have appeared, it means the ruin is slowly losing its defensive powers, and it is transitioning into an emergency state.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Someone broke through the protective system from the outside, so I appeared here to tell you the important informations. Also… When you are really in trouble, something you need will appear once and lend a helping hand..’ (TLN: it’s either something he needs or something that is needed – he is making a vague statement)</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What do you mean by something I need?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You will find out soon. Therfore… Live well.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>While laughing bitterly, Carlos disappeared from Azell’s dream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>4</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t believe he became bald……”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s eyes naturally opened, and he muttered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The words he muttered came out of nowhere, so Arrieta asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you talking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind. I was talking about my dream.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos’ apppearance in the dream was shocking. He used to be a cold handsome man who used to steal the heart of numerous ladies. However, he lost all his hair when he grew old.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, the fact that he had aged was shocking in itself. He had never thought he would be able to live and see his friend get old. Azell had never imagined it before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, this made him realize anew that he (TLN:Carlos) had died, while he slept.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell thought about the fact that he had been thrown into the far future by himself, and it made him feel lonely.</span></p>
