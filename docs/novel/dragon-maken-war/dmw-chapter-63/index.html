  <p dir="ltr">Chapter 63 - Those who Follow the Prophecy (2)</p>
  <p dir="ltr">3</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Normally, the nobility moved with a big party that denoted their station. &nbsp;This was especially true for those with the rank of Duke. &nbsp;There were numerous retinue that would do the miscellaneous work.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, Kairen was starting the fire and drawing the water from the stream by himself.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell spoke.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I never thought I would see the sight of you starting a fire, and drawing water.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Of course, Azell wasn’t fooling around, while Kairen was doing the miscellaneous work. &nbsp;He ran around the forest to hunt down the birds and the rabbits. &nbsp;Since he was a high rank Spirit Order Practitioner, he was able to use his mental wave freely. &nbsp;It felt like cheating using those skills to hunt.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Kairen responded in a calm manner.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If there is no one to do it, then I have to do it. &nbsp;It isn't as if these tasks will finish on its own. Do you want to do all of it, since you are my junior?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I'll decline.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell's skillful hands skinned the rabbit's leather, and he worked with the meat. &nbsp;He grumbled, while doing this.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Would it have been better if we packed some provisions from the palace?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mmmm. I never expected you to run so poorly. &nbsp;It was my mistake in overestimating you.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“…….”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell pouted.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The two of them were traveling from the capital to the Dukedom of Tarantos by 'running'</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It wasn't a figure of speech. &nbsp;They were running. &nbsp;Kairen had refused the horses given by the throne, then he cut down as much luggage as he could. &nbsp;Then he made a straight line towards the Dukedom of Tarantos.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It might sound crazy to other people, but it was the most logical method for Kairen.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">‘That is the fastest way.’</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He could run faster than a galloping horse, and he was able to ignore the terrain as he ran straight towards his destination. This was why he could travel much faster than traveling on a road. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, he had misjudged Azell's stamina.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Tsk tsk. &nbsp;We traveled at such a slow pace, yet you are tired after running a mere 20 kilometres.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“…if someone overheard us, they would think you were talking in wrong units.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Kairen clicked his tongue, Azell grumbled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They had traveled at a much higher speed than a normal person could sprint, and they had covered 20 kilometres. &nbsp;They cut straight through mountains, forests, and prairies. &nbsp;It was a much rougher journey compared to traveling the same distance on a proper road.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It had been only one month, since Azell had awoken in this era. &nbsp;During that time, he had rebuilt his body by a little bit, and he had increased his magic reservoir. &nbsp;However, it paled in comparison to his prime. When one continuously moves across a long distance, stamina was more important than technique. There was no know-how that would make this easier, so Azell tired pretty fast. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Kairen spoke as he chewed on the cooked bird.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Since your swordsmanship was so outstanding, I might have overestimated you. I'll have to adjust my view of you. &nbsp;I planned on arriving there by tomorrow night...”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“…….”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If one measured the distance from the capital to the Dukedom of Tarantos in a straight line on a map, the distance was over 500 kilometers.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I guess we will target one week as the travel time. &nbsp;Are you going to say you can't travel a mere 70 kilometers a day?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“…are you trying to kill me?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ho-oh. &nbsp;I really like the sound of you sounding weak.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ughhh.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“We should at least find a town to rest tonight.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Kairen was humming as if he was in a good mood, and he opened up a map.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The two of them really travelled 70 meters everyday in a straight line. As each day passed, his body was screaming out in pain, yet Kairen kept complaining that he was too slow.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">‘Ooooohk! Just wait until I recover my strength! I'll definitely show you a bitter taste, old man!’</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At such a young age, he never expected to pine for the old days. He grinded his teeth. &nbsp;Azell cursed Kairen inside, but he covered the fixed distance they had set as a goal. &nbsp;He went to sleep completely exhausted.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Four days had passed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mmmm?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, Kairen's brows furrowed. &nbsp;They were climbing a mountain when he noticed smoke rising in the distance.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Azell.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes. I see it.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell also saw what Kairen had seen.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The two didn't speak any further, and they started heading towards the location. One would need a professional gear to descend the mountain slope, yet they ran down as if they were running across flat ground. &nbsp;They stepped on trees as if they were flying, and they head towards the source of the smoke.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They arrived at the foot of the mountain, and they saw the fields of the village being razed by fire. &nbsp;A band of bandits that included orcs were plundering a village.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mmm?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The two of them had been heading towards the village at high speed, yet they suddenly stopped when they detected a different kind of being. &nbsp;A person was on top of a tree. &nbsp;This being was hiding himself with a Concealment technique as he looked down at the village.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">‘A magician? No, something is off.’</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He wasn't using a high ranked Concealment technique, so Azell and Kairen could easily sense his presence. &nbsp;This person had an old hat on his head, and he was surrounded by a voluminous traveler's cloak.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They couldn't see his face. &nbsp;While this person was small in stature, they could sense a significant amount of magic from this being.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">‘Dragon Majin? No, it doesn't seem like it... &nbsp;Perhaps?’</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell detected the smell of Dragon Demon Magic from this person. &nbsp;Unlike those from the Dragon Demon race and Dragon Majin, this person only had a partial aspect of the Dragon Demon Magic... &nbsp;Basically, he felt like a human, who had gone through the Dragon Slayer's ritual like him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">‘He doesn't look to be in the same group as those bastards…….’</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It didn't seem plausible for such an unusually gifted magician to be part of a bandit group attacking a farming village. &nbsp;Still, how could he calmly look at what's going on unless he was part of the bandits?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">-Let's go. &nbsp;If he is an enemy, we can face him at a later time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Kairen had already come to a decision, so he spoke to Azell through Whispering. Then they immediately ran towards the farmer's village. An orc was on top of a female child ripping her clothes away. &nbsp;Kairen descended like a bird of prey.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pah-hahk!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The orc's head was separated from its neck at the same time Kairen raised his sword.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell was following right behind him. &nbsp;When he arrived, a geyser of blood fountained into the air as Azell severed three necks.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ooh-ahk!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Who are these bastards!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The two of them had attacked so abruptly that the bandits were a step slow in reacting. &nbsp;However, Azell and Kairen didn't care if they reacted or not. &nbsp;They just approached any bandit they saw, and they swung their swords.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The bandits had already killed a lot of farmers, and they were in the process of gathering women and children. &nbsp;The bandits thought they had already won, so they were focused on looting. &nbsp;They hadn't expected an ambush, so the bandits were being mowed down.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“W...who the hell are you bastards?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A large man, who looked to be the leader, asked the question in shock.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell spoke as he walked towards him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why should I answer your question? You guys are already dead, so there is no point in answering your…….”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the same time, Azell's form disappeared.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“…question.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The sentence came to an end from behind the man. The man tried to turn around in surprise.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Something was wrong. &nbsp;He was just turning his head, yet his vision was rapidly dimming.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Afterwards, the neck that was turning was cleanly sliced. &nbsp;His head slid to the ground, and a fountain of blood erupted from the wound.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tuhl-suhk!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Kyahhhhhhhk!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The bandit fell in front of a woman, and she let out a scream. Azell flinched.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Jeez. I made a mistake.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Your lack of consideration for others is troubling.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Kairen clicked his tongue as he approached Azell.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There had been about 30 members in the bandit group, but it didn't even take 5 minutes to kill all of them. Maybe, if they were fully armed and ready to fight, the fight would have lasted longer. &nbsp;However, most of them had their pants down as they were about to violate the women. &nbsp;This was why everything ended so easily.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They released the people tied up by the bandits, and they extinguished the flames burning up the houses. &nbsp;The surviving farmers all bowed their head towards the two men.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Aigo! Thank you very much!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">While they were doing this, they looked at the two men with fear in their eyes. &nbsp;These two men had overwhelming power that allowed them to kill the bandits in minutes. &nbsp;Moreover, they could overlook Azell, but wasn't Kairen of the Dragon Demon race? &nbsp;Moreover, he wore black armor that covered his entire body. &nbsp;He was dressed like a knight, and the villagers could tell that this being was a noble.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hmmm. There is a farming settlement in such a rural area... &nbsp;Does the local lord here have a bad personality?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Kairen asked with his head tilted.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He correctly guessed that these workers had run away from the rule of their lord to live as farmer inside the mountain. If a lord was merciless in his rule, one would occasionally come across such a situation. &nbsp;If there was a famine or a problem causing a poor harvest, these farmers couldn't meet ends meet if the taxes were high. &nbsp;Those who couldn’t pay taxes and even criminals sometimes ran away to form a village.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was why such a village didn't have the power to protect themselves, so they were subject to being attacked by bandits. &nbsp;They had escaped from being plundered, and killed. &nbsp;However, the problem was the fact that their savior was a noble.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, Kairen thought outside the box regarding such issues.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Well, you don't to be scared. &nbsp;You aren't a resident of my domain, and I'm not part of the bandits. &nbsp;I don't care what you say.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“…you are very heroic in your temperament. &nbsp;However, is it ok for a great lord that holds the respect of the throne to be speaking this way?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Who cares? &nbsp;No one will overhear me here. &nbsp;Moreover, I have a more urgent business right now.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After saying those words, Kairen glared at the magician atop the tree. &nbsp;The next moment he used his Instantaneous Movement to appear right in front of the magician.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Uh?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The magician was so surprised that he jumped off the tree. &nbsp;It seemed he hadn't expected to be found, since he was using his Concealment technique.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Kairen dropped in front of him. &nbsp;The magician was taken aback, so he asked a question.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why are you being like this?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Kairen and Azell was amazed by his words. &nbsp;Doesn't he realize how suspicious he looked?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The two of them were a bit surprised when the hat half fell off the magician's head. &nbsp;He looked to be only 14 or 15 years old. &nbsp;He had curly blonde hair and blue eyes. &nbsp;This youth was looking up at Kairen with an expression that indicated he didn't understand the cause of Kairen’s action.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell was especially surprised.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">‘This little shrimp completed the Dragon Slayer's ritual? No way…….’</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Soon, Kairen put on a cold expression as he asked a question.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What's your identity? &nbsp;It doesn't seem like you are in the same group as the bandits.... &nbsp;Are you perhaps the mastermind behind this attack?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I have no ties to those people.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Then why were you hiding there as you looked on?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I was traveling nearby, and the bandits suddenly appeared. &nbsp;I hid, because I was afraid they would harm me.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“By the look of it, you look to be a proficient magician. &nbsp;Didn't you have any thoughts about helping the people being pillaged?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The teen tilted his head at the question.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I might die if I did. Am I required to do that?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“…….”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His attitude was so matter of fact that Kairen and Azell got angry for a brief moment.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The teen put his hat back on. &nbsp;He stood up, and he dusted off his clothes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I know why you are asking me those questions. &nbsp;However, am I bound by duty to do what you suggest? &nbsp;It isn't as if I brought the bandits here. &nbsp;I don't know these people, so I don't have any sense of obligation to these people.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“That is...true.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Kairen spoke as if he didn't appreciate the young man's attitude.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The teen's words were very selfish, but he wasn't wrong. &nbsp;Even if this young man was a magician with strong magic, it wasn't guaranteed he would survive against bandits that numbered over twenty. &nbsp;He made a cold decision to prioritize his life over others. &nbsp;It was hard to berate him for that. He could criticize the youth on moral grounds, but it wouldn't be productive to do so.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">Of course, Azell wasn’t fooling around, while Kairen was doing the miscellaneous work. &nbsp;He ran around the forest to hunt down the birds and the rabbits. &nbsp;Since he was a high rank Spirit Order Practitioner, he was able to use his mental wave freely. &nbsp;It felt like cheating using those skills to hunt.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Kairen responded in a calm manner.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“If there is no one to do it, then I have to do it. &nbsp;It isn't as if these tasks will finish on its own. Do you want to do all of it, since you are my junior?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I'll decline.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell's skillful hands skinned the rabbit's leather, and he worked with the meat. &nbsp;He grumbled, while doing this.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Would it have been better if we packed some provisions from the palace?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mmmm. I never expected you to run so poorly. &nbsp;It was my mistake in overestimating you.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“…….”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell pouted.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The two of them were traveling from the capital to the Dukedom of Tarantos by 'running'</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It wasn't a figure of speech. &nbsp;They were running. &nbsp;Kairen had refused the horses given by the throne, then he cut down as much luggage as he could. &nbsp;Then he made a straight line towards the Dukedom of Tarantos.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It might sound crazy to other people, but it was the most logical method for Kairen.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">‘That is the fastest way.’</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He could run faster than a galloping horse, and he was able to ignore the terrain as he ran straight towards his destination. This was why he could travel much faster than traveling on a road. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, he had misjudged Azell's stamina.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Tsk tsk. &nbsp;We traveled at such a slow pace, yet you are tired after running a mere 20 kilometres.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“…if someone overheard us, they would think you were talking in wrong units.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Kairen clicked his tongue, Azell grumbled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They had traveled at a much higher speed than a normal person could sprint, and they had covered 20 kilometres. &nbsp;They cut straight through mountains, forests, and prairies. &nbsp;It was a much rougher journey compared to traveling the same distance on a proper road.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It had been only one month, since Azell had awoken in this era. &nbsp;During that time, he had rebuilt his body by a little bit, and he had increased his magic reservoir. &nbsp;However, it paled in comparison to his prime. When one continuously moves across a long distance, stamina was more important than technique. There was no know-how that would make this easier, so Azell tired pretty fast. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Kairen spoke as he chewed on the cooked bird.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Since your swordsmanship was so outstanding, I might have overestimated you. I'll have to adjust my view of you. &nbsp;I planned on arriving there by tomorrow night...”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“…….”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If one measured the distance from the capital to the Dukedom of Tarantos in a straight line on a map, the distance was over 500 kilometers.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I guess we will target one week as the travel time. &nbsp;Are you going to say you can't travel a mere 70 kilometers a day?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“…are you trying to kill me?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ho-oh. &nbsp;I really like the sound of you sounding weak.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ughhh.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“We should at least find a town to rest tonight.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Kairen was humming as if he was in a good mood, and he opened up a map.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The two of them really travelled 70 meters everyday in a straight line. As each day passed, his body was screaming out in pain, yet Kairen kept complaining that he was too slow.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">‘Ooooohk! Just wait until I recover my strength! I'll definitely show you a bitter taste, old man!’</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At such a young age, he never expected to pine for the old days. He grinded his teeth. &nbsp;Azell cursed Kairen inside, but he covered the fixed distance they had set as a goal. &nbsp;He went to sleep completely exhausted.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Four days had passed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mmmm?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, Kairen's brows furrowed. &nbsp;They were climbing a mountain when he noticed smoke rising in the distance.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Azell.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes. I see it.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell also saw what Kairen had seen.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The two didn't speak any further, and they started heading towards the location. One would need a professional gear to descend the mountain slope, yet they ran down as if they were running across flat ground. &nbsp;They stepped on trees as if they were flying, and they head towards the source of the smoke.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They arrived at the foot of the mountain, and they saw the fields of the village being razed by fire. &nbsp;A band of bandits that included orcs were plundering a village.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mmm?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The two of them had been heading towards the village at high speed, yet they suddenly stopped when they detected a different kind of being. &nbsp;A person was on top of a tree. &nbsp;This being was hiding himself with a Concealment technique as he looked down at the village.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">‘A magician? No, something is off.’</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He wasn't using a high ranked Concealment technique, so Azell and Kairen could easily sense his presence. &nbsp;This person had an old hat on his head, and he was surrounded by a voluminous traveler's cloak.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They couldn't see his face. &nbsp;While this person was small in stature, they could sense a significant amount of magic from this being.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">‘Dragon Majin? No, it doesn't seem like it... &nbsp;Perhaps?’</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell detected the smell of Dragon Demon Magic from this person. &nbsp;Unlike those from the Dragon Demon race and Dragon Majin, this person only had a partial aspect of the Dragon Demon Magic... &nbsp;Basically, he felt like a human, who had gone through the Dragon Slayer's ritual like him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">‘He doesn't look to be in the same group as those bastards…….’</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It didn't seem plausible for such an unusually gifted magician to be part of a bandit group attacking a farming village. &nbsp;Still, how could he calmly look at what's going on unless he was part of the bandits?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">-Let's go. &nbsp;If he is an enemy, we can face him at a later time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Kairen had already come to a decision, so he spoke to Azell through Whispering. Then they immediately ran towards the farmer's village. An orc was on top of a female child ripping her clothes away. &nbsp;Kairen descended like a bird of prey.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pah-hahk!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The orc's head was separated from its neck at the same time Kairen raised his sword.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell was following right behind him. &nbsp;When he arrived, a geyser of blood fountained into the air as Azell severed three necks.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ooh-ahk!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Who are these bastards!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The two of them had attacked so abruptly that the bandits were a step slow in reacting. &nbsp;However, Azell and Kairen didn't care if they reacted or not. &nbsp;They just approached any bandit they saw, and they swung their swords.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The bandits had already killed a lot of farmers, and they were in the process of gathering women and children. &nbsp;The bandits thought they had already won, so they were focused on looting. &nbsp;They hadn't expected an ambush, so the bandits were being mowed down.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“W...who the hell are you bastards?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A large man, who looked to be the leader, asked the question in shock.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell spoke as he walked towards him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why should I answer your question? You guys are already dead, so there is no point in answering your…….”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the same time, Azell's form disappeared.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“…question.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The sentence came to an end from behind the man. The man tried to turn around in surprise.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Something was wrong. &nbsp;He was just turning his head, yet his vision was rapidly dimming.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Afterwards, the neck that was turning was cleanly sliced. &nbsp;His head slid to the ground, and a fountain of blood erupted from the wound.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tuhl-suhk!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Kyahhhhhhhk!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The bandit fell in front of a woman, and she let out a scream. Azell flinched.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Jeez. I made a mistake.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Your lack of consideration for others is troubling.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Kairen clicked his tongue as he approached Azell.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There had been about 30 members in the bandit group, but it didn't even take 5 minutes to kill all of them. Maybe, if they were fully armed and ready to fight, the fight would have lasted longer. &nbsp;However, most of them had their pants down as they were about to violate the women. &nbsp;This was why everything ended so easily.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They released the people tied up by the bandits, and they extinguished the flames burning up the houses. &nbsp;The surviving farmers all bowed their head towards the two men.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Aigo! Thank you very much!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">While they were doing this, they looked at the two men with fear in their eyes. &nbsp;These two men had overwhelming power that allowed them to kill the bandits in minutes. &nbsp;Moreover, they could overlook Azell, but wasn't Kairen of the Dragon Demon race? &nbsp;Moreover, he wore black armor that covered his entire body. &nbsp;He was dressed like a knight, and the villagers could tell that this being was a noble.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hmmm. There is a farming settlement in such a rural area... &nbsp;Does the local lord here have a bad personality?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Kairen asked with his head tilted.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He correctly guessed that these workers had run away from the rule of their lord to live as farmer inside the mountain. If a lord was merciless in his rule, one would occasionally come across such a situation. &nbsp;If there was a famine or a problem causing a poor harvest, these farmers couldn't meet ends meet if the taxes were high. &nbsp;Those who couldn’t pay taxes and even criminals sometimes ran away to form a village.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was why such a village didn't have the power to protect themselves, so they were subject to being attacked by bandits. &nbsp;They had escaped from being plundered, and killed. &nbsp;However, the problem was the fact that their savior was a noble.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, Kairen thought outside the box regarding such issues.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Well, you don't to be scared. &nbsp;You aren't a resident of my domain, and I'm not part of the bandits. &nbsp;I don't care what you say.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“…you are very heroic in your temperament. &nbsp;However, is it ok for a great lord that holds the respect of the throne to be speaking this way?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Who cares? &nbsp;No one will overhear me here. &nbsp;Moreover, I have a more urgent business right now.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After saying those words, Kairen glared at the magician atop the tree. &nbsp;The next moment he used his Instantaneous Movement to appear right in front of the magician.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Uh?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The magician was so surprised that he jumped off the tree. &nbsp;It seemed he hadn't expected to be found, since he was using his Concealment technique.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Kairen dropped in front of him. &nbsp;The magician was taken aback, so he asked a question.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why are you being like this?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Kairen and Azell was amazed by his words. &nbsp;Doesn't he realize how suspicious he looked?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The two of them were a bit surprised when the hat half fell off the magician's head. &nbsp;He looked to be only 14 or 15 years old. &nbsp;He had curly blonde hair and blue eyes. &nbsp;This youth was looking up at Kairen with an expression that indicated he didn't understand the cause of Kairen’s action.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell was especially surprised.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">‘This little shrimp completed the Dragon Slayer's ritual? No way…….’</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Soon, Kairen put on a cold expression as he asked a question.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What's your identity? &nbsp;It doesn't seem like you are in the same group as the bandits.... &nbsp;Are you perhaps the mastermind behind this attack?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I have no ties to those people.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Then why were you hiding there as you looked on?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I was traveling nearby, and the bandits suddenly appeared. &nbsp;I hid, because I was afraid they would harm me.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“By the look of it, you look to be a proficient magician. &nbsp;Didn't you have any thoughts about helping the people being pillaged?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The teen tilted his head at the question.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I might die if I did. Am I required to do that?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“…….”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His attitude was so matter of fact that Kairen and Azell got angry for a brief moment.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The teen put his hat back on. &nbsp;He stood up, and he dusted off his clothes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I know why you are asking me those questions. &nbsp;However, am I bound by duty to do what you suggest? &nbsp;It isn't as if I brought the bandits here. &nbsp;I don't know these people, so I don't have any sense of obligation to these people.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“That is...true.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Kairen spoke as if he didn't appreciate the young man's attitude.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The teen's words were very selfish, but he wasn't wrong. &nbsp;Even if this young man was a magician with strong magic, it wasn't guaranteed he would survive against bandits that numbered over twenty. &nbsp;He made a cold decision to prioritize his life over others. &nbsp;It was hard to berate him for that. He could criticize the youth on moral grounds, but it wouldn't be productive to do so.</p>
