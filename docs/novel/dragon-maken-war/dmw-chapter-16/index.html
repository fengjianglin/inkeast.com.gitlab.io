  <p><span style><span style>Chapter 16 - Dragon Slayer’s Ritual (1)</span></span></p>
  <p></p>
  <hr>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>If one asked anyone from Rulain Kingdom’s Western Border Patrol as to what was the most frightening existence inside the Balan forest was, they wouldn’t hesitate to give their answer.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Dragons.</span></p>
  <p><span style>These tyrants existed deep inside the spacious Balan forest, and none of the demonic beasts could approach them. They were on the apex of the food chain. Enormous amounts of damages occurred every time they moved. The Western Border Patrol was cautious as to never enter their territory.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Koo-roo-roo-roo-roo……</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was rare for the dragons to come out of their territories. They filled their bellies by catching preys within the boundaries of their territories like full stomached demonic beasts.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, they were always beholden to a thirst. Normal beasts couldn’t understand this agony.</span></p>
  <p><span style>They were aware that they were unintelligent, so they thirsted for knowledge.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“This is a trade.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The short stature of Regina was standing in front of a dragon. She was breaking out into cold sweat within her hood.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Two large eyes were watching her within the darkness of the forest, and it was emitting a tremendous amount of intimidation. Even if she was a Dragon Demon, she couldn’t help but feel fear when she was in close proximity to a dragon.</span></p>
  <p><span style>On the surface, it looked like a large violent animal. Will this existance be able to understand her?</span></p>
  <p><span style>In her head, she knew it could understand her language. However, she felt more and more unsure as she stared at it. What would happen if it didn’t understand her words and it treated her as a prey, who had invaded its territory?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Regina desperately tried to suppress her worries and fear.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If you fulfill our request, you will be able earn the ‘Moment of Wisdom’.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Koo-roo-roo-roo-roo….. (TLN: Dragon growls)</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Will you accept it?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Koong! Koo-oong! (TLN: sound of dragon moving)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The dragons walked forth from the darkness when it was asked this question. Regina stopped breathing when the enormous body appeared between the trees.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Earth Dragon. (TLN: ji-ryong)</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was the name given to dragons that could move freely underground like swimming fish. The silhouette looked like an elongated lizard, and it had dark brown scales that had a rock-like texture. It had a curved horn, and its red eyes were slit vertically. From head to tail, it measured over 30 meters, and it was a monster with a castle-like bulk.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The dragon nodded its head, while looking at Regina.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘It really… It understands human speech.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>It couldn’t form words by itself, but it could understand everything. Even if it was any other language in this world, it would have understood it. Regina didn’t know how this was possible. Still, the earth dragon could understand Regina’s words, and it had accepted her request. This was all that mattered.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Regina spoke naturally, while she was suppressing a sigh of relief.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Then I’ll describe your target.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>2</span></p>
  <p><span style>At night, the forest was swept up in deep darkness. The only source of light one can rely on was the moon light and starlight.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, 4 people were moving through this darkness.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was Azell, Rick, Arrieta and Enora.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Enora.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Suddenly Arrieta opened her mouth. She was looking at Enora, who was stumbling from fatigue.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ll carry you.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…I, I cannot commit such disrespect ”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Enora was startled as if she was burnt by a fire.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta had a loose personality, so much so that it was hard to believe that she was royalty. However, it was fact that she was someone who was as high as the sky. So how could she allow this precious person to carry her?</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I know you are having a hard time walking. Currently, it’s the right move.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“But…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It’s an order. Get on.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After Arrieta started showing her back in front of her, Enora hesitated before she got on. Azell was impressed when he saw this.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘This princess’ personality is quite awesome.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>At first, he was annoyed that she had followed him, but as he observed her actions he liked her. It wasn’t easy for a member of a royal family to act this way. Is it because she was born with a unique identity called the Dragon Demon Princess?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell turned around and looked at Rick.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Rick. Want me to give you a piggy-back?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…I’ll refuse.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick was also tired.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After the Dragon Demon Jackal started the forest fire, the party was continuously ambushed by monsters and demonic beasts for half a day. The fire was spreading aggressively, and they were desperately running away to avoid the fire. They were barely able to escape from the direction the fire was spreading when they were again attacked by the monsters and demonic beasts.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta was also getting tired from continuously battling them. It was a miracle that Enora and Rick hadn’t received a major injury during all this.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘My condition isn’t that great either.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>While coming to this place, he had rotated with Arrieta to recharge their magical energy with meditation. However, he could do nothing about the accumulated fatigue.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Currently, I don’t feel anyone’s Sight on us. This must be the effect of the fire I started a while ago. ”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I could have never imagined you would do such a radical act.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The other side started the fire first. If we want to escape, we have to take on some risks.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell took drastic measure to escape from the enemy’s pursuit. He also set the forest on fire like Jackal. Of course unlike Jackal, he devised a means to do it in a controlled manner.</span></p>
  <p><span style>While they were moving, he had conversations with Arrieta to get all the relevant information, and he had started a fire in certain areas. He also put in a spell that’ll automatically extinguish the fire after a certain amount of time had passed. However, this was the forest not the plains. There wasn’t any guarantee that it’ll turn out like they wanted. Like the fire that was still burning at the other side of forest, there was a huge risk that the fire would continue to spread.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Fortunately, it seems to have ended without spreading…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta showed signs of disapproval. His actions had too much risk. She had followed Azell’s words, because she didn’t have any other choice.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘However, if we didn’t do that then we wouldn’t have been able to avoid the enemy’s surveillance.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>The members of the Dragon’s Shadow took action after using a far-seeing magic to locate their party. If they weren’t able to avoid the Sight, then the party would have had no reasons to feel relief.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“We should rest right about now. Are you able to generate heat without making a fire, Princess?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I can. However, why don’t you also work once in awhile?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It’s unfortunate, but I have very little magical energy.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You have so much skill yet your magical energy is weak. You are a really strange man.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I really don’t want to be this kind of a man.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After Azell answered back cheekily , Arrieta casted a magic on the ground while snorting. Heat started coming out from the location where the magic was casted, and it drove the cold air away.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Let us rest in shifts. I don’t think we can rest for long.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“We can’t expect the enemies to not move during the night.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes. Even if we set aside the bastards from the Dragon’s Shadow, there are the monsters and demonic animals they use as troops.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>There were a lot of nocturnal monsters and demonic animals.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Princess and I will rotate sentry duties.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Huh? Why? Shouldn’t everyone rotate? Ah, even if we exclude Miss Enora….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick raised the question. Even if they excluded the young girl Enora, shouldn’t a healthy adult male like him take a turn on sentry duty?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell explained his reasoning.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Unfortunately, you aren’t much help as a sentry. Once you are able to detect the enemy’s movements, it’ll be too late.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ughh. So that’s how it is.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“So rest well. You will have to recover your stamina, at least a little bit, to be able to follow us.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>They hadn’t had anything to eat, while they were coming here. They were able to occasionally drink some water they found. This meant their stamina was extremely low.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick bit his lips.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m sorry.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Before you rest why don’t you look after Miss Enora. I believe she sustained some minor injuries.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ok.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick followed his words. Enora had traveled the forest road in haste, so her clothes were ripped in places and she had sustained some injuries. Rick performed his healing art, and the wounds healed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell spoke to Arrieta.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Let us set the night watch for 1 hour. Do you want the first watch, Princess?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Usually the earlier watch is easier. He had made this suggestion as a kind gesture, but she shook her head.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No. I want to sleep first, even if it is a little bit. You go first, please.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Understood.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Suddenly, Arrieta’s face was drowned in anxiety.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I don’t know what happened to the others.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“They’ll be safe.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell wanted to reassure her, eventhough he didn’t have any basis for it. Arrieta sighed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“After rescuing Enora, I decided that it would be safer for them if I moved independently. So I followed you… I don’t know if I made the right choice….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Is that why she followed me?’ (TLN: she knew the bad guys would kill her party is she stayed with them)</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell wondered as to why she followed him instead of the party she came with from the throne. However, she did have a reason.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was both funny and shocking at the same time.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“So you thought it was ok for me to fall into danger?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That wasn’t the reason why I followed you.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Then why?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I was suspicious. At first, I thought maybe you were an agent of the organization called Dragon’s Shadow.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Even after I had saved you, Princess?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You fought against them and injured them, but you hadn’t killed them. Therefore, there was a chance that it was an act to trick me.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Even though these were words casted suspicion on him, Azell was a bit impressed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Ho-oh. She’s pretty good?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was a sharp observation. For beings with superhuman capabilities, they would do unimaginable things to disguise themselves. It was beyond normal human’s imagination.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“However, I have confirmed it while we were cooperating with each other. At the very least, you aren’t an enemy.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I want to thank you for believing in me.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“There are still a mountain of things that is suspicious…. At the very least, I am willing to believe that you don’t hold any evil intentions towards me. Now I’ll sleep for a little bit.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After saying this, Arrieta leaned against a tree and she closed her eyes. Before 3 seconds had passed, she started breathing steadily.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell started mumbling because he was amazed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“How can she sleep in such a situation….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was a man with a certain view about sleep. His view on sleep might be strange to hear, but he considered the ability to sleep as the most important ability to have in the battle field. It was important for survival to sleep when opportunity presents itself, and use it to recover one’s stamina.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Among the Spirit Order techniques, there were techniques used to induce sleep. Azell enjoyed using such techniques.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Arrieta wasn’t using any such techniques. She just decided she wanted to sleep then she slept.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Jeez.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell burst out laughing.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Unlike her previous figure that was overflowing with dignity, her appearance right now was vastly different. Her face was that of a innocent girl. She was covered in dirt, but she slept soundly as if she was sleeping on her own bed. It almost blurred his sense of reality.</span></p>

 <p><span style>The short stature of Regina was standing in front of a dragon. She was breaking out into cold sweat within her hood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two large eyes were watching her within the darkness of the forest, and it was emitting a tremendous amount of intimidation. Even if she was a Dragon Demon, she couldn’t help but feel fear when she was in close proximity to a dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the surface, it looked like a large violent animal. Will this existance be able to understand her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>In her head, she knew it could understand her language. However, she felt more and more unsure as she stared at it. What would happen if it didn’t understand her words and it treated her as a prey, who had invaded its territory?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regina desperately tried to suppress her worries and fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you fulfill our request, you will be able earn the ‘Moment of Wisdom’.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-roo-roo-roo-roo….. (TLN: Dragon growls)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Will you accept it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koong! Koo-oong! (TLN: sound of dragon moving)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dragons walked forth from the darkness when it was asked this question. Regina stopped breathing when the enormous body appeared between the trees.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earth Dragon. (TLN: ji-ryong)</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the name given to dragons that could move freely underground like swimming fish. The silhouette looked like an elongated lizard, and it had dark brown scales that had a rock-like texture. It had a curved horn, and its red eyes were slit vertically. From head to tail, it measured over 30 meters, and it was a monster with a castle-like bulk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dragon nodded its head, while looking at Regina.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It really… It understands human speech.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It couldn’t form words by itself, but it could understand everything. Even if it was any other language in this world, it would have understood it. Regina didn’t know how this was possible. Still, the earth dragon could understand Regina’s words, and it had accepted her request. This was all that mattered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regina spoke naturally, while she was suppressing a sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll describe your target.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>2</span></p>
 <p><span style>At night, the forest was swept up in deep darkness. The only source of light one can rely on was the moon light and starlight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, 4 people were moving through this darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Azell, Rick, Arrieta and Enora.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enora.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly Arrieta opened her mouth. She was looking at Enora, who was stumbling from fatigue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll carry you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…I, I cannot commit such disrespect ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enora was startled as if she was burnt by a fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta had a loose personality, so much so that it was hard to believe that she was royalty. However, it was fact that she was someone who was as high as the sky. So how could she allow this precious person to carry her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know you are having a hard time walking. Currently, it’s the right move.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s an order. Get on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Arrieta started showing her back in front of her, Enora hesitated before she got on. Azell was impressed when he saw this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This princess’ personality is quite awesome.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>At first, he was annoyed that she had followed him, but as he observed her actions he liked her. It wasn’t easy for a member of a royal family to act this way. Is it because she was born with a unique identity called the Dragon Demon Princess?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell turned around and looked at Rick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rick. Want me to give you a piggy-back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…I’ll refuse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick was also tired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the Dragon Demon Jackal started the forest fire, the party was continuously ambushed by monsters and demonic beasts for half a day. The fire was spreading aggressively, and they were desperately running away to avoid the fire. They were barely able to escape from the direction the fire was spreading when they were again attacked by the monsters and demonic beasts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta was also getting tired from continuously battling them. It was a miracle that Enora and Rick hadn’t received a major injury during all this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘My condition isn’t that great either.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>While coming to this place, he had rotated with Arrieta to recharge their magical energy with meditation. However, he could do nothing about the accumulated fatigue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Currently, I don’t feel anyone’s Sight on us. This must be the effect of the fire I started a while ago. ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I could have never imagined you would do such a radical act.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The other side started the fire first. If we want to escape, we have to take on some risks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell took drastic measure to escape from the enemy’s pursuit. He also set the forest on fire like Jackal. Of course unlike Jackal, he devised a means to do it in a controlled manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While they were moving, he had conversations with Arrieta to get all the relevant information, and he had started a fire in certain areas. He also put in a spell that’ll automatically extinguish the fire after a certain amount of time had passed. However, this was the forest not the plains. There wasn’t any guarantee that it’ll turn out like they wanted. Like the fire that was still burning at the other side of forest, there was a huge risk that the fire would continue to spread.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fortunately, it seems to have ended without spreading…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta showed signs of disapproval. His actions had too much risk. She had followed Azell’s words, because she didn’t have any other choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘However, if we didn’t do that then we wouldn’t have been able to avoid the enemy’s surveillance.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The members of the Dragon’s Shadow took action after using a far-seeing magic to locate their party. If they weren’t able to avoid the Sight, then the party would have had no reasons to feel relief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We should rest right about now. Are you able to generate heat without making a fire, Princess?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can. However, why don’t you also work once in awhile?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s unfortunate, but I have very little magical energy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have so much skill yet your magical energy is weak. You are a really strange man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really don’t want to be this kind of a man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Azell answered back cheekily , Arrieta casted a magic on the ground while snorting. Heat started coming out from the location where the magic was casted, and it drove the cold air away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let us rest in shifts. I don’t think we can rest for long.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We can’t expect the enemies to not move during the night.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. Even if we set aside the bastards from the Dragon’s Shadow, there are the monsters and demonic animals they use as troops.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were a lot of nocturnal monsters and demonic animals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Princess and I will rotate sentry duties.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? Why? Shouldn’t everyone rotate? Ah, even if we exclude Miss Enora….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick raised the question. Even if they excluded the young girl Enora, shouldn’t a healthy adult male like him take a turn on sentry duty?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell explained his reasoning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unfortunately, you aren’t much help as a sentry. Once you are able to detect the enemy’s movements, it’ll be too late.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ughh. So that’s how it is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So rest well. You will have to recover your stamina, at least a little bit, to be able to follow us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They hadn’t had anything to eat, while they were coming here. They were able to occasionally drink some water they found. This meant their stamina was extremely low.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick bit his lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Before you rest why don’t you look after Miss Enora. I believe she sustained some minor injuries.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick followed his words. Enora had traveled the forest road in haste, so her clothes were ripped in places and she had sustained some injuries. Rick performed his healing art, and the wounds healed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke to Arrieta.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let us set the night watch for 1 hour. Do you want the first watch, Princess?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Usually the earlier watch is easier. He had made this suggestion as a kind gesture, but she shook her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. I want to sleep first, even if it is a little bit. You go first, please.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Arrieta’s face was drowned in anxiety.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know what happened to the others.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’ll be safe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell wanted to reassure her, eventhough he didn’t have any basis for it. Arrieta sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“After rescuing Enora, I decided that it would be safer for them if I moved independently. So I followed you… I don’t know if I made the right choice….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is that why she followed me?’ (TLN: she knew the bad guys would kill her party is she stayed with them)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell wondered as to why she followed him instead of the party she came with from the throne. However, she did have a reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was both funny and shocking at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you thought it was ok for me to fall into danger?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That wasn’t the reason why I followed you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was suspicious. At first, I thought maybe you were an agent of the organization called Dragon’s Shadow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even after I had saved you, Princess?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You fought against them and injured them, but you hadn’t killed them. Therefore, there was a chance that it was an act to trick me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though these were words casted suspicion on him, Azell was a bit impressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Ho-oh. She’s pretty good?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a sharp observation. For beings with superhuman capabilities, they would do unimaginable things to disguise themselves. It was beyond normal human’s imagination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, I have confirmed it while we were cooperating with each other. At the very least, you aren’t an enemy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to thank you for believing in me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are still a mountain of things that is suspicious…. At the very least, I am willing to believe that you don’t hold any evil intentions towards me. Now I’ll sleep for a little bit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying this, Arrieta leaned against a tree and she closed her eyes. Before 3 seconds had passed, she started breathing steadily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell started mumbling because he was amazed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can she sleep in such a situation….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was a man with a certain view about sleep. His view on sleep might be strange to hear, but he considered the ability to sleep as the most important ability to have in the battle field. It was important for survival to sleep when opportunity presents itself, and use it to recover one’s stamina.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Among the Spirit Order techniques, there were techniques used to induce sleep. Azell enjoyed using such techniques.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Arrieta wasn’t using any such techniques. She just decided she wanted to sleep then she slept.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jeez.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell burst out laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike her previous figure that was overflowing with dignity, her appearance right now was vastly different. Her face was that of a innocent girl. She was covered in dirt, but she slept soundly as if she was sleeping on her own bed. It almost blurred his sense of reality.</span></p>
