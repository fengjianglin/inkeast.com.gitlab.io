 <p>Chapter 144 - Second Coming of a Legend (7)</p>
 <p><span style>9</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-goo-gooo-gooo……!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The great destruction lasted only for a brief moment. &nbsp;However, it felt like eternity for everyone on the battlefield. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The shockwave that spread from site of the explosion reached a radius of several hundred meters. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sun Lightsaber’s after effect was very small compared to its destructive power. &nbsp;Azell had focused the destructive capability into a small region, so the after effect was minimized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-ook. &nbsp;If someone had told me I’m having a bad dream right, I probably would have enthusiastically agreed with that person….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen tried to regain his breath as he sat down within the waves of dusts swirling around him. &nbsp;If Azell hadn’t given him a heads up on what was going to happen, he would have been in big trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, he had prepared for it yet he had thought he was going to die. &nbsp;He was able to block the shockwave, but his consciousness had almost succumbed to the mental wave even though he had resisted against it with his full power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen laughed at the absurdity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha ha ha ha ha. &nbsp;Those ridiculous records were real? &nbsp;They didn’t exaggerate the accounts. &nbsp;They actually might have understated it…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, he had visited the palace’s library for Azell Karzark….. &nbsp;Basically, he went to read historical records about Azell, and he had stated that the absurd accounts actually did a disservice to Azell. &nbsp;When he thought back on what he had said, he wanted to hide in a mousehole from the embarrassment he felt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…hmmm. &nbsp;You are still alive?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, he heard Leticia’s voice next to him. &nbsp;Kairen answered her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Somewhat. It looks as if you had an easier time under the protection of the magician.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I couldn’t afford to protect both of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren smirked as he spoke. &nbsp;Before Azell had precipitated the final confrontation, Yuren had quickly surrounded a barrier around Leticia and himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that right? &nbsp;Anyways, even the Dragon Demon general Reygus can’t survive against such an attack…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen’s face hardened at that point in his words. &nbsp;Leticia and Yuren had an expression of disbelief a beat later. &nbsp;They looked at the scene beyond the dust cloud..</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…it survived after taking that hit?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other side of the large cloud of dust, Reygus was holding up Azell by his throat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>10</span></p>
 <p><span style>The most powerful technique called the Sun Lightsaber could be actualized only using the Sky Splitter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the final battle in the Dragon Demon war, Azell had used this move to corner Atein.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the battle, an endless amount of magic spells were sent towards Azell, and he had been in dire straits. &nbsp;However, Azell had been spying for a chance to attack Atein, and when the opportunity presented itself, Azell put his life on the line to use the Sun Lightsaber technique. &nbsp;It blew away all of Atein’s defensive magic, and Atein had been gravely wounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was his Dragon weapon, the quality of his Dragon Demon magic and the vessel that held his magical energy…. &nbsp;&nbsp;Everything wasn’t up to par with his past self right now except for his technical skills. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he had fulfilled enough of the three requirements to use the secret technique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first requirement was time. &nbsp;Reygus had dared him to use it, so he had enough time to gather the requisite energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The second requirement was the Vitan’s Chalice. &nbsp;Since his vessel holding the magical energy was small and weak, the amount of magical energy he could gather and hold was smaller than his previous self. &nbsp;However, a vast amount of magical energy could be gathered and concentrated using the Vitan Chalice’s Dimensional Distortion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thirdly, it was daytime right now. &nbsp;In the past, he had to gather light from the moonlight, starlight and the light that erupted from various parts of the battlefield to complete the technique. &nbsp;If he hadn’t had the massive amount of light provided by daylight, it would have been impossible to use it in his current state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sun Lightsaber appeared once again in this era after 220 long years, because all three conditions were met. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However….</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You are really incredible. &nbsp;You are a preposterous human.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus hadn’t cease to exist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t as if it hadn't taken damage. &nbsp;Reygus was a mess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no trace of its left arm, and almost half its upper body was blown away. &nbsp;There was no region on the white armor that was unharmed. &nbsp;It was broken and bent. &nbsp;Darkness leaked out like blood from the cracks that had been created.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it had endured against the absolute calamity of destruction. &nbsp;It survived against the tsunami of light swords. &nbsp;Now it was raising Azell by the neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A hidden card…. &nbsp;You had one too, you sneaky bastard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was panting, and he was a bloody mess. &nbsp;He still possessed all his body parts, but his armor had been turned into junk. &nbsp;There was a deep cut on his stomach, and it was deep enough to see some of his innards through the cut. &nbsp;His left arm was broken, and it was dangling by his side. &nbsp;His right arm wasn’t broken, but he couldn’t put any strength into it. &nbsp;It was a miracle that he was still conscious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I thought it was quite fair. &nbsp;Wasn’t it? &nbsp;It was a fight where both of us didn’t know who would win.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha ha ha. I’m at a loss for words.…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>How was Reygus able to endure the Sun Lightsaber?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a combination of two answers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I’ll be truthful. &nbsp;I never thought I would be able to evolve my Dragon Weapon at my advanced age. &nbsp;The last time my Dragon weapon evolved was 400 years before my death…..&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sky Splitter wasn’t the only Dragon weapon to go through a transformation. &nbsp;The Soul Hammer had evolved beyond the one Azell had known about. &nbsp;In the past, the Soul Hammer had a powerful curse that could destroy minds and souls of its opponents. &nbsp;It also could resonate with the earth to bring out a great destructive ability. &nbsp;However, this new form of hammer allowed Reygus to freely control the power from earth. &nbsp;Moreover, it allowed Reygus to disperse damage through the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Basically, it and its armor had become a castle wall while its feet was connected to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover….</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;If your technique had been perfected, I might have been sent back to the underworld. &nbsp;You are the best, Azell.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That kind of compliment… Do you think… I’ll be happy to hear it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sun Lightsaber wasn’t complete.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the first place, there were three restrictive prerequisite he would have to fulfill to be able to use it at this point in time. &nbsp;He had been successful in forming and using the technique. &nbsp;However, he had failed at controlling it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In his prime, Azell would have linked his other Dragon weapons to contain the energy within a specific area. &nbsp;It would have amplified the destructive capability to the extreme. All the after effect that had swept through the radius of several hundred meters would have been directed inwards. &nbsp;The shock wave and the mental wave would have been in his control as it would have destroyed his enemies within this limited region. &nbsp;The pressure created allowed it to exceed a certain level, and even Atein had been shocked by it. &nbsp;An extreme destructive phenomena was created.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he had lost control, and a considerable amount of energy had leaked out. &nbsp;It killed the effectiveness of the attack. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It sounded ridiculous, but the recent Sun Lightsaber couldn’t even muster half of its original power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zzuh-juhk…….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, the sound of a fissure was heard. &nbsp;Then the wrist of the arm holding Azell broke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tul-suhk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell rolled across the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t move. &nbsp;His body and energy pulse couldn’t function normally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, he got up. &nbsp;He used the beat of his heart to resonate the Rings of Life to create magical energy within his body. He used his psychokinesis to keep his body upright, and the fallen Dragon sword returned to his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Both of us are a wreck..&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The winner and loser of the battle was already determined. &nbsp;Azell was showing admirable fighting spirit, but he wasn’t in a state where he could fight. &nbsp;Reygus could use his psychokinesis to hit him with the Soul Hammer. &nbsp;No, since its two arms were useless, a single kick could kill Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was too late for his comrades to help him. &nbsp;They were too far away. &nbsp;By the time they started to move, Reygus would have already ended Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, its vision darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Mmm?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus realized it had entered a Dimensional Distortion field.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Vitan’s Chalice? &nbsp;No, I’m sure I saw it get unsummoned….&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was taken aback, but it soon realized who was the culprit precipitating this situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Kayalia, what are you doing?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kayalia had copied the effects of the Vitan’s Chalice. &nbsp;She had used the Dimensional Distortion field. &nbsp;When it raged, Kayalia’s white ghostlike form appeared in front of it to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-What do you mean what am I doing? &nbsp;Can’t you tell just by looking at it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Are you really going to betray me at such a moment? &nbsp;You are too much.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-It isn’t like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Mmm?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I’m just being fair. &nbsp;Didn’t I save oppa earlier?</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;…….&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus groaned at the shameless answer. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was regretful that it no longer had hands to grip its own head. &nbsp;Reygus spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;My god. &nbsp;Aren’t you on our side? &nbsp;Why should you care about what is fair for him? &nbsp;Isn’t it a given for you to help me?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Wasn’t this supposed to be a one on one battle between men?</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Oohk.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-You were arrogant. &nbsp;You took your time in attacking, and you almost died because of it. &nbsp;You would have met your end if I hadn’t saved you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus was at a loss for words. &nbsp;Kayalia had been the one to block Azell earlier. &nbsp;If it wasn’t for her intrusion, it would have died before it could truly showcase its true strength. &nbsp;It had allowed Reygus to see Azell’s secret card, so it didn’t have any grounds to complain to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Ughh.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Moreover, I’m still….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kayalia had a melancholy expression on her face as she turned away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>11</span></p>
 <p><span style>A quiet descended on the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus’ presence was gone as if it had been snuffed out. &nbsp;Everyone was taken aback at the unexpected turn of events.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell mumbled to himself in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Vitan’s Chalice……?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It couldn’t be. &nbsp;He had unsummoned the Vitan’s Chalice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Laura?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had seen Laura use Dimensional Distortion to defeat Dikal. &nbsp;Of course, this was the only possibility that sounded plausible to him. &nbsp;However, he was wrong. &nbsp;He could see a desperate expression on Laura’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘So who…….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>-You remain unchanged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, a white cloth fluttered in front of his eyes. &nbsp;Then a faint insubstantial figure could be seen in his vision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Who is she?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell thought he had heard that voice from somewhere before. &nbsp;He was about to raise his head when a warm touch could be felt on his forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-It has been a long time since we’ve met. &nbsp;I’m sorry I can’t give you a proper greeting. &nbsp;When I see you next, my heart will have come to a decision. &nbsp;I’ll have decided either way by then.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the end of her words, Azell lost consciousness. Kairen caught Azell’s falling body. &nbsp;Kairen faced forward as he asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kayalia chose to reveal herself, so Kairen could see her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If one used human standards, she looked to be a 14 or 15 year old girl. &nbsp;She was a Dragon Majin girl with blonde hair flowing through the air. &nbsp;There was a gray horn protruding from between her hair, and her ears were long. &nbsp;She possessed a slate-grey Dragon Magic stone on the back of her hand which was the same color as her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The weirdest part about her was the fact that she didn’t possess a body. &nbsp;It wasn’t an illusion sent by a magician. &nbsp;It looked like a ghost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The problem was the fact that she was emitting Dragon Demon magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kayalia let out a melancholy smile as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I was once the enemy of humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you part of the Dragon Demon King’s army?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen’s wariness increased. &nbsp;He didn’t know what she was, but his instinct was giving him a warning. &nbsp;It was telling him that she was a very dangerous being.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Kayalia shook her head from side to side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-At one time, I considered him to be my savior. &nbsp;That should be enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I’m not going to tell you. &nbsp;I’m leaving now. &nbsp;Please don’t waste the opportunity I have provided.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…mmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen’s expression hardened, and Kayalia disappeared in mid-air as if she had melted away. &nbsp;Laura asked with a worried expression on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about Azell?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fortunately, it isn’t life-threatening.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…even in such a state?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia was taken aback. &nbsp;Azell had taken grievous wounds. &nbsp;It wouldn’t have shocked her if he died at any moment. &nbsp;However, there was a strangely peaceful expression on the face of the unconscious Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I also have a hard time believing it, but it is true. &nbsp;First, let’s get out of here then we can heal him. &nbsp;I don’t know the identity of that ghost woman, but as unbelievable as it may sound, she saved Azell. &nbsp;The reinforcement from the Plain of Darkness will be here soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone knew what Kairen was talking about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The real adversity would begin right now. &nbsp;They had won the battle, but the party was in rough shape. &nbsp;Moreover, they didn’t know how, but the Demon King worshippers had a way of tracking them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The party left behind numerous questions as they exited the battlefield. &nbsp;They started running towards east.</span></p>
 <p><span style>12</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus was released from Kayalia’s Dimensional Distortion field after 30 minutes. &nbsp;During that time, its Dragon Demon magic had dissipated, and its armor had returned to its black color.&nbsp; Reygus grumbled as it observed its half-recovered armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I let go of a fish I had almost caught.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Doesn’t all your work turn out that way?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if he had been waiting for this moment, a man walked towards Reygus as he spoke. &nbsp;Reygus replied when it saw him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Hmm. &nbsp;You are here? &nbsp;It seems she let me go, because she saw you.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She probably did. &nbsp;The fact that she rarely shows herself in front of me might mean that she doesn’t really want to see me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Unlike me, you aren’t that cute.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;She said I’m cute.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…whether it's the past or now, she is someone that is hard to understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;By the way, you showed up after the fight…. &nbsp;Your ass has gotten really heavy.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not like you. &nbsp;I’m just an old man that everyone has forgotten about. &nbsp;Since I’ve hidden myself for such a long time, numerous annoying problems have cropped up when I decided to move.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Shouldn’t you have taken care of all of that beforehand?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Diligence and a busy life is the domain of the young ones. &nbsp;I’m too old to live a diligent and busy life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Your tongue still remains slippery. &nbsp;It is incongruous with how you look.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If we are going by appearance, there is no one that looks as boorish as you. &nbsp;So how can you say such words to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man cackled. &nbsp;The conversation didn’t have much substance behind it, but it revived the old feelings they had felt long ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, the man turned away from Reygus to walk towards a certain direction. &nbsp;There were only two survivors from the earlier battle. &nbsp;One of the Dragon Majin was breathing raggedly as he received treatment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus followed behind the man as it spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I guess they managed to survive.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…they are underlings under your command. &nbsp;You shouldn’t speak like that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;That’s true, but I was imprisoned by Kayalia. &nbsp;Aside from Azell’s party, the Guardian Shadows are surprisingly good at avoiding detection.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He probably had a hand in this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Ah, you are probably right. &nbsp;However, this isn’t like him. &nbsp;He wouldn’t kill all the dying enemies. &nbsp;It isn’t in his nature.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man sighed at Reygus’ words. &nbsp;Then he spoke to the Dragon Majin who had barely regained his consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you well enough to give your report?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Majin was puzzled by the man’s words. &nbsp;This was the first time he had seen this man. &nbsp;However, his confusion suddenly turned into shock. &nbsp;This being was known to everyone who resided in the Plain of Darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are……!” </span></p>
