 <p>Chapter 185 - Two Persons (3)</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>&lt;I’m the one that eliminated your curse. &nbsp;Despite this fact, there are two reasons why you slept for a long time.&gt;</p>
 <p>First, Carlos eliminated the curse after Azell fell asleep for over 100 years. &nbsp;Until that moment, Azell had been using his hibernation to resist against the curse, and he had been persistent in hanging onto his life.</p>
 <p>Secondly, the damage he had taken from the curse had put him close to death. &nbsp;It took a long time for Azell to recover from it.</p>
 <p>“I woke up with my Rings of Life missing not because of the long sleep…...”</p>
 <p>&lt;The curse ate away at it. &nbsp;If it wasn’t for your Rings of Life, you would have died before I was able to circumvent the curse.&gt;</p>
 <p>“So that's how it was…….”</p>
 <p>Azell was astonished. &nbsp;He knew something had gone awry, but he hadn’t expected this.</p>
 <p>“What was the true identity of the curse?”</p>
 <p>Albatan had revealed that Atein’s curse hadn’t been placed there only to kill Azell. Albatan had revealed that there was some profound intent behind the curse.</p>
 <p>Carlos spoke.</p>
 <p>&lt;Dragon Demon General.&gt;</p>
 <p>“What are you saying?”</p>
 <p>&lt;Atein planned on making you the new Dragon Demon general, Azell.&gt;</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>Azell couldn’t hide the shock he was feeling.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>What nonsense was he saying?</p>
 <p>However, Carlos was serious.</p>
 <p>&lt;Let’s look at our current situation. &nbsp;All the Dragon weapons of the Dragon Demon generals had been preserved. &nbsp;Reygus’ corpse had been destroyed, yet he was brought back as a special breed of Undead. &nbsp;How was he revived as this special Undead? &nbsp;Moreover, Almarick was able to come fully back to life, because his corpse had been recovered. &nbsp;How was this all possible?&gt;</p>
 <p>“What’s worse is that Atein is trying to revive himself too. &nbsp;Laura surmised that this was all possible thanks to the Great Darkness…….”</p>
 <p>&lt;That i s correct. &nbsp;They stored their essence within the Great Darkness, and this allows them to be revived.&gt;</p>
 <p>“What is the Great Darkness? &nbsp;How can it bring about such miracles?”</p>
 <p>&lt;If I try to explain it in a concise manner….. &nbsp;Hmmm. &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;Let us say there are beings that had gained transcendent power. &nbsp;It is the graveyard for those that had reached for immortality.&gt;</p>
 <p>“A graveyard?”</p>
 <p>&lt;There were beings that couldn’t die, and those that were dead that still wanted to live forever. &nbsp;It’s a graveyard that promised eternal sleep for these beings.&gt;</p>
 <p>“…you are explaining in a prose that magicians love to use. &nbsp;I have no idea what you are trying to say.”</p>
 <p>&lt;Ha ha ha. &nbsp;If I start getting into the specifics, the explanation will become endless. &nbsp;However, I’ll tell you about a figure you have to know. &nbsp;There was a being named Belrun from a long time ago.&gt;</p>
 <p>“What did he do?”</p>
 <p>&lt;He was called the King of Death. &nbsp;He was the original black magician.&gt;</p>
 <p>“That’s a very grandiose title. &nbsp;I don’t think I’ve heard about him before…...”</p>
 <p>&lt;He was a figure buried in legends. &nbsp;However, he once pushed the world to the brink of its demise. &nbsp;He was the first amongst the numerous creatures of this world to defy death. &nbsp;He became an Undead. &nbsp;He also used his experience of becoming an Undead to create summoning techniques that taunted death.&gt;</p>
 <p>It was the same story told by Reygus to Chanes.</p>
 <p>‘A living being feels pain, because one is alive. &nbsp;That is why I will make everyone into an Undead. &nbsp;Everyone will transcend the cycle of life and death. &nbsp;This will free everyone from the the pain caused by the four phases of life!’</p>
 <p>Belrun was a madman that had tried to bring his ambition into reality.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The problem was the fact that Belrun had the enough power to bring his ambition into fruition. &nbsp;He was the first to defy death, and he shook the foundation of the world by causing all kinds of disasters. &nbsp;He caused countless deaths.</p>
 <p>&lt;In the end, he was defeated at the hands of Atein, Almarick and Reygus.&gt;</p>
 <p>“So they were once heroes, who saved the world.”</p>
 <p>&lt;That isn’t the entire story, but it is part of it.&gt;</p>
 <p>However, even Atein was unable to kill Belrun. &nbsp;Belrun had transcended death, and it was more apt to say that he was a god-like figure.</p>
 <p>&lt;Atein put Belrun in a sleep that he couldn’t wake up from. &nbsp;Then Atein sealed him. &nbsp;The method he used to bring about this result was the Great Darkness.&gt;</p>
 <p>Belrun wasn’t the only one trapped within the Great Darkness. &nbsp;He wasn’t the first nor would he be the last.</p>
 <p>There were beings that the world couldn’t handle. &nbsp;These transcendent beings threatened the balance of the world through their madness. &nbsp;Atein methodically defeated these beings, and he had sealed them within the Great Darkness.</p>
 <p>It was odd. &nbsp;These were beings that transcended the mysteries of the world. &nbsp;They had become immortals, and every single one of them had gone mad.</p>
 <p>They couldn’t accept the world that was in front of them, so they tried to change the world into their image. &nbsp;Every time such an event occurred, Atein and his comrades fought to defend the world.</p>
 <p>&lt;…moreover, the power of the sealed beings became the basis for creating the Great Darkness. &nbsp;This is my guess, but Atein probably hadn’t expected such a result to occur. &nbsp;Atein had realized that it was impossible to indefinitely seal the power of these near immortal beings. This was why he further developed the Great Darkness.&gt;</p>
 <p>These were beings that could not perish. &nbsp;How could one seal beings that continuously regenerated?</p>
 <p>It was impossible.</p>
 <p>Atein put them to sleep, and he created a method where their power was being continuously consumed.</p>
 <p>Atein used the power generated by these beings as pillar to a feedback structure that encompassed the world. &nbsp;It was a system that continuously sealed them using their own power, and it continuously inflicted loss on their power.</p>
 <p>The Great Darkness possessed immense possibility, and when the power of these beings mixed with the Great Darkness, the Great Darkness started to change.</p>
 <p>&lt;The Great Darkness was something that transcended magic. &nbsp;Atein had created it, but it had become part of the world. &nbsp;This caused a huge wound to be formed on this world.&gt;</p>
 <p>“So they were able to use the power of Belrun to revive themselves?”</p>
 <p>&lt;It is part of the reason. &nbsp;The power to make the Undead allowed him to make the special Undead. &nbsp;However, that power couldn’t wholly bring someone back to life. &nbsp;Reygus was a result that was achieved using Belrun’s power.&gt;</p>
 <p>“Hmm. &nbsp;It seems we’ve strayed off topic.… What about the part where he was trying to make me a Dragon General?”</p>
 <p>&lt;I need to tell you this story. &nbsp;If not, you won’t be able to understand the conclusion. &nbsp;Atein targeted you with the curse, because he wanted to make you part of the Great Darkness.&gt;</p>
 <p>“Mmm?”</p>
 <p>&lt;It means you would have been a subordinate to the Great Darkness like Almarick and Reygus.&gt;</p>
 <p>“That…….”</p>
 <p>Azell stopped breathing for a moment.</p>
 <p>If he had died by Atein’s curse, would he have been reborn in this era like Almarick?</p>
 <p>&lt;Yes, you would have become the new Dragon Demon general. &nbsp;You would have had to obey Atein.&gt;</p>
 <p>“…….”</p>
 <p>Azell became chilled with fright. &nbsp;He never expected such a plot from Atein.</p>
 <p>His attempt failed. &nbsp;I was barely able to find out the true nature of the curse, and I was able to eliminate it.&gt;</p>
 <p>“By this time, you’ve been asleep for well over 100 years…...”</p>
 <p>Azell felt an ominous feeling as he queried Carlos.</p>
 <p>“Were you in this state? &nbsp;Or were you still your former self?”</p>
 <p>&lt;No.&gt;</p>
 <p>“So how were you able to accomplish it?”</p>
 <p>Carlos couldn’t exit this place. &nbsp;It had been the same at the time.</p>
 <p>The Guardian Shadows were created at a later date. &nbsp;Basically, he didn’t have any subordinates that could have helped him take care of his business. &nbsp;That was what Azell surmised.</p>
 <p>&lt;As expected, you are quite sharp. &nbsp;I…..&gt;</p>
 <p>Carlos spoke with a bitterness in his voice.</p>
 <p>&lt;I became part of the Great Darkness.&gt;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>5</p>
 <p>While Azell and Carlos were conversing, the other party members were walking down a tunnel created within the mountain peak of Laus. &nbsp;They felt a chill. &nbsp;Kairen spoke using the Whispering technique.</p>
 <p>-It is creepy here. &nbsp;Is everyone an Undead here?</p>
 <p>There were countless stone cases, clothes and armor filled with darkness lining the tunnel. &nbsp;It seemed they were all vessels containing an Undead.</p>
 <p>Yuren spoke.</p>
 <p>-I guess so. &nbsp;They are all very powerful Undead. &nbsp;They feel similar to the Guardian Shadows……..</p>
 <p>They felt similar to the ‘Sleepless Guardians’, who had accompanied the Keepers of the Prophecy. &nbsp;They felt distinct from the normal Undead, and they seemed to possess more power.</p>
 <p>Kairen posed a question.</p>
 <p>-Why won’t they mobilize them onto the field? &nbsp;With this amount of troops, the ongoing fight would be resolved much easier……</p>
 <p>The Sleepless Guardians were powerful beings. &nbsp;However, they had possessed a limitation. &nbsp;They had been tied to the Keepers of Prophecy. &nbsp;However, if there were more beings like them, they would be able to further restrict the activities of the Dragon Demon king worshippers.</p>
 <p>‘It is an unsatisfying situation.’</p>
 <p>The party reached their destination. &nbsp;There was a space along the tunnel that had been widened, and the items for the party had be readied there.</p>
 <p>The Undead spoke.</p>
 <p>&lt;Please look on top of the stone altar engraved with your name.&gt;</p>
 <p>It was as he said. &nbsp;The space contained wide stone pillars that had the name of Kairen, Laura, Leticia and Yuren engraved on it. &nbsp;On top of these altars, there were items that were infused with powerful magic.</p>
 <p>“It seems they really prepared items that are tailored to each of us.”</p>
 <p>Kairen expressed his amazement. &nbsp;There was a sword that looked similar to his Dragon Sword, and there was a set of armor that looked similar to the one he wore in the past. &nbsp;These items didn’t contain any Dragon Demon magic, but one could tell that they were powerful magical weapons. &nbsp;Leticia received a new spear and armor. &nbsp;Laura received a magic tome that contained Carlos’ knowledge, and a coat that was infused with magic. &nbsp;They also received accessories that were complementary to the gears they received.</p>
 <p>“Why do I only get this?”</p>
 <p>Yuren sounded as if he was about to cry. &nbsp;It was to be expected…..</p>
 <p>“You only received that?”</p>
 <p>Kairen was taken aback.</p>
 <p>Yuren was given an iron box that was the size of his fist. &nbsp;Yuren furrowed his brows.</p>
 <p>“Wow. &nbsp;Since he is my ancestor, my hopes were high. &nbsp;How can this be?”</p>
 <p>“It seems you just look like him. &nbsp;You might not be his descendant….”</p>
 <p>“That’s not possible. &nbsp;You heard what Azell and Almarick said, right?”</p>
 <p>Yuren grumbled as he looked over the box. &nbsp;It didn’t look special, but a change occurred when he inserted his magical energy into the box.</p>
 <p>-To my descendant Yuren Rizester.</p>
 <p>When he inserted his magical energy, he heard the voice of Carlos within his head.</p>
 <p>-This is the Box of Hope.</p>
 <p>‘Box of Hope?’</p>
 <p>-If you open this box, you will be greeted by an irrevocable destruction.</p>
 <p>The name and the description didn’t match up.</p>
 <p>-I promise you this. &nbsp;In return, you will be able to overcome any danger using this.</p>
 <p>‘It is used for suicide bombing.’</p>
 <p>Yuren grumbled. &nbsp;Basically, he would have to sacrifice his life to obtain enormous power.</p>
 <p>However, the explanation hadn’t ended yet.</p>
 <p>-Then you will find out the truth.</p>
 <p>‘Truth?’</p>
 <p>-This is a truth you must know. The miracle is the price for this truth. &nbsp;The choice is up to you, my descendant.</p>
 <p>Carlos’ explanation ended there. &nbsp;However, Yuren dumbfoundedly stared at the box for a long time.</p>
 <p>‘Truth? What truth is he talking about? Is he perhaps talking about the identity of the Guide?’</p>
 <p>He had a lot of guesses, but he was leery at the fact that he couldn’t pinpoint what Carlos was talking about. &nbsp;Yuren furrowed his brows.</p>
