  <p><span style><span style>Chapter 20 - Dragon Slayer’s Ritual (5)</span></span></p>
  <p></p>
  <hr>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>In the meantime, Jackal dashed out from between the trees like a gale, and he attacked Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Ka-ah-ah-ahng! (TLN: sound of sword ringing)</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell put Rick down and he faced the sword head-on.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was a strike where he didn’t have time to think. Jackal’s sword strike was so fierce that Azell’s body started sliding backwards. Jackal spoke in a chaotic manner.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ll kill you.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I don’t really want to return those words.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell answered indifferently. The ambush collapsed his stance, but he didn’t show any signs of panic.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Jackal felt a sense of danger from his expression.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Soo-paht! (TLN: slicing sfx)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The next moment something passed by and it cut his hood. The veil of darkness became turbulent, and the upper portion of the hood was thinly sliced.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What did you do….!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Jackal was horrified as he retreated hurriedly. He was sure Azell was being forced back when their swords were locked together. However, a sword attack came from his blind spot.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell smiled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Well, what do you think I did?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Impudent bastard! You are merely a human!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“How many times in the human history has that line been said? Why don’t you use some creativity? Has your head hardened from having a stupid dragon’s blood?:</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You bastard….!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Jackal burst into a fit of rage at Azell’s provocation yet he couldn’t carelessly rush forward. He had no idea what methods Azell had used.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell stared at him indifferently, but he was kicking himself inside.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘This is bad.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was a shame that he wasn’t able to critically injure Jackal a moment ago with a decisive blow. Jackal’s wariness had gotten too strong, so he wasn’t going to rush forward.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell had used a simple method. He used his Concealment technique to hide the other sword and at a decisive moment, he used it to attack from a blind spot. Azell’s one-handed use of the sword was so natural that Jackal couldn’t fathom Azell had using two swords.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Koo-goo-goo-goo-goo-goo…! (TLN: ground shaking noise)</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was at that moment. The ground shook, and eventually it swelled like wave.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell looked towards the Earth Dragon with desperate eyes. Eventually, the Earth Dragon lifted its head.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Roar of a Dragon!’</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was an attack method akin to a calamity where the dragon poured out all of its strength at once.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Koo-gwa-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! (TLN: earth destruction noise)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The earth was overturned and an explosive sound rang out.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The roar centered around the dragon, and the shock wave spread out while being transmitted across the surface of the ground. It killed everything above the ground.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The surface of the earth was peeled off as a whole, and all the grasses and trees on the surface was blown away. The massive amount of earth dropped like hail after exploding, and it covered everything.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Koo-goo-goo-goo-goo…..(TLN: earth shaking sfx)</span></p>
  <p><span style>A radius of couple hundred meters shook, and the cloud of dust that had magnificently risen started to settle down.</span></p>
  <p><span style>7</span></p>
  <p><span style>The dragon was basically an existence akin to a walking disaster.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The physical rampage of such a large existence would cause enormous damage yet it also had mastery over the natural phenomena of the same element. It had the power to freely control the earth.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Fortunately, the dragons rarely bumped against the humans.</span></p>
  <p><span style>If one looked at their habits, they set their territory and reigned over it like tyrants. They were similar to wild animals. Moreover, they were reluctant to approach human territories to an abnormal degree.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Despite this fact, the humans gathered a lot of information on the dragons. Once in awhile, the human population had collided with a dragon. The damage caused by one of them was so vast that it was almost unbelievable.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Even if she had learned about them…. Arrieta realized the truth. She really didn’t know anything about a dragon.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I’m no match against it.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>In the past two years, she had faced evil black magicians and even a crazed Dragon Demon. The fact that she had such experiences enabled her to stay calm when confronting the members of the Dragon’s Shadow.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, the Earth dragon in front of her eyes was on a different level. Her hands were full just from running and escaping the large body that was attacking her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Enora….’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Moreover, Arrieta had someone she had to protect. Enora had a pale complexion and she had fainted, while being held by Arrieta. A normal young girl couldn’t cope with such a situation. Also, there was a lot of physical burden being applied to her…..</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘It’ll be dangerous if I continue to use the Instantaneous Movement method.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Instantaneous Movement method allowed one to move a distance of several dozen meters in an instant, but it puts a huge load on the body.</span></p>
  <p><span style>As a Dragon Demon, Arrieta was endowed with a body that couldn’t be compared to a normal person. She was unrivalled in her strength and sturdiness. The Dragon Demon Magic protected her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Enora had fainted under the pressure of just one Instantaneous Movement.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Koong! Koo-oong…..! (TLN: dragon footstep sfx)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Earth Dragon pushed through the dust storm in front of her, and its approaching footsteps rang out.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Could she evade while not using the Instantaneous Movement method? Every time the Earth Dragon moved the surrounding became widely devastated. Moreover, the members of the Dragon’s shadow kept holding onto her ankles.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘It won’t work….’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta felt a dark despair. Had she ever been in a situation in her life where there wasn’t an answer to a solution?</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was at that moment.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I have no choice.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>She heard Azell’s voice.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta was surprised so she turned to look at the direction where the voice came from. Azell was walking toward her with Rick draped around him, and he was flicking blood off of his sword.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta muttered to herself absent-mindedly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Azell Zestringer….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It isn’t my style to flip a card without seeing what’s behind it…. Carlos is perverse even in his death.” (TLN: Azell thinks Carlos is involved somehow)</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell smirked then he put down Rick beside Arrieta. At that moment, a voice filled with hatred was heard.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You bastard….!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You are still alive after being hit by that? You are very sturdy.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell already knew about this yet he spoke shamelessly. Beyond the dust cloud, Jackal’s stumbling figure was revealed. However, there was a large cut across his chest and he was losing a lot of blood.</span></p>
  <p><span style>A moment ago when the Earth Dragon let out its Roar of the Dragon, Jackal was taken aback so he was completely defenseless. Instead of evading the approaching catastrophe, he prioritized attacking Jackal.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This resulted in Jackal being critically injured. Even if he was a Dragon Demon with a sturdy physique, he was in danger if he didn’t get immediate healing.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell snorted.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hoong.(TLN: noise made by nose, hmmph) I wanted to end your life… Now I don’t have the time to deal with someone like you.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What did you say? Bastarrrrrrd…..!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Jackal! Stop!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Regina was too late in understanding the situation. She yelled desperately. However, it was after Jackal had exploded. The Dragon Demon Magic responded to his anger, and a storm-like wave poured out. Jackal attacked Azell, while surrounded by blue flames.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Poo-ook! (TLN: sound of blade piercing flesh)</span></p>
  <p><span style>A horrifying sound of destruction rang out.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Uh….?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Jackal, who had just used the Instantaneous Movement method to attack Azell, suddenly came to a stop, and an idiotic moan leaked out.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The two swords were pierced through his body like skewers.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Where in the hell did this…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Didn’t I tell you? I have no time to deal with someone like you.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell laughed coldly. Then he stared at Jackal with eyes filled with contempt.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I can manipulate the Sight and read the flow of thought. Someone who doesn’t even have the eyes to observe one’s opponent dares to fight against me…. Apologize to the strong power you possess. Are all the Dragon Demons these days of low quality?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell hadn’t lost Jackal’s location for even a moment. He predicted which direction he’ll come from after he had inflicted the critical wound. He used the two hidden swords to set up a trap. He had injected his magical force beforehand, and its flight was controlled remotely. It was easy for Azell to perform this skill.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You.. Stupid….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Jackal died immediately after his lung and heart was pierced.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Regina and her companion shuddered. Instead of feeling angry about their companion dying in front of them, the fear they felt for Azell, who was staring at them with cold eyes, was larger.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘What is this guy?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>They could only feel a fistful of magical energy from him. Until now, she had killed countless number of humans with stronger magical energy than him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However… She couldn’t see the floor. (TLN: it’s a metaphor)</span></p>
  <p><span style>Objectively, the difference between their power was absolutely immense, but he used ridiculous methods to defeat his opponents every time. What kinds of a magic was he using?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Koong.. Koong… Koo-oong…..! (TLN:footstep sfx)</span></p>
  <p><span style>While he was in a confrontation, the Earth Dragon came closer during that time. Azell spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Princess. Escape with Rick and Miss Enora.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…what?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ll block the dragon.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What, what are you talking about?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta was taken aback.</span></p>
  <p><span style>She knew Azell was strong. One couldn’t assess his true strength just by looking at his outer appearance. At the very least, Arrieta couldn’t even reach the tip of his toes in terms of mastery over battle techniques.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However… It was an entirely different matter when facing a dragon. Even if he was extremely skilled, if he didn’t have overwhelming strength then how could he face a dragon?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell laughed bitterly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“To tell you the truth, I… I have a really perverse friend.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“……?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“This person always wants to see a person at their worst. Even though he could help immediately, he wants to see a person cornered so he could evaluate the worth of a person. Well. Occasionally, you might not believe this, but sometimes he waits for the exact moment where he could could take credit for everything.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…he doesn’t sound like a human I want to associate with.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You’re right. However, if he acknowledges your worth then he’ll treat you very well. He’ll even put his life on the line for you.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Carlos was such a man in Azell’s memories. Everyone avoided him yet he was so talented that people had no choice, but to rely on him. He was an eccentric magician.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That is why I trust him.” (TLN: I think he is assuming Carlos put some contingency plan in place)</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What does that have to do with this situation?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It’s relevant.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After speaking those words, Azell stepped in front of the Earth Dragon. The Earth Dragon stopped and turned its head questioningly as if it had responded to Azell’s gaze.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Dragon.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“My name is Azell Zestringer.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Then the name of an absolute trial that was buried within his memories leaked out of his mouth.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ll challenge you to the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>8</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kirion, a member of Dragon’s Shadow, was inside the underground building, which was assumed to be Carlos’ ruin.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He was ordered to look over the ruins with the backup that had arrived, because he had been injured the day before by Azell. He was dissatisfied, but it was an order from Regina, who held a higher position than him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Every time we approach anything it gets wasted.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kirion’s voice revealed a trace of anger, and the back up from the association grumbled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It can’t be helped. Initially, it must have been decided that whatever inside wouldn’t be turned over to an outsider.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>There was a limit to how many reinforcement that could be dispatched in one day to an isolated location. Another Dragon Demon magician like Kirion had come here.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He was a dark magician that gave off a dark energy. Kirion also treated human lives as if it was worth no more than that of a fly, but he didn’t use the death itself as a tool like this black magician. He shuddered at the energy emitted by the black magician.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, his skill was undeniable. Kirion used every method at his disposal yet he couldn’t open the ruin’s defensive barrier. The black magician opened it in just 12 hours.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, the trouble came afterwards.</span></p>

 <p><span style>It was a strike where he didn’t have time to think. Jackal’s sword strike was so fierce that Azell’s body started sliding backwards. Jackal spoke in a chaotic manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll kill you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t really want to return those words.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell answered indifferently. The ambush collapsed his stance, but he didn’t show any signs of panic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jackal felt a sense of danger from his expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soo-paht! (TLN: slicing sfx)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next moment something passed by and it cut his hood. The veil of darkness became turbulent, and the upper portion of the hood was thinly sliced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you do….!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jackal was horrified as he retreated hurriedly. He was sure Azell was being forced back when their swords were locked together. However, a sword attack came from his blind spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, what do you think I did?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impudent bastard! You are merely a human!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How many times in the human history has that line been said? Why don’t you use some creativity? Has your head hardened from having a stupid dragon’s blood?:</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You bastard….!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jackal burst into a fit of rage at Azell’s provocation yet he couldn’t carelessly rush forward. He had no idea what methods Azell had used.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell stared at him indifferently, but he was kicking himself inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is bad.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a shame that he wasn’t able to critically injure Jackal a moment ago with a decisive blow. Jackal’s wariness had gotten too strong, so he wasn’t going to rush forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had used a simple method. He used his Concealment technique to hide the other sword and at a decisive moment, he used it to attack from a blind spot. Azell’s one-handed use of the sword was so natural that Jackal couldn’t fathom Azell had using two swords.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-goo-goo-goo-goo-goo…! (TLN: ground shaking noise)</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was at that moment. The ground shook, and eventually it swelled like wave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell looked towards the Earth Dragon with desperate eyes. Eventually, the Earth Dragon lifted its head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Roar of a Dragon!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an attack method akin to a calamity where the dragon poured out all of its strength at once.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-gwa-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! (TLN: earth destruction noise)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The earth was overturned and an explosive sound rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The roar centered around the dragon, and the shock wave spread out while being transmitted across the surface of the ground. It killed everything above the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surface of the earth was peeled off as a whole, and all the grasses and trees on the surface was blown away. The massive amount of earth dropped like hail after exploding, and it covered everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-goo-goo-goo-goo…..(TLN: earth shaking sfx)</span></p>
 <p><span style>A radius of couple hundred meters shook, and the cloud of dust that had magnificently risen started to settle down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>7</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dragon was basically an existence akin to a walking disaster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The physical rampage of such a large existence would cause enormous damage yet it also had mastery over the natural phenomena of the same element. It had the power to freely control the earth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, the dragons rarely bumped against the humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If one looked at their habits, they set their territory and reigned over it like tyrants. They were similar to wild animals. Moreover, they were reluctant to approach human territories to an abnormal degree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite this fact, the humans gathered a lot of information on the dragons. Once in awhile, the human population had collided with a dragon. The damage caused by one of them was so vast that it was almost unbelievable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if she had learned about them…. Arrieta realized the truth. She really didn’t know anything about a dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m no match against it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past two years, she had faced evil black magicians and even a crazed Dragon Demon. The fact that she had such experiences enabled her to stay calm when confronting the members of the Dragon’s Shadow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the Earth dragon in front of her eyes was on a different level. Her hands were full just from running and escaping the large body that was attacking her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Enora….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, Arrieta had someone she had to protect. Enora had a pale complexion and she had fainted, while being held by Arrieta. A normal young girl couldn’t cope with such a situation. Also, there was a lot of physical burden being applied to her…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’ll be dangerous if I continue to use the Instantaneous Movement method.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Instantaneous Movement method allowed one to move a distance of several dozen meters in an instant, but it puts a huge load on the body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a Dragon Demon, Arrieta was endowed with a body that couldn’t be compared to a normal person. She was unrivalled in her strength and sturdiness. The Dragon Demon Magic protected her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Enora had fainted under the pressure of just one Instantaneous Movement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koong! Koo-oong…..! (TLN: dragon footstep sfx)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Earth Dragon pushed through the dust storm in front of her, and its approaching footsteps rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could she evade while not using the Instantaneous Movement method? Every time the Earth Dragon moved the surrounding became widely devastated. Moreover, the members of the Dragon’s shadow kept holding onto her ankles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It won’t work….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta felt a dark despair. Had she ever been in a situation in her life where there wasn’t an answer to a solution?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have no choice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She heard Azell’s voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta was surprised so she turned to look at the direction where the voice came from. Azell was walking toward her with Rick draped around him, and he was flicking blood off of his sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta muttered to herself absent-mindedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Azell Zestringer….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t my style to flip a card without seeing what’s behind it…. Carlos is perverse even in his death.” (TLN: Azell thinks Carlos is involved somehow)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell smirked then he put down Rick beside Arrieta. At that moment, a voice filled with hatred was heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You bastard….!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are still alive after being hit by that? You are very sturdy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell already knew about this yet he spoke shamelessly. Beyond the dust cloud, Jackal’s stumbling figure was revealed. However, there was a large cut across his chest and he was losing a lot of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A moment ago when the Earth Dragon let out its Roar of the Dragon, Jackal was taken aback so he was completely defenseless. Instead of evading the approaching catastrophe, he prioritized attacking Jackal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This resulted in Jackal being critically injured. Even if he was a Dragon Demon with a sturdy physique, he was in danger if he didn’t get immediate healing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoong.(TLN: noise made by nose, hmmph) I wanted to end your life… Now I don’t have the time to deal with someone like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you say? Bastarrrrrrd…..!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jackal! Stop!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regina was too late in understanding the situation. She yelled desperately. However, it was after Jackal had exploded. The Dragon Demon Magic responded to his anger, and a storm-like wave poured out. Jackal attacked Azell, while surrounded by blue flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Poo-ook! (TLN: sound of blade piercing flesh)</span></p>
 <p><span style>A horrifying sound of destruction rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh….?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jackal, who had just used the Instantaneous Movement method to attack Azell, suddenly came to a stop, and an idiotic moan leaked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two swords were pierced through his body like skewers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where in the hell did this…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t I tell you? I have no time to deal with someone like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell laughed coldly. Then he stared at Jackal with eyes filled with contempt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can manipulate the Sight and read the flow of thought. Someone who doesn’t even have the eyes to observe one’s opponent dares to fight against me…. Apologize to the strong power you possess. Are all the Dragon Demons these days of low quality?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell hadn’t lost Jackal’s location for even a moment. He predicted which direction he’ll come from after he had inflicted the critical wound. He used the two hidden swords to set up a trap. He had injected his magical force beforehand, and its flight was controlled remotely. It was easy for Azell to perform this skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You.. Stupid….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jackal died immediately after his lung and heart was pierced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regina and her companion shuddered. Instead of feeling angry about their companion dying in front of them, the fear they felt for Azell, who was staring at them with cold eyes, was larger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is this guy?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They could only feel a fistful of magical energy from him. Until now, she had killed countless number of humans with stronger magical energy than him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However… She couldn’t see the floor. (TLN: it’s a metaphor)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Objectively, the difference between their power was absolutely immense, but he used ridiculous methods to defeat his opponents every time. What kinds of a magic was he using?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koong.. Koong… Koo-oong…..! (TLN:footstep sfx)</span></p>
 <p><span style>While he was in a confrontation, the Earth Dragon came closer during that time. Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Princess. Escape with Rick and Miss Enora.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll block the dragon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What, what are you talking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She knew Azell was strong. One couldn’t assess his true strength just by looking at his outer appearance. At the very least, Arrieta couldn’t even reach the tip of his toes in terms of mastery over battle techniques.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However… It was an entirely different matter when facing a dragon. Even if he was extremely skilled, if he didn’t have overwhelming strength then how could he face a dragon?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell laughed bitterly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To tell you the truth, I… I have a really perverse friend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“……?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This person always wants to see a person at their worst. Even though he could help immediately, he wants to see a person cornered so he could evaluate the worth of a person. Well. Occasionally, you might not believe this, but sometimes he waits for the exact moment where he could could take credit for everything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…he doesn’t sound like a human I want to associate with.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re right. However, if he acknowledges your worth then he’ll treat you very well. He’ll even put his life on the line for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos was such a man in Azell’s memories. Everyone avoided him yet he was so talented that people had no choice, but to rely on him. He was an eccentric magician.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is why I trust him.” (TLN: I think he is assuming Carlos put some contingency plan in place)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What does that have to do with this situation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s relevant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After speaking those words, Azell stepped in front of the Earth Dragon. The Earth Dragon stopped and turned its head questioningly as if it had responded to Azell’s gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dragon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My name is Azell Zestringer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then the name of an absolute trial that was buried within his memories leaked out of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll challenge you to the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>8</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kirion, a member of Dragon’s Shadow, was inside the underground building, which was assumed to be Carlos’ ruin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was ordered to look over the ruins with the backup that had arrived, because he had been injured the day before by Azell. He was dissatisfied, but it was an order from Regina, who held a higher position than him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Every time we approach anything it gets wasted.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kirion’s voice revealed a trace of anger, and the back up from the association grumbled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It can’t be helped. Initially, it must have been decided that whatever inside wouldn’t be turned over to an outsider.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a limit to how many reinforcement that could be dispatched in one day to an isolated location. Another Dragon Demon magician like Kirion had come here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was a dark magician that gave off a dark energy. Kirion also treated human lives as if it was worth no more than that of a fly, but he didn’t use the death itself as a tool like this black magician. He shuddered at the energy emitted by the black magician.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, his skill was undeniable. Kirion used every method at his disposal yet he couldn’t open the ruin’s defensive barrier. The black magician opened it in just 12 hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the trouble came afterwards.</span></p>
