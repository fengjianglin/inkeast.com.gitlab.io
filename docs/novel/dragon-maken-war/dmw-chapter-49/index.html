  <p><span style>Chapter 49 - Guardian Shadows (2)</span></p>
  <p></p>
  <hr>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>“Don't look at me like that with those eyes. They were adopted.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Adopted children?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The children became orphans for various reasons, but I adopted them. Actually, there were other people who acted as their actual parents…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Still, the children were a shining beacon in his memories.</span></p>
  <p><span style>During the Dragon Demon War, Azell had seen a lot of tragedy. During this time, he had adopted children whose fate brushed against his, and he had sent them to the lands owned by him, Marquis Karzark.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After he had killed Atein to end the Dragon Demon war, he was slowly dying from the curse. Thus, he had retreated back into his territories for two years.</span></p>
  <p><span style>During that time, he had made a lot of memories with his adopted children. They were like a real family during that time.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He rode horses with them. They raced across the plains, and they found secret locations where other people wouldn't even dare to visit. He had also taught them martial arts... There was once a time when he had lived in such a way.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Enora, who had been listening without interruption, spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Sir Azell must have been a noble.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Is that so?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Unless you are a noble, the activities you described is impossible. Moreover, it sounds like your family was prosperous. You really can't remember the details?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes. I really want to remember it all.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If I really turn out to be a noble, Ms. Enora has to treat me well?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmm. So I just have to stop calling you ahjushi?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You are pretty quick on the uptake.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell couldn't help, but laugh when Enora looked up at him in a cute manner.</span></p>
  <p><span style>3</span></p>
  <p><span style>After purchasing the items, they visited a clinic. When they returned to the place they were lodging at with the healer, the sun was setting.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Enora spoke in an excited manner.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Wow. I want to always shop with someone like Sir Azell.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“So you want a strong servant?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell grumbled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>As they walked, she had bought necessary travel items and ingredients for food. The amount she bought wasn't a joke. These items would be divvied up between the horses during the travel, yet he currently had to hold it all by himself. Azell held a burden that was bigger than the size of his body. He acrobatically held it with both hands, which caused a spectacle. People in the street stopped to watch him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles was surprised at the amount of luggage Azell had brought.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You carried all of this by yourself… Maybe we should have gone too?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I didn't know she would buy this much.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>He couldn't tell Giles about Enora's cold assessment of him, so Azell gave an ambiguous answer.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Enora and the healer went to meet Arrieta, and Azell went out to the garden in the back of the inn. Since this place catered to the nobles, the building was luxurious and had a pretty large garden.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hmmm.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>He found Kairen there. The man had taken off his armor and had hidden his horn, ears, and Dragon Demon stone. Kairen sat in an outdoor table disguised as a human, drinking alcohol.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That's quite the disguise.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If I show my real appearance in such a crowded place, it would be annoying to operate in that location.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Unlike Arrieta, who had basically been a propaganda tool for the throne, Kairen often worked under the radar. This was why he had spent a lot of his money making this personal magic tool that disguised his outer appearance.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kairen queried.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Did you bring a healer?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes. Ms. Enora created a big fuss asking for a female healer, so it took some time.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“She is young, but she is quite good at her job. Do you want a cup?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I won't refuse, but… Do you think I can ask you a question before that?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“By the way you are speaking, it seems your words will make me lose appetite for alcohol... What if I say no?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Then I won’t ask.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If you are meekly backing off like this, then it must not be anything important.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No. I'll just give up on getting a glass of alcohol from the duke, then I'll pursue the matter by myself. They seem to be outstanding at hiding themselves, but if I chase after them myself...”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>In a flash, the atmosphere froze.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell looked at him with a smiling face, and Kairen glared back with a rigid expression on his face. The pressure emitted by him was so enormous that the air started to vibrate a little bit.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Azell sloughed it off nonchalantly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…You are quite adept at fending off my pressure. You’re like a ghost, and it’s putting me in a foul mood.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I've had many occasions where I received such pressure. If I'm flattened by this, then I would have been dead long ago.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You are really too impudent. Normally, a person would be too afraid at the prospect of dying.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If you are someone I could deal with by being polite, we wouldn't even be having this conversation. To tell you the truth..."</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell sat across Kairen without asking for permission.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Shouldn't I be a bit suspicious? There are unseen beings circling around us. Our party members don't know about their existence, yet their presence disappeared after meeting with you.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It hasn't been too long since we were monitored and chased by the Dragon Demon King worshippers. I believe I have valid reasons to bring up this issue even though it might sour your taste for the alcohol.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hooo…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kairen tossed the rest of the alcohol into his mouth as if he was annoyed. Then he glared at Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was at that moment.</span></p>
  <p><span style>「Dragon Demon magic…….」</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell flinched. Between the trees of the garden, he heard a voice that was akin to whispering children.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘He was this close to me?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>The voice was coming from a location only 20 meters away from Azell. How could he not realize that someone had gotten so close to him?</span></p>
  <p><span style>「You are a human, yet... The well of Dragon Demon Magic...」</span></p>
  <p><span style>He was sure a single person was speaking, yet it had sounded as if multiple people were whispering at the same time. It was a very strange voice. He would be a great subject in a horror story for the masses.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell glared at the location with sharp eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Is he a specter?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The other person wasn't a human. He was sure of it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The person had on a similar outfit as those from the Dragon's Shadow. He had a white robe with a hood covering his face. The shadow casted by the hood obscured his face.</span></p>
  <p><span style>That wasn't the only oddity. Below the robe, Azell couldn't see his feet and no hands were protruding out from his sleeves.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘How strange. Is there a real body underneath the robe?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell furrowed his eyebrows, then awakened his magic. He moved slowly so his opponent wouldn't realize it. He stealthily...</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Yet this.... This feeling isn't wholly unfamiliar. What is this?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>The faceless specter's presence agitated some memory in Azell's mind. He was sure this was the first time he'd seen this being, yet he felt a sense of déjà vu.</span></p>
  <p><span style>At that moment, Kairen spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Stop it. He isn't an enemy.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…Do you really think I would believe those words?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Suddenly, another being could be detected by Azell's senses. He had appeared like a ghost, and he had the same outfit as the first specter. The only difference was the size of their bodies. One was small like a child, and the other was a giant over two meters tall.</span></p>
  <p><span style>As they glided across the floor, they spoke in their whispering voices.</span></p>
  <p><span style>「Is he a defender of the prophecy… No…….」</span></p>
  <p><span style>「Still, he has it. The Dragon Demon magic...」</span></p>
  <p><span style>「Strange…….」</span></p>
  <p><span style>「Very strange…….」</span></p>
  <p><span style>「This kind of human hasn't existed for a long time…….」</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell couldn't see their faces, but he knew they were speaking about him. He could feel their gaze. Their eyes bore into Azell...</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Stop there. If you approach any further... This friend might attack you.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>「We won't die easily…….」</span></p>
  <p><span style>“However, it isn't as if you can't be killed. Don't you have unfinished business? It would be best if you don't do anything that might result in you losing your strength.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>「He isn't… He isn't strong enough to harm us…….」</span></p>
  <p><span style>「However… He has Dragon Demon magic.」</span></p>
  <p><span style>「He is hiding it…….」</span></p>
  <p><span style>「Maybe we aren't reading him correctly…….」</span></p>
  <p><span style>「A human… There used to be…….」</span></p>
  <p><span style>「Really……?」</span></p>
  <p><span style>「A long time ago…….」</span></p>
  <p><span style>They babbled as if they weren't sane. However, they circled around at a distance of ten meters and didn't approach Azell any further.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That's surprising. I've never seen them show so much interest in a single person.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What are they?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell asked in a nonchalant manner. Of course, he circulated his magical energy inside so he could attack at any given moment.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Guardian Shadows.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…You just gave me their name and I still have no idea what they are.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It would be difficult for me to tell you anything more. The fact that you even know about their existence... It makes me wonder what I should do with you.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The specter who had kept his silence since he first appeared spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>「You can tell him…….」</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kairen was surprised. This meant the specter's words was quite out of the norm.</span></p>
  <p><span style>「He isn't connected with us… Maybe the prophecy…….」</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The prophecy? What is that?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kairen frowned as he asked the question, but the specters kept their mouths shut. Moreover, when the specters’ babbling stopped, a very ominous silence descended on them.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmmm…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kairen didn't like it, but it was pointless to glare at the Guardian Shadows. A common sense approach didn't work with them in the first place.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Eventually, Kairen gave up and gave an explanation to Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“They are like a suppression system that prevents the Dragon Demon King worshippers from operating out in the open....”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The Dragon Demon King worshippers can't reveal themselves because of these things?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Didn't you think what you experienced this time around was a bit unusual?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kairen answered a question with another.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell queried.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What do you mean?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The people who ambushed your party were very powerful. Each individual had a massive amount of power that is rarely seen. They easily used monsters as disposable soldiers. Why would those bastards with such power try so hard to hide their activities from the eyes of the people?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I'm not sure. Isn't it because they were just a small elite unit inside the secret organization?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Truthfully, Azell didn't entirely grasp how everything operated in this era, so he didn't get the point Kairen's question was trying to make. If one possessed powerful strength, then one could cause chaos in the world even without the help of others. However, it seemed the Dragon’s Shadow were trying to look out for their own safety. What was weird about that?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kairen put on an expression as if he couldn't believe what Azell had said.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Are you really dumber than I thought or did you really lose your memories?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It is the latter.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If you don't have anything worth saying, then at the very least, think a little bit harder. If those bastards rampaged through the countryside, do you think anyone could stop them?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmm… There will be a massive loss of lives. Only after they caused massive damage will anyone with strength hear about it. Only after the fact will anyone chase after the culprit.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell slowly understood what Kairen was trying to say.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Still, the power of the Dragon Demon King worshippers were a bit too strong for him to accept his explanation as the only reason.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Either Niberis and Duran could be considered a one-man army. The members of the Dragon's Shadow from the first ambush had enough power to demolish a small town in the countryside.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Moreover, they recruited the help of a dragon.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>They were capable of taking care of their own business. However, they had used some method to train monsters to act as their hunting dogs, and they had been used as disposable soldiers. Moreover, a dragon was enticed to move on their behest.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Now that I hear your words… They seem to be excessively cautious. However, isn't it because they are worried about the aftermath?”</span></p>

 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Don't look at me like that with those eyes. They were adopted.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Adopted children?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The children became orphans for various reasons, but I adopted them. Actually, there were other people who acted as their actual parents…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, the children were a shining beacon in his memories.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the Dragon Demon War, Azell had seen a lot of tragedy. During this time, he had adopted children whose fate brushed against his, and he had sent them to the lands owned by him, Marquis Karzark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he had killed Atein to end the Dragon Demon war, he was slowly dying from the curse. Thus, he had retreated back into his territories for two years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During that time, he had made a lot of memories with his adopted children. They were like a real family during that time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He rode horses with them. They raced across the plains, and they found secret locations where other people wouldn't even dare to visit. He had also taught them martial arts... There was once a time when he had lived in such a way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enora, who had been listening without interruption, spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir Azell must have been a noble.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unless you are a noble, the activities you described is impossible. Moreover, it sounds like your family was prosperous. You really can't remember the details?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. I really want to remember it all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I really turn out to be a noble, Ms. Enora has to treat me well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm. So I just have to stop calling you ahjushi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are pretty quick on the uptake.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell couldn't help, but laugh when Enora looked up at him in a cute manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>3</span></p>
 <p><span style>After purchasing the items, they visited a clinic. When they returned to the place they were lodging at with the healer, the sun was setting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enora spoke in an excited manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow. I want to always shop with someone like Sir Azell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you want a strong servant?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell grumbled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they walked, she had bought necessary travel items and ingredients for food. The amount she bought wasn't a joke. These items would be divvied up between the horses during the travel, yet he currently had to hold it all by himself. Azell held a burden that was bigger than the size of his body. He acrobatically held it with both hands, which caused a spectacle. People in the street stopped to watch him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles was surprised at the amount of luggage Azell had brought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You carried all of this by yourself… Maybe we should have gone too?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn't know she would buy this much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn't tell Giles about Enora's cold assessment of him, so Azell gave an ambiguous answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enora and the healer went to meet Arrieta, and Azell went out to the garden in the back of the inn. Since this place catered to the nobles, the building was luxurious and had a pretty large garden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He found Kairen there. The man had taken off his armor and had hidden his horn, ears, and Dragon Demon stone. Kairen sat in an outdoor table disguised as a human, drinking alcohol.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That's quite the disguise.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I show my real appearance in such a crowded place, it would be annoying to operate in that location.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike Arrieta, who had basically been a propaganda tool for the throne, Kairen often worked under the radar. This was why he had spent a lot of his money making this personal magic tool that disguised his outer appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen queried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you bring a healer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. Ms. Enora created a big fuss asking for a female healer, so it took some time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She is young, but she is quite good at her job. Do you want a cup?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won't refuse, but… Do you think I can ask you a question before that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“By the way you are speaking, it seems your words will make me lose appetite for alcohol... What if I say no?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I won’t ask.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you are meekly backing off like this, then it must not be anything important.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. I'll just give up on getting a glass of alcohol from the duke, then I'll pursue the matter by myself. They seem to be outstanding at hiding themselves, but if I chase after them myself...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a flash, the atmosphere froze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell looked at him with a smiling face, and Kairen glared back with a rigid expression on his face. The pressure emitted by him was so enormous that the air started to vibrate a little bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Azell sloughed it off nonchalantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…You are quite adept at fending off my pressure. You’re like a ghost, and it’s putting me in a foul mood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I've had many occasions where I received such pressure. If I'm flattened by this, then I would have been dead long ago.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are really too impudent. Normally, a person would be too afraid at the prospect of dying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you are someone I could deal with by being polite, we wouldn't even be having this conversation. To tell you the truth..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell sat across Kairen without asking for permission.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shouldn't I be a bit suspicious? There are unseen beings circling around us. Our party members don't know about their existence, yet their presence disappeared after meeting with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It hasn't been too long since we were monitored and chased by the Dragon Demon King worshippers. I believe I have valid reasons to bring up this issue even though it might sour your taste for the alcohol.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hooo…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen tossed the rest of the alcohol into his mouth as if he was annoyed. Then he glared at Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>「Dragon Demon magic…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell flinched. Between the trees of the garden, he heard a voice that was akin to whispering children.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He was this close to me?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The voice was coming from a location only 20 meters away from Azell. How could he not realize that someone had gotten so close to him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>「You are a human, yet... The well of Dragon Demon Magic...」</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was sure a single person was speaking, yet it had sounded as if multiple people were whispering at the same time. It was a very strange voice. He would be a great subject in a horror story for the masses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell glared at the location with sharp eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is he a specter?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other person wasn't a human. He was sure of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person had on a similar outfit as those from the Dragon's Shadow. He had a white robe with a hood covering his face. The shadow casted by the hood obscured his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That wasn't the only oddity. Below the robe, Azell couldn't see his feet and no hands were protruding out from his sleeves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How strange. Is there a real body underneath the robe?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell furrowed his eyebrows, then awakened his magic. He moved slowly so his opponent wouldn't realize it. He stealthily...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Yet this.... This feeling isn't wholly unfamiliar. What is this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The faceless specter's presence agitated some memory in Azell's mind. He was sure this was the first time he'd seen this being, yet he felt a sense of déjà vu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop it. He isn't an enemy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…Do you really think I would believe those words?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, another being could be detected by Azell's senses. He had appeared like a ghost, and he had the same outfit as the first specter. The only difference was the size of their bodies. One was small like a child, and the other was a giant over two meters tall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they glided across the floor, they spoke in their whispering voices.</span></p>
 <p><span style>「Is he a defender of the prophecy… No…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>「Still, he has it. The Dragon Demon magic...」</span></p>
 <p><span style>「Strange…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>「Very strange…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>「This kind of human hasn't existed for a long time…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell couldn't see their faces, but he knew they were speaking about him. He could feel their gaze. Their eyes bore into Azell...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop there. If you approach any further... This friend might attack you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>「We won't die easily…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, it isn't as if you can't be killed. Don't you have unfinished business? It would be best if you don't do anything that might result in you losing your strength.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>「He isn't… He isn't strong enough to harm us…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>「However… He has Dragon Demon magic.」</span></p>
 <p><span style>「He is hiding it…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>「Maybe we aren't reading him correctly…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>「A human… There used to be…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>「Really……?」</span></p>
 <p><span style>「A long time ago…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>They babbled as if they weren't sane. However, they circled around at a distance of ten meters and didn't approach Azell any further.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That's surprising. I've never seen them show so much interest in a single person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are they?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell asked in a nonchalant manner. Of course, he circulated his magical energy inside so he could attack at any given moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guardian Shadows.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…You just gave me their name and I still have no idea what they are.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It would be difficult for me to tell you anything more. The fact that you even know about their existence... It makes me wonder what I should do with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The specter who had kept his silence since he first appeared spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>「You can tell him…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen was surprised. This meant the specter's words was quite out of the norm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>「He isn't connected with us… Maybe the prophecy…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The prophecy? What is that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen frowned as he asked the question, but the specters kept their mouths shut. Moreover, when the specters’ babbling stopped, a very ominous silence descended on them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen didn't like it, but it was pointless to glare at the Guardian Shadows. A common sense approach didn't work with them in the first place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eventually, Kairen gave up and gave an explanation to Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They are like a suppression system that prevents the Dragon Demon King worshippers from operating out in the open....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Dragon Demon King worshippers can't reveal themselves because of these things?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn't you think what you experienced this time around was a bit unusual?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen answered a question with another.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell queried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The people who ambushed your party were very powerful. Each individual had a massive amount of power that is rarely seen. They easily used monsters as disposable soldiers. Why would those bastards with such power try so hard to hide their activities from the eyes of the people?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm not sure. Isn't it because they were just a small elite unit inside the secret organization?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Truthfully, Azell didn't entirely grasp how everything operated in this era, so he didn't get the point Kairen's question was trying to make. If one possessed powerful strength, then one could cause chaos in the world even without the help of others. However, it seemed the Dragon’s Shadow were trying to look out for their own safety. What was weird about that?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen put on an expression as if he couldn't believe what Azell had said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you really dumber than I thought or did you really lose your memories?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is the latter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you don't have anything worth saying, then at the very least, think a little bit harder. If those bastards rampaged through the countryside, do you think anyone could stop them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm… There will be a massive loss of lives. Only after they caused massive damage will anyone with strength hear about it. Only after the fact will anyone chase after the culprit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell slowly understood what Kairen was trying to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, the power of the Dragon Demon King worshippers were a bit too strong for him to accept his explanation as the only reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Either Niberis and Duran could be considered a one-man army. The members of the Dragon's Shadow from the first ambush had enough power to demolish a small town in the countryside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Moreover, they recruited the help of a dragon.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were capable of taking care of their own business. However, they had used some method to train monsters to act as their hunting dogs, and they had been used as disposable soldiers. Moreover, a dragon was enticed to move on their behest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now that I hear your words… They seem to be excessively cautious. However, isn't it because they are worried about the aftermath?”</span></p>
