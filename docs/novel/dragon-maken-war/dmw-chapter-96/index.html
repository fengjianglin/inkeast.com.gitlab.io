 <p>Chapter 96 - Those who Seek Their Own Destiny (5)</p>
 <p><span style>-Hmmm. &nbsp;What is it? &nbsp;Is it really possible to see this far into the distance?</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were moving fairly quickly, and they had already traversed 5 kilometres. &nbsp;However, they hadn't reached their opponent yet. &nbsp;The range of the surveillance was beyond Kairen's common sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>- This person is using a relay system of Magic Eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>- Relay?</span></p>
 <p><span style>- Only the very high rank magicians can use this method. &nbsp;It requires a high amount of skill and magical energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A magician could only send the Magical Eye to a distance of several hundred meters. &nbsp;This was why there was a limit on how high the Magical Eye could move up into the sky to look down on its surrounding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The relay magic was a magic designed to overcome the Magic Eye's limits. &nbsp;The magician had to put down a marker nearby to maintain the magic, and the farthest Magic Eye links to the nearest Eye, the next Eye links to the next closest Eye, and so on. &nbsp;It was possible to observe far distance using such a method.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is the first time I've seen it since I've woken up.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a magic used occasionally in the Dragon Demon war, but this was the time he had seen it used in this era. &nbsp;Azell was swept up by a queer feeling. </span></p>
 <p><span style>-We won't be able to escape from the enemy's surveillance using this tactic... Let's change it up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-How?</span></p>
 <p><span style>-That is…….</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a moment, Azell and Kairen started running at frightening speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, other Azells started appearing from various parts of the forest. The Clones formed by Azell possessed a presence, and the real body disappeared from sight in an instant using a Cloaking skill. &nbsp;He disappeared once he passed beneath a tree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he increased his speed again as he ran forward faster than his Clones. &nbsp;His Clones were running at high speeds, but they couldn't hold a candle to the real Azell, who was moving silently through the forest. &nbsp;He wanted his opponent to be caught off-guard by making his opponent think Azell was still far away. &nbsp;He planned on capturing his opponent in one fell swoop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, his plan became obsolete the next moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The gaze disappeared?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Magic Eyes set up in various location vanished. &nbsp;It was as if the other side had given up the surveillance on them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwah-ah-ahng……!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he heard an explosion from the other side of the forest, and the flames brightened the darkening sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>8</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis was walking through a ruined ancient castle. &nbsp;The sun had set, and her surrounding was becoming dark. A much deeper darkness rippled around Niberis' body as her ebony hair billowed around her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I've read your file... &nbsp;I have a question I want to ask you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her whole body was filled with power. &nbsp;As a magician, the source of her power was Darkness. &nbsp;When night arrived after the sun set, her powers became much stronger...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, I have an additional question I want to ask before I ask you the other question.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I give you an answer… Will you let us live……?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren replied with a labored voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis queried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you really expect me to follow through on such a request?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. &nbsp;However, aren't you suppose to tell me you will?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You aren't worth lying to. &nbsp;I have no thoughts on debasing myself by doing so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow… You really... &nbsp;The arrogance suits the direct descendent of the Dragon Demon king....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll ask my question. &nbsp;Why did you run away towards the land seeped in sin?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The way you keep referring to this place.... I'm fed up with it. This land... &nbsp;Why is it seeped in sin....?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren giggled. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis' brow furrowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn't as if you don't know the reason behind the name, so why are you asking? &nbsp;What is your purpose in coming to the land of the great sinner Azell Karzark?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were within the County of Karzark. &nbsp;Moreover, they were at the heart where the castle of Karzark was located at.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you perhaps think I wouldn't follow after you into the territory of the Dragons? &nbsp;You don't look that dumb...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The County of Karzark wasn't designated as being a Cursed land just because there were a lot of monsters here. &nbsp;Amongst the 13 Dragons, who had destroyed this land, seven of them had taken residence here in this land. &nbsp;This was why Bijes kingdom had no choice but to give up on this bountiful land.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The knowledge... &nbsp;A price always follows... If you are a magician... Shouldn't you....have more sense?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess you will refuse to answer me. &nbsp;All right. &nbsp;If you want to speed up your death, I'll....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The darkness around Niberis' body rose up like flame. &nbsp;At the same time, a powerful magical wave started to emanate from Yuren's body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He suddenly spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…I haven't reached my end yet. &nbsp;No, let me rephrase that. Not here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you just say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis was surprised. Yuren had been half dead, yet his condition was rapidly changing. Power was being infused into his voice, and his body looked to be overflowing with energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is it a regeneration ability? No, if he had that, he would have used it sooner. &nbsp;Then what is he... Mmmm?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, she realized what Yuren was doing. &nbsp;She was further taken aback by his actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He called for a demon, and he let it in.... &nbsp;Is he nuts?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A black smoke was gathering behind Yuren, and a figure was taking shape. &nbsp;It looked like a horribly deformed silhouette of a human. &nbsp;At the same time, an evil energy started to spread, and it was hard to breathe from just approaching the figure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis was someone, who played with the lives and souls of beings through black magic, yet her body was shaking. &nbsp;This was how deep this evil was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Its hatred for all living creatures was so immense that it wanted to destroy the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a Demon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the black magicians avoided approaching one, yet it was a being one must meet if one wanted to earn the knowledge of black magic. &nbsp;If not for a very specific situation, the Demons couldn't deliver their voices into this world. &nbsp;They didn't have any substance. &nbsp;There weren't much information known regarding the Demons, yet it was known that they possessed the source knowledge that was filled with evil and hatred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How funny.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His brown hair was whipping about as his gray eyes started to turn red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are from the Dragon Demon race, yet you are showing aversion to this being. &nbsp;What nonsense. &nbsp;The Dragon Demon race is the amalgamation of Dragons and Demons. &nbsp;The Demons are your father and mother.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as he had said. &nbsp;The Dragons thirsted for knowledge, and the Demons pined for a physical body. &nbsp;The two sides fused to form the Dragon Demon race. &nbsp;The first of the Dragon Demon race was Atein, and after his birth, a numerous number of the first generation Dragon Demons was born. &nbsp;Even now, such births may be occurring some place in this world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis glared at Yuren.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are right. &nbsp;However, great Dragon Demon King had spoken about this. &nbsp;The Demon race may be our father, but not all fathers deserve our admiration and love.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yet you guys still exploit this relationship. &nbsp;Even now, you are throwing test subjects to the Demon race to earn more knowledge. &nbsp;Moreover, you are trying to create monster through this union, yet you dare to say such words?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If one kept contact with the Demon race, it was like crawling into a swamp of destruction. &nbsp;When a normal human came in contact with a Demon, the human lost his mind, since he couldn't overcome the terrifying energy filled with malice and hatred. &nbsp;Still, there were a lot of cases where magicians sought knowledge and wisdom from the Demon race. &nbsp;They went in with plenty of preparation, yet their mind became unknowingly polluted. &nbsp;This made the magicians repeat unbelievably stupid acts as they were driven towards their destruction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon race loved powerful souls. &nbsp;When they were called into this world, these strong souls were able to resist their natural malice and hatred. &nbsp;However, the Demons worked towards corrupting and ruining these souls. &nbsp;It was the ultimate pleasure to eat these souls in the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was also true that one could earn something really valuable in the process. &nbsp;This was why the Dragon Demon king worshippers gave humans and Dragon Majin to the Demons as commodity. &nbsp;The Dragon Demon king worshippers 'farmed' these knowledges from the Demons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm the monster of your own creation... &nbsp;Actually, I wasn't really raised as a test subject. &nbsp;Well, whatever. &nbsp;Just the thought of killing a direct descendant of the Dragon Demon king makes me elated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren had called forth a Demon, and he was receiving power from it. &nbsp;It wouldn't have been strange if he went mad, but surprisingly, Yuren had been successful in keeping control over his power. &nbsp;He converted the Demon's power into his own magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis' expression turned cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don't know your place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ggwah-gwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the sound of an explosion rang out, both Yuren and Niberis took a step backwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ruined ancient castle shook as stone dusts fell from the ceiling. &nbsp;The two of them moved as if they were sliding across the floor, and they started exchanging flashy magical spells. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Paht! Pah-baht! Pah-pah-pah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Each immense magical spells was powerful enough to kill each combatants a thousand times over. &nbsp;However, there was no outward phenomena occurring between them. &nbsp;The air shook, and a weak spark formed between them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this was how a high level magical battle was fought. &nbsp;Before each other's magic could take form, they cut off the magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwah-kwah-kwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, an explosion occurred, and a hole was formed in the wall. &nbsp;Yuren and Niberis exited the ruins of the old castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis made a cold assessment of Yuren's battle capability.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In terms of magical energy, he exceeds me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Surprisingly, Yuren's magical energy exceeded a direct descendent of the Dragon Demon king. &nbsp;This was still true even if one took into account the fact that the Dragon Demon magic was much more effective than magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Moreover, we are almost equal in terms of technique. &nbsp;How could such a young human...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be precise, Yuren was better at fine control of magic, which needed only a small investment of power. &nbsp;On the other hand, Niberis was better at manipulating magic, which affected a large area. &nbsp;These kinds of magic required the investment of a lot of power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Normally, Niberis would be at a disadvantage in such a situation, yet the battle was tight right now. &nbsp;This was true, because Yuren was in a tenuous situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kook……!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren let out a groan. It was obvious that he was more skilled in focused magic. &nbsp;If he was steady in his progress, he would be able to dominate Niberis in all facets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, his control over his magic was becoming spotty. &nbsp;The cause was the Demon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the first place, it was considered impossible to receive power from a Demon, and control it. &nbsp;The fact that he was able to do it without being influenced by the Demon was commendable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, at the same time, he couldn't prevent the Demon from eating away at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis let out a cold smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You were boasting about a power you cannot fully control... &nbsp;You are a failure as a magician.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm sad that I cannot refute those words. &nbsp;However, the Dragon Demon king's direct descendent will die here today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oh oh oh oh oh oh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shape wavering behind Yuren grew to twice its size. &nbsp;The evil demonic energy amplified by several orders, and it pushed forward as if to swallow Niberis' Darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You plan on going for the winning move by hastening your own destruction?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren voluntarily took on a larger burden of hate and malice. &nbsp;It allowed him to bring out a much larger amount of power. &nbsp;The power was immense, yet if Niberis could maintain her defense, she'll be able to see Yuren basically kill himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess I'll have to show you that I'm on a different level. &nbsp;What a foolish traitor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis' eyes shone. &nbsp;At the same time, the darkness around her swirled around as it surged forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She spoke with a dignified voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come! &nbsp;Come into the hands of your proper owner! &nbsp;Dragon Arts - Book of the Dark Soul.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-koo-koo-koong!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A black thunderbolt struck in front of her, and the evil energy that had been encroaching towards her was shredded to pieces.</span></p>
