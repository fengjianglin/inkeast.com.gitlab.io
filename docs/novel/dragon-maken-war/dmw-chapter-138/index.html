 <p>Chapter 138 - Second Coming of a Legend (1)</p>
 <p><span style>1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silence quickly spread in a battlefield that had been filled with screams and loud sounds. &nbsp;At that moment, everyone turned to look at Reygus as if they had misheard its words. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…did he just say Azell? &nbsp;It really is Azell himself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon king worshippers looked towards Reygus in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was the great sinner, who had killed their exalted king. &nbsp;The human, Azell Karzark, was like the ultimate evil that appeared in their lore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had killed the king, but he had paid a price. &nbsp;It was widely known that he had fallen into hell when an eternal curse was placed on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t just the Dragon Demon king worshippers, who were shocked. &nbsp;The Guardian Shadows were frozen from the shock they felt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus didn't care if they were looking at it or not. &nbsp;Its gaze remained fixed on Azell. &nbsp;Since it was an Undead with only a skeleton as its body, it was impossible for Reygus to make a facial expression. &nbsp;However, Azell felt that it was laughing like a mischievous tyke. &nbsp;It was the same in the past. &nbsp;Reygus didn’t hold a single iota of hate towards a strong opponent. &nbsp;Instead, it took pleasure in the encounter like a immature brat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he thought about those time, a sigh automatically came out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke as if he was dismayed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you talking about, you big lummox of an Undead? &nbsp;The hero Azell died 220 years ago.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;That’s what I thought too. &nbsp;However, that little brat that is standing in front of me alive and kicking?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Humans usually produce descendants that look surprisingly like their ancestors. &nbsp;Since you’ve lost your brain when you came back from death, did you forget about such common sense?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Oh. &nbsp;That is the least entertaining joke I’ve heard since I’ve been revived. &nbsp;The brat I knew was a bit more imposing. &nbsp;Well, I guess 220 years enough time for you to become a coward?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;You are pissing me off. &nbsp;Shall I tell you something really ridiculous?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;What is it?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wild pig Reygus. &nbsp;It is very nice to see you. &nbsp;Does that make any sense?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Koo-hahahaha!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus laughed uproariously at his words. &nbsp;Its thunder-like laugh rang out in the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After it stopped laughing, Reygus spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;If it was just the Heaven Splitter(Sword that Splits the Sky) , I would have just assumed you were a descendent. &nbsp;However, you spoke too openly about yourself in the fight with Ms Niberis. &nbsp;So why are you trying to make excuses now?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll make a confession. &nbsp;I’ve told everyone the truth, yet no one believed me. &nbsp;That is why I’m a bit hesitant to make that claim.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;That is unfortunate. &nbsp;Anyways, I feel the same way as you. &nbsp;It sounded nice even when you called me a wild pig. &nbsp;I feel like shedding a tear. &nbsp;Of course, I can’t shed any tears any more.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is quite fortunate. &nbsp;You’ve become much more handsome in the time I wasn’t able to see you. &nbsp;In the past, your face was so ugly that it made me want to throw up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Hue hue. Your rude way of speaking is the same as 220 years ago.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Kairen’s voice could be heard from behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…the story you told me was real?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen’s voice was trembling. &nbsp;When Azell told the truth in the beginning, Kairen had cut him off thinking it was a fabricated story. &nbsp;However, as he spent more time with Azell on the travel, he &nbsp;wondered if the story was true or not. &nbsp;He mused over the idea even as he mocked himself for it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That topic might lead to an animated conversation, and we aren’t in a position to do so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…ha ha ha. &nbsp;Let’s push it off to a later time. &nbsp;You better be prepared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You were the one that didn’t believe me when I told you the truth. &nbsp;You shouldn’t be saying that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell snorted as he looked back at Reygus. &nbsp;Kairen and Leticia knew very well what they should be doing with the time bought by Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Reyugus knew it too. &nbsp;However, it didn’t attack immediately. &nbsp;The deep emotions it felt after meeting Azell again was too large.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It seems you’ve suffered under a similar predicament as I.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is so for those that live a life that others have a hard time accepting as reality. &nbsp;It is something that can’t be experienced except by the first generation Dragon Demons, who’s far removed from reality.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;That is true. &nbsp;So what are &nbsp;you doing here?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you really think I’ll tell you that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;No. &nbsp;I’m sure it is a plan to screw us over. &nbsp;However, I’m really surprised. &nbsp;What method did that brat, Carlos, use to keep you alive until now? &nbsp;He’s already done enough by killing my friends, yet he…..…….&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard you asked about Carlos’ whereabouts. &nbsp;Why did you ask such a question? &nbsp;Is it impossible to think logically now that you don’t have a brain? &nbsp;Ah, of course, you barely thought logically even when you still had your brain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Ha ha ha. &nbsp;You are quite lame, Azell. &nbsp;You are alive and kicking, so why should I believe he is dead? You hid yourself like a mouse, while moving around…...&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;Let me correct you on that. &nbsp;I didn’t hide my identity. &nbsp;Didn’t you say so yourself? &nbsp;I hinted at my identity a lot when I fought Niberis. &nbsp;If I planned on hiding my identity, why would I do that? &nbsp;Your guys must be poorly educated. &nbsp;They didn’t recognize me at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;By the look of it, your comrades didn’t recognize you either.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sadly, you are right. &nbsp;It is a tough world where people won’t believe you when you tell the truth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell burst out laughing. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s true identity was too incongruous with reality. &nbsp;It was a truth that couldn’t be confirmed unless someone from Azell’s era could corroborate it. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell always knew this day was coming. &nbsp;There were survivors of the Dragon Demon war inside the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;There would come a day when they would take matters into their own hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However….. &nbsp;He never expected Reygus to show up as an Undead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if you are an Undead, aren’t you too high up in the food chain to come here yourself? &nbsp;You left the kids behind to come out yourself. &nbsp;It seems you aren’t being treated well there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;No way. &nbsp;Everyone treats me like an old man, who should stay cooped up in the backroom…. &nbsp;Well, you know my personality. &nbsp;It won’t change just because I’m dead.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It doesn’t look like that from my point of view. &nbsp;If not, they would have sent couple more of the higher ranked….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Even Dragon Demons and Dragon Majins can’t win against time. &nbsp;You are only a human, yet you remained the same over this long period of time. &nbsp;It seems you didn’t feel it, but…. &nbsp;Ah. &nbsp;I shouldn’t blather on like this. &nbsp;Jeez.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ho-oh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s eyes shone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was obvious if one thought about it. &nbsp;Two hundred twenty years had passed since the Dragon Demon war. &nbsp;The survivors from that time were all old and weakened now. &nbsp;It meant that there weren’t that many that was young enough to fight in battles themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, the structure of the organization was also a problem. &nbsp;During the Dragon Demon war, as one’s power increased in the Dragon Demon army, one was given more missions. &nbsp;Those in high places couldn’t back out from fights based on their position. &nbsp;They couldn’t when Dragon Demon king Atein and the four Dragon Demon generals fought in the frontlines as an example.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, the Plain of Darkness was a secret organization that hid from the eyes of the world. &nbsp;They schemed from behind the curtain. &nbsp;It was a society formed through fanaticism where the Demon King Atein was deified. &nbsp;There was a strict hierarchy within this organization. &nbsp;The humans were the lowest class, and even the Dragon Majins and Dragon Demons were stratified by bloodlines.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In such an organization, those with power gave orders. &nbsp;They didn’t carry out their own objectives. &nbsp;Basically, they created a system where they cultivated and deployed fighters. &nbsp;They merely maintained and serviced the machinery they created. &nbsp;They didn’t directly enter into a fight..</span></p>
 <p><span style>If so, how could they have maintained their own personal battle prowess after 200 years of doing this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I learned a very important information.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>From what he learned from Laura, the upper crust of the Plain of Darkness rarely moved. &nbsp;If those in high positions still had comparable power they possessed during the Dragon Demon war, they wouldn’t be making their descendants do the work. &nbsp;They wouldn’t pass on the weapons of the Dragon Demon generals to their descendants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I can hear the gear inside your head turn. &nbsp;Shit. &nbsp;It seems I said something I shouldn’t have.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whether it’s the past or now, you haven’t changed. &nbsp;Well, I guess it is fortunate for you that Baldazark and Aunsaurus are no longer here. &nbsp;They would have gotten angry at you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the Dragon Demon war, Reygus hadn’t thought much. &nbsp;He was the type of being that acted on his emotions. When he found a powerful enemy, he ignored his allies and the battle plan. &nbsp;His eyes would twinkle as he charged into a battle they had almost won. &nbsp;He &nbsp;tried to bait his opponents into using their hidden card…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He is the same as before. &nbsp;It seems this bastard’s idiocy was baked into his bones.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus was a being that had lived over a thousand years, yet it was quite immature. &nbsp;In some ways, one could describe Reygus as a pure martial artist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus laughed at those word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Koo-koo-koohnk. &nbsp;You are a brat, yet you treat your elder as if he’s a kid. &nbsp;Well, all right. &nbsp;How about….&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus spoke cheerfully as it raised its hammer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Let us stop our friendly banter here…. &nbsp;&nbsp;Shall I check out your prowess?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus charged before Azell could get into his stance. Kairen was standing off to the side, and he was barely able to keep up with its speed with his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen’s eyes were belatedly seeing the afterimages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He saw a surprising sight. &nbsp;Reygus had delivered a surprise attack, but Azell was already behind it. &nbsp;He was able to get in one blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Koo-uhk!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s single strike did plenty of damage to Reygus. &nbsp;Reygus righted itself before it almost fell over, and it swung its hammer. &nbsp;Azell didn’t dodge it. &nbsp;He deflected it head on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…that’s what Reygus thought he was attempting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the sword made contact with the hammer, there was a little bit of resistance before the sword turned into light. &nbsp;Azell aimed the Dragon Maken, which was rippling with thunder, towards Reygus from the back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gwah-gwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus’ huge body rose into the air. &nbsp;The dispersing thunderbolt coalesced at a single point, and it turned into the blue Dragon Maken. &nbsp;He gripped the sword, then six of him appeared. &nbsp;In a flash, they attacked Reygus again with a slight delay on each attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Kah-ahhhk!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus let out a scream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was barely able to repel the first attack, but another Azell appeared as if he had been waiting for this moment. &nbsp;Azell lifted Reygus into the air with his attack. &nbsp;Before its defense could harden again, Azell let out additional attacks. &nbsp;Where Reygus was flung away, another Azell was waiting for it…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>A combination of seven attacks sent Reygus rocketing into the air. &nbsp;The last Azell brought down the Dragon Maken surrounded with thunder as if he had been waiting for this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Thunder Dragon’s Horn!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lightning erupted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a flash, a lightning that looked as if it would rip apart the heavens exploded forth. &nbsp;The terrifying wave of Dragon Demon magic shook the earth, and after a heartbeat, an enormous cloud of dust rose into the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It all happened in a flash, so everyone thought Reygus had been killed. This was how terrifying Azell’s attack was, and it etched a deep impression on everyone. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;D...amn...it all….! &nbsp;Ooh-ahhhhhh!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, a shout of anger arose from inside the cloud of dust. &nbsp;The sound rang out as it dispersed the dusts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afterwards, Azell and Reygus clashed. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-jee-jee-jee-jeek!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The magical energy of thunder and the magical energy of pulverization clashed against each other as it started to raise the temperature of the air around them. &nbsp;Reygus gritted its teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You bastard! &nbsp;When did the Heaven Splitter develop such a ability?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How long ago was that? &nbsp;It seems your death has stopped your progress. &nbsp;No, you've actually become weaker. &nbsp;It is to be expected, since you’ve lost your Dragon Demon magic!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus had died before it was able to see the final battle that had occured at the Dragon’s Horn Fortress. &nbsp;This was why it didn’t know about Azell’s peak abilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, magical energy was overflowing from his Energy Pulse. &nbsp;It was swirling with terrifying force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The vessel to hold his magical energy was still incomplete, but the amount of magical energy he could produce for a short amount of time was comparable to the level he displayed in his prime.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ba-dump! &nbsp;Ba-dump! &nbsp;Ba-dump!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Magical energy erupted like hail when his heart pulsed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, there were seven Rings of Life around his heart. &nbsp;If one went by the normal standards, he was a Septuple master. &nbsp;Amongst all of them, six had gone through Dual Banding. &nbsp;The magical energy created through the resonance transcended common sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is a suitable opponent to test out my new answer!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, Laura had said Atein would be revived to the form he possessed at the time of his death. &nbsp;Azell came to the conclusion that there was no way he would be able to win against Atein.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it didn’t matter if it was the past or present. &nbsp;He didn’t despair or give up. &nbsp;He thought hard on finding answers to his problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dual Banding was one of the few ways he would be able to exceed his past self. &nbsp;It was still incomplete, but if he was able to complete his 7th Ring of Life, he would boast enough magical energy that would exceed the magical energy of his prime!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, Reygus! &nbsp;You are a mere ghost from the past! &nbsp;You should become the sacrificial offering to the technique I developed!” </span></p>
