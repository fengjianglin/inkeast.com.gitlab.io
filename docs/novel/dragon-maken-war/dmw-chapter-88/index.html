 <p>Chapter 88 - Birth of the Dragon Sword (3)</p>
 <p><span style>4</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the new sun came up, Arrieta left the capital with her brother to travel a long road. &nbsp;It had been a while, since she had done this. &nbsp;Moreover, there were over 200 escorts accompanying them on the road.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta let out a sigh inside the carriage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder if our teacher will become infuriated at us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, Arrieta and Seigar was headed towards the Dukedom of Tarantos for a vacation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their mother, the Dragon Demon Queen, strongly insisted on them taking a break. &nbsp;It was decided that they would take half a year of rest from the work required by them as members of the royal family. &nbsp;Originally, the throne would have never consented to such a plan, but the Dragon Demon king worshippers had tried to kidnap both of them. &nbsp;Since they were in personal danger, the throne decided to allow it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, it was called a vacation on the surface. &nbsp;However, the real purpose of this break was for them to be retrained by Kairen. &nbsp;It wasn't just Seigar. &nbsp;Arrieta also felt the need to get stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar had a bitter smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher will come to realize this wasn't your idea.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were currently being escorted by 200 people, because the throne was worried the Dragon Demon king worshippers would try to kidnap them again. &nbsp;The throne put a stipulation that they couldn't refuse this escort, so Arrieta brought the several personal subordinates she under her command. &nbsp;Seigar brought a large portion of the men enlisted under his banner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I hope so. It isn't as if we can send everyone back after arriving there... &nbsp;Well, you can talk to him nicely about it, Seigar.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? &nbsp;You are going to push that task off to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I only brought 15 subordinates. &nbsp;Isn't the rest of the group under your command? &nbsp;If one of us has to be struck by teacher's severe reprimand, I still think you should be the one taking the brunt of it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta was still in the progress of assembling her own unit that would be directly under her command. &nbsp;The Dragon Demon Queen and Seigar had gathered some useful people for her, but the number was still too low. &nbsp;Moreover....</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Moreover, you brought selected members from your unit, so they can learn from the Duke Tarantos. &nbsp;However, you are trying to obfuscate this fact... &nbsp;Do you think our teacher won't see through your plans? &nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think he'll just go along without making a note of it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm. &nbsp;Well... &nbsp;I guess I have no choice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar scratched his cheek.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as she surmised. &nbsp;Since Seigar was going for a prolonged stay, he was looking for an opportunity to ask for some tutelage from Kairen for his men. &nbsp;He would also ask a joint training session with the knights of Tarantos. &nbsp;He was always trying to find a way to increase the power of his troops. &nbsp;This was why he chose suitable members for this trip with that purpose in mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now that I think about it… &nbsp;He might still be there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm talking about sir Azell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah ah. He's probably there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the midway point of this trip, Seigar had sent a message to update their progress. &nbsp;He indirectly heard about what was going on at the dukedom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“From what I heard, it seems our teacher is deeply immersed in sparring with Azell. &nbsp;It is to the point where he is ignoring all his other works.... &nbsp;Mmmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta spoke when she saw a perplexed expression on her brother's face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems you can't accept it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I'm being honest, I can't.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think there is sufficient information going for him. &nbsp;From what I heard from our teacher, Azell made significant contributions to your rescue....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard about it, but I didn’t witness it. &nbsp;Moreover, there's no other eyewitnesses except our teacher.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen had said Azell had won a one-on-one battle with a Dragon. &nbsp;Even if he worshipped the ground walked on by his teacher, he was having a hard time taking his teacher at his word. &nbsp;If one of his subordinates that was with him saw it, then maybe....</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is no way a human would be able to pull that off. &nbsp;Moreover, he is young...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There was a time when I thought similar thoughts as you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar raised his head at Arrieta's words. &nbsp;She spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However… &nbsp;I changed my opinion when I saw sir Azell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If he is still with our teacher, you'll be able to see his skills. &nbsp;It actually might be a good experience for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta smiled as she looked at her conflicted brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was happy at the thought of seeing Azell again. &nbsp;It had been over half a year, since she had seen him. &nbsp;How much had he changed?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Arrieta and Segiar arrived, they wanted to immediately meet with Kairen to extend their greetings. &nbsp;However, the house steward Havanz told them Kairen was absent at the moment. &nbsp;He wanted them to wait. &nbsp;When they asked the reason behind it, Havanz awkwardly gave them an answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That's… &nbsp;Sir Azell is our guest, and the duke went out to spar with him. &nbsp;They still haven't returned. &nbsp;I told the duke to come back early since the two of you were arriving today....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At those words, Arrieta and Seigar asked Havanz to assign lodging to their party. &nbsp;Then they were lead by a servant to the back mountain where Kairen and Azell was present. &nbsp;They found Kairen and Azell at a frozen lake....</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are they atop the water?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar's eyes turned round.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell and Kairen was running atop the lake as they exchanged sword blows. &nbsp;It was winter, but they weren't running a frozen lake. &nbsp;The ice had been broken, and the two of them were fighting atop the rolling waters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surprising part was the fact that the fight continued to be fought atop from the water from the time they discovered the two from afar to the time they got close.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta was astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That's incredible. &nbsp;They aren't using repulsive power to impact against the water. &nbsp;They are actually walking on water.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar became surprised at her words, and he looked at the feet of the two men.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was running and fighting atop a body of water, it was something Seigar could do. &nbsp;However, his method was done through pressurizing and detonating pockets of air with his Dragon Demon Qi. &nbsp;It wasn't truly walking on top of water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he looked closely at Azell and Kairen, they were stepping on water as if it was solid ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At times, they came to a stop, and they rocked back and forth with the surface of the water. &nbsp;They walked, skidded and ran across the water as they clashed. &nbsp;The act looked so natural that it looked unreal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chwahhhhhh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two were running in a circle as they clashed, and it sent up a spray of water. &nbsp;At the same time, Kairen's body dipped below the surface of the water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other side, Azell just slid back about two steps. &nbsp;Kairen realized what had happened, so he surged up to the surface of the water. &nbsp;Then they started up exchanging sword blows again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kah-ahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rebound caused Kairen's body to descend below the surface of the water. &nbsp;The water that was displaced for their clash returned to its original location, and his body was pushed under water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had a carefree attitude as he rained down sword strikes from above.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Poo-uhk! &nbsp;You really are going to go there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen had swallowed some water, so he coughed. &nbsp;Azell responded to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You ambushed me earlier before when the match hadn't started &nbsp;yet. &nbsp;I was dunked into the water. &nbsp;I don't think you have the right to say that....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That was that and this is... &nbsp;Poo-uhp! &nbsp;Uh-pooh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Kairen couldn't exit the water, so he was pushed under water. &nbsp;Azell let out a laugh as he thoroughly enjoyed what was going on. &nbsp;He retreated backwards. &nbsp;In the next moment, the surface of the water exploded, and a rough spray of water rose into the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chwah-chwah-chwah-chwahh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen exited the water, and he looked like a drowned rat. &nbsp;One could see his teeth chattering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit! &nbsp;It is cold enough to make me gnash my teeth!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course. &nbsp;It's winter now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was a normal person, one would have to be worried for that person’s life. &nbsp;Kairen raised his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you saying you want to avoid a match on a wet field?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn't anything like that. &nbsp;I'll spar you no matter where it is. &nbsp;However, we should end this here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you saying! &nbsp;We are far from done!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guests have arrived. &nbsp;Wouldn't it be unbecoming to show such a disgraceful behavior in front of your students?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell pointed towards the shore of the lake where Arrieta and Seigar was standing. &nbsp;Kairen furrowed his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It's already that time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I told you earlier that I was hungry, so we should head back and eat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don't remember hearing that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow. &nbsp;You are getting more thick skinned as time passes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen snorted at Azell's idle remarks. &nbsp;He started walking towards the shore of the lake. &nbsp;It was as if he was walking on solid ground, but he was walking on water. &nbsp;As he walked, heat emanated from his body, and the water on his body evaporated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything he did looked very natural. &nbsp;Kairen was learning techniques from Azell, and he was getting stronger each day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he arrived at the shore, he laughed as he looked at his two students.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It's been awhile. &nbsp;I am glad you guys came.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>5</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It hadn't even been a year since I last saw you....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta had a mystified light in her eyes as she spoke to Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are like a completely different person. &nbsp;How were you able to do such a feat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I ate good meals, and I was able to get sufficient rest. &nbsp;Moreover, once you combine those factors with a great view, this is possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell grinned. &nbsp;Arietta had a sudden fit of laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you for teaching me such an incredible secret. &nbsp;Anyways, it is good to see you again, sir Azell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel the same way, princess.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enora also spoke a lot about you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When did I do that princess?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When you heard Sir Azell was here, you agonized over whether you should send a letter or not?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected of a maid to the royal family, Enora had been standing with impeccable posture. &nbsp;Her face turned red. &nbsp;Azell laughed..</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow. &nbsp;I can't believe Ms. Enora did that. &nbsp;It is an honor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You've grown more ill-natured during the time we haven't seen you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think I was infected by the duke's personality. &nbsp;I wasn't usually like this....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please come up with a more believable excuse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enora harrumphed as she turned her gaze away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maybe, it was because she was at an age where she was still growing, but she had grown a lot in the past 7 months. &nbsp;She looked to be a little bit taller, and there was a feeling of maturity around her. &nbsp;Still, she looked like a young girl to Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke to the man sitting next to Arrieta.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems the life of being a personal knight to the princess suits you, sir Giles. &nbsp;You look more open now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so? &nbsp;My current work is clearly better than what I did at the western border.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles had also changed a lot. &nbsp;His face hadn't changed, but he looked more stylish than before. &nbsp;Moreover, he had a dignified air around him. His clothes reflected the position of being the princess' personal knight. &nbsp;Currently, he was wearing a formal outfit. &nbsp;He gave off a completely impression now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How's sir Boar doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is actually doing quite well right now. &nbsp;I've received a lot of help from him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boar's attitude in how he treated others had changed drastically, and the opinion of him had improved. &nbsp;His family already had a lot of power, but his conduct went a long way in strengthening his family's power. &nbsp;Giles received a lot of benefit from his acquaintance with Boar. &nbsp;Of course, Giles had gone from a soldier dispatched at the border to being a royal knight. &nbsp;If it wasn't for Boar, Giles would have had a very hard time getting used to his current life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, it wasn't as if the help was one-sided. &nbsp;Giles had been taught Spirit Order techniques from Azell, and he had passed it on to Boar. &nbsp;Whenever they had time, the two of them met up to refine their techniques, and they trained to increase their internal energy. &nbsp;Giles had been a big help to Boar in those terms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke after hearing everyone's story.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“By the way, you guys brought 200 people? &nbsp;That is a lot of people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It couldn't be helped. &nbsp;The throne wouldn't have allowed us to come here if we didn't take a force of that size. &nbsp;Of course, Seigar jumped on this opportunity to bring his people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen was belatedly informed of the situation, so Seigar was getting an earful from Kairen right now. &nbsp;If everything was done as it should have been done, the escort would have returned to the capital after a brief stay. &nbsp;However, Segiar had insisted on bring his own people. &nbsp;Now the Dukedom of Tarantos had to be in charge of taking care &nbsp;of 200 people, who would be here for an extended stay.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
