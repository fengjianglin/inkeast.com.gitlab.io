 <p>Chapter 141 - Second Coming of a Legend (4)</p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph. &nbsp;That’s right, Laura. &nbsp;You were right. &nbsp;I did come here too early.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was stubborn as a mule, so he left behind the Shadow’s Sword Belt to fight one on one with Laura. &nbsp;However, he couldn’t hold a candle to her. &nbsp;This truth greatly wounded his pride.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, that is all there is to it. &nbsp;You merely had more time to learn more magic than me! If those old bags weren’t so picky about passing on their techniques, I would have needed a little bit more time. &nbsp;I wouldn’t have lost to you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dikal, I….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Laura raised her hands, and she placed them on her neck. &nbsp;She let out a forlorn laughter as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…this is the first time I felt sorry for someone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are a pitiful person. &nbsp;More so than my previous self….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, Laura had been a puppet of the Aunsaurus family. &nbsp;She lived to bring about the result desired by them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal was similar to her in that fashion. &nbsp;However, there was a big difference between Dikal and her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal based his own self worth on their judgement, and he accepted that fact as a given.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was subjected to what amounted to a curse, yet he still thirsted for their approval. &nbsp;He cursed them with his mouth, but he would do anything to hear their praises. &nbsp;He had no idea what else to base his own self worth on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can see why I hated myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she first met him, Laura considered his hatred to be a given. &nbsp;His life had been stolen away by her. &nbsp;Of course, he would hate her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, as she listened to Dikal’s words, she realized there was something more to this. &nbsp;The real reason why Dikal hated Laura was…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I threw away what you clung to as if it was trash.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What nonsense……!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think I can understand what you are feeling. &nbsp;Still, I will assert it once again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A red air current started emanating from the tip of her fingers, which she had placed on her throat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They are trash. &nbsp;They are trash that should have been eradicated a long time ago, yet they act as they please by stepping on our lives.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’d rather die than be caught within their hands.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal flinched. &nbsp;He had been focusing on her words, so he was a beat late in realizing what was going on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit! &nbsp;Stop her!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura was trying to commit suicide. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She would rather die here than be caught by them. &nbsp;However, it wouldn’t be enough just to take her own life. &nbsp;They had the power to call back the souls of the dead. &nbsp;This was why she had to terminate herself in no uncertain terms. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I want to live.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wanted to live a bit longer. &nbsp;She had so much more she wanted to see.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I finally found out who you really are.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Azell’s face appeared within her thoughts. &nbsp;She had always wondered about it, but he really was the hero Azell Karzark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When it was in regards to him, everything was on the table. &nbsp;When she found out the truth, she laughed even in the midst of danger. &nbsp;She didn’t feel any surprise. &nbsp;It simply cleared up the pressure she felt inside her chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If I die here, will you mourn for me?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Up until now, she had no one that would have shed a tear for her if she died. &nbsp;She hadn’t lived her life worrying about such things. &nbsp;However, while she travelled with Azell’s party using the excuse of being a prisoner, she developed lingering attachments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘At the very least, they won’t get angry, because a tool had become unusable. &nbsp;They would view it as my death, simple as that.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura was baffled by her thoughts, so she laughed. &nbsp;Dikal and the Shadow’s Sword Belt looked at her as if she had gone mad. &nbsp;She had put a defensive magic around here, so they had to watch as she completed the cursed power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-You give up too quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a voice flowed into her consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Why don’t you put a little bit more faith in your comrades?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The magic spells that had been pouring out towards her was rapidly dissipating. &nbsp;Moreover….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A pure white light that looked like white fire and lighting ran across the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the Sky Splitter. &nbsp;While Laura was distracted, three members of the Shadow’s Sword Belt was cut down from the surprise attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time as the magic and thunder detonated, her surrounding became distorted as if it was a hot day in spring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Vitan’s Maze!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura immediately recognized the identity of the phenomena.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She quickly canceled the power of the curse as if she was putting out a fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah-oohk…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was able to cancel it, but it was a magic where even her corpse would have been destroyed. &nbsp;She hadn’t wanted to hand over anything to her enemies. &nbsp;This was why the backlash was fierce. &nbsp;Black smoke emanated from her entire body, and she felt her insides churn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She suddenly spoke in a sullen manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…I’m only a prisoner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You were until now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell suddenly appeared next to her. &nbsp;Azell smirked as he gave his answer. &nbsp;Azell spoke as he tapped her once with his finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s stop doing this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The magical shunt placed with Laura’s Energy Pulse was removed. &nbsp;Laura looked at Azell with rabbit eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really do whatever you want.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone told me the same thing around 220 years ago. &nbsp;It seems the era may change, but people do not.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But my body and mind is still that of a 28 year old. &nbsp;There’s no reason why I should hear such words from a Dragon Majin lady who is older than me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are shameless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I hear that a lot too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell replied in a sly manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Anyways, you should take care of your body from within this place. &nbsp;I’ll take care of the rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t know if his enemies had techniques that could penetrate the Vitan’s Maze. &nbsp;Even if they did have such a technique they would be too busy fighting Azell to use it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Laura grabbed Azell before he could exit the Vitan’s Maze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll take care of Dikal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“With that body? &nbsp;I know you have some kind of history with him, but if you fight in such a state….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can do it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura’s attitude was so firm that Azell just watched her for a moment. &nbsp;He turned his head away as he let out a bitter laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whether it’s the present or the past, I’m unable to stop anyone who’s willing to risk their lives on a task. &nbsp;A lot of people cursed me for it…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He continued to speak as he canceled the Vitan’s Maze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems I’ll be the one cursing you out. &nbsp;If your bravado gets you killed, I’ll curse at you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…this is the first time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the first time I’ve heard such words.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have too many firsts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he spoke those words, Azell’s sword turned into burning thunder as it sped along the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>5</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This makes no sense.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal was in a state of panic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he found out Azell was really the Azell Karzark, he was shaken up for only a brief moment. &nbsp;At that moment, the capture of Laura had been more important in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had been tenacious in his hunt, and at last, his goal had been right in front of his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this had occurred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The flash of light was actively moving across the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Normally, magicians were adept at fighting in the air. &nbsp;Spirit Order practitioners &nbsp;and Dragon Arts practitioners were able to stay in the air for a limited amount of time. &nbsp;Even if that problem was solved, they had no way of propelling themselves through the air. &nbsp;This was why it was hard to fight a magician in aerial combat. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Azell ruthlessly broke such common sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-jee-jee-jeeek!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The light was moving in every direction, and it cut through one of the Shadow’s Sword Belt. &nbsp;For a brief moment, Azell could be seen, so another member of the Shadow’s Sword Belt sent a flame towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was useless. &nbsp;Spatial Distortion appeared in front of him, and the flame was sent right back to the user.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the attacker paused to block the flame, another Azell appeared from behind to cut him in half.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oooh ooh ooh……!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal was terrified. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sword Splitter and the Vitan’s Chalice was creating a synergistic effect. &nbsp;The attacks were beyond one’s imagination. &nbsp;The sword wasn’t constrained by space, yet now the additional effect of dimensional manipulation was added on to it. &nbsp;The combination of the two was a calamity that no one could stop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, the Shadow’s Sword Belt hadn’t studied the available information in regards to Azell. &nbsp;From the onset, they had used lighting and light magic without thinking much about it. &nbsp;They had pretty much sealed their own death. &nbsp;The Sky Splitter absorbed it all as all six members were burnt to a crisp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dikal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Light and the roar of thunder filled the battlefield. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, a low voice could be heard clearly within Dikal’s ears. &nbsp;He turned to look at the owner of the voice in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The thoroughly injured Laura was standing there glaring at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s end this. &nbsp;This is between the two of us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal laughed as he couldn’t believe what he had just heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you out of your mind? &nbsp;Now that you’ve jumped on the back of Azell Karzark, it seems you’ve gone mad. &nbsp;You want to fight me one on one in that state?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph. &nbsp;Do you think I’ll fall for such a trap? &nbsp;You will probably act like you are fighting me, and Azell Karzark would use the opportunity to hit me from behind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At his words, Laura tilted her head in puzzlement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you really think you are worth doing such a maneuver?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…what did you just say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it wasn’t for my request, you would already be dead. &nbsp;I extracted a promise from him. &nbsp;If you win against me in a one on one battle against me, he’ll let you leave the battlefield alive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura had been adamant about this point. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he realized she was serious, Dikal grinded her teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How long are you going to ignore me like this, Laura!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is what I want to say to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura attacked first. &nbsp;When Dikal received her attacked, something incomprehensible occurred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-jee-jee-jeek!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuh-uhk?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He possessed six swords that had a curse placed on each of them. &nbsp;Each curse was flowing backwards now. &nbsp;His eyesight started to darken as openings appeared within his formation of magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ggwah-gwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>An explosion detonated from within his barrier. &nbsp;He was sent flying. &nbsp;Dikal was barely able to right himself as he plummeted to the floor, and he started using his magic indiscriminately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-ahhhhhhhhhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike Laura who was dying, he had plenty of magical energy. &nbsp;Laura was superior to him in terms of using magic, but he decided she wouldn’t be able to cut through the hail of magic spells.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, as if to break Dikal’s prediction, he heard Laura’s cold voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t even know why you are losing…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was pity in her voice. &nbsp;Dikal became angry, so he tried to send the magic swords towards her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-ahhhhhhhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if it had been waiting for him to try that move, the curses flowed backwards again. It felt as if the pain was frying every single nerve inside his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal finally realized what she had done.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’ve lost ownership of the magic swords!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he was to be precise, he hadn’t lost complete ownership of the magic swords. &nbsp;However, the part of the magic that allowed one to move the magic swords was in her control.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hoo-oooooooooooh…….</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Dikal was barely able to dispel the curse, Laura’s condition was rapidly improving. &nbsp;Her physical state wasn’t getting better, but she had taken control of the magical energy expended in vain by Dikal. &nbsp;She was absorbing it to recover her magical energy. &nbsp;She was displaying an appalling amount of refinement in her control over her magical energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the end, Dikal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How laughable! &nbsp;You’ve created some confusion using my magical tools, yet you act as if the fight is over! &nbsp;You’ve required only a modicum of magical energy. &nbsp;It won’t be enough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal unleashed his magical energy in anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I only have the use of defensive magic and magic amplification of the magic swords. &nbsp;I’ll have to use the two functions to end this. &nbsp;I have to overwhelm her with my magical energy. &nbsp;Even if she is better than me at using skills, the difference in the quantity of magical energy available to me is absolute. &nbsp;I’ll crush her with my firepower!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>His judgement was correct. &nbsp;Laura’s magical energy was almost depleted. &nbsp;He could use several dozen spells, while his opponent could use only one or two spells. &nbsp;The result was preordained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, he pushed back against Laura’s control with pure power. &nbsp;He used all of his magic at once. &nbsp;A vortex formed on the ground. &nbsp;A storm of lightning raged, and flame exploded forth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are the one that will meet your end here, Laura!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He shouted out those words as he felt enraptured. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is as I’ve said. &nbsp;This is the end.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura answered in a low voice. &nbsp;The sound cut through the noise of the explosion. &nbsp;It meant she had used her magic in a narrow scope to deliver her voice on purpose. &nbsp;Goosebumps arose all &nbsp;over his entire body. &nbsp;All the spells he sent towards Laura returned towards Dikal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwah-gwah-gwah-gwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kahhhh……!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Dikal’s scream was buried in the sound of the explosions. &nbsp;Dikal fell as fire and smoke surrounded his body. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura tracked him down. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, Laura stood in front of Dikal. &nbsp;It looked as if half of his body had been blown off, and he was gasping for breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a miracle that he was still alive. &nbsp;He asked in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How….?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Vitan’s Chalice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura answered him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve been researching it all this time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal was satisfied with the answer. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>No on inside the Plain of Darkness had been able to learn magic that dealt with space. &nbsp;However, Laura had used the Vitan’s Chalice. &nbsp;After much research and experiments, she was able to replicate some of the magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal laughed as if he was baffled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I...really…did come here…too soon…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They will perish too, so you can go rest now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha ha ha. &nbsp;As always…. &nbsp;You are really an unpleasant….woman…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying those words, Dikal’s life came to an end. &nbsp;Laura created fire to burn his corpse. &nbsp;She looked up at the brilliant and deadly light moving across the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Those words…. &nbsp;I’ve heard them way too much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she looked into the empty air, clear tears ran down from her eyes.</span></p>
