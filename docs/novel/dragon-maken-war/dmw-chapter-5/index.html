  <p></p>
  <hr>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>Giles spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I heard the approximate account from army doctor Rick. He said your memories are obscured….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes. It might seem like a lie, but I have no memories as to why I was there. I’m not even sure who I am…..”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Unlike Rick, Azell spoke respectfully towards Giles. He had heard from Rick that Giles was a noble that had received the title of knight. It was a situation where he couldn’t disseminate his identity, so he had to be polite towards the noble.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Truthfully, I have a hard to time believing it. However, the problem is every time I look at you the story becomes more likely.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>When Azell was found, his appearance was very grave. Even now he was still in somewhat of a critical state. The only way a human could have such an appearance and still be alive was for him to have been subjected to evil magical experimentation.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“At the very least, it doesn’t seem like you are a spy from a different country. I have decided to just let you go. However…..”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“However?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It isn’t a problem where I can make the decision. I’ll have to report to my Lieutenant and receive permission.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The matter was a bit too sensitive for him to make a decision instead of his lieutenant.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmm. Then let’s go meet the lieutenant right now and continue the story?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Unfortunately, it’s impossible right now.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Why?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“We came out of our fort to excavate the ruins. Moreover, the lieutenant returned to the fort to receive an important person. After couple days, he’ll return back here.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Then I have to wait until then?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Until you receive the lieutenant’s permission, you’ll have to stay in our camp without leaving it. I won’t imprison you, but it would be best if you don’t wander around. In your circumstance, this isn’t such a bad measure.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell wasn’t healthy enough to wander around freely. Therefore, Giles told him it would be best to wait here, while being under their protection.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell realized his consideration, so he nodded his head.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ll do that.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Then please go back. While you are standby, stay at the medical barracks.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I understand. Ah. By the way, may I ask you one question?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell asked as if he just thought it up, so Giles answered back.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Centurion Giles. You have 4 rings of life? At your age, you are already a Cord-Rope master and a knight of the army, so why are you a Centurion in the frontier?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>At his unexpected intelligence, Giles’ expression visibly hardened. At the same time, he emitted an offensive energy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“How did you know that?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>For those who train in the Spirit Order, one gets a title of ‘Master’ once the ring of life reaches 4. The offensive energy emitted by those who reached the level of master was enough to flatten a normal person.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Azell didn’t show any signs of shrinking back even after he received the energy. He just shrugged his shoulder and replied back.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I just asked about what I saw. I don’t understand how I can see it either.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Of course, this was a lie. Azell had reached a higher level as a practitioner of the Spirit Order in the past than Giles. Whether it was magical detection ability or the ability to discern the opponent’s fighting power, he was able to see through Giles’ strength at one glance.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He decided to ask an antagonistic question towards Giles, because he wanted to learn information about this time period. If one was a Cord-Rope master 220 years ago, the person would be acknowledged as someone with great power. However, will it be the same in this time period?</span></p>
  <p><span style>After glaring at Azell for a moment, Giles retracted his offensive energy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…what army doctor Rick said about you being a Spirit Order practitioner was true.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It’s true.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You don’t have any rings of life, or magical force but… I’ve had a vague sense that I can’t ignore you.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>It wasn’t as much as Azell, but Giles, who was a Cord-Rope master, was considerably adept at sensing other’s strength with his developed sense. The moment he saw Azell, he received a sensation that indicated he couldn’t be ignored.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Anyways, you don’t have to answer that question. You don’t have any reason to answer it.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It is a sensitive topic, so I apologize.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It’s fine. You can go now.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell nodded his head then he turned his body and he walked out of Gile’s barrack.</span></p>
  <p><span style>6</span></p>
  <p><span style>At the Balan forest’s ruin excavation site, the chef in charge of the meals was looking at an unbelievable sight.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was caused by the transformation of one person. When he saw the person accompanying army doctor Rick Boran for the first time, he was surprised. The person was so skinny that he looked like a walking corpse.</span></p>
  <p><span style>While looking like that, the person ate an enormous amount of food, so the chef was astonished. He had eaten about 5 servings of food and 2 liters of water . The army was overflowing with men with robust appetites, but it was a whole different level trying to eat like this skinny corpse-like man.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, the truly baffling part was his transformation.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He came to the kitchen to eat both lunch and dinner.</span></p>
  <p><span style>When he showed up for dinner, there was a suspicion as to the fact that he was the same person who showed up earlier for lunch. No matter how he saw it he was suspicious, but his superficial characteristics were certainly same as before. For example, he still had long red hair, and blue eyes. But the skinny corpse-like person had suddenly gained weight so how were they they suppose to interpret this? How can a human change so much in just couple hours?</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Maybe it’s magic?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>He could only consider this thought as his customer, Azell Zestringer, went through an extreme change.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ah, is it because I was starving? Everything tastes like honey. But the seasoning is a bit strong.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You really eat well. Are you sure you are ok?””</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick was sitting across him and he was shocked by the change.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He was almost unrecognizable. His weight had increased suddenly, so he looked more like a human.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Truthfully, Rick spent a full minute trying to dissuade Azell from eating more than 1 serving. Even after seeing him being ok after eating one serving, Rick still decided that he shouldn’t eat more. However, Azell was stubborn and he ate 3 servings, which frightened Rick. Soon he rapidly recovered his human appearance.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Now he was continuously eating dinner, while he was receiving everyone’s stares.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m fine. I’m eating this much because my body requires it. To tell you the truth, I have to eat more, but I don’t want to suddenly abuse the stomach and be sick. So I’m eating in moderation.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘This is eating in moderation?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick was loss for words. Azell was already cleaning up his 6th serving. Moreover, he drank at least 3 liters of water.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If you drink that much water then wouldn’t you develop a stomach ache?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Usually.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Then why are you drinking so much?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I am eating a large amount of food, so I have to drink enough water to digest it, and I need to rehydrate my body. Rick, do you know that most of the body is composed of water? My body was extremely weakened, so I have to eat and drink a lot to return to my normal state. ”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…you seem to make sense for a moment, but the truth is you are talking nonsense. Even a healthy person cannot eat that much and be fine. You are in a weakened state. If you eat and drink this way then you could die….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m fine. Am I not ok?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Ah, is that right? The corner of Rick’s mouth twitched. He wanted to say a word as a healing expert with an education from the Medical Association, but he was overwhelmed after seeing Azell’s absurd change.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Be that as it may, isn’t your rapid change absurd? After eating a lot, you just slept for couple hours?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Doesn’t it make sense if you considering the weakened stated I was in? Also, each person has different rate of digestion?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“With all do respect, where in the world is a person with that kind of digestive ability? Are you a beast of endless starvation brought up from some demon world?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Eh-ee.(TLN: it’s a sound you make that signifies ‘whatever’) Originally, if a person who was weakened from starvation was fed well, then wouldn’t he be able to return to a human-like appearance in about four days? My situation is similar to that, but since I am eating more, the speed of the change is a bit different. ”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No matter how I think about it, it doesn’t make any sense….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ah, really. I’m fine.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Stop saying it doesn’t make sense to something that has already happened. It happened in reality so accept it and analyze it. If you deny everything that diverges from your logic, then how will you be able to deal with unexpected situations?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After saying this, Azell chewed on a seasoned vegetable. He had eaten all the food on top of his food tray, so he stood up with the tray.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Are you done eating?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No, I’m going to eat another serving. Six servings is a bit unlucky. I’ll have to eat 7 servings, since magicians favor that number.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mr. Chef is pretty skilled. It’s delicious.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Without caring if he was flabbergasted or not, Azell started complimenting the chef, while he was scooping up the food. One of the chef approached Rick and asked a question.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Who is that guy?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“We were told to treat him as Sir Giles’ guest. Weren’t you all informed of this?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I had heard about him…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“He must be a gluttonous monster captured by an evil magician. I’m sure of it.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Just leave it at that.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was walking towards them while humming, so Rick pushed the chef forward.</span></p>
  <p><span style>7</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Centurion of the Rulain kingdom’s western border guard, Giles Vince, was deeply interested in the mysterious man named Azell Zestringer. Aside from how they initially found him, he was able to see through Giles’ strength, which he was hiding, with one glance. He did this without having any rings of life, so his interest was inevitable.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘How did he do it?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>He had thought about it since he let Azell leave, but it was a question that he couldn’t solve.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He wasn’t able to enter into the famous knight squads for personal reasons, and he had to enter into the army. While he was assigned to these remote locations, there weren’t that many people who were able to recognize his true abilities. Most people assumed that he was a small fry who was promoted to Centurion based on his family’s power. They assumed this without even getting to know him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Even the knights in this place, who were hardened by fighting against monsters, thought the same thing. This goes to show how well Giles had hidden his true skill.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘What is he playing at?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>He didn’t believe a single word coming from Azell. The only thing that kept him from being suspicious was the state Azell was found in was too appalling, so he thought his story sounded believable.</span></p>

 <p><span style>“Then please go back. While you are standby, stay at the medical barracks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand. Ah. By the way, may I ask you one question?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell asked as if he just thought it up, so Giles answered back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Centurion Giles. You have 4 rings of life? At your age, you are already a Cord-Rope master and a knight of the army, so why are you a Centurion in the frontier?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At his unexpected intelligence, Giles’ expression visibly hardened. At the same time, he emitted an offensive energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did you know that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For those who train in the Spirit Order, one gets a title of ‘Master’ once the ring of life reaches 4. The offensive energy emitted by those who reached the level of master was enough to flatten a normal person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Azell didn’t show any signs of shrinking back even after he received the energy. He just shrugged his shoulder and replied back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just asked about what I saw. I don’t understand how I can see it either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, this was a lie. Azell had reached a higher level as a practitioner of the Spirit Order in the past than Giles. Whether it was magical detection ability or the ability to discern the opponent’s fighting power, he was able to see through Giles’ strength at one glance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He decided to ask an antagonistic question towards Giles, because he wanted to learn information about this time period. If one was a Cord-Rope master 220 years ago, the person would be acknowledged as someone with great power. However, will it be the same in this time period?</span></p>
 <p><span style>After glaring at Azell for a moment, Giles retracted his offensive energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…what army doctor Rick said about you being a Spirit Order practitioner was true.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s true.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t have any rings of life, or magical force but… I’ve had a vague sense that I can’t ignore you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t as much as Azell, but Giles, who was a Cord-Rope master, was considerably adept at sensing other’s strength with his developed sense. The moment he saw Azell, he received a sensation that indicated he couldn’t be ignored.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Anyways, you don’t have to answer that question. You don’t have any reason to answer it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is a sensitive topic, so I apologize.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s fine. You can go now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell nodded his head then he turned his body and he walked out of Gile’s barrack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>6</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the Balan forest’s ruin excavation site, the chef in charge of the meals was looking at an unbelievable sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was caused by the transformation of one person. When he saw the person accompanying army doctor Rick Boran for the first time, he was surprised. The person was so skinny that he looked like a walking corpse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While looking like that, the person ate an enormous amount of food, so the chef was astonished. He had eaten about 5 servings of food and 2 liters of water . The army was overflowing with men with robust appetites, but it was a whole different level trying to eat like this skinny corpse-like man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the truly baffling part was his transformation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He came to the kitchen to eat both lunch and dinner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he showed up for dinner, there was a suspicion as to the fact that he was the same person who showed up earlier for lunch. No matter how he saw it he was suspicious, but his superficial characteristics were certainly same as before. For example, he still had long red hair, and blue eyes. But the skinny corpse-like person had suddenly gained weight so how were they they suppose to interpret this? How can a human change so much in just couple hours?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Maybe it’s magic?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could only consider this thought as his customer, Azell Zestringer, went through an extreme change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, is it because I was starving? Everything tastes like honey. But the seasoning is a bit strong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really eat well. Are you sure you are ok?””</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick was sitting across him and he was shocked by the change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was almost unrecognizable. His weight had increased suddenly, so he looked more like a human.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Truthfully, Rick spent a full minute trying to dissuade Azell from eating more than 1 serving. Even after seeing him being ok after eating one serving, Rick still decided that he shouldn’t eat more. However, Azell was stubborn and he ate 3 servings, which frightened Rick. Soon he rapidly recovered his human appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now he was continuously eating dinner, while he was receiving everyone’s stares.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m fine. I’m eating this much because my body requires it. To tell you the truth, I have to eat more, but I don’t want to suddenly abuse the stomach and be sick. So I’m eating in moderation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is eating in moderation?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick was loss for words. Azell was already cleaning up his 6th serving. Moreover, he drank at least 3 liters of water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you drink that much water then wouldn’t you develop a stomach ache?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Usually.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then why are you drinking so much?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am eating a large amount of food, so I have to drink enough water to digest it, and I need to rehydrate my body. Rick, do you know that most of the body is composed of water? My body was extremely weakened, so I have to eat and drink a lot to return to my normal state. ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…you seem to make sense for a moment, but the truth is you are talking nonsense. Even a healthy person cannot eat that much and be fine. You are in a weakened state. If you eat and drink this way then you could die….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m fine. Am I not ok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ah, is that right? The corner of Rick’s mouth twitched. He wanted to say a word as a healing expert with an education from the Medical Association, but he was overwhelmed after seeing Azell’s absurd change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be that as it may, isn’t your rapid change absurd? After eating a lot, you just slept for couple hours?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Doesn’t it make sense if you considering the weakened stated I was in? Also, each person has different rate of digestion?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“With all do respect, where in the world is a person with that kind of digestive ability? Are you a beast of endless starvation brought up from some demon world?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh-ee.(TLN: it’s a sound you make that signifies ‘whatever’) Originally, if a person who was weakened from starvation was fed well, then wouldn’t he be able to return to a human-like appearance in about four days? My situation is similar to that, but since I am eating more, the speed of the change is a bit different. ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No matter how I think about it, it doesn’t make any sense….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, really. I’m fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop saying it doesn’t make sense to something that has already happened. It happened in reality so accept it and analyze it. If you deny everything that diverges from your logic, then how will you be able to deal with unexpected situations?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying this, Azell chewed on a seasoned vegetable. He had eaten all the food on top of his food tray, so he stood up with the tray.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you done eating?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I’m going to eat another serving. Six servings is a bit unlucky. I’ll have to eat 7 servings, since magicians favor that number.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Chef is pretty skilled. It’s delicious.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without caring if he was flabbergasted or not, Azell started complimenting the chef, while he was scooping up the food. One of the chef approached Rick and asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is that guy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We were told to treat him as Sir Giles’ guest. Weren’t you all informed of this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I had heard about him…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He must be a gluttonous monster captured by an evil magician. I’m sure of it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just leave it at that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was walking towards them while humming, so Rick pushed the chef forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>7</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Centurion of the Rulain kingdom’s western border guard, Giles Vince, was deeply interested in the mysterious man named Azell Zestringer. Aside from how they initially found him, he was able to see through Giles’ strength, which he was hiding, with one glance. He did this without having any rings of life, so his interest was inevitable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How did he do it?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had thought about it since he let Azell leave, but it was a question that he couldn’t solve.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t able to enter into the famous knight squads for personal reasons, and he had to enter into the army. While he was assigned to these remote locations, there weren’t that many people who were able to recognize his true abilities. Most people assumed that he was a small fry who was promoted to Centurion based on his family’s power. They assumed this without even getting to know him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the knights in this place, who were hardened by fighting against monsters, thought the same thing. This goes to show how well Giles had hidden his true skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is he playing at?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t believe a single word coming from Azell. The only thing that kept him from being suspicious was the state Azell was found in was too appalling, so he thought his story sounded believable.</span></p>
