 <p><span style>Chapter 66 - Those who Follow the Prophecy (5)</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I'm absolutely flabbergasted. &nbsp;What technique did you use? I believe you used the extension of the Astral Projection technique. &nbsp;Is it really possible to use it in this manner?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zeta walked out of the cloud of dust unharmed. Azell didn't answer him as he tried to regulate his breathing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Astral Projection.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a highly difficult training method used by a Spirit Order Practitioner, when one is in the process of training one's mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mind and the body was completely separated from each other. &nbsp;The body moved in such a state. Moreover, one had to imitate and conceptualize the various organs of the body. This was how one could still keep the sensation of being alive, while one was separated from one's body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This process was so hard that not many Spirit Order practitioners succeeded in achieving this state. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zeta was an Undead, yet he was able to use his Spirit Order. &nbsp;Zeta was also using an variation of this technique to achieve this result.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was also true for Azell's cloning technique 'Dance of the Shadow', which gave his clones substance. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was possible to imitate the sensation of being alive through the astral body. &nbsp;However, what Azell was doing was on a whole different level. &nbsp;The clones that had been completely separated from the body was able to physically influence the material world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zeta had been a high level Spirit Order Practioner in his previous life, and he had maintained his level of skill. &nbsp;However, the technique shown by Azell was inexplicable to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;If you won't answer me, then I'll have to find out the answer. However, there is something that doesn't make any sense. &nbsp;You have all these techniques, yet.....&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell didn't give Zeta the chance to finish his words. &nbsp;When he determined his breathing was under control, Azell used the Instantaneous Movement to rush forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Four of Azell's clone appeared near Zeta.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Accompanying the sound of an explosion, Zeta was sent flying. &nbsp;Each of them possessed detailed and clear presence that one couldn't tell which one was the real body. &nbsp;This was why Zeta chose to pierce three of them at the same time. He pierced one with his sword, and the other two with his Darkness magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the last remaining one had hit Zeta's body. &nbsp;Then the one that Zeta had thought he had defeated pierced through his Darkness Magic. &nbsp;The one he considered to be a clone struck out at Zeta.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to decide the victory right now!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Azell's heart started beating crazily as it poured out the magical energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even when he was mindlessly panting, he hadn't let even a second go to waste. &nbsp;The fact that his heart was racing meant he was vibrating his Rings of Life. &nbsp;When one's body craved oxygen, the painful moment could be used to extract a vast amount of magical energy. &nbsp;Currently, he was swirling with magical energy that was much higher in quantity than his body could contain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Star's Breath!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He created a white hot flame to eradicate the Undead. &nbsp;The flame followed the trajectory of his sword, and it exploded when it reached its target.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hahhhhhhhhk!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The storm of white flame lashed out. &nbsp;Azell had accelerated his sword past his limit. &nbsp;He pierced through Zeta's defense, and his sword energy showered down at Zeta.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Too-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how sturdy this bizarre armor was, there had to be a breaking point. &nbsp;If he could use his entire strength to break it....</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;How unfortunate.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>…Zeta had been taking a beat, yet a genuine sound of regret was heard in his voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hooooooooooohng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A blood-colored darkness exploded forth with Zeta at its center.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell's white fire was swept away in an instant. &nbsp;It was like a candle being snuffed out by a storm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a moment, Azell's movement stalled, and Zeta didn't miss taking advantage of this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;How can you possess such wondrous skills, yet.... &nbsp;How do you not have any power?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zeta's sword flew towards Azell. The Curse of Darkness had dug into his mind. &nbsp;He had stiffened as he tried to resist against the Curse of Darkness that had dug into his mind. &nbsp;It caused Azell to be a step slow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This small pause proved to be fatal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell hadn't taken a direct hit from Zeta's sword energy until now. There was too much &nbsp;of a difference in physical strength, and Zeta's sword was a Demonic Sword with powerful magic dwelling within it. Azell had received the attacks obliquely as he let the attacks slide off of his sword. &nbsp;This had protected his sword. &nbsp;However, he wasn't able to do so this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell's sword broke into pieces. &nbsp;Before Azell could do anything, Zeta hit Azell's body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Accompanying the sound of explosion, Azell was sent flying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Fuck……!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell's body hit the ground, and his body took a high bounce. His body lodged into a tree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he was a normal person, he would have died immediately from the impact. &nbsp;However, Azell had used Spirit Order in an instant to reduce the shock. &nbsp;It saved his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No…….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell forcefully grabbed onto his fading consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The situation he had been worried about had come true. &nbsp;If Azell and Kairen fought at full strength with the intent to kill each other, the result would be something similar to now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was fighting against Zeta, not Kairen. &nbsp;Still, his prediction had been on point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If one was an expert, one could deflect strong attacks through techniques. &nbsp;However, techniques wouldn't be able to hold back a flood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was short on power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If a three year old child developed the greatest technique in the world, the child wouldn't be able to beat a trained adult, who was fully armed. &nbsp;This was how vast the gulf was between Azell and Zeta.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was trying his damnedest to stand up when he heard the voice of a youth. &nbsp;It was Leone, who had been observing the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I have no idea.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…so what the hell was the point of all of this? We just bought unwanted enmity with this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;However, he is worth watching a little bit more.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmm. Is that so? Maybe, someone else should test him right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;We should give him more time.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, he does need time to recover from his wounds…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;No, we have to give him more time than that. &nbsp;Only then will he find out about his true worth.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have any evidence to supports this opinion?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;No. However, my feeling is telling me it is so.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmmm…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Even if someone else conducts another test right now, it would be difficult for us to get our confirmation.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, you are the one, who tested him. &nbsp;Since that is your opinion, we will do as you say.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Let's retreat for now. &nbsp;We've been out for too long.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait, you dirty bag of bones…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell glared at Zeta as he panted. &nbsp;Zeta returned his gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I'll give you a chance to avenge yourself next time. &nbsp;You should rest right now, test taker. &nbsp;You will have plenty of opportunities if you stay alive.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The darkness emitted by Zeta swallowed Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Ah. &nbsp;Annoying... Bastard.....’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As this thought ran across Azell's mind, he lost consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>7</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell's consciousness travelled to a time long before. He returned to a time when he had still been young and inexperienced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It's a dream.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell knew this to be true. &nbsp;He hadn't meant for this to happen, but his sense of desire before he fell unconscious had guided him to this point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is needed for the humans to win against the Dragon Demon race?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A middle-aged man, who possessed a large body, asked the question. Azell was a tall man, but the other man was a head taller than Azell. &nbsp;Moreover, the man possessed brown skin color, and a black beard. &nbsp;From Azell's perspective, the man had an exotic appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was Azell's 3rd teacher, Liglan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was a dual-swordsman, who used two curved sword. &nbsp;He was a frightening high rank Spirit Order practitioner, who was greater than anyone Azell had known at the time. He was royalty from a desert kingdom. &nbsp;After his kingdom was exterminated by the Dragon Demon army, he became well known in the Nadick Empire for his bravery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the time, Azell had been an unaffiliated knight, and he had decided to fight alongside Liglan. &nbsp;Azell had been awed by his courage and righteousness. &nbsp;Liglan carried himself like royalty as he possessed boldness and dignity. He was a brave general, who struck fear into the Dragon Demon army.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, Liglan considered Azell to be the one to bring hope to this era of Darkness. &nbsp;This was why he had taken in the unaffiliated knight, who had wandering from place to place. &nbsp;Liglan taught Azell techniques that hadn't been taught to him by his previous masters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess one needs the Dragon Demon Qi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Magic Qi was the ultimate weapon. &nbsp;It was made using one's soul as ingredient and it required the use of refined power of a Dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a miraculous tool that was available to the Spirit Order Practitioners, who were standing at the zenith of their ability. It was rare to find someone, who possessed this miraculous tool. &nbsp;Moreover, each of these men held enough power to be able to contend against the strong players of the Dragon Demon Army.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liglan was one of them. &nbsp;Up until now, he had fought eight Dragons to the death, and the result of his victories was the Dragon Maken in the form of two swords that made up a pair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liglan shook his head from side to side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The answer is more simple than that. &nbsp;It's power.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon Race was born with a powerful body at birth in comparison to humans. &nbsp;Even a frail looking woman possessed enormous strength to be able to rip a wild beast in half with her bare hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, those from the Dragon Demon race was lightning fast even if they hadn't cultivated. &nbsp;If they decided to kill a normal person, one wouldn't even be able to see their movements.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon race had extreme perception that allowed them to control their abilities. &nbsp;They also possessed special magic called the Dragon Demon Magic, which exceeded the magic of a high rank human magician. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if a being from the Dragon Demon race never learned any battle techniques, one of them had the power to take on a hundred humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yet those beings cultivate their own martial arts called the Dragon Ridge Arts, and they research about magic. &nbsp;Humans are like practice targets they could kill at their whim.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Techniques were insufficient in being able to contend against them. &nbsp;One needed power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who cares if one could hit them if they were unharmed afterwards?</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was the point in being able to block their attacks if one's entire defense would be blown into pieces?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you want to go toe to toe with them, you have to move past the so-called limits of a normal human. &nbsp;That's the minimum requirement. &nbsp;You have to become as strong as a monster, and fast as a lightning. &nbsp;Then you will be able to stand at the starting line.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there an alternative answer to the Dragon Slayer's Ritual?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If one was victorious in the Dragon Slayer's Ritual, one could strengthen one's body through the Dragon's power. &nbsp;It was the magical key that freed one from the limit one reached through cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liglan had performed the Dragon Slayer's Ritual eight times, and he had moved past the limitations of a human. &nbsp;However, that wasn't the entire story. &nbsp;Didn't it mean one had to already have enough power to be able to fight and kill a Dragon in the Dragon Slayer's Ritual? &nbsp;If one already had the power to kill a Dragon, one already had the power to contend against the Dragon Demon Race.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liglan spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Azell. Your teachers were very outstanding. &nbsp;I can tell just by looking at you. &nbsp;I wish Balf was still alive. &nbsp;I would have liked to meet him. He taught you about the Extreme Senses. &nbsp;However, he probably wasn't able to pass on everything he wanted before he died. &nbsp;It is now my responsibility to fill in that gap.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balf's mad teachings allowed Azell to possess superhuman senses that was superior to most Spirit Order Practitioners. &nbsp;However, a young man like him wasn't able to overcome a high level Spirit Order Practioner with just his potential in hand. &nbsp;The techniques were too strong and profound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You've done well in learning ways to strengthen your mind. I have nothing to teach you regarding that topic. I can only give you some knacks to help you. &nbsp;However, I can teach you a lot about strengthening your body. &nbsp;The problem is this can't be achieved in an instant. &nbsp;If you want a powerful body, you have invest enough time into it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are basically saying I have to stay alive for me to achieve this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bboooooooooo―!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A horn rang out far in the distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a signal that alerted everyone that the enemies were coming. The soldiers within the fortress moved busily as they got ready to face the Dragon Demon army.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liglan climbed the stairs to the castle walls as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We don't have the luxury of isolating ourselves to grow our power like the cultivators of old. &nbsp;However, I don't want you to kill hundred to thousands of people to grow your power.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I never wanted to do such a thing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please stay alive until you are able to learn everything I have to teach you. &nbsp;As your teacher, this is the only promise I want from you. &nbsp;Can you give me that promise?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, of course, I'll do that.”</span></p>
