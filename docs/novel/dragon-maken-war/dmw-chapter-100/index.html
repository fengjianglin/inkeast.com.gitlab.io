 <p>Chapter 100 - The Sword that Split the Heavens (3)</p>
 <p><span style>5</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Niberis!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…it seemed she had lost her consciousness for a brief moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis' consciousness kept blinking in and out as she heard a familiar voice. &nbsp;It was a voice infused with genuine concern. &nbsp;It was a voice she tolerated with discomfort since her childhood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Niberis! Wake up! Please!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kier… en…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis looked at him with blurry eyes. The young Dragon Demon was Kieren Baldazark. &nbsp;He was her rival, and he was the descendent of one of the four exalted Dragon Demon Generals. &nbsp;He looked as if he was about to cry as he called out her name.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why is he here…….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ooh ooh ooh &nbsp;ooh ooh…….</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, she realized the space around her was distorted. &nbsp;There was only one person she knew that could create such a phenomena. When she realized this fact, she suddenly felt annoyed even if she was close to her death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Laura…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;Laura, Sir Almarick and I are here! &nbsp;Hold on! &nbsp;If you die, I...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duke Baldazark.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kieren spoke as if he was about to cry, but Laura cut through his words. Laura's voice was monotone as always, but Kieren could felt nervousness behind her words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This space was made using Laura's Dragon Demon weapon called Vitan's Chalice. &nbsp;The Vitan's Maze was an isolated pocket dimension. Since she created a spatial distortion, this place couldn't be reached from outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Basically, the Vitan's Maze offered complete safety when it was put in place. &nbsp;It was a bit problematic when one had to get out, but once you were in there....</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura, who had her Vitan's Maze engaged, spoke as her expression stiffened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up. &nbsp;Bring out your Dragon Demon weapon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can't hold out much longer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-goo-goo-goo-goo……!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Vitan's Maze, which was isolated from the world, started to shake. &nbsp;Kieren was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Is he perhaps intruding into the Vitan's Maze?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We were tracked down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is this possible?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is possible. &nbsp;I don't have time to explain it. &nbsp;Hurry...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kook! I am the true descendant of the beings, who was born into the world without parents! &nbsp;I call for you to obey my call! &nbsp;The Dragon Demon weapon bleeds....!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kieren didn't know what was going on, but he followed Laura's instruction. &nbsp;Before he could fully bring out his Dragon Demon weapon, thunder exploded around &nbsp;him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwah-ahhhhhhhhhh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pocket dimension, which had safely sealed them away, was ripped apart. A calamity of light akin to a thunderbolt connected the heaven and earth. &nbsp;The darkness of the night sky was violently ripped away as a blue colored sword impacted on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kieren yelled out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Sword that Split the Heavens……!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It matched the description passed down in the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;It was the weapon that took the Dragon Demon King Atein's life. &nbsp;Then there was the four Dragon Demon Generals. &nbsp;They were beings, who came into this world without being born to parents, and they tried to change the fate of the world. &nbsp;However, they had been afraid of this particular weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Vitan's Maze crumbled away as the surrounding returned to normal. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell appeared from the rear with his red hair swirling around him. &nbsp;He spoke as he looked at the Dragon Demons, who had been within the Vitan's Maze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In truth, I'm impressed. &nbsp;You timed it perfectly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Azell unleashed his final blow against Niberis, the Vitan's Maze was activated, and Niberis was sequestered into the pocket dimension. &nbsp;Laura and Kieren was still 1 kilometers away from Niberis, yet she was able to take into account the distance in using her magic. &nbsp;She was skilled and it was quite admirable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You isolated space to make a pocket dimension. &nbsp;However, that space has to exist somewhere.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The method in creating spatial distortion and the pocket dimension was different. &nbsp;The concept behind Vitan's Maze was to distort the configuration of space. If one entered from the outside, the maze would trap all visitors in an endless maze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had fought Aunsaurus in the Dragon Demon wars. &nbsp;Moreover, the so-called impregnable Vitan's Maze had been broken several times by Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura mumbled to herself as if she was groaning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speed of light…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems the knowledge about the Sword that Split the Heavens was passed down amongst you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is a sword of calamity, and it can control all of the world's light. &nbsp;It can control the light from the sun, the flame from the volcanoes, and the roaring thunder within the storm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are quite ostentatious in your descriptions. &nbsp;Well, it is understandable. &nbsp;This sword killed your god, so I can understand why you would add such descriptions to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sword that Split the Heavens was a Dragon Demon weapon he had completed as he matured. &nbsp;When he first made the Dragon Demon weapon, it only had the power to control thunderbolts, which he had used for long ranged attacks. &nbsp;However, as he went through the gauntlet of battles in the Dragon Demon war, his sword was refined. &nbsp;It grew into becoming the ultimate weapon capable of defeating the Dragon Demon King. &nbsp;This had been possible through Azell's efforts, and the sacrifices of his comrades.....</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sword that Split the Heavens controlled light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It could control thunder. &nbsp;Moreover, it could gather all existing light within his domain to convert it into an offensive energy. &nbsp;Moreover, when the sword itself turned into light, it could break all shackles of limitation for a brief moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kieren asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is he saying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Vitan's Maze cannot transcend the limitation of my perception.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura spoke as cold sweat ran down her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if she isolated a large amount of space using the Vitan’s Maze, she was creating the space within the limited region within her perception. &nbsp;Even if she created a castle wall where one needed several days of running to reach the end, her opponent could just use the light from the sky to cut through her space.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura was able to assess this problem, so she had tried to use the property of light against Azell. &nbsp;She knew light travelled in straight lines, so he kept changing the location of her space to block the Sword that Split the Heavens. &nbsp;However, her efforts had been futile. &nbsp;The Sword that Split the Heavens could scatter numerous light particles, and it allowed Azell to trace any beings if light was able to reach them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kieren had been a step slow in realizing this fact. &nbsp;He spoke with a shaking voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So the sword can really split the heavens....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm? &nbsp;Are you perhaps the descendant of Baldazark?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell tilted his head as he looked at Kieren. &nbsp;Niberis was of a different sex as Saibein, and Laura also looked different Aunsaurus. &nbsp;However, Kieren's outer appearance and voice was almost a carbon copy of Baldazark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kieren asked in surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did you know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I knew it by your appearance. &nbsp;Saibein's daughter, Aunsaurus' grandchild and Baldazark's scion.... &nbsp;Did all the Dragon Demons of note and the small fries gather here today? </span></p>
 <p><span style>When the Vitan's Maze was broken, three young Dragon Demons was returned to normal space. &nbsp;They returned to a location where a large number of Dragon Demon king worshippers were gathered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was the group being led by Duran, and they had been fighting Leticia. &nbsp;Then there was the group brought here by Laura and Kieren. &nbsp;There was a total of 120 Dragon Demon king worshippers present, and all of them were quite proficient at fighting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had an absolute numerical advantage. &nbsp;However, Azell didn't even show an ounce of nervousness as he asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How long will it take for our allies to get here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm not sure. &nbsp;This land is rarely seen by the gazes of man, so the response may be sluggish. &nbsp;They are usually really good at showing up when they aren't needed....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I agree. &nbsp;They are like perverts, who like to stalk. &nbsp;If so, why the hell are they so late? &nbsp;They are useless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell and Kairen was talking about the Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;There wasn't much of a population within the County of Karzark, so the surveillance net was thin here. &nbsp;However, Kairen was a member of the Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;Since he witnessed the Dragon Demon king worshippers, the Guardian Shadows would know about it. &nbsp;It was a matter of time before they got here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen didn't show any outwards signs, but he asked Azell a question through Whispering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-How much reserve do you have left?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell showed off a fearsome god-like power, yet this power wasn't endless. &nbsp;Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-The Dragon Maken I called forth is starting to reach its limit. &nbsp;Moreover, the Dragon Sword is groaning under the stress.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cheat-like Dragon Maken he called forth had a time limit. &nbsp;The Dragon Sword had become the vessel for his power, yet it couldn't channel that power indefinitely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On top of that fact, the use of the Dragon Maken put quite a lot of burden on Azell too. &nbsp;Azell hadn't been able to complete his recovery yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-However, I have plenty enough to kill all these bastards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Hmm. Then I'll focus my power on protecting this guy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke as he unsheathed his dual swords. &nbsp;Yuren was at Kairen's feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then they naturally came to a realization that a female Dragon Majin was showing her back to them. She was a Dragon Majin with short, black and wavy hair. &nbsp;It was Leticia. &nbsp;She asked Kairen a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is he dead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you mean the magician, he is still alive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems he wasn't destined to die. &nbsp;Then let me ask you another question. &nbsp;I don't know who you are, but are you an ally?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to pose the same question to you as an answer, but... &nbsp;Since we have common enemies, you can join our side until the end of this fight. &nbsp;We can talk about our interests afterwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Such a generous answer. &nbsp;It almost makes me tear up. &nbsp;All right. &nbsp;Let's do that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia let out a snort. Then she let out a tumultuous killing intent towards the other side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, I never expected to see Duke Almarick here. &nbsp;I would have never imagined it. &nbsp;Is this the destiny Yuren was talking about?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her gaze was focused on a being with long, blue-black hair. &nbsp;It had horns that made him look like a black bull. &nbsp;This particular Dragon Demon youth possessed yellowish brown eyes and Dragon Demon Stone. &nbsp;He was like Kieren and Laura. &nbsp;He was the descendent of 'The Sword that parts a storm' Almarick, and his name was Jeffers Almarick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell tilted his head in confusion at her words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm? This guy is Almarick's descendent?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are only a lowly human, yet you dare speak his name?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jeffers words revealed his disdain of Azell. &nbsp;He hadn't been inside the Vitan's Maze, so he hadn't witnessed Azell's god-like powers. &nbsp;If he had seen it, he wouldn't have been able to maintain such an attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell smiled as he revealed his teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are quite the prototypical Dragon Demon. &nbsp;However... &nbsp;Why don't you look anything like Almarick?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The scion of Baldazark looks like that git. &nbsp;He looks exactly like the foppish Baldazark. &nbsp;However, you don't share any common features with your predecessor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What nonsense are you spouting?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now that I think about it, the only thing different about Aunsuarus' descendent is her gender. &nbsp;As the daughter of the Simpleton Prince, they look very alike. &nbsp;However, this isn't true for you. &nbsp;You are the only one that doesn't look like your predecessor. &nbsp;Don't you think that's strange?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bastard! &nbsp;You are a being from the gutters, yet you dare to insult me using such baseless conjectures?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jeffers raged. &nbsp;However, Azell didn't back off from his taunts. From what he remembered, Almarick had long, dirty white hair. &nbsp;His eyes had been bright red, and his thick horns had the consistency of volcanic rocks. &nbsp;He had been a middle-aged Dragon Demon, who looked like a savage lion. &nbsp;No matter how he looked at it, Jeffers didn't look anything like Almarick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the other Dragon Demons hadn't looked like their predecessors, he wouldn't have remarked on it. &nbsp;However, Niberis, Laura and Kieren looked similar to the Dragon Demons of old.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why is he different?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was having a hard time letting go of this incongruity . &nbsp;When Azell furrowed his brows, Kieren spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duke Almarick. &nbsp;That man is strong. &nbsp;You have to use your Dragon Demon weapon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you talking about? &nbsp;I have to use my Dragon Demon weapon facing a lowly human?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Listen to my words carefully. Niberis lost to him even after using her Dragon Demon weapon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What nonsense are you……!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He's coming.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a flash, Laura stretched out her hand to activate her barrier. &nbsp;By a hair's breadth, she was able to divert the sharp light emitted by the sword towards an entirely different direction.</span></p>
