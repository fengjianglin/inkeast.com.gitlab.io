 <p>Chapter 97 - Those who Seek Their Own Destiny (6)</p>
 <p><span style>9</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Leticia was outside the castle with Duran. &nbsp;She was battling the forces being led by him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was leery about being separated from Yuren, but she had no choice. &nbsp;Yuren was in such poor shape, so she had hidden him before she stepped forward to fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she had observed the Magic Eyes being retracted, and an explosion came from within the castle. &nbsp;She knew there was a battle going on inside the castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His use of the Forbidden technique of summoning a Demon was probably a necessity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though the situation had become chaotic and desperate, Leticia's cool-headedness never eroded. &nbsp;Duran was trying to confuse her senses by using Clones, but she blocked every one of Duran's sword strike with her spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-ah-ah-ahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the explosion rang out, Leticia had already bounced off Duran's sword, and at the same time, she showed off her intricate control over her power by getting in a counter. &nbsp;Duran's shoulder protector was ripped away, and the cold energy gathered around this region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the battle was ongoing, the surrounding had turned into a scene straight out of winter. She was called the Cold-blooded Queen, and she possessed Dragon Demon magic, which was on par with the high ranking Dragon Demon officers residing within the Plain of Darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected of the Dragon Demon King's dog, your sense of smell is quite keen. &nbsp;Yuren is great at covering his tracks, yet…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Both of you will soon be dragged away like dogs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really? &nbsp;You master is opposing someone that may have the means to kill her. &nbsp;”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both combatants could feel the clash of enormous powers nearby.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In such a situation, Leticia was not the one, who was restless. &nbsp;Unexpectedly, it was Duran, who felt restless. &nbsp;He trusted Niberis' power. &nbsp;However, at the same time, she was the daughter of Saibein, who had been Duran's savior. &nbsp;Niberis was the direct descendant of the exalted Dragon Demon King, and he was worried she would get hurt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On contrast, Leticia was calm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Yuren. &nbsp;If you die here... &nbsp;The guide in your dream was a trick used by the Demons to push you towards your own destruction.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn't fuss over something she had no control over. &nbsp;All she could do was to do her best in solving the problem in front of her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them had been in an intense pursuit battle with the Dragon Demon king worshippers. &nbsp;&nbsp;It hadn't been a wise decision for them to enter the County of Karzark. &nbsp;The Dragon Demon king worshippers alway kept an eye on this land. &nbsp;Yuren and Leticia was well aware of this fact. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, Yuren insisted that he had to go to this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The guide within my dream said that I'll meet my destiny here.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>…when she heard his words, Leticia thought really hard as to whether Yuren really had lost his mind. &nbsp;She had allied herself with him, because he had been too talented. &nbsp;Moreover, they had the same goal. &nbsp;She had assessed that he was of sane mind. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Had she been wrong?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren insisted that the guide in his dream was instrumental in him betraying the Dragon Demon king worshippers. &nbsp;He had been subjected to constant indoctrination, and the guide had been instrumental in him breaking the bonds of fanaticism. &nbsp;If Leticia didn't go with him, Yuren &nbsp;planned on going to the County of Karzark by himself. &nbsp;Leticia decided to gamble. &nbsp;She gave this mad plan a chance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No matter how I look at this, this is crazy, but... &nbsp;If I was of sane mind, I wouldn't be fighting these bastards.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If she thought about it carefully, Yuren was someone she should avoid getting close to even if he had betrayed the Dragon Demon king worshippers. &nbsp;Even if one needed a lot of power to go up against the Dragon Demon race, one shouldn't cross the line by calling a Demon into one's body. &nbsp;The Black magicians, who went this far, were considered to be a bad egg.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Yuren's intentions and actions were surprisingly just even if he had broken an evil taboo. &nbsp;This was why Leticia had accepted him as a comrade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Leticia trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the midst of her fierce battle, she felt the inflating magical energy of Yuren being ripped into pieces, and an oppressive Dragon Demon magic had exploded forth. Leticia let out a moan when she realized the identity of this energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…Niberis possesses Dragon Demon Qi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an unexpected situation. &nbsp;Even at a glance, she had been able to tell Niberis was a scary opponent. &nbsp;However, she never expected her to possess Dragon Demon Qi. &nbsp;Yuren didn't stand a chance!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kah-ahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia charged Duran as she brought down her spear. &nbsp;The sword and the spear was interlocked with each other. &nbsp;Duran laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We'll see if each of us put our trust in the right place. &nbsp;The result will show us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm. Certainly…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Leticia's surprise was pushed down in an instant. &nbsp;After pushing back Duran, she spoke in an apathetic voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, if he dies here, it is his fate..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran was taken aback. &nbsp;Were these two really comrades? Her comrade was in obvious danger, so how could she be so calm about it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia smiled. &nbsp;She had a savage smile of a predator.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Once one enters into a battle as a combatant, one has to be responsible for one's own life. &nbsp;I won't fret over him as if he was a baby left by the river. &nbsp;I would be putting the cart before the horse, and it might result in my death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When one acknowledged each other as comrades, one also accepted the fact that one’s comrade might die. &nbsp;If a comrade died, the living member only had the obligation to take revenge for the dead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia had always fought with this mental attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We'll see if his fate leads him to destruction or hope.... We'll soon find out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a brief moment, the Dragon Demon magic, which had been agitating her senses from afar, disappeared as if it had been a lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>10</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis couldn’t comprehend what had happened in front of her, so she was filled with confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front of her, there was a book floating in front of her, and it possessed pages covered in pitch black darkness. &nbsp;This was Dragon Art's Book of the Dark Soul, which had been passed down from the Dragon Demon wars.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she obtained this great relic, she was able to wield a different level of magical power. &nbsp;She had been in a tight battle with Yuren, but in an instant, she was able to overpower him. &nbsp;He had been wrecked by her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she was about to capture him, a sword appeared in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh……!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sword had fallen in front of her like thunderbolt, and it ripped away the darkness formed by her. &nbsp;It wasn't as if an overwhelming strength had exploded onto the scene. &nbsp;The sword had flown in, and it cut off the swirling magical wave as if it had never existed. &nbsp;It was akin to a sword cutting a piece of paper....</span></p>
 <p><span style>She felt a chill. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was such a thing really possible?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This sword…….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sword possessed a white blade. &nbsp;At a glance, one could tell it wasn't made out of metal. &nbsp;It was made out of some other ingredient.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It has been a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then she heard a familiar voice. &nbsp;It was a voice of a man she would never forget.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis spoke with an angry voice towards the man, who was walking slowly towards her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Azell Zestringer……!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Confusion washed over her alongside her rage. &nbsp;Why was this man here? &nbsp;How come she hadn't received any information regarding his presence here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon king worshippers were on high alert regarding Azell's whereabouts. &nbsp;However, Azell and Kairen’s movement speed transcended imagination. &nbsp;After they left the Dukedom of Tarantos, she had received no information from her observers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silence descended between the two. &nbsp;The Dragon Sword embedded in the ground rose up into the air by itself, and it returned to Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Even the Dragon Sword Duke....’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis located Kairen, who was standing behind Azell. &nbsp;She wasn't in a good situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell suddenly spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems you gained a new Dragon Arts I've never seen you use. Since such a young Dragon Demon like you possesses Dragon Demon Qi,I'm guessing you inherited something that already existed. &nbsp;Actually, I remember that Dragon Demon Qi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell calmly looked over Niberis. &nbsp;Her Dragon Demon magic hadn't changed much. &nbsp;However, it was hard to assess how much energy a magician possessed unless one fought against one. &nbsp;However, the mere fact that she had gained the Dragon Arts meant that she would be able to wield a different level of power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Before I ask you why you are here... &nbsp;I'm curious about one thing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are we really in a situation where we can calmly answer each other's questions?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Were you guys responsible for destroying this land?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had ignored Niberis' sarcastic remarks, and he had asked the question. &nbsp;Niberis looked straight into Azell's eyes, which was burning with anger, and she gave her answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That's right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was true that he had suspected the identity of culprits. Thirteen Dragons had suddenly rampaged in madness, and a large force of monsters had been ready to move into his land. &nbsp;It had been an unnatural event.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this wasn't the only reasons why Azell had suspected the Dragon Demon king worshippers. &nbsp;He knew it to be true when he learned that all the descendents of Count Karzark had been eradicated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if the County of Karzark was destroyed, his descendents couldn't have all died. &nbsp;Of course, the women and the old would have been evacuated. &nbsp;Then there would have been some, who were out of the lands, at the time of the attack. &nbsp;So how could all of them be massacred so thoroughly?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone had taken advantage of the chaos created by the Great Darkness, and the downfall of the County of Karzark. &nbsp;If not, there was no way everyone would have died. &nbsp;The only likely suspect, who would do such a thing, was the Dragon Demon king worshippers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell briefly closed his eyes as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis was taken aback at his unexpected words. &nbsp;Azell spoke as he opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll be able to hate all of you with all my heart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A powerful magical wave was emitted from Azell. It was as if her senses was hit by a heavy sensation. &nbsp;When the magical wave reached her, Niberis trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What the hell has he been doing?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell's magical energy couldn't be compared to the last time she had seen him. &nbsp;His growth rate was unrivalled..</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike the Dragon Demons or the Dragon Majins, humans weren't born with massive amounts of power. &nbsp;Instead, they were able to rapidly grow their power in a short amount of time. This held true for Spirit Order Practitioners and Magicians.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, there was a limit on how fast one could grow. &nbsp;It had only been 1 year, since she had seen him last. &nbsp;So how could his magical energy grow so much?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘At the very least, he is a Septuple Master!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cold sweat ran down her body. &nbsp;Even when Azell had incomprehensibly low magical energy, he had been a threat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How was he able to gain this much magic in only a year?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis used her Communication magic to gather her underlings, and she got ready for battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It happened at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;It really...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren was lying next to Azell's feet, and he spoke with a feeble voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The guide's words... &nbsp;He was right……. The fact that he was so accurate... &nbsp;Even if I'm the beneficiary of such information, I... &nbsp;don't feel.... too good about it....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It would be best if you spare your words.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell didn't even look at him as he spoke. &nbsp;Niberis was stoking her fighting spirit in front of him, so Azell couldn't reveal any openings in his defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha ha ha… Thank... you... For worrying about me....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don't' know who you are. &nbsp;In truth, I don't like the fact that you stink of an evil energy, but.... &nbsp;You seem to be the enemy of my enemies, so I'll spare you. &nbsp;I'll give you a chance to explain yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell took a step forward. &nbsp;Kairen, who had silently stood behind Azell, took Yuren, and they retreated towards the back. &nbsp;After confirming their retreat, he spoke to Niberis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is time for you to pay off your debts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You took the words out of my mouth, the man whose name is seeped in sin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm tired of being called by that long and unnecessary nickname. &nbsp;I'll make it so that you'll never &nbsp;utter those words again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A tumultuous killing intent exploded forth from Azell, and he charged toward Niberis.</span></p>
