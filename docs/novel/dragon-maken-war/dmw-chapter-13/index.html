  <p><span style><span style>Chapter 13 - Dragon’s Shadow (2)</span></span></p>
  <p></p>
  <hr>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>The woman spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That is surprising. You can sense our presence?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You guys hid your Dragon Magic and it’s quite brilliant. The princess didn’t know about you guys in the beginning, because of it.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“How did you find out?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I have no reasons to reveal my funds.” (TLN: it’s an analogy, you don’t tell others how much you have in the bank)</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell laughed fiercely.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It is a stupid act to tell your opponent any information about yourself when you are fighting. Even if you think it is useless information, you have to hide the information about yourself. You never know what will help you survive.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The woman spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What a hateful man. You are a Spirit Order Practitioner, but you speak like a magician.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>She spoke while looking at the knife buried in the man’s stomach. The woman nor the man who was stabbed in the stomach knew how it was done.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Of course, Azell knew it since he was the attacker. It was a very simple trick.</span></p>
  <p><span style>In a single moment, he exploded his power to cause the enemy to be cautious. While he accelerated his speed, he caused confusion by executing fancy moves. At the same time he ran forth, he had used a concealment spell to hide the knife and he threw it. The opponent didn’t realize this, and it had pierced him. It didn’t have anything to do with the dynamics of power. (TLN: it basically means the method he used didn’t have anything to do with how much power he has)</span></p>
  <p><span style>He had confused the enemies’ senses. He used the concealment method without them knowing then he mixed his throwing motion within his other movements. It was a frighteningly polished technique.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell evaluated the situation inside.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘There are five opponents with this much skill. I think it is impossible for us to face them all.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>In the past, if he encountered this situation then he would have gotten through it while laughing. However, he was too weak right now. He was able to catch the enemy off guard a moment ago, but in a proper fight, he didn’t have a chance.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘It makes me want to sigh. This happened so suddenly. I thought peaceful days would be waiting for me after I woke up after 220 years.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell lamented on his own fate. The Dragon Demon War shook the world 220 years ago, and he had to fight with his life on the line since his childhood. He fought for the future when he would be able to stop fighting and welcome the peaceful days. This ardent desire allowed him to wade through the piles of body and lakes of blood he made.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, the end did not bring peace, but despair. He had gambled to escape a hopeless situation, and the cost required him to be thrown away by the world he remembered. He was exiled to the far future.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Even if it was just that, he would have felt sorry for himself and wept. However, this ordeal was shoved into him not too long after.</span></p>
  <p><span style>At that moment, the woman spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Let’s retreat for now.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“We’ve almost captured them, but you want us to retreat?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“How can you say that when you are in such a state?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Kuk…..!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The cold woman’s words shut the man’s mouth.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The woman spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“When one hunts, one has to do it at one’s leisure. The enemy’s fighting power is unknown, so until we find it out, let’s torment them.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>As he was backing up, Azell asked her a question.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hey, young lady.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…young lady(TLN: Miss)?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The woman mumbled as if she had heard something quite bizarre.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell replied back with another question.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Do you prefer madam?”(TLN: Mrs. the term author uses indicates an older woman usually married, depends on how you use it you can imply the woman is over the hill/unattractive)</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No, I prefer to be called young lady.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Then I’ll call you madam.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“……”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I have no reason to satisfy your request since you are my enemy, right?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You are really a detestable man. It has been awhile since someone has tried my patience to this degree.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The woman’s hoarse voice was still steady, but the magical vibration she was emitting became rougher. For a normal person, one would feel tormented by the stifling pressure, but Azell just smirked.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If you don’t want to be called madam then at the very least, you could tell me your name?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Is your name too famous to be revealed? Well, you are worried enough about your identity being revealed so much so that you are wearing a mask…..”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Regina.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The woman with the hoarse voice spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m the Dragon’s Shadow Regina. It is a name that was forgotten by the world, so it will be useless for you to look for any clue.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Dragon’s Shadow must be the name of your organization.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes. Now it’s your turn.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmmm?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Reveal your name.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Unlike you guys, I’ll gladly reveal my name. It is Azell Zestringer.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Azell….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Regina showed some interest.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You have an ominous name.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It’s omnious?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes. Just for having that name, it is ominous enough for you to deserve death.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You are speaking nonsense.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I don’t have a hobby of remembering the name of someone who became a corpse…. Against my will, I won’t be able to forget your name now.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Then Regina hid her figure. The man was about to follow her and disappear, but he spoke in a rumbling voice, while glaring at Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m Dragon’s Shadow Kirion. Remember it. It is the name of the man, who’ll kill you in the most excruciating way possible.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I don’t want to remember it, so why don’t you fight me now? Are you afraid of me even though I am unarmed?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kirion was in a rage, and he started emitting chaotic forces, but in the end, he went away without attacking Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell clicked his tongue.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“He is more cool-headed than I thought. If he flew into rage and attacked me then I could have ended him….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell threw his hands up after he spoke. Arrieta was surprised after seeing this.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“By the way…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Where did the sword pop out from?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Somehow, Azell was already holding onto a blade. Azell shrugged his shoulder.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I had it from the beginning.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I was merely hiding it.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>From the start of his intrusion, he had two swords. Anything can happen in the middle of battle, so he looted useful weapons from the enemies he defeated.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He had discarded one sword on the ground right before he jumped in, and he used the other sword to attack Kirion. After his sword broke, he picked up the other sword without regret over losing the other, and he casted a concealment spell. While conversing with Regina, he had grabbed the sword, but no one realized it. To pull off this trick, he used a technique that binded the item to Azell’s skin.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“We should settle this situation now…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, something even he couldn’t have predicted happened. From all around, flashes of light and torpedo shaped globes started falling in an arc onto the battlefield.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Shit!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Ggwa-gwa-gwang! Ggwa-gwa-gwa-gwa-gwang! (TLN: explosion sound)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The lights blew up and it was bright enough to blind a person.</span></p>
  <p><span style>3</span></p>
  <p><span style>One hour had passed since the ruin excavation site and Princess Arietta was ambushed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The members of the secret society called Dragon’s Shadow was gathered at the ruin excavation site, which was in shambles.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The location was mercilessly demolished. While the monsters were causing havoc, the members of the Dragon’s Shadow planted explosive magic in various locations. The explosion was triggered by attacking it with powerful magic from outside. During all this, the monsters were all getting massacred, but they didn’t care about the sacrifice. Initially, the monsters were subdued to be used as a disposable item.</span></p>
  <p><span style>An appalling amount of dead bodies of humans and monsters were strewn around, but no one cared. The five people were dressed similarly in a suspicious manner, and Regina was the leader who commanded them.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Regina asked in her hoarse voice.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Where is the Dragon Demon Princess located at?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“She is 4km North-East from here. Jackal is chasing her, so there is no chance we’ll lose her.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“We have to capture her before she reaches the fortress. You know this, right?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Western Border Fort’s military power was strong. Each of the members of the Dragon’s Shadow had considerable amount of strength, but the Western Border Fort had been fortified against mass attack by monsters, and even an ambush by a dragon. It was impossible to attack them with just their number.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was why they were moving under the initial assumption that they would catch Arrieta before she reached the Western Border Fort.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Currently, is anyone with the Dragon Demon Princess?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“There are four people including the Dragon Demon Princess. Even a non-combatant is among them.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Where is the man called Azell Zestringer?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“He is on the move with the Dragon Demon Princess.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I knew he wouldn’t die just from that.” (TLN: the explosion)</span></p>
  <p><span style>After speaking, Regina threw back her hood. The veil of darkness, which was covering her face, disappeared and her bare face was revealed. She had long black hair, and cold blue eyes. She was a woman that gave an impression of sharpness. Her age could be around mid-30s?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Since she was a Dragon Demon, her ears were slightly pointed, and above her left ear there was a black horn that looked like a feather decoration.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Becareful when you face off against him. Dispose of him from distance if possible.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Does he warrant that big of a warning? No matter how I see it he didn’t seem that strong.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“While he was confronting the Dragon Demon Princess, he was able to assess our exact number.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmmm?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Everyone agreed with her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>They were confident that they had hidden their existence. They used a specialized item to hide their Dragon Magic, so if they hid their life signature, no one should be able to see through to their existence.</span></p>
  <p><span style>In reality, the several hundred soldiers and even the Dragon Demon Princess Arrieta was unable to notice them. So how was Azell able to see through to their existence?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Regina spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Do not think that you have seen the floor when you have only seen his exterior. If you don’t acknowledge the fact that Master level Spirit Order Practitioners are beings who have surpassed humans then you may pay dearly later. ”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmm.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You should be very careful, while hunting them. I want you circle them with the forest orcs, and wear them out. I want you to keep scratching and biting them until they are completely tired out. Then we will capture the Dragon Demon Princess and leave. We cannot disappoint that person…..”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After saying this, Regina walked towards the entrance of the ruin.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The entrance to the ruins was being excavated, but the attack from the Dragon’s Shadow had reburied it. For a moment, Regina examined the location before speaking.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I believe this really is Carlos’ ruin.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What? Are you sure?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The members of the Dragon’s Shadow murmured.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Carlos had left his name in history as an Archmage. He was the hateful enemy of the Dragon’s Shadow. They were a secret organization that worshiped the Dragon Demon Race, who wanted to conquer the human of this world.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Regina nodded her head.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I think so. However, I’m not an expert, so I’ll have to thoroughly investigate this place. I’ll request for additional troops to be deployed…. It’ll be a race against the time for us. They(TLN: the humans) will comeback after they reorganize themselves.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Understood.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Then let us start the hunt again.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The members of the Dragon’s Shadow rushed towards the fleeing Dragon Demon Princess.</span></p>
  <p><span style>4</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was used to being chased.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Humans were always numerically inferior in the fight against the Dragon Demon race. The number of Dragon Demon race were small, but they subjugated monsters and demonic animals to fight in their army. When they were unorganized, the monsters and demonic animals couldn’t stand up against the might of the human armies. However, they were enslaved by the Dragon Demon race, and they were reborn as a terrifying power.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I’m experiencing the same exact situation as before.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>The people, who revealed themselves to be the ‘Dragon’s Shadow’, made Azell think about the Dragon Demon race from 220 years ago.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘If I’m alone, then I could escape easily….’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was looking around the area while on top of a tree. He threw his gaze downwards, and he saw three members of his party. It was the Dragon Demon Princess Arrieta, her young maid Enora, and Rick, who he had rescued during all the confusion.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I don’t know what happened to Sir Giles.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>He got separated from Giles. He had no way to know if he was dead or alive.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell looked at Arrieta.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I’ve take on a really big burden.’</span></p>
  <p></p>

 <p><span style><span style>Chapter 13 - Dragon’s Shadow (2)</span></span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The woman spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is surprising. You can sense our presence?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys hid your Dragon Magic and it’s quite brilliant. The princess didn’t know about you guys in the beginning, because of it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did you find out?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have no reasons to reveal my funds.” (TLN: it’s an analogy, you don’t tell others how much you have in the bank)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell laughed fiercely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is a stupid act to tell your opponent any information about yourself when you are fighting. Even if you think it is useless information, you have to hide the information about yourself. You never know what will help you survive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a hateful man. You are a Spirit Order Practitioner, but you speak like a magician.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She spoke while looking at the knife buried in the man’s stomach. The woman nor the man who was stabbed in the stomach knew how it was done.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Azell knew it since he was the attacker. It was a very simple trick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a single moment, he exploded his power to cause the enemy to be cautious. While he accelerated his speed, he caused confusion by executing fancy moves. At the same time he ran forth, he had used a concealment spell to hide the knife and he threw it. The opponent didn’t realize this, and it had pierced him. It didn’t have anything to do with the dynamics of power. (TLN: it basically means the method he used didn’t have anything to do with how much power he has)</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had confused the enemies’ senses. He used the concealment method without them knowing then he mixed his throwing motion within his other movements. It was a frighteningly polished technique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell evaluated the situation inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There are five opponents with this much skill. I think it is impossible for us to face them all.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, if he encountered this situation then he would have gotten through it while laughing. However, he was too weak right now. He was able to catch the enemy off guard a moment ago, but in a proper fight, he didn’t have a chance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It makes me want to sigh. This happened so suddenly. I thought peaceful days would be waiting for me after I woke up after 220 years.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell lamented on his own fate. The Dragon Demon War shook the world 220 years ago, and he had to fight with his life on the line since his childhood. He fought for the future when he would be able to stop fighting and welcome the peaceful days. This ardent desire allowed him to wade through the piles of body and lakes of blood he made.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the end did not bring peace, but despair. He had gambled to escape a hopeless situation, and the cost required him to be thrown away by the world he remembered. He was exiled to the far future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if it was just that, he would have felt sorry for himself and wept. However, this ordeal was shoved into him not too long after.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the woman spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s retreat for now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ve almost captured them, but you want us to retreat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can you say that when you are in such a state?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk…..!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cold woman’s words shut the man’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When one hunts, one has to do it at one’s leisure. The enemy’s fighting power is unknown, so until we find it out, let’s torment them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he was backing up, Azell asked her a question.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, young lady.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…young lady(TLN: Miss)?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman mumbled as if she had heard something quite bizarre.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell replied back with another question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you prefer madam?”(TLN: Mrs. the term author uses indicates an older woman usually married, depends on how you use it you can imply the woman is over the hill/unattractive)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I prefer to be called young lady.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll call you madam.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“……”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have no reason to satisfy your request since you are my enemy, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are really a detestable man. It has been awhile since someone has tried my patience to this degree.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman’s hoarse voice was still steady, but the magical vibration she was emitting became rougher. For a normal person, one would feel tormented by the stifling pressure, but Azell just smirked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you don’t want to be called madam then at the very least, you could tell me your name?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is your name too famous to be revealed? Well, you are worried enough about your identity being revealed so much so that you are wearing a mask…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Regina.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman with the hoarse voice spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m the Dragon’s Shadow Regina. It is a name that was forgotten by the world, so it will be useless for you to look for any clue.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dragon’s Shadow must be the name of your organization.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. Now it’s your turn.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Reveal your name.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unlike you guys, I’ll gladly reveal my name. It is Azell Zestringer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Azell….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regina showed some interest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have an ominous name.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s omnious?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. Just for having that name, it is ominous enough for you to deserve death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are speaking nonsense.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t have a hobby of remembering the name of someone who became a corpse…. Against my will, I won’t be able to forget your name now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Regina hid her figure. The man was about to follow her and disappear, but he spoke in a rumbling voice, while glaring at Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m Dragon’s Shadow Kirion. Remember it. It is the name of the man, who’ll kill you in the most excruciating way possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to remember it, so why don’t you fight me now? Are you afraid of me even though I am unarmed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kirion was in a rage, and he started emitting chaotic forces, but in the end, he went away without attacking Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell clicked his tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is more cool-headed than I thought. If he flew into rage and attacked me then I could have ended him….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell threw his hands up after he spoke. Arrieta was surprised after seeing this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“By the way…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where did the sword pop out from?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Somehow, Azell was already holding onto a blade. Azell shrugged his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I had it from the beginning.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was merely hiding it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the start of his intrusion, he had two swords. Anything can happen in the middle of battle, so he looted useful weapons from the enemies he defeated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had discarded one sword on the ground right before he jumped in, and he used the other sword to attack Kirion. After his sword broke, he picked up the other sword without regret over losing the other, and he casted a concealment spell. While conversing with Regina, he had grabbed the sword, but no one realized it. To pull off this trick, he used a technique that binded the item to Azell’s skin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We should settle this situation now…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, something even he couldn’t have predicted happened. From all around, flashes of light and torpedo shaped globes started falling in an arc onto the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ggwa-gwa-gwang! Ggwa-gwa-gwa-gwa-gwang! (TLN: explosion sound)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lights blew up and it was bright enough to blind a person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>3</span></p>
 <p><span style>One hour had passed since the ruin excavation site and Princess Arietta was ambushed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The members of the secret society called Dragon’s Shadow was gathered at the ruin excavation site, which was in shambles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The location was mercilessly demolished. While the monsters were causing havoc, the members of the Dragon’s Shadow planted explosive magic in various locations. The explosion was triggered by attacking it with powerful magic from outside. During all this, the monsters were all getting massacred, but they didn’t care about the sacrifice. Initially, the monsters were subdued to be used as a disposable item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An appalling amount of dead bodies of humans and monsters were strewn around, but no one cared. The five people were dressed similarly in a suspicious manner, and Regina was the leader who commanded them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regina asked in her hoarse voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where is the Dragon Demon Princess located at?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She is 4km North-East from here. Jackal is chasing her, so there is no chance we’ll lose her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We have to capture her before she reaches the fortress. You know this, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Western Border Fort’s military power was strong. Each of the members of the Dragon’s Shadow had considerable amount of strength, but the Western Border Fort had been fortified against mass attack by monsters, and even an ambush by a dragon. It was impossible to attack them with just their number.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why they were moving under the initial assumption that they would catch Arrieta before she reached the Western Border Fort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Currently, is anyone with the Dragon Demon Princess?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are four people including the Dragon Demon Princess. Even a non-combatant is among them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where is the man called Azell Zestringer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is on the move with the Dragon Demon Princess.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I knew he wouldn’t die just from that.” (TLN: the explosion)</span></p>
 <p><span style>After speaking, Regina threw back her hood. The veil of darkness, which was covering her face, disappeared and her bare face was revealed. She had long black hair, and cold blue eyes. She was a woman that gave an impression of sharpness. Her age could be around mid-30s?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since she was a Dragon Demon, her ears were slightly pointed, and above her left ear there was a black horn that looked like a feather decoration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Becareful when you face off against him. Dispose of him from distance if possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does he warrant that big of a warning? No matter how I see it he didn’t seem that strong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“While he was confronting the Dragon Demon Princess, he was able to assess our exact number.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone agreed with her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were confident that they had hidden their existence. They used a specialized item to hide their Dragon Magic, so if they hid their life signature, no one should be able to see through to their existence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In reality, the several hundred soldiers and even the Dragon Demon Princess Arrieta was unable to notice them. So how was Azell able to see through to their existence?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regina spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do not think that you have seen the floor when you have only seen his exterior. If you don’t acknowledge the fact that Master level Spirit Order Practitioners are beings who have surpassed humans then you may pay dearly later. ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should be very careful, while hunting them. I want you circle them with the forest orcs, and wear them out. I want you to keep scratching and biting them until they are completely tired out. Then we will capture the Dragon Demon Princess and leave. We cannot disappoint that person…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying this, Regina walked towards the entrance of the ruin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entrance to the ruins was being excavated, but the attack from the Dragon’s Shadow had reburied it. For a moment, Regina examined the location before speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe this really is Carlos’ ruin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Are you sure?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The members of the Dragon’s Shadow murmured.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos had left his name in history as an Archmage. He was the hateful enemy of the Dragon’s Shadow. They were a secret organization that worshiped the Dragon Demon Race, who wanted to conquer the human of this world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regina nodded her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think so. However, I’m not an expert, so I’ll have to thoroughly investigate this place. I’ll request for additional troops to be deployed…. It’ll be a race against the time for us. They(TLN: the humans) will comeback after they reorganize themselves.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let us start the hunt again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The members of the Dragon’s Shadow rushed towards the fleeing Dragon Demon Princess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>4</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was used to being chased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Humans were always numerically inferior in the fight against the Dragon Demon race. The number of Dragon Demon race were small, but they subjugated monsters and demonic animals to fight in their army. When they were unorganized, the monsters and demonic animals couldn’t stand up against the might of the human armies. However, they were enslaved by the Dragon Demon race, and they were reborn as a terrifying power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m experiencing the same exact situation as before.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people, who revealed themselves to be the ‘Dragon’s Shadow’, made Azell think about the Dragon Demon race from 220 years ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If I’m alone, then I could escape easily….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was looking around the area while on top of a tree. He threw his gaze downwards, and he saw three members of his party. It was the Dragon Demon Princess Arrieta, her young maid Enora, and Rick, who he had rescued during all the confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I don’t know what happened to Sir Giles.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He got separated from Giles. He had no way to know if he was dead or alive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell looked at Arrieta.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’ve take on a really big burden.’</span></p>
