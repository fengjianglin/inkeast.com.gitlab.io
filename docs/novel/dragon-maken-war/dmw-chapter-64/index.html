  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Chapter 64 - Those who Follow the Prophecy (3)</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">While he was thinking this, Azell couldn't help, but ask the question.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Still, the people were suffering yet you didn't think about helping them?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell expected the youth to feel tormented by the guilt he felt, but the youth was extremely unperturbed. It was a face that said he didn't care if people around him was raped and killed.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">The youth spoke.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I did.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You did?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“…….”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell and Kairen looked at each other. His answer was unexpected, since he said it so matter of factly. The youth's expression was so nonchalant that his word didn't have a ring of truth.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">The youth kept speaking.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“However, it was more important for me to save my life instead of helping them. &nbsp;Are my answers sufficient, Azell Zestringer?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shweeeng!</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">In a flash, a line of silver light appeared in front of the youth's eyes. When he realized something had flashed, Azell's sword point was already aimed at his neck.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“How do you know my name?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">4</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">The tense sense of danger swept over the youth. &nbsp;The youth spoke with a slightly shaky voice.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I can easily give you the answer.... &nbsp;Can we do that after you put away your sword?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Do you want me draw a bloody line across your neck?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You are much more scarier than I imagined...”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">The young man spoke in an awkward manner.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I'm here to test whether you are the prophesied person. &nbsp;I am the Guardian Shadow's Keeper of Prophecy. &nbsp;My name is Leone. Will that be sufficient for my introduction?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You are part of the Guardian Shadows?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell's brows furrowed. Kairen asked a question as if there was neither rhyme nor reason about it.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“A kid like you is part of the Guardian Shadows?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Age isn't that important when becoming a Guardian Shadow, Dragon Sword Duke.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">The youth was letting out cold sweat as he retreated backwards. &nbsp;Azell decided to sheathe his sword for now.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">The youth named Leone spoke with a bright smile on his face.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The only important thing is what one can bring to the cause and effect. Anyways, I was chasing you down, but this meeting was unplanned. &nbsp;Originally, I planned on visiting you both at night. &nbsp;You are overflowing with the sense of justice, Azell Zestringer.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I'm overflowing with the sense of justice... &nbsp; I have a mountainous amount of things to say on the subject, but I’ll omit it for now. Did you just say you were chasing after &nbsp;us?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“For how long?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It's been awhile. &nbsp;However, it was only today that I knew I would be able to catch up to the both of you.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Basically, you always knew where we were located?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“…….”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell's eyes held disbelief.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">‘I wasn't able to feel their sight on me?’</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">This meant Leone had tracked down Azell using magic of farsight. &nbsp;Azell couldn't accept the fact that he hadn't been able sense the gaze that would have been upon him. &nbsp;Was there a technique within the Guardian Shadow that was able to avoid Azell's detection?</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">‘If I think about the time the Guardian Shadow first appeared, that could be a possibility.’</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell was confident in his sensing ability, but he didn't consider it to be absolute. &nbsp; The Detection technique and Concealment skills &nbsp;had a biting or being bitten relationship. &nbsp;One couldn’t predict, which techniques might gain the upper hand. &nbsp;When he thought about the first meeting where he saw the Guardian Shadow, he hadn’t been able to sense it until it got within 20 meters of him….</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell asked a question.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“How did you track us?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“That's easy. &nbsp;I just had to ask for the Dragon Sword Duke's location from the Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;Since you two were traveling so fast, I had a hard time following the both of you.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“…ah. So that's how it is.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">He could now understand why he didn't detect any gaze on him. &nbsp;They hadn't been monitoring Azell.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Leone spoke to the slightly dejected Azell.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I'm sure you are a human, yet you are a vessel for the Dragon Demon magic. &nbsp;You aren't a Dragon Majin, yet...”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Dragon Majin was the offspring between a human and a being from the Dragon Demon race. As the line becomes more mixed with humans, the special characteristics of a Dragon Majin disappeared, and a regular human was born. &nbsp;At that point, any trace of the Dragon Demon magic disappeared.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, Azell held the scent of the Dragon Demon magic. &nbsp;This was caused by him absorbing a Dragon's power through the Dragon Slayer's Ritual.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Leone spoke in an interested manner.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I have no idea why you would have the scent of the Dragon Demon magic. &nbsp;However, I've been told there hasn't been a human like you in hundred years.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Bullshit.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You are saying that, but you are human. This undermines the credibility of your words.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ah ah. I am… &nbsp;No, I should be seen as exception to the norm. &nbsp;We are looking for the being from the prophecy. &nbsp;He can't be one of us, yet he has to satisfy certain conditions.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The prophesied being? What are you talking about?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Unless I can confirm that you are the being foretold by the prophecy, I won't be able to tell you.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This is also the first time I've heard about this. &nbsp;Why wasn't I informed?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Kairen spoke. He had shown dedication in his work as a member of the Guardian Shadow, yet he wasn't informed of this fact. &nbsp;He was displeased that a young man knew more about this situation than him.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Leone spoke.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The prophecy isn't known to all the members of the Guardian Shadows. The Keeper of the Prophecy knows it. &nbsp;The Keeper of the Prophecy are beings, who willingly dedicates one’s life to the prophecy.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sacrifice? Keeper of the Prophecy?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Only those who gives up on one's own future to protect and aid in the prophecy can become the Keeper of the Prophecy. &nbsp;This doesn't apply to you, Duke.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“So being a dedicated member of the Guardian Shadow is insufficient? &nbsp;It seems secrets I don't like keeps popping up as time passes.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Well, it isn't as if I like my current situation. &nbsp;Still, the arrow has been shot, and it can’t be withdrawn.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Leone had a bright smile as he spoke. &nbsp;Azell asked a question as if he found it objectionable.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If you are a member of the Guardian Shadow, don't you have the duty to protect the population from the Dragon Demon King worshippers? &nbsp;Yet you didn't stop the bandits in front of your eyes from pillaging the village just because you valued your own life more than theirs. Truthfully, I cannot trust your words.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You are severley misinformed about us, Azell Zestringer.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Leone spoke with a sour expression on his face.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“We aren't particularly burning with the sense of duty to protect the population. &nbsp;Moreover, we aren't doing carrying out the cause of justice.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Then what are you fighting for?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“We want to eradicate the Dragon Demon Worshippers, and the final goal is to kill the Dragon Demon King once and for all. &nbsp;That is our goal. &nbsp;If one wants to save the people dying in front of one's eyes, it is the prerogative of the individual. &nbsp;However, it has nothing to do with the goal of the &nbsp;Guardian Shadows.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“…….”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“By your expression, it seems you have a great misconception of us. &nbsp;I'll be clear. The Guardian Shadow isn't an organization that upholds justice. We fight against the Dragon Demon King and his worshipper. &nbsp;We just safeguard the human race from them.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mmm…….”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell realized disappointment and anger was simmering within him.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Leone smiled as if he had a mask on his face. &nbsp; He had a bright smile, but his words didn't match his expression. &nbsp;He gave off a very eccentric feeling.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If one had to choose between the duty towards humans and shutting down the Dragon Demon Worshippers, I would willingly choose the latter. &nbsp;That is what the Guardian Shadow is all about.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“…I'll admit I misunderstood the intentions of the Guardian Shadow.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell fought to push down his anger as he admitted he had a preconceived notion of the Guardian's Shadow.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">‘They only want to stop the Dragon Demon Worshippers.’</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell had gone through the Dragon Demon war. He had the noble idea of wanting to carry out justice for the people. &nbsp;However, the Guardian Shadows and Leone moved to a different standard.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Leone spoke.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It is a relief that you understand us now. &nbsp;From now on, you won't look favorably at what we have to do to you. &nbsp;It'll be awkward if you misunderstand our intentions.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You will find out once the night comes. Please be patient until then... If you don't mind, may I travel with you guys? &nbsp;I'll be following you anyways.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“…….”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell and Kairen had big frowns on their face. &nbsp;Leone was still smiling as if he had a mask on his face.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">5</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell and Kairen departed the farming village, and they traveled to their destination at high speed. &nbsp;The two of them moved at a pace unimaginable to a normal person, yet the youth was unexpectedly keeping up. Magicians were able to fly through the air. &nbsp;This mode of travel was very advantageous, since terrains didn't bother the magician. &nbsp;The youth flew at high speeds for a long time, yet he had enough energy to spare.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ho-ooh.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">When they reached a town, Azell rented out a room at an inn. &nbsp;He washed his tired body, then he fell into meditation within his room. Before he went into his mediation, Azell gathered a Magic Aggregate in both hands, and he drank it. &nbsp;Kairen asked in surprise.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What are you doing?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I'm recovering my magic.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I've never seen such a method. &nbsp;Is it worth doing??”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“When one is trying to immediately recover one's exhausted magical reservoir, it is better than a calm meditation. &nbsp;If one wants to fill up one's Energy Pulse with dense magic, the normal way would be more effective.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Basically, Azell was implying that he might need to use his magic soon.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Kairen asked a question.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Do you think we'll have to fight that child?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“There is no guarantee. &nbsp;However, when I heard his tone of voice, I don't think this meeting will be pleasant for us.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hmmm. The Guardian Shadows is becoming more bizarre as I learn more about them.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You are a member, so you shouldn't speak like that.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“However, I am angry that I was kept in the dark until now. &nbsp;They dared to use me, yet they hid the important information from me.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Kairen looked to be in a very bad mood. &nbsp;He was called the Dragon Demon Duke, and he was revered by the people. &nbsp;In regards to information, he was always first to be informed. &nbsp;He was the one, who kept important information from others. &nbsp;He had never been on the other side of the equation. &nbsp;This was why he didn't like how this organization called the Guardian Shadow was being run.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell was recovering his magic when he slowly opened his eyes.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“…it's here.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mmm? Can you feel something?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Kairen still couldn't sense anything.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell spoke.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I can't feel its energy. &nbsp;However... &nbsp;I can most definitely tell that it is 'watching me'.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">At that moment, someone was watching Azell from afar. Moreover, it seemed this being realized he was compromised. &nbsp;The being let out a ominous magical wave, and it stimulated Azell's senses.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Kairen's expression hardened.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This is…….”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It has the stench of Black Magic. It's probably an Undead.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">A being, who had used forbidden magic to overcome death, was making his presence known. &nbsp;This being let out his presence from afar. &nbsp;The presence was very dim, yet it was enough for the two of them to sense it.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Kairen asked a question as he watched Azell arm himself.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Will you be ok?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">For the past couple days, Azell had been on a forced march, and he had accumulated a lot of fatigue. &nbsp;His body was exhausted, and his Energy Pulse wasn't in a good condition.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell spoke.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“In any fight, my opponent won't be considerate about what kind of condition I am in. &nbsp;The probability of finding a fair fight is the same as finding an opponent, who has lost his mind. &nbsp;It is very rare. The person expecting a fair fight, while a sword is pointed at one's throat, is the stupid one.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sometimes, you say words that I really like. &nbsp;It puts me in a tough position.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Kairen grinned as he followed after Azell.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">The two of them erased their presence, and they secretly exited the inn. They stretched their senses into the surrounding, and they heard the whispers of restless spirits. &nbsp;They detected an ominous energy. &nbsp;This was an invitation being sent by their opponents.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell spoke.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“There are three of them.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“There are three of them including the one following us from the back.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell pointed backwards. Leone was following them in plain sight.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Kairen spoke.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The other two… Did you find this out through your ability to sense other people's gaze?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“That is a very desirable technique. &nbsp;I can feel a very dim sensation, yet I can't pin point it for sure....”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I'll teach it to you later. &nbsp;Of course, I'll have to receive something in return.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Just don't overcharge me too much.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It'll depend on how you act from now on.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">While they were speaking, the two of them arrived at a hill that was about 2km away from the town.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was a being standing there with the moonlight shining down behind his back.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">His opponent spoke.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">&lt;Azell Zestringer?&gt;</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">The voice that asked the question was very bleak. &nbsp;One got goosebumps just from listening to it, and the voice invoked a instinctive fear within oneself. &nbsp;The sound wasn't formed by the vibrations of a living being's vocal cords. &nbsp;It was evidence that this undead being was using Black Magic to produce sound.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell queried.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Before you ask the other person for his identity, shouldn't you should reveal your own first?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">&lt;It seems you are him. &nbsp;I'm Zeta. That is all you need to know. &nbsp;If you want to know more....&gt;</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Puh-luhk!</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Undead being billowed his cape that had been covering his body. &nbsp;Beneath the moonlight, a Skeleton Knight encased in a dark metal with an ominous red-black line running down the armor appeared. Two strong light was shining within the helm where the eyes should be.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">&lt;Acquire your qualification by surviving against my sword.&gt;</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You are only an Undead yet you are blathering about such nonsense. Bring it on.”</p>
  <p></p>

 <p dir="ltr">Chapter 64 - Those who Follow the Prophecy (3)</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">While he was thinking this, Azell couldn't help, but ask the question.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Still, the people were suffering yet you didn't think about helping them?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell expected the youth to feel tormented by the guilt he felt, but the youth was extremely unperturbed. It was a face that said he didn't care if people around him was raped and killed.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">The youth spoke.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I did.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You did?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“…….”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell and Kairen looked at each other. His answer was unexpected, since he said it so matter of factly. The youth's expression was so nonchalant that his word didn't have a ring of truth.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">The youth kept speaking.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“However, it was more important for me to save my life instead of helping them. &nbsp;Are my answers sufficient, Azell Zestringer?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shweeeng!</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">In a flash, a line of silver light appeared in front of the youth's eyes. When he realized something had flashed, Azell's sword point was already aimed at his neck.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“How do you know my name?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">4</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">The tense sense of danger swept over the youth. &nbsp;The youth spoke with a slightly shaky voice.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I can easily give you the answer.... &nbsp;Can we do that after you put away your sword?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Do you want me draw a bloody line across your neck?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You are much more scarier than I imagined...”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">The young man spoke in an awkward manner.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I'm here to test whether you are the prophesied person. &nbsp;I am the Guardian Shadow's Keeper of Prophecy. &nbsp;My name is Leone. Will that be sufficient for my introduction?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You are part of the Guardian Shadows?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell's brows furrowed. Kairen asked a question as if there was neither rhyme nor reason about it.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“A kid like you is part of the Guardian Shadows?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Age isn't that important when becoming a Guardian Shadow, Dragon Sword Duke.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">The youth was letting out cold sweat as he retreated backwards. &nbsp;Azell decided to sheathe his sword for now.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">The youth named Leone spoke with a bright smile on his face.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The only important thing is what one can bring to the cause and effect. Anyways, I was chasing you down, but this meeting was unplanned. &nbsp;Originally, I planned on visiting you both at night. &nbsp;You are overflowing with the sense of justice, Azell Zestringer.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I'm overflowing with the sense of justice... &nbsp; I have a mountainous amount of things to say on the subject, but I’ll omit it for now. Did you just say you were chasing after &nbsp;us?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“For how long?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It's been awhile. &nbsp;However, it was only today that I knew I would be able to catch up to the both of you.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Basically, you always knew where we were located?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“…….”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell's eyes held disbelief.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">‘I wasn't able to feel their sight on me?’</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">This meant Leone had tracked down Azell using magic of farsight. &nbsp;Azell couldn't accept the fact that he hadn't been able sense the gaze that would have been upon him. &nbsp;Was there a technique within the Guardian Shadow that was able to avoid Azell's detection?</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">‘If I think about the time the Guardian Shadow first appeared, that could be a possibility.’</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell was confident in his sensing ability, but he didn't consider it to be absolute. &nbsp; The Detection technique and Concealment skills &nbsp;had a biting or being bitten relationship. &nbsp;One couldn’t predict, which techniques might gain the upper hand. &nbsp;When he thought about the first meeting where he saw the Guardian Shadow, he hadn’t been able to sense it until it got within 20 meters of him….</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell asked a question.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“How did you track us?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“That's easy. &nbsp;I just had to ask for the Dragon Sword Duke's location from the Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;Since you two were traveling so fast, I had a hard time following the both of you.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“…ah. So that's how it is.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">He could now understand why he didn't detect any gaze on him. &nbsp;They hadn't been monitoring Azell.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Leone spoke to the slightly dejected Azell.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I'm sure you are a human, yet you are a vessel for the Dragon Demon magic. &nbsp;You aren't a Dragon Majin, yet...”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Dragon Majin was the offspring between a human and a being from the Dragon Demon race. As the line becomes more mixed with humans, the special characteristics of a Dragon Majin disappeared, and a regular human was born. &nbsp;At that point, any trace of the Dragon Demon magic disappeared.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, Azell held the scent of the Dragon Demon magic. &nbsp;This was caused by him absorbing a Dragon's power through the Dragon Slayer's Ritual.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Leone spoke in an interested manner.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I have no idea why you would have the scent of the Dragon Demon magic. &nbsp;However, I've been told there hasn't been a human like you in hundred years.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Bullshit.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You are saying that, but you are human. This undermines the credibility of your words.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ah ah. I am… &nbsp;No, I should be seen as exception to the norm. &nbsp;We are looking for the being from the prophecy. &nbsp;He can't be one of us, yet he has to satisfy certain conditions.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The prophesied being? What are you talking about?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Unless I can confirm that you are the being foretold by the prophecy, I won't be able to tell you.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This is also the first time I've heard about this. &nbsp;Why wasn't I informed?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Kairen spoke. He had shown dedication in his work as a member of the Guardian Shadow, yet he wasn't informed of this fact. &nbsp;He was displeased that a young man knew more about this situation than him.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Leone spoke.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The prophecy isn't known to all the members of the Guardian Shadows. The Keeper of the Prophecy knows it. &nbsp;The Keeper of the Prophecy are beings, who willingly dedicates one’s life to the prophecy.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sacrifice? Keeper of the Prophecy?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Only those who gives up on one's own future to protect and aid in the prophecy can become the Keeper of the Prophecy. &nbsp;This doesn't apply to you, Duke.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“So being a dedicated member of the Guardian Shadow is insufficient? &nbsp;It seems secrets I don't like keeps popping up as time passes.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Well, it isn't as if I like my current situation. &nbsp;Still, the arrow has been shot, and it can’t be withdrawn.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Leone had a bright smile as he spoke. &nbsp;Azell asked a question as if he found it objectionable.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“If you are a member of the Guardian Shadow, don't you have the duty to protect the population from the Dragon Demon King worshippers? &nbsp;Yet you didn't stop the bandits in front of your eyes from pillaging the village just because you valued your own life more than theirs. Truthfully, I cannot trust your words.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You are severley misinformed about us, Azell Zestringer.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Leone spoke with a sour expression on his face.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“We aren't particularly burning with the sense of duty to protect the population. &nbsp;Moreover, we aren't doing carrying out the cause of justice.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Then what are you fighting for?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“We want to eradicate the Dragon Demon Worshippers, and the final goal is to kill the Dragon Demon King once and for all. &nbsp;That is our goal. &nbsp;If one wants to save the people dying in front of one's eyes, it is the prerogative of the individual. &nbsp;However, it has nothing to do with the goal of the &nbsp;Guardian Shadows.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“…….”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“By your expression, it seems you have a great misconception of us. &nbsp;I'll be clear. The Guardian Shadow isn't an organization that upholds justice. We fight against the Dragon Demon King and his worshipper. &nbsp;We just safeguard the human race from them.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mmm…….”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell realized disappointment and anger was simmering within him.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Leone smiled as if he had a mask on his face. &nbsp; He had a bright smile, but his words didn't match his expression. &nbsp;He gave off a very eccentric feeling.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“If one had to choose between the duty towards humans and shutting down the Dragon Demon Worshippers, I would willingly choose the latter. &nbsp;That is what the Guardian Shadow is all about.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“…I'll admit I misunderstood the intentions of the Guardian Shadow.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell fought to push down his anger as he admitted he had a preconceived notion of the Guardian's Shadow.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">‘They only want to stop the Dragon Demon Worshippers.’</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell had gone through the Dragon Demon war. He had the noble idea of wanting to carry out justice for the people. &nbsp;However, the Guardian Shadows and Leone moved to a different standard.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Leone spoke.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It is a relief that you understand us now. &nbsp;From now on, you won't look favorably at what we have to do to you. &nbsp;It'll be awkward if you misunderstand our intentions.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You will find out once the night comes. Please be patient until then... If you don't mind, may I travel with you guys? &nbsp;I'll be following you anyways.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“…….”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell and Kairen had big frowns on their face. &nbsp;Leone was still smiling as if he had a mask on his face.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">5</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell and Kairen departed the farming village, and they traveled to their destination at high speed. &nbsp;The two of them moved at a pace unimaginable to a normal person, yet the youth was unexpectedly keeping up. Magicians were able to fly through the air. &nbsp;This mode of travel was very advantageous, since terrains didn't bother the magician. &nbsp;The youth flew at high speeds for a long time, yet he had enough energy to spare.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ho-ooh.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">When they reached a town, Azell rented out a room at an inn. &nbsp;He washed his tired body, then he fell into meditation within his room. Before he went into his mediation, Azell gathered a Magic Aggregate in both hands, and he drank it. &nbsp;Kairen asked in surprise.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What are you doing?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I'm recovering my magic.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I've never seen such a method. &nbsp;Is it worth doing??”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“When one is trying to immediately recover one's exhausted magical reservoir, it is better than a calm meditation. &nbsp;If one wants to fill up one's Energy Pulse with dense magic, the normal way would be more effective.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Basically, Azell was implying that he might need to use his magic soon.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Kairen asked a question.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Do you think we'll have to fight that child?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“There is no guarantee. &nbsp;However, when I heard his tone of voice, I don't think this meeting will be pleasant for us.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hmmm. The Guardian Shadows is becoming more bizarre as I learn more about them.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You are a member, so you shouldn't speak like that.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“However, I am angry that I was kept in the dark until now. &nbsp;They dared to use me, yet they hid the important information from me.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Kairen looked to be in a very bad mood. &nbsp;He was called the Dragon Demon Duke, and he was revered by the people. &nbsp;In regards to information, he was always first to be informed. &nbsp;He was the one, who kept important information from others. &nbsp;He had never been on the other side of the equation. &nbsp;This was why he didn't like how this organization called the Guardian Shadow was being run.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell was recovering his magic when he slowly opened his eyes.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“…it's here.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mmm? Can you feel something?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Kairen still couldn't sense anything.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell spoke.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I can't feel its energy. &nbsp;However... &nbsp;I can most definitely tell that it is 'watching me'.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">At that moment, someone was watching Azell from afar. Moreover, it seemed this being realized he was compromised. &nbsp;The being let out a ominous magical wave, and it stimulated Azell's senses.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Kairen's expression hardened.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This is…….”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It has the stench of Black Magic. It's probably an Undead.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">A being, who had used forbidden magic to overcome death, was making his presence known. &nbsp;This being let out his presence from afar. &nbsp;The presence was very dim, yet it was enough for the two of them to sense it.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Kairen asked a question as he watched Azell arm himself.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Will you be ok?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">For the past couple days, Azell had been on a forced march, and he had accumulated a lot of fatigue. &nbsp;His body was exhausted, and his Energy Pulse wasn't in a good condition.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell spoke.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“In any fight, my opponent won't be considerate about what kind of condition I am in. &nbsp;The probability of finding a fair fight is the same as finding an opponent, who has lost his mind. &nbsp;It is very rare. The person expecting a fair fight, while a sword is pointed at one's throat, is the stupid one.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sometimes, you say words that I really like. &nbsp;It puts me in a tough position.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Kairen grinned as he followed after Azell.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">The two of them erased their presence, and they secretly exited the inn. They stretched their senses into the surrounding, and they heard the whispers of restless spirits. &nbsp;They detected an ominous energy. &nbsp;This was an invitation being sent by their opponents.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell spoke.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“There are three of them.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“There are three of them including the one following us from the back.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell pointed backwards. Leone was following them in plain sight.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Kairen spoke.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The other two… Did you find this out through your ability to sense other people's gaze?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“That is a very desirable technique. &nbsp;I can feel a very dim sensation, yet I can't pin point it for sure....”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I'll teach it to you later. &nbsp;Of course, I'll have to receive something in return.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Just don't overcharge me too much.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It'll depend on how you act from now on.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">While they were speaking, the two of them arrived at a hill that was about 2km away from the town.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was a being standing there with the moonlight shining down behind his back.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">His opponent spoke.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">&lt;Azell Zestringer?&gt;</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">The voice that asked the question was very bleak. &nbsp;One got goosebumps just from listening to it, and the voice invoked a instinctive fear within oneself. &nbsp;The sound wasn't formed by the vibrations of a living being's vocal cords. &nbsp;It was evidence that this undead being was using Black Magic to produce sound.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell queried.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Before you ask the other person for his identity, shouldn't you should reveal your own first?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">&lt;It seems you are him. &nbsp;I'm Zeta. That is all you need to know. &nbsp;If you want to know more....&gt;</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Puh-luhk!</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Undead being billowed his cape that had been covering his body. &nbsp;Beneath the moonlight, a Skeleton Knight encased in a dark metal with an ominous red-black line running down the armor appeared. Two strong light was shining within the helm where the eyes should be.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">&lt;Acquire your qualification by surviving against my sword.&gt;</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You are only an Undead yet you are blathering about such nonsense. Bring it on.”</p>
 <p></p>
