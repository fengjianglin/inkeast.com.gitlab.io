 <p>Chapter 87 - Birth of the Dragon Sword (2)</p>
 <p><span style>3</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two weeks had passed. &nbsp;During this time, Kairen had experienced his pride become thoroughly wrecked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-ook. &nbsp;Shit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a round of sparring session, Kairen spoke as he healed the wounds on his cheeks. &nbsp;He spoke as he glared at Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How many secret techniques do you have? &nbsp;Every time it looks like I'm about to break one another new technique come out. &nbsp;It feels like an infinite loop.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I still have 472 left.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…is that for real?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm joking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ughhh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had been two weeks since Azell had gained the Dragon Sword. &nbsp;The two of them had participated in fierce sparring matches everyday. &nbsp;Currently, they had already conducted over 200 sparring matches. &nbsp;They've already demolished two training halls, and these halls were in the process of being rebuilt. &nbsp;They had to move their location to the mountain, and everything was being overturned as they clashed with each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, the result was....</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen had lost all of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some sparring matches lasted less than 5 minutes, and there were long training sessions that lasted over an hour. &nbsp;Every match had different conditions and rules set as they fought each others to test their mettle as martial artists.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen flopped backwards as he lie on the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. I really can't do this any more!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you finally giving up? &nbsp;Wow. &nbsp;In truth, I was getting a bit tired of this. &nbsp;I'm glad. &nbsp;Now I can sleep in a comfortable bed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell smirked. For the past 2 weeks, Kairen had been very dogged in his request for matches that it was wearing a little thin for Azell. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>'One more match! &nbsp;I want one more match!'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen kept repeating those words as he charged towards Azell. &nbsp;He didn't have much time to rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen was going to retort, but he just sighed as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel as if I'm 80 years younger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you are saying you are like a 20 year old young man. Does this mean I can treat you as an equal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don't push your luck or the the status quo we have right now might be scrapped.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke as he snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I've never been thoroughly beaten like this, since my father trained me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are talking about the previous Duke of Tarantos.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;It was hard to find any good opponents after my father passed away..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When did your father pass away?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As I said before, it was around 80 years ago. It was right when I was about to enter into my sleep cycle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon Race was an amalgamation of Dragons and Demons. &nbsp;This was why the Dragon Demon race shared the activity and sleep pattern of these races. &nbsp;During childhood, it was common for a Dragon Demon to fall into a hibernation period every few years. &nbsp;If it was short, it would last one week. &nbsp;If it was long, it would last a month or two. &nbsp;This happened quite frequently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen was deep in his recollection.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is why I didn't get to see my parents for the last time. &nbsp;I was told later that the Dragon Demon King worshippers had targeted me during my hibernation period, and they caused a lot of problems. &nbsp;Our castle was set on fire, so I don't have single picture of them left in my possession.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Well, don't look at me like that. &nbsp;This happened a long time ago. My mother and father died by the hands of the villains... &nbsp;This was also why I chose to become a Guardian Shadow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen let out a bitter laugh. &nbsp;It had already been over 80 years. &nbsp;However, the wound was still present inside Kairen's heart. &nbsp;It was also the main motivation behind his fight against the Dragon Demon king worshippers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke as he stood up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For all my life, I trained in an attempt to surpass my father. &nbsp;There were too many things I wasn't able to learn from my father. &nbsp;However, I've been running out of available skills that I can learn from others, so I believed I had achieved my goal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was called the Dragon Sword Duke, and no one in the kingdom could teach him anything new about the martial arts. &nbsp;It was actually the opposite now. &nbsp;Everyone was trying to learn from him. &nbsp;This was why Kairen didn't stop his efforts to get better. &nbsp;He wanted to surpass the prior goal he had set. &nbsp;The creation of the Dragon Weapons had been part of that plan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, I now realize that I have been too arrogant. &nbsp;This is the thought I had when I was thoroughly defeated by you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your were right to think that way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren't you suppose to console me by saying it isn't true?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I forgot the duke likes people paying lip service to you. &nbsp;I'll rephrase my words. &nbsp;You are wrong. &nbsp;If you parent heard what you have achieved, they would most definitely feel a swell of pride at the fact that you have surpassed....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…stop. &nbsp;&nbsp;You are giving me the goosebumps.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen grumbled then he laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please continue speaking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Which approach do you want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don't pay lip service to me. &nbsp;Just tell me what you were originally going to say.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In my opinion....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell paused for a brief moment before he continued to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your predecessor might have.... &nbsp;I believe your father was learning what is called the 'forgotten technique'. &nbsp;It was a term coined by the Dragon Demon King worshippers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Like you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you saying they probably wanted to eliminate the knowledge from being passed on to the future generations, so my father was eliminated?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is what I think. &nbsp;I also believe the castle was intentionally set on fire to burn the records. &nbsp;If what I suffered up until now is any indication, I think it is quite possible they put in a lot of effort into making that happen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two hundred twenty years was a long time for the humans, but it was almost a single life span for the Dragon Demons. &nbsp;These beings lived as part of the human society, so the knowledge and techniques wouldn't be easily forgotten.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the fact that one was from the Dragon Demon race didn’t mean they all learned magic or the Dragon arts. &nbsp;Even if they did, they didn't learn it to the extreme for the express purpose of battle. &nbsp;Moreover, they weren't going to willingly pass on the knowledge and techniques to strangers. &nbsp;This was why it was enough for the Dragon Demon King worshippers to eliminate the beings that had critical knowledge, and the high level techniques.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I've heard it from Mr Havanz. &nbsp;The knowledge of the Dragon Slayer's Ritual and the Dragon Arts wasn't passed down in Sir Rogan's family.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, Count Aldrick's children weren't inclined towards martial arts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wouldn't that make it more likely that he would have been targeted?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is a little bit weird for me to say, but.... &nbsp;I can teach you some of the stuff you were supposed to have learned from you father. &nbsp;At the very least, I can teach you a portion of it. &nbsp;I have a lot to teach you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I would have never expected to hear such words from a human that is the age of my grandchild if I had one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you averse to it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm not saying that, because I don't like the idea. &nbsp;Now I have something to learn, and there is someone willing to teach me. &nbsp;This is... &nbsp;I'm in a bit of an unfamiliar territory.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen put on a bitter smile. It had been a long time, since he was the one learning from someone else. &nbsp;For a long time, everyone put him on a pedestal, and they wanted to learn from him. &nbsp;Moreover, Kairen had thought that was how it should be. &nbsp;Now he was in the position to be the student learning from someone else. &nbsp;He had never imagined such a day would have come.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen suddenly asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Azell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you being so good to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You were also good to me... &nbsp;Isn't that enough?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is hard for me to accept that. &nbsp;These techniques are something I wouldn't even teach to a friend. &nbsp;I would understand it if you had decided to take up the sword and use those techniques for my cause. &nbsp;However, you plan on teaching me these valuable techniques... &nbsp;As a martial artist, I question why you are doing this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whether it was a magician, Spirit Order practitioner or Dragon Arts practitioner, it was all the same. &nbsp;All of them were very careful in choosing the candidates they'll pass on their techniques and knowledge to. &nbsp;Kairen had taught Arrieta and Seigar at the plea of the Dragon Demon Queen. &nbsp;However, he didn't have a true disciple yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell could understand what Kairen was thinking. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a brief moment of thought, he spoke the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is needed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Needed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is to prepare for the danger that might come in the near future... &nbsp;I feel the need to return the power that was stolen from the beings that the Dragon Demon worshippers consider to be enemies.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon king worshippers had weakened the power of the population and those that might rise up against them through a long period of time. &nbsp;At the same time, they had kept their history and techniques intact. &nbsp;It was a very dangerous situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it is as they believe and the Dragon Demon King Atein really revives....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell remembered going up against Atein. &nbsp;He was the first of the Dragon Demon race, and he was also the world's first magician. &nbsp;He had lived as long as the existence of a single race. He was an unnatural being that looked at the world through a strange and long range view.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Dragon Demon King worshippers that reside in the far-away Plains of Darkness will sweep over the world again. &nbsp;When that time comes, we need power to be able to fight against them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think we'll be at a disadvantage if it does happen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;Currently, our side has forgotten about the Dragon Slayer's Ritual, and the Dragon Demon Qi. &nbsp;Moreover, our side forgot the true techniques behind the Spirit Order and Dragon Arts. &nbsp;If our enemies use these knowledge against us, we will be powerless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You said Dragon Demon Qi. &nbsp;You still haven't given an explanation on what it is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had mentioned the Dragon Demon Qi when he explained the Dragon Slayer's Ritual. &nbsp;However, he had too many questions he had wanted to ask that Kairen had half-forgotten about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell didn't answer his question. &nbsp;He continued to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was impressed by the duke. &nbsp;The fact that.... &nbsp;You were able to make the Dragon Sword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, there were only scraps of record left regarding the Dragon Demon Qi. &nbsp;However, Kairen had spent 30 years to gather these scraps, and he had made the Dragon Sword through these efforts. &nbsp;It was a less powerful than having the Dragon Demon Qi, but it was much superior in the fact that it was a tool that anyone would be able to use. &nbsp;It was superior to the Dragon Demon Qi in that aspect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you tell me that the record you had found was the impetus in making the Dragon Weapons?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is correct.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That record was about the Dragon Demon Qi..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell started to explain to Kairen about the Dragon Demon Qi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soul had to be used as ingredient as it was refined through the Dragon's power. &nbsp;This was the ultimate weapon that came out as a result.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Humans and Dragon Majin can take the power of a Dragon through the Dragon Slayer's Ritual, and the Dragon Demon Qi can be produced. &nbsp;This was beyond having a tool of power like the Dragon Swords. &nbsp;It was a miraculous power for the Spirit Order, Dragon Arts and magic that strived for the pinnacle of power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen swallowed his breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Such a thing really exists?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. It was one of the reason why humans were able to win in the fight against the Dragon Demon race. &nbsp;There is a big gulf between those that have and don't have the Dragon Demon Qi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is why the duke has to produce Dragon Demon Qi too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen was surprised. &nbsp;He asked the question as if he didn't understand what had just been said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn't you say the Dragon Demon Qi is made through taking the Dragon's power? &nbsp;Moreover, this can only be done through the Dragon Slayer's ritual?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However. I'm of the Dragon Demon race. &nbsp;I thought you said I couldn't participate in the Dragon Slayer's Ritual.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can't.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then how will I be able to make the Dragon Demon Qi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, I haven’t told you the full story regarding the Dragon Demon Qi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell smirked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I told you that this was made through taking the power of a Dragon by conducting the Dragon Slayer's Ritual. &nbsp;However, I was talking about it through the prism of being a human. &nbsp;The humans don't have Dragon Demon magic in the first place. &nbsp;A human has to defeat a Dragon through the Dragon Slayer's Ritual to gain the Dragon Demon Magic. &nbsp;However, doesn't the Dragon Demon race already have Dragon Demon magic?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why there were those that possessed Dragon Demon Qi within the Dragon Demon race. &nbsp;The most notable being the Dragon Demon King Atein and the Dragon Demon generals, who followed him. &nbsp;Each of them were walking calamities that could face down thousand troops.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, it isn't easy to make it. &nbsp;There are three methods.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell unfurled three fingers, and he lowered one finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The first method is to use the secret technique behind Dragon Demon Qi to produce it yourself. &nbsp;It is the hardest method.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To my knowledge, it takes about 10 years at the earliest to produce it. &nbsp;If it takes a long time, it might take up to a 100 years. &nbsp;If you are from the first generation of the Dragon Demon race, then it might be a different story.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first generation Dragon Demons meant they were directly born from the amalgamation of a Dragon and a Demon. &nbsp;The Dragon Demons that were currently in the human society wasn't first generation Dragon Demons. &nbsp;They were the descendents. &nbsp;&nbsp;However, there were still first generation Dragon Demons born into the world. &nbsp;It happened from time to time. &nbsp;Moreover, these being possessed much more powerful Dragon Demon magic than the descendants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This was true for Atein and the Dragon Demon Generals.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell felt a chill as he thought about how strong they had been. &nbsp;They had Dragons as parents, but they were the first of their kind. &nbsp;They didn't have Dragon Demon parents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell folded his second finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The second method is to combine the power of a Dragon Demon and a Dragon Majin. &nbsp;It could also be a human that possessed Dragon Demon Qi. &nbsp;However, these candidates need to have cultivated their magic or Dragon Demon Qi. &nbsp;Of course, this also take a lot of time and effort.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How long would it take?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It really depends on the skill and quality of the participants. &nbsp;However, the difficult part is... &nbsp;You still fall short of meeting the requirement. &nbsp;If you really learn and train hard, then you might be able to reach the bare minimum requirement. &nbsp;However, do you think you'll be able to find people of similar level as &nbsp;you? &nbsp;Moreover, they would have to sacrifice their Dragon Demon magic to pour this power into you. &nbsp;Ah, I guess Count Michael fits this description. &nbsp;He is a magician, so this sacrifice might matter less than someone training in the Dragon arts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen frowned. &nbsp;Azell had a big smile as he folded his third and last finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The last method is to use the Dragons..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dragons?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is impossible for the Dragon Demons to conduct the Dragon Slayer's Ritual. &nbsp;However, they can use the corpse of the Dragon after killing it. &nbsp;The Dragon Demon race can't absorb the power of the Dragons, but…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the Dragon Demons saw the humans gain power through the Dragon Slayer's Ritual, they attempted to gain power through the same method. &nbsp;However, the Dragon Demons found out that they couldn't absorb the Dragon's power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They can use it to create the Dragon Demon Qi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can kill a Dragon, and you can use its corpse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a massive amount of magic stored inside a Dragon's corpse. &nbsp;One could use this special method to accelerate the formation of Dragon Demon Qi in a Dragon Demon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The efficiency isn't that great, but it can't be helped. &nbsp;The Dragon Demon Qi was meant to be created over a long period of time....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, this was to the best of his knowledge. &nbsp;At the time of the Dragon Demon war, there hadn't been a lot of Dragon Demons in the Dragon Demon army that possessed this power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That means there aren't that many amongst our enemies that possess it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;Even the one called Niberis didn’t have the Dragon Demon Qi yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmmm…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell suddenly asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;You did say they are coming here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems they have various functions they have to attend in the new year. &nbsp;They'll be coming here afterwards. &nbsp;It'll probably take them over two weeks to get here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen grinned as he headed towards the estate with Azell.</span></p>
