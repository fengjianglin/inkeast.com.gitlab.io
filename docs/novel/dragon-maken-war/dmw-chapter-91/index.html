 <p>Chapter 91 - Birth of the Dragon Sword (6)</p>
 <p><span style>If it was during the Dragon Maken War, he would have understood the existence of these humans. &nbsp;It was common for humans to betray their own kind for survival as they crawled underneath the Dragon Demon Army. &nbsp;Then there were some that had been true believers of Dragon Demon King. They believed him to be a god.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, why would such humans exist in this era? &nbsp;Azell was having a hard time comprehending this point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enora spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really speak like someone, who had lived through that era.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought you were going to consider my story as only speculation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I did. &nbsp;Mmm. &nbsp;Doesn't this mean sir Azell is over 200 years old? &nbsp;Should I call you elder from now on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll be thankful if you call me that in about 40 years from now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell let out a bitter laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>9</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was a human, but he was allowed to reside in the Plain of Darkness as a Dragon Demon king worshipper. &nbsp;Black Swordsman Duran thought about the moment when he developed his great faith.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When a human was born, one was either a noble or baseborn. &nbsp;It didn't matter if one were talented. &nbsp;It didn't matter what character one had. &nbsp;If one was born from low caste parents, one would never break above their station no matter how talented one was. &nbsp;One would be treated like trash by those born as nobles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In such an unfair societal structure, Duran had been at the bottom. &nbsp;He had been a slave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were 7 kingdoms that ruled over this continent, and only two allowed slavery. &nbsp;Moreover, slaves were viewed basically as gutter scums.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From a young age, Duran had a massive build, and he was known for his strength. &nbsp;He was a head taller than anyone else in his age group, and no one could surpass him in work that dealt with strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he grew up, he naturally did all the hard work. &nbsp;If violence was needed, he was called to take care of it. &nbsp;When he had shown aptitude for fighting, he was taught martial art. His owner wanted to put him to good use.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, Duran didn't get a big head over his treatment. &nbsp;Even if he was strong, he knew he was insignificant compared to the knights, who had learned Spirit Order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, he hadn’t put these knights on a pedestal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Those bastards are scared at the possibility of us getting stronger.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He first became aware of it when he started learning martial arts. &nbsp;When he learned the systematized techniques that were monopolized by these men, a new world had opened up to Duran.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran had a natural aptitude for martial arts. &nbsp;He learned snippets of technique as he was berated by the snobby men. &nbsp;Still, he was developing much faster than those who were receiving proper tutelage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Duran had an epiphany.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The only advantage they have is the fact that a lot had been passed down to them..’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the same for martial arts and Spirit Order. &nbsp;A person was able to become a great presence through the knowledge one was able to monopolize. &nbsp;If all the secret techniques were shared equally amongst the masses, will they be able to hold superior positions over the people under them?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He made a mistake when he allowed such thoughts to enter his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Thank you. &nbsp;What is your name?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he went out on an excursion, he had come across his master's daughter being attacked by monsters. &nbsp;He threw his body in front of her to save her. &nbsp;The knights, who were supposed to be protecting her, were easily beaten. &nbsp;If Duran hadn't fought as he received severe wounds, the lady would have lost her life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Duran didn't receive any rewards after the incident. &nbsp;Instead, he was punished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A slave dared to touch a sword! &nbsp;Unforgivable!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran had used a dead knight's sword to defeat the monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slaves weren't allowed to pick up any weapons. &nbsp;At the very most, the slave owners allowed slaves to be armed with clubs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a given that slave would be put down even if one touched a sword by mistake. &nbsp;The knights considered their swords to be symbols of their honor. &nbsp;It was considered to be an unforgivable insult if a lowly slave touched one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn't logical, but this was how the world worked here. &nbsp;Where Duran lived, this was common sense. &nbsp;The nobility didn't look at slaves as humans. &nbsp;The slaves were worth less than the cheapest item they owned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran despaired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the time, he really had no choice. &nbsp;He couldn't win using only his fist. He couldn't overcome this situation using only his body. &nbsp;He could run away by himself, but he would later be executed for surviving the encounter, while a noble lady had died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You evil bastard! &nbsp;I showed favor to such a lowly bastard by teaching you martial arts. &nbsp;You dared to steal and learn swordsmanship?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was unfair. &nbsp;He had never learned swordsmanship. &nbsp;He only remembered snippets of swordsmanship he had seen by chance during his martial arts sessions. &nbsp;Even with such limited knowledge, he was able to defeat the monsters. &nbsp;It was the first time he had held a sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran had saved his daughter's life, yet the master was acting as if he had committed an evil act against god and man. &nbsp;He continued to berate Duran with a red face. &nbsp;At that moment, Duran had a thought that was unforgivable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They are all retarded bastards.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The knights had been inferior to him. &nbsp;He had picked up the sword for the first time in his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had done their job for them, yet he was the who had sinned?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The one, who came to the rescue of Duran, was the daughter of his master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Please forgive him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the request of his daughter, her father forgave Duran's transgression. &nbsp;However, it wasn’t as if he had gotten off easy. &nbsp;He was stripped naked as his entire body was chained. &nbsp;Then he was shut in an isolated underground room for 5 days. &nbsp;He wasn't even given water during his punishment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the incident, the lady became interested in Duran.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Duran. &nbsp;There is no way that is a name befitting a slave.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had made Duran her servant, and he was always by her side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she hadn't been a master with a good personality. &nbsp;She became hysteric at minor incidents, and of course, she took out her anger at the people under her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran had become the subject of her tantrums countless of times. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>One day she was taking out her anger on Duran by whipping him when she did something totally unexpected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Hoong. &nbsp;You are probably better compared to that weak bastard.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was after she had broken up with her boyfriend. &nbsp;It was as if she had done it as a retaliation. &nbsp;She brought Duran into her bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the time, Duran had been 19 years old. &nbsp;However, this hadn't been his first experience. &nbsp;At the time, Duran was over 2 meters tall, and he was a massive man with taut muscles. &nbsp;He also had a well-defined and handsome face. &nbsp;He had received countless lustful gazes from the females.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a passionate night session, she always wanted Duran's body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She started showing strong possessiveness, so he had to sever all his relationships with the slave women. &nbsp;If a female slave tried to seduce Duran over any lingering attachment, the female slave would receive severe punishments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, nothing else had changed aside from the sex. &nbsp;She still whipped him when she vented her anger, and she didn't hesitate to verbally abuse him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Duran calmly accepted such a relationship. &nbsp;It wasn't as if he liked it. &nbsp;He just didn't have a choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The problem was... &nbsp;Even though the slave was the victim, he would be treated as the bigger sinner if he did anything against the assailant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How dare you touch my daughter! &nbsp;I forgave you of your past transgression, yet you spat on my generosity? &nbsp;You dared to touch my daughter?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had become pregnant with Duran's child.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a natural outcome. &nbsp;The two of them had mingled their bodies together whether it was day or night. &nbsp;Wouldn't it be more strange if a baby hadn't formed?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the truth was revealed, the entire household was flipped on its head. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the morning, Duran had been working as an attendant. He didn't know the reason behind it, but he was given a beating before his bloodied body was dragged into the yard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was there too. &nbsp;She looked at Duran with tear-filled eyes. &nbsp;Duran had expected nothing out of his life, but her words shattered Duran's heart into pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘H...he threw his body in front of me to save me. &nbsp;I kept him by my side as a favor, yet... &nbsp;When we were out of sight, he forced me to... &nbsp;Ooh-hoohk. &nbsp;I was so scared that I wasn't able to tell anyone...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran wasn't the only one, who was dumbfounded by her words. &nbsp;They had made sure her parents didn't hear about it, but the whole household had known about the illicit affair. &nbsp;It wouldn't be too far-fetched if her family members also suspected what was going on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the truth didn't matter to them. &nbsp;A lowly slave had dared to mingle his body with his daughter. &nbsp;Duran deserved to die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They said Duran's sin was too large for them to give Duran a clean death. &nbsp;They beat him until he was a wreck. &nbsp;After throwing salt on his wounds, they chained him up in the basement prison cell. &nbsp;This process would continue everyday until he would die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was on the fourth day. &nbsp;Duran cursed himself for not taking his own life earlier. &nbsp;Now his entire body was restrained with steel chains, and there was a wooden stick put between his teeth. &nbsp;He couldn't kill himself by biting off his own tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, on the fourth day, a miracle had occurred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one came for him in the morning. &nbsp;Instead, he could hear explosions and screams coming from outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was going on out there? </span></p>
 <p><span style>He was curious, but all he could do was wait for his inevitable death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A Dragon Demon appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Those bastards were very vicious. &nbsp;This man committed no sin, yet they treated him like this. &nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I was too merciful in how I killed them.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon had exterminated the owner and his family. &nbsp;The one, who had rescued Duran, was named Saibein. &nbsp;He was the son of the great Dragon Demon King Atein.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason why Saibein knew about Duran's situation was simple. &nbsp;There had been Dragon Demon King worshippers inside the household.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran hadn't know this at the time, but the worship of the Dragon Demon King was pretty widespread amongst the slaves. The feelings he felt during his lifetime was a fertile soil for accepting this new faith. &nbsp;The world decried the worship of the Dragon Demon king as evil, yet wasn't the people who made those statements also part of an irrational and evil social structure?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Humans are all equal. &nbsp;The determination of a person's status at birth is a tool used by the evil men. The true barometer of one's status shouldn't be determined this way. &nbsp;The Dragon Demon race were born superior to the humans. &nbsp;The true way is for the Dragon Demons to guide the humans from above them. &nbsp;This is how the world should be structured.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran had been about to face the end after living an unreasonable life. &nbsp;Duran was willing to believe. &nbsp;He decided to dedicate his life to the faith of the Dragon Demon King, which had save his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Forty years had passed since that day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran desperately grew his power, and in a rare move, a human was allowed to reside in the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;The Dragon Demons with the royal blood, and the Dragon Majin respected him for his martial prowess and position. &nbsp;They kept their manners.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had fought in countless battles, and he had killed countless enemies in each battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was living a life soaked in blood, but he had no regrets. &nbsp;He wanted to create the correct world, and he sacrificed everything for the day when his great savior would return.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From Duran's perspective, he could’t forgive those that rejected the truth. &nbsp;He couldn't forgive those that defended this unreasonable world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>10</span></p>
 <p><span style>The world viewed the Dragon Demon king worshippers as religious fanatics. &nbsp;They were akin to worshippers of evil. &nbsp;These worshippers had deified the Dragon Demon King, and they believed he would return from his death. &nbsp;They had an ironclad belief that he'll right the wrongs of the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, not everyone in the organizations held such beliefs. &nbsp;These false Dragon Demon king worshippers hid their true intent as they mingled into the rest of the world. &nbsp;As time passed, these people developed different goals separate from their organization. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the Dragon Demon king worshippers didn't forgive such beings. &nbsp;The organization systematically revealed those that no longer shared common goals with them, and there would be no forgiveness. &nbsp;Duran had killed countless betrayers amongst their ranks of Dragon Demon king worshippers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why he didn't show any change in expression in front of a man, who might be better off dead right now. The betrayer was in an appalling state. &nbsp;Duran grabbed the man by his neck as he spoke with a rage-filled voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yuren. &nbsp;Where's the wicked traitor, who has the name seeped in sin?”</span></p>
