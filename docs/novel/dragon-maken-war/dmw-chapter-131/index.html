 <p>Chapter 131 - Fallen Demon (1)</p>
 <p><span style>1</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they exited the border region, Azell’s party moved carefully towards their destination. &nbsp;This location was known to be the habitat for Dragons, so they didn’t want to draw the attention of the Dragons. &nbsp;As expected of a Dragon’s habitat, there were a lot of monsters and beasts there. &nbsp;They had to thoroughly scout the area as they moved stealthily through the land. &nbsp;They avoided getting into a battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While they were making preparations to spend the night outside, Yuren asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wouldn’t you like to do a Dragon Slayer’s Ritual since we are here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t time yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell shook his head from side to side. &nbsp;He was able to digest the Dragon’s power faster through the new training method contained within the skill manual. &nbsp;However, he needed more time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren asked Leticia a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about you, Leticia?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You talk so easily about fighting one on one with a Dragon. &nbsp;You talk lightly of it as if it is a meeting between a young man and a young woman. &nbsp;If you think the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual will be so profitable, why don’t you do it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In truth, I’m not too confident about it myself. &nbsp;Magicians are more disadvantaged against Dragons, and I have to work on getting proper control over my magical energy instead of gaining more Dragon Demon magic…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A black fog like energy emanated from Yuren’s hand. &nbsp;At his core, Yuren was a Black magician. &nbsp;In truth, he used his magic more like a traditional magician, but there was an ominous energy emanating from it. &nbsp;It was the energy of Black magic. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, his energy was overwhelming more ominous and denser compared to other Black magicians. &nbsp;The reason being he had learned a forbidden technique at the guidance of the guide. He had made a connection with the Demon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The magical energy he earned by connecting to the Demon didn’t disappear easily. &nbsp;It had increased Yuren’s magical energy immensely, but at the same time, it was trying to take over his Energy Pulse. &nbsp;Demons wanted to corrupt humans. &nbsp;It allowed them to acquire souls. &nbsp;The Demons were able to eat away at the user’s magical energy using the connection. &nbsp;There was a demonic will contained within it. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why Yuren always worked hard on suppressing the subversion. &nbsp;Recently, the training method from the manual relieved the burden by a notch. &nbsp;The participants gathered their magical energy, and the qualitative nature of the magical energy was synced. &nbsp;Then it imbued Dragon Demon magic to all the participants. This process had an effect of cleansing his magical energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are quite good at using such a dangerous power. &nbsp;That method is forbidden even for those who seek out Black magic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…well, &nbsp;your words are true. &nbsp;Somehow, I feel aggrieved at hearing those words from you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura tilted her head in confusion. &nbsp;She couldn’t understand what he was trying to say. &nbsp;Yuren clicked his tongue as if he couldn’t believe her words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don't you know why? &nbsp;The Plain of Darkness tried to make someone like me artificially. &nbsp;I thought all their attempts had all been unsuccessful, but….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he spoke, Yuren’s eyes naturally started to turn towards someone. &nbsp;He quickly stopped himself. &nbsp;Leticia spoke in a lukewarm manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t have to be considerate of me. It is unnecessary.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, no. &nbsp;It’s….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve never told you about it, so I won’t ask you how you know…. &nbsp;In truth, the answer is obvious. &nbsp;You are a crazy person, who had voluntarily called up a Demon, to make a connection with it. &nbsp;You knew we were tarred with the same brush.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At her words, Laura asked in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You also have a connection with the Demon race?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The fact that I have to hear those words from you makes me mad, but…. &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;If seen in a certain light, you are like me as well as Jeffers Almarick.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia let out a bitter laugh. &nbsp;She had betrayed the Dragon Demon king worshippers as a Dragon Majin, because they had experimented on her with Black magic. &nbsp;She spoke about her past in a calm manner. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t some incredible story. &nbsp;The Aunsaurus family worked toward making the final product in you, Laura Aunsaurus. &nbsp;The Almarick family did something similar. &nbsp;However, they chose to make the children in a more organic manner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is as I’ve said. &nbsp;The men of the Almarick slept with many human women and female Dragon Majins. &nbsp;They required these women to have multiple babies.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If heard in passing, one would think it was a natural attempt at propagating their line. However, Leticia knew the details, so she knew the process wasn’t as benign as it sounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A lot of women were needed to acquire over 100 children. &nbsp;The women were from all over the place. &nbsp;There were the villagers from within the Plain of Darkness, test subjects from outside, kidnapped women…. &nbsp;&nbsp;They were all turned into tools by the Almarick family in an attempt create the child they desired.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia had no idea who her mother was. &nbsp;The Almarick family separated the children from their mothers before they were weaned. &nbsp;She found this out later, but the Almarick family had no intentions of letting the information of what they were doing leak out to the outside. &nbsp;Magic was used to destroy the minds of the women from the beginning. &nbsp;Their bodies were modified, so they were able ‘produce’ as many children as possible. &nbsp;Afterwards, they were all ‘disposed’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…we had no idea about the truth. &nbsp;The children lived on in an attempt to become the ideal heir to Almarick. &nbsp;The education we received was quite severe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the education progressed further, the number of children inevitably shrunk. &nbsp;There were those killed during training sessions or experiments. &nbsp;Then there were those that were labeled as failures. &nbsp;They disappeared to be never seen again. &nbsp;At the time, she hadn’t known what they did with the children, who had failed. &nbsp;Now she knew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was also a failed product.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dropouts were sent to a Black magic research facility, and they became test subjects. &nbsp;Leticia had been one of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The tests that was performed on her was brutal. &nbsp;The training to become the heir was inhumane, but as a test subject for the Black magic experiments, the fact that they were living beings with personalities was ignored.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…however, I couldn’t escape.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The test subjects were under perfect surveillance, and they went through hell on a daily basis. &nbsp;Even the act of running away through death wasn’t allowed. &nbsp;It was a Black magic research lab, so it was normal for them to toy with death. &nbsp;Death wasn’t the end. &nbsp;One suffered more painfully in death. &nbsp;This truth was told to them by demons…. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were basically living within the lowest floor of hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before she knew it, she was staring into the campfire, and her voice shook slightly. &nbsp;She always looked cold on the outside, but there were stacks of memories deep down within her. &nbsp;The memories of pain and fear generated the hate and hostility she felt towards the Dragon Demon king worshippers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was able to escape from that place, because they were covetous of the power of Demons.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Black magic research facility within the Plain of Dark used test subjects as sacrificial lambs. &nbsp;They were given to the Demon race in an attempt to gain more knowledge. &nbsp;They were persistent in their pursuit. &nbsp;They even took a step beyond what was acceptable. &nbsp;They performed banned experiments by connecting test subjects to Demons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As you’ve seen from this guy, it was determined that one can gain immense power through this crazy process. &nbsp;However, &nbsp;there were no cases of success.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the very least, there had been none until Leticia came along.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon race coveted the souls of humans. &nbsp;However, once the connection was made, the Demon didn't try to take over the body. &nbsp;The Demon soon destroyed the body. &nbsp;The hail of evil destroyed the mind, and the body followed. &nbsp;Those killed in such a way couldn’t be raised as an Undead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, the process succeeded in me. &nbsp;I don’t know why it succeeded. &nbsp;&nbsp;I was connected to a Demon, but my case looks different from what Yuren did. &nbsp;There might be a different explanation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the first experiment, the connection lasted 10 seconds before it dissolved. &nbsp;Leticia’s mind and body remained intact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the researchers readied a second experiment. &nbsp;Up until that point, there were less than 10 subjects, who was able to achieve the same result as Leticia. &nbsp;She became a really valuable test subject.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The result of the second test was surprising. &nbsp;The connection was maintained for three minutes yet nothing happened. &nbsp;Normally, the longer period of exposure in the second experiment inevitably led to the destruction of the test subjects. &nbsp;Leticia was able to maintain a longer connection, and she was able to withstand it until the connection was severed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The researchers were happy. &nbsp;They shouted in joy when they finally achieved the result they had desired….</span></p>
 <p><span style>They immediately became pillars of ice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When I look back at it…. I’ve never felt so wronged as what I experience at that moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had received all kinds of torment from them. &nbsp;However, she had given them a clean death before she could exact a proper revenge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An enormous change occured when she was connected to a Demon twice. &nbsp;The Demon was gone, but the evil magical energy remained behind. &nbsp;It was overflowing within her. &nbsp;It had destroyed every mechanism that had been placed to restrain her. &nbsp;Her Dragon Demon magic had also received a boost, so she was able to use the power of ice as easily as breathing. &nbsp;She exceeded most Dragon Majin in terms of power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…however, I didn’t connect to the Demon on purpose like Yuren. &nbsp;I never want to experience it again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t as if I did it because I wanted to. &nbsp;I had no choice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren grumbled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The connection he formed with the Demon race was a trump card he had learned from the guide within his dreams. &nbsp;He hadn’t wanted to use it unless it was absolutely necessary. &nbsp;The burden of controlling such a technique was too high.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He used his rationality and senses to create his magic spell, yet it felt as if a foreign agent was destroying his heart with evil. &nbsp;That overwhelming power was being provided to him, but it felt as if his Energy Pulse, which extended to his entire body, was crawling with maggots. &nbsp;It was a horrifying feeling as if it was eating him alive from the inside..</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia, who had been looking at Yuren with displeasure, turned to Azell. &nbsp;She suddenly asked him a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have a question I want to ask at this time, Azell Zestringer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want to know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t have to be so enthused about answering my question. &nbsp;I didn’t reveal my past as a chip to gain information from you. &nbsp;I just….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia smirked as if she was a little bit baffled at what she was about to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it is you all, I thought I could talk to you guys about it. &nbsp;The bastards from the Plain of Darkness already knows about my past, so it doesn’t feel too bad to know that the people I chose as comrades knows about it too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the beginning, she had balked when she was questioned by Azell about her past. &nbsp;However, as she traveled with them, the wall she had put up came down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she had betrayed the Dragon Demon King worshippers, she had always been alone except for the time when she received instruction from her teacher. &nbsp;She had been in the grips of madness when her teacher taught her how to live as a decent being. &nbsp;After she separated from her teacher, she hadn’t gotten close to any one. &nbsp;She only thought about fighting the Dragon Demon King worshippers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, a change occurred inside her heart when she met Yuren. &nbsp;She had overcome hardship with him, and she was able to meet Azell Zestringer. &nbsp;She had comrades, who shared the same purpose as her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As a person who experienced the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual, do you think I will be able to do the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell didn’t even have to think about it before he gave his answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm. &nbsp;If that is your assessment….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, there is alway a risk of one losing one’s life in a Dragon Slayer’s Ritual. &nbsp;The fact that one possesses the skill to succeed doesn’t guarantee that one would succeed in it. &nbsp;As the challenger grows in Dragon Demon magic, the Dragon becomes stronger too. &nbsp;You have to remember that point.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not naive. &nbsp;I won’t try to eat the world raw.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia snorted.</span></p>
