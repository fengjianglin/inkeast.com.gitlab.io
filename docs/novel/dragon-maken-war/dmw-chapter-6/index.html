  <p></p>
  <p><span style>‘He a strange person.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>The fact that he was still alive looking like that was amazing, but if one paid close attention, there were other strange things about him. His accent was weird. He sounded like he was from a far away place, and his inflection was a bit different. At times, he would use old-fashioned vocabularies. Moreover, his reaction to spoken words were strangely slow as if he didn’t understand what was being said.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I don’t think his ear is damaged.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Any ways, he was most definitely a practitioner of Spirit Order. He had a hard time believing it, while looking at his exterior, but he might be an expert who attained a relatively high mastery.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles asked his aide.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“How is he doing?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“He hasn’t done anything out of the norm. After he ate, he went to rest. However, there was a surprising incident.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I was told he has rapidly changed after eating lunch and dinner. He used to be emaciated, but now he looks a bit skinny.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What? Really?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Yes. Everyone is gossiping about it. They think it’s some strange magic.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That is curious. I should go meet him.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Should I go with you?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No, I’ll go by myself.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After the conversation, Giles exited his office and he went towards the medical barracks, where Azell was staying.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Army doctor Rick, it’s Centurion Giles. Do you mind if I enter?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Come in.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After hearing Rick’s reply, Giles entered the barrack. However, unlike what he had expected, Rick didn’t greet him. He was distracted and he looking at the wrong place.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He followed the other’s gaze, and before he knew it, Giles’ eyes opened wide.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He saw the sight of Azell upside down with his shirt off. He was doing a handstand with one of his right finger, while three small round stones were stacked beneath his finger. In this state, he was doing a pushup.</span></p>
  <p><span style>In a couple hours time, his body had unbelievably filled out, but his body didn’t show much muscle. Since he was so skinny before, his muscle tissues had died out. (TLN: catabolized muscle tissue)</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was surprising he was able to do this act with that body. After reaching a certain level as a practitioner of Spirit Order, one develops superhuman strength and sense of balance. Therefore, it wasn’t surprising to see him doing a push-up while doing a handstand with one finger. However, he had stacked 3 small round stones on top of each other, and a small shift in balance would make the stones slip. He had never thought about doing this.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I want to try it.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>When Giles came in, Azell stopped doing the push-ups, and he flicked the finger he was balanced on. This caused the 3 stones to scatter in different direction. His body turned in a circle and he was able to land his body lightly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ooht-cha.(TLN:sound of exertion, like a grunt I guess) Centurion Giles….. No, should I call you Sir Giles?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After hearing Azell’s words, Giles was surprised again. Wasn’t he entirely different from his morning appearance? His voice was different, but his blue eyes and the burning red color of his hair was the same. If these physical attributes didn’t match then he wouldn’t have thought it was the same person.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles spoke, while hiding his unrest.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Call me as you like. You aren’t my subordinate.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Then I will call you Sir Giles. It’s shorter.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That’s fine. Any ways, that’s a pretty fun training technique.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I had a memory of training this way. My body is in a rough shape, so it’s difficult.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell complained, while he looked at his body with discontent.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“How were you able to recover you body in couple hours?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I ate and drank a lot. If one provides what the body needs then the body recovers quickly.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It is hard for me to believe that is the only reason. When a person is weakened, one cannot accept a lot of food at one time. They would probably have to eat slowly and gradually recover their body?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Of course, one has to have enough digestive ability, and control over the state of one’s body. Sir Giles, you haven’t experienced an extreme situation like me, but if you did, wouldn’t you be able to do the same thing? Fundamentally, Spirit Order practitioners learn to control the rhythm of the heart. If so, wouldn’t you be able to control the circulation of the blood or your sleep state?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Spirit order uses the pulsation of the heart as the source of power. Every time the heart pulses, it vibrates the spirit ring and the resonance causes the magical forces to move.</span></p>
  <p><span style>If one learned the Spirit Order then he will have a technique that’ll manipulate the beat of his heart. While standing still, if he wanted to, he could make his heart beat crazily fast or beat slow as if he is asleep.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles asked a question, while being amused.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Do you mean to say you are able to extend the technique to manipulate your body to that degree?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Of course. If you can manipulate your heart’s rhythm then you should be able to manipulate every part of your body. Unlike regular people, as a Cord-rope master, you should be able to use this method to control your body.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You are right.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles nodded his head.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Even though he accepted it, the transformation of Azell was miraculous. He couldn’t believe a human could change so drastically. Even if he was a practitioner of Spirit Order, wasn’t this simply too amazing?</span></p>
  <p><span style>It had been a long time since his heart beat rapidly. Giles looked directly into Azell’s eyes and spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hmmm. Azell Zestringer, would you spar with me?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>From behind, they heard an intake of breath. Rick’s face stiffened.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Is he out of his mind? Just this morning, he was about to die and now a knight is requesting a spar?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>He only thought this. As a healing expert, it would be unforgivable for him to say this out loud.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Azell smiled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Sure. If I face off against another Spirit Order practitioner then it might help me recover my memories. However, my condition is a bit of a mess so I might not be able to be a proper sparring partner?</span></p>
  <p><span style>It’s been 220 years since the period of time he was active, and he was curious as to how much the knights had changed. In what ways did the Spirit Order and sword techniques improve? Also, he wanted to know what level of standards this period’s knights had?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Therefore, in Azell’s perspective, he wholeheartedly welcomed the sparring request by Giles.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Of course, I’m not going to ask for an intense sparring session from someone who just got out from the sickbed. Instead of using the body, let us spar through showing appropriate techniques as a Spirit Order practitioner. Would that be ok?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If that is Sir Giles’ intent then I’m fine with it.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Sparring didn’t mean they had to fight with swords. There were other ways to battle. Spirit Order had various ways to spar.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Then let us meet again tomorrow after lunch.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After Giles left, the frowning Rick asked Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You are really going to spar against Sir Giles?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes. I can move my body well, so there should be any problems?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Sir Giles is young, but his skills aren’t ordinary. No one really knows about it, but he isn’t a joke. I’m warning you….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I already know about it. That is why I chose a sparring method where we can’t hurt each other. So please stop worrying.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Jeez. You are a patient, but you are being boastful in front of a healing expert.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Do I still look like a patient?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell curled both his arms to bunch his muscles, and he took a pose. However, his flesh was full of water so it didn’t bulge at all. (TLN: flabby)</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick started staring at him, so Azell looked away in embarrassment.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Shit. Wait a few days. I’ll show you some wonderful abs!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If gaining muscles were that easy, then all the men in the world will be muscular.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick snorted. Azell volleyed back.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Do you think another person could gain this much flesh in one day?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No one… probably.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I was able to do it. Within couple days, I’ll be able to bulk up.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick was loss for words when he looked at Azell’s attitude, which was full of confidence without any basis.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell smiled smugly while asking a question.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“So how old is Sir Giles?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“He should be 19 this year?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“He’s only that old? Ah, he does look very young, but still.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It hasn’t even been half a year since he joined our outfit. Still everyone acknowledges his skill.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>During that time, even though Giles was a Centurion, he participated in patrolling the Balan forest to learn about the troop’s work. He displayed himself to be an earnest person.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Then he showed excellent skills dispatching monsters, and his fellow soldiers were impressed by his actions. At first, they weren’t thrilled to have a rookie knight as a superior officer. However, they all had accepted him and followed him now.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Our troops fight against monsters quite frequently so skill is valued. He was earnest and skilled, so he was immediately acknowledged.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“So that’s how it is. He has achieved a lot for a 19 year old. How is his skills compared to the other knights?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m not too sure about that. He should be around the middle. If he is able to act as the Centurion for our troops then he can’t be average. The other knights aren’t normal.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Of course, they are like that. The troops constantly get threatened by monsters, and fight against them. (TLN: the knights are strong b/c they are constantly fighting near the forest)</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell slightly narrowed his eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I want to see the other knights… For his age, it is a great accomplishment to become a Cord-rope master, but I have no idea about this period’s appraisal standard.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>In Azell’s time, Cord-rope masters weren’t rare.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Dragon Demon king Atein and his army was a disaster that threatened the very existence of mankind. In front of them, the humans had to struggle desperately. Numerous warriors died daily, and only the strong survived.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The lack of military strength forced many to share the secret techniques they had had hoarded. If someone looked like he had some aptitude, then they freely shared the secret techniques.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The quality of knights became noticeably better than before the Dragon Demon War.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, even in his time period it was rare to see a 19 year old surpass the level of Cord-rope master. According to Azell’s memory, there were less than 10 people.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘However, if I add one more year then the number doubles.’ (TLN:19 vs 20 yr old)</span></p>
  <p><span style>That one year difference made an enormous difference.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Hmm. I guess I’ll have to find out about it slowly. ‘</span></p>
  <p><span style>He put away the question he was thinking about for a moment and he started exercising again. He used his other arm. Of course, he stacked three stones and while doing handstand with one finger, he started doing pushups.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick was struck dumb by this sight, so he started mumbling to himself.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Jeez. You are doing some amazing things, but… Why can I only think of you as a weird guy?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell could only laugh at his words. He resumed exercising without saying a word.</span></p>

 <p><span style>He saw the sight of Azell upside down with his shirt off. He was doing a handstand with one of his right finger, while three small round stones were stacked beneath his finger. In this state, he was doing a pushup.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a couple hours time, his body had unbelievably filled out, but his body didn’t show much muscle. Since he was so skinny before, his muscle tissues had died out. (TLN: catabolized muscle tissue)</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was surprising he was able to do this act with that body. After reaching a certain level as a practitioner of Spirit Order, one develops superhuman strength and sense of balance. Therefore, it wasn’t surprising to see him doing a push-up while doing a handstand with one finger. However, he had stacked 3 small round stones on top of each other, and a small shift in balance would make the stones slip. He had never thought about doing this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I want to try it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Giles came in, Azell stopped doing the push-ups, and he flicked the finger he was balanced on. This caused the 3 stones to scatter in different direction. His body turned in a circle and he was able to land his body lightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooht-cha.(TLN:sound of exertion, like a grunt I guess) Centurion Giles….. No, should I call you Sir Giles?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After hearing Azell’s words, Giles was surprised again. Wasn’t he entirely different from his morning appearance? His voice was different, but his blue eyes and the burning red color of his hair was the same. If these physical attributes didn’t match then he wouldn’t have thought it was the same person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles spoke, while hiding his unrest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Call me as you like. You aren’t my subordinate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I will call you Sir Giles. It’s shorter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s fine. Any ways, that’s a pretty fun training technique.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I had a memory of training this way. My body is in a rough shape, so it’s difficult.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell complained, while he looked at his body with discontent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How were you able to recover you body in couple hours?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I ate and drank a lot. If one provides what the body needs then the body recovers quickly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is hard for me to believe that is the only reason. When a person is weakened, one cannot accept a lot of food at one time. They would probably have to eat slowly and gradually recover their body?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, one has to have enough digestive ability, and control over the state of one’s body. Sir Giles, you haven’t experienced an extreme situation like me, but if you did, wouldn’t you be able to do the same thing? Fundamentally, Spirit Order practitioners learn to control the rhythm of the heart. If so, wouldn’t you be able to control the circulation of the blood or your sleep state?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Spirit order uses the pulsation of the heart as the source of power. Every time the heart pulses, it vibrates the spirit ring and the resonance causes the magical forces to move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If one learned the Spirit Order then he will have a technique that’ll manipulate the beat of his heart. While standing still, if he wanted to, he could make his heart beat crazily fast or beat slow as if he is asleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles asked a question, while being amused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you mean to say you are able to extend the technique to manipulate your body to that degree?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course. If you can manipulate your heart’s rhythm then you should be able to manipulate every part of your body. Unlike regular people, as a Cord-rope master, you should be able to use this method to control your body.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though he accepted it, the transformation of Azell was miraculous. He couldn’t believe a human could change so drastically. Even if he was a practitioner of Spirit Order, wasn’t this simply too amazing?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had been a long time since his heart beat rapidly. Giles looked directly into Azell’s eyes and spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmm. Azell Zestringer, would you spar with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From behind, they heard an intake of breath. Rick’s face stiffened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is he out of his mind? Just this morning, he was about to die and now a knight is requesting a spar?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He only thought this. As a healing expert, it would be unforgivable for him to say this out loud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Azell smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure. If I face off against another Spirit Order practitioner then it might help me recover my memories. However, my condition is a bit of a mess so I might not be able to be a proper sparring partner?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It’s been 220 years since the period of time he was active, and he was curious as to how much the knights had changed. In what ways did the Spirit Order and sword techniques improve? Also, he wanted to know what level of standards this period’s knights had?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, in Azell’s perspective, he wholeheartedly welcomed the sparring request by Giles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, I’m not going to ask for an intense sparring session from someone who just got out from the sickbed. Instead of using the body, let us spar through showing appropriate techniques as a Spirit Order practitioner. Would that be ok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If that is Sir Giles’ intent then I’m fine with it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sparring didn’t mean they had to fight with swords. There were other ways to battle. Spirit Order had various ways to spar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let us meet again tomorrow after lunch.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Giles left, the frowning Rick asked Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are really going to spar against Sir Giles?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. I can move my body well, so there should be any problems?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir Giles is young, but his skills aren’t ordinary. No one really knows about it, but he isn’t a joke. I’m warning you….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I already know about it. That is why I chose a sparring method where we can’t hurt each other. So please stop worrying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jeez. You are a patient, but you are being boastful in front of a healing expert.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do I still look like a patient?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell curled both his arms to bunch his muscles, and he took a pose. However, his flesh was full of water so it didn’t bulge at all. (TLN: flabby)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick started staring at him, so Azell looked away in embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit. Wait a few days. I’ll show you some wonderful abs!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If gaining muscles were that easy, then all the men in the world will be muscular.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick snorted. Azell volleyed back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think another person could gain this much flesh in one day?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No one… probably.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was able to do it. Within couple days, I’ll be able to bulk up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick was loss for words when he looked at Azell’s attitude, which was full of confidence without any basis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell smiled smugly while asking a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So how old is Sir Giles?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He should be 19 this year?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s only that old? Ah, he does look very young, but still.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It hasn’t even been half a year since he joined our outfit. Still everyone acknowledges his skill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>During that time, even though Giles was a Centurion, he participated in patrolling the Balan forest to learn about the troop’s work. He displayed himself to be an earnest person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he showed excellent skills dispatching monsters, and his fellow soldiers were impressed by his actions. At first, they weren’t thrilled to have a rookie knight as a superior officer. However, they all had accepted him and followed him now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Our troops fight against monsters quite frequently so skill is valued. He was earnest and skilled, so he was immediately acknowledged.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So that’s how it is. He has achieved a lot for a 19 year old. How is his skills compared to the other knights?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not too sure about that. He should be around the middle. If he is able to act as the Centurion for our troops then he can’t be average. The other knights aren’t normal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, they are like that. The troops constantly get threatened by monsters, and fight against them. (TLN: the knights are strong b/c they are constantly fighting near the forest)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell slightly narrowed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I want to see the other knights… For his age, it is a great accomplishment to become a Cord-rope master, but I have no idea about this period’s appraisal standard.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Azell’s time, Cord-rope masters weren’t rare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon king Atein and his army was a disaster that threatened the very existence of mankind. In front of them, the humans had to struggle desperately. Numerous warriors died daily, and only the strong survived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lack of military strength forced many to share the secret techniques they had had hoarded. If someone looked like he had some aptitude, then they freely shared the secret techniques.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The quality of knights became noticeably better than before the Dragon Demon War.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, even in his time period it was rare to see a 19 year old surpass the level of Cord-rope master. According to Azell’s memory, there were less than 10 people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘However, if I add one more year then the number doubles.’ (TLN:19 vs 20 yr old)</span></p>
 <p><span style>That one year difference made an enormous difference.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Hmm. I guess I’ll have to find out about it slowly. ‘</span></p>
 <p><span style>He put away the question he was thinking about for a moment and he started exercising again. He used his other arm. Of course, he stacked three stones and while doing handstand with one finger, he started doing pushups.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick was struck dumb by this sight, so he started mumbling to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jeez. You are doing some amazing things, but… Why can I only think of you as a weird guy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell could only laugh at his words. He resumed exercising without saying a word.</span></p>
