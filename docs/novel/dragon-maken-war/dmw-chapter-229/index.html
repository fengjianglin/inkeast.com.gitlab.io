 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">5</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Up until that point, Azell’s party couldn’t understand Atein’s attitude. &nbsp;However, they were able to decipher Atein’s intention through the information given to them by Kayalia.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why hadn’t Atein been more aggressive in defending the waypoints to the Road of Emptiness?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He needed the death of the Dragon Demon King worshippers, who were contracted to his cause. &nbsp;They were connected to the Great Darkness, and their deaths were necessary in advancing his plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This didn’t mean that the Road of Emptiness wasn’t important either. &nbsp;However, Atein didn’t plan on fighting whole world like he did in the past. &nbsp;Atein was going to use the souls of the Dragon Demon King worshippers as a resource to create a massive magic ritual. &nbsp;That was much more important to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We still have to destroy all the waypoints.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kairen spoke. &nbsp;He knew Atein’s intention, yet he decided that they should continue their plan of destroying the waypoints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It might be best to give the appearance that we are obsessed with destroying the waypoints. &nbsp;It’ll give us legitimate cover until we decide to attack them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Anyways, they needed to destroy all the nearby waypoints before they could destroy a pillar of Darkness. &nbsp;If they want to invest fully in a battle, they had to eliminate the possibility of being hit from behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The only problem that remain is which pillar we should destroy first…….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Great Darkness was being propped up by 12 pillars, and they had destroyed three of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, Azell’s party knew the location of all the nine remaining pillars. &nbsp;Carlos hadn’t known all the location, but the missing information had been filled in by Kayalia.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The most vulnerable one is located within the Balran forest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was where they had lost Yuren, and in the end, Atein had be able to reseal the Tree god.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Azell’s party had been able to destroy all the defenses that had been placed around the seal of the Tree god. &nbsp;According to Kayalia’s information, Atein hadn’t been able to restore the defense yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Atein could have started restoring the defense after Kayalia’s authority to view information was revoked. &nbsp;However, a defense of that nature couldn’t be put up in a short amount of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It mean they’ll guard it more securely with troops.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Isn’t it better to hit a different place?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, we have to hit that place. &nbsp;They’ll tolerate losing waypoints, but they can’t afford to lose pillars. &nbsp; We’ll clear the nearby waypoints as fast as possible to set up the attack. &nbsp;Let’s keep pushing before they come up with a new countermeasure.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kairen continued to make plans in his head. He had been frustrated up until that point, because he hadn’t known what Atein was planning. &nbsp;He would be able bloody Atein’s nose with this time around. &nbsp;Kairen let out an evil smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">6</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Count Lakadi of the Rios Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His nickname was the Count of the Thousand Swords. &nbsp;Bakard Lakadi was a Dragon Demon, and he had been working as a member of the Guardian Shadows for a very long time. &nbsp; He garnered respect from the royal family of the Rios Kingdom, and he was known as being one of the legendary figures of this era.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In many ways, his career was remarkably similar to Kairen’s career.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was a Dragon Demon, yet he was a lord of a human kingdom. &nbsp;He had lost his parents to the Dragon Demon King worshippers, so he had joined the Guardian Shadows to get his revenge. &nbsp;He hadn’t learned any forgotten techniques, yet he was one of the subject of caution for the Plain of Darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, there were differences. &nbsp;He had three other Dragon Demon siblings that were in the Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;They were named Sarah Lakadi, Eileen Lakardi and Jierens Lakardi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve talked couple times with you through correspondence, but…..”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was the oldest of his siblings, and he was a count. &nbsp;However, he looked to be in his mid 20s. &nbsp;There was a scar made by a sword on his cheek, and he had long thick brown hair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was an 80 year old Dragon Demon, yet he was basically at his prime.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is the first time meet you face to face, marquis Azell Karzark.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wanted a handshake. &nbsp;Azell spoke as he shook his hand. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is a pleasure to meet you, count Lakadi. &nbsp;I’ve heard about your many exploits.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Azell’s identity had been revealed to everyone within the Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;After Carlos passed away, the command of the Guardian Shadows was given to Kairen, and he had chosen to reveal the important truths to the members. &nbsp;The members of the Guardian Shadows had put their lives on the line to fight the Dragon Demon King worshippers. &nbsp;They had the right to know the truth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this didn’t mean everyone believed the information.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Azell asked in a playful manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tell me the truth. &nbsp;Do you really believe that I’m Azell Karzark?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In truth, I’m on the fence right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bakard Lakadi was truthful with his answer. &nbsp;It might have been believable to those that had traveled with Azell. &nbsp;It was asking too much for strangers to believe his claim. &nbsp;They had no frame of reference. &nbsp;Bakard Lakadi continued to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your identity is hard to believe, and many stories related to you sound implausible. &nbsp;I do know that Atein and the Dragon Demon generals have been revived. &nbsp;Yes, I think I can believe that the archmage Carlos made the Guardian Shadows after exiting from history. &nbsp;However, anything beyond that is pushing my limits.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bleak and gloomy truths were overflowing in this world. &nbsp;The news that the hero Azell Karzark had revived in this era was like a ray of hope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It doesn’t sound believable, but I want to believe. &nbsp;At the very least, I will treat you with respect as the marquis of Karzaark.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are honest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ve given me techniques. &nbsp;This is just good manners for what you did for us. &nbsp;I don't’ care what your identity is. &nbsp;I’ll never forget your good will.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Azell had conversed with Bakard Lakadi, because he had wanted to give Bakard the forgotten techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was way less effective than teaching it to him. &nbsp;Azell and Laura taught them how to deal with the hidden techniques, and it had increased the abilities of the members of the Guardian Shadows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Lakadi siblings were ones that showed exceptional growth amongst the members. &nbsp;Their team was made out of two warriors and two magicians. &nbsp;Even high ranked officers of the Plain of Darkness couldn’t defeat them easily. &nbsp;They were quite a fearsome party.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sarah Lakadi, who was the third sibilling, asked a question after she listened to their conversation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why are you insisting on fighting with us? &nbsp;Moreover, you insisted on coming alone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She looked to be around the same age as Bakard. &nbsp;She was an haughty looking beauty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ll be hard to find a group like us. &nbsp;We don’t need your help.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The members of the Guardian Shadows knew that Azell’s party was achieving incredible results. &nbsp;They were constantly being kept up to date with information about Azell party’s progress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Lakadi siblings didn’t really need much help in carrying out their tasks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, the information regarding the target, and the support from the ghost-like figures of the Guardian Shadows were valuable. &nbsp;However, once the battle started, the four Lakadi siblings did most of the heavy lifting, and they achieved great success in battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So why did Azell go out of his way to help them?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the entirety of Azell’s party had come, the siblings might have been excited at the prospect. &nbsp;Maybe, Azell’s party might have been planning on luring out a Dragon Demon general. &nbsp;However, Azell had come by himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the perspective of the Lakadi siblings, they were a bit offended. It felt as if they were being told that they were unreliable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please don’t take this the wrong way. &nbsp;I’m not here, because we thought you would have trouble in this battle.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then why?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I wanted to witness your skills with my own eyes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmm. &nbsp;Does that mean you came here to verify our skills?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bakard asked him a question. &nbsp;Azell nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is as you’ve said.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is your reasoning for doing this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We are fighting all over the continent. &nbsp;However, at some point, there will come a time when we’ll have to concentrate our power in one place. &nbsp;I’m choosing members that’ll participate in that battle.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Interesting. &nbsp;It has been awhile since we’ve been evaluated by someone else. &nbsp;However, you do realize that we’ll be doing the same to you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed Bakard wasn’t offended after hearing Azell’s goal in coming here. &nbsp;However, his attitude would change drastically if Azell didn’t show his ability and competence in this battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Azell didn’t plan on hiding his skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘I wonder if Laura is doing well.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Laura and Arrieta were traveling towards the Albatan forest. &nbsp;If he counted the time they would spend there, it would take them around two days to get back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The party wanted to use that time efficiency, so they decided to check up on the skilled members of the Guardian Shadows with their own two eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Azell had come by himself to check up on the Lakadi siblings. &nbsp;Their party was very well balanced. &nbsp;Kairen, Leticia and Kayalia went to check on the other candidates.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Well, let’s….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Azell usually didn’t wear a helmet, but he wore one that completely covered his head. &nbsp;He also didn’t wear his normal White Dragon armor, and the long sword on his hip wasn’t the Dragon sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was trying to hide his identity from the Dragon Demon King worshippers. &nbsp;He wanted to evaluate the abilities of this party. &nbsp;This was why he would be put in a bind if Almarick suddenly made an appearance. &nbsp;The fight with Almarick had to go according to Kairen’s plan. &nbsp;The perfect stage would be prepared at a later date.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shall we start?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Laura wasn’t here, he couldn’t use his Extreme Extinction to destroy the waypoint at the beginning of the fight. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Azell let the siblings dictate the battle as he ran into the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">7</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When attacking a waypoint, one had to go out on an all out attack. &nbsp;As more time passed, there was the danger of the enemies sending reinforcements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the reinforcement was led by a Dragon Demon general, the fight would end as a failure. &nbsp;At that point, they would have to extract themselves from the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their goal was to end the fight before the third support force could arrive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the battle started, a single Guardian Shadow usually kept an eye on the waypoint as a lookout. &nbsp;If enemy support troops appeared from the waypoint, they had to immediately make a decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite using these precautions, many members of the Guardian Shadows had died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, their losses had decreased in recent days. &nbsp;It was, because the Plain of Darkness weren’t sending any high ranked officers with their reinforcement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’ll break through them in one fell swoop. &nbsp;Please don’t fall behind.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two of Lakadi sibling were high ranked Dragon Arts practitioners, and the other two were high ranked magicians. &nbsp;Each sibling possessed great ability, and they’ve been working together for a very long time. &nbsp;This was why the power of their teamplay was truly powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first to jump in was Bakard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew it would be hard to evade detection from their enemies using the Concealment technique. &nbsp;This was why he immediately used the Instantaneous movement to appear within the midst of his enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After being attacked numerous times, the Dragon Demon King worshippers became much more adept at searching out their enemies. &nbsp;Moreover, they were much more prepared for a fight now. &nbsp;A distance of 100 meters had to be traversed if Bakard and his siblings wanted to ambush the Dragon Demon King worshippers. &nbsp;It just wasn’t a feasible to pull off the attack before they were noticed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dragon Majin warrior on patrol easily blocked Bakard’s ambush attack. &nbsp;The patrol had three members. &nbsp;Another Dragon Majin attacked Bakard, and the magician activated a spell as he looked at his surrounding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kah-ahng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bakard blocked the frontal attack with the shield in his left hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pah-jee-jee-jeek!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Afterwards, Sarah Lakadi clashed with the enemy magician with her magic. &nbsp;Sparks formed in the air. &nbsp;However, she wasn’t the only magician in her party. &nbsp;Jierens Lakadi was the youngest sibling, and he sent out a spell towards the enemy magician and warriors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Puh-ung!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A mental wave bomb detonated, and it messed with his enemy’s senses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bakard had already expected this attack, so he was unaffected. &nbsp;The two enemy warriors faltered, and Bakard took advantage of this opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kwah-jeek!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bakard was locked swords with a warrior. &nbsp;He kicked the midsection of the warrior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shweek!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He used the rebound to change his stance, and Bakard’s sword took off the head of the other warrior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The female warrior Eileen Lakadi moved a beat later as she chased after the warrior that had been sent flying by Bakadi’s kick. &nbsp;She brought down her steel mace as she ended his life. &nbsp;Afterwards, Sarah and Jierens worked in tandem to kill the magician.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘They are amazing.’</span></p>
