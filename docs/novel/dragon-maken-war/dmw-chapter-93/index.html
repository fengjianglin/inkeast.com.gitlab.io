 <p>Chapter 93 - Those who Seek Their Own Destiny (2)</p>
 <p><span style>3</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren didn't know the exact moment when he became a Dragon Demon king worshipper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His earliest memory he could remember was the cold corpse of his mother. &nbsp;He didn't know the exact cause, but his mother had been sick and poor. &nbsp;She froze to death in a back alley of a city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren was probably fated to die like his mother. &nbsp;However, someone had taken Yuren, who was unable to speak yet. &nbsp;He was sent to a training school for talented humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He learned how to speak in this place. &nbsp;He grew up being indoctrinated with the &nbsp;knowledge and mindset of the Dragon Demon King worshippers. &nbsp;At an early age, the trainers categorized the children depending on their aptitude. &nbsp;In this process, Yuren was put on the path to becoming a magician.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he was young, he never questioned the environment he was in. &nbsp;He completely believed everything the adults told him. &nbsp;It was truth. &nbsp;He was steadily becoming a fanatic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His first kill came at 9 years old. &nbsp;The Dragon Demon king worshippers wanted to take root in a particular city. &nbsp;He had to kill an old couple, who refused to give up control over a neighbourhood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he thought back on it, the couple was blameless, and they had been kind to children. &nbsp;He had used their kindness against them. &nbsp;On a cold day, Yuren had disguised himself as an orphan. &nbsp;The couple allowed him into their home, and they had provided him warm soup. &nbsp;He had used this opportunity to put a strong magical poison in the couple's meal. &nbsp;He had killed them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afterwards, he didn't feel any emotions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren had received the teachings of the great Dragon Demon King, and anyone that didn't follow it wasn't considered to be 'human.' &nbsp;They were dirty trashes that propped up this false world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, a change occurred when he was 14 years old.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One day an unknown voice started to whisper to him in his dreams.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will tell you the name of your bloodline. &nbsp;Yuren Rizester.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“……mmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren opened his eyes. The green eyes that shown beneath the disheveled brown hair surveyed his surrounding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His field of vision was shaking. &nbsp;It was disorienting. &nbsp;It seemed he was being moved, and he was slung over someone's shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm being carried on a woman's shoulder.... How refreshing...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you have the energy to spout such bullshit, it seems you are fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A sharp voice answered him. &nbsp;Someone had slung Yuren over her shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a woman that was smaller than Yuren. &nbsp;Her black hair was cut into an even bob, and she was wearing a leather armor painted black. &nbsp;She was a cold beauty with yellowish red eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was a Dragon Majin. &nbsp;There was a sculpture-like horn above her right ear, and it was give out a red light. &nbsp;A Dragon Stone of the same color was embedded on the back of her hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren spoke with a tired voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leticia. &nbsp;I'm glad you are happy, but... &nbsp;This might be the last bullshit statement I'll be able to utter in this life.... &nbsp;I don't know if....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm starting to think that might be preferable to this. &nbsp;You should stop speaking. &nbsp;You did something idiotic, yet you aren't dead. &nbsp;You know you are lucky to be alive even after losing so much blood. &nbsp;Just shut up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The child……?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He's dead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren's face crumpled at Leticia's words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was seriously injured. &nbsp;He had been running away with the children. &nbsp;His feet were shackled since he had to protect the children. &nbsp;He had thrown his body in the way of a sword thrust as he had tried to save a child. &nbsp;He fainted after receiving a deep sword wound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I should have… If we left them alone, then...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don't say those words again. &nbsp;Shut up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even a smart person couldn't have predicted the outcome. &nbsp;We did this despite knowing we might regret it later. &nbsp;However, those children were heading down the road to fanaticism, and their dignity as human were being stripped away. &nbsp;We can't just do nothing about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The current situation had occurred, because Yuren had aimed to go after the most evil training facility run by the Dragon Demon king worshippers. &nbsp;Basically, it wasn't a simple training facility that nurtured regular fighters. &nbsp;It was a place where children with special constitution were gathered, and evil experimentation was conducted on them. &nbsp;This was a place where they 'reared' the test subjects, so Yuren couldn't just pass it by.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While he was doing his advance work, he became acquainted with Leticia. &nbsp;They decided to do a joint operation. &nbsp;After they conducted their advance work for a month, they had destroyed the institution, and the children were able to escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, something unexpected had happened. &nbsp;Pursuers showed up behind Yuren as if they had been waiting for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It took Yuren much effort to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me down…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You aren't in a condition to walk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know. &nbsp;However, you are....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren had picked up on the fact that Leticia was also injured. &nbsp;Yuran and Leticia had fought and killed over 100 Dragon Demon king worshippers to be able to get here. &nbsp;It would be more strange if they weren't tired and wounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm not in such a bad shape that I won't be able to carry a human cub.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No… I don't think you can face this enemy with me on your shoulder.... &nbsp;Nope....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…enemy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia was startled by his words. She had enough Qi to make the Dragon Demon king worshippers shake in their boots. &nbsp;However, she hadn't sensed any enemies approaching them. &nbsp;What did Yuren sense?</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Leticia felt someone looking down at her. &nbsp;She had learned the Gaze Detection technique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Was the person's gaze hidden? &nbsp;No. &nbsp;No one had been watching me until a moment ago!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The enemies had just appeared, so it meant that they had been lying in ambush at this location. &nbsp;The enemies hadn't been looking at the two of them. &nbsp;However, when the two entered their sensory field, they had turned their gazes towards the two.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Leticia realized this fact, lightning struck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ggah-gwah-gwahng! Ggwah-gwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn't just one or two thunderbolts. &nbsp;The forest was bright from the fire, yet the light from the thunderbolts was able to burn their retinas. Dozens of lightning fell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had the destructive power to take out a unit with scores of men. After a moment, two people walked out from the dispersing thunder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kook. &nbsp;This is... &nbsp;Did a high ranking officer come after us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That's right, sinners. &nbsp;I commend you for getting out of our trap.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A person stepped out from between the trees. &nbsp;A woman of the Dragon Demon race was encircled in darkness as she emitted enormous power. &nbsp;The heat was causing the air to flow, and it flutter the black hair of the woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Niberis… A direct descendent of the Dragon Demon king…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon woman was Niberis. &nbsp;It seemed the beings in the Plains of Darkness had accepted Yuren as a serious problem. &nbsp;They had sent a high ranking member.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis' expression hardened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How were you able to recognize me? &nbsp;You should only be a minor apprentice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even amongst the Dragon Demon king worshippers, Niberis wasn't known to many people. &nbsp;One didn't know about her unless one lived in the Plains of Darkness. &nbsp;When she travelled outside, she had put considerable amount of energy in covering up her identity. &nbsp;On her last mission, she had travelled to the Rulain kingdom to kidnap the Dragon Demon Princess Arietta with Regina. &nbsp;Even then she took the precaution of paralyzing the minds of the rank and file members, so they wouldn't be able to see her appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Yuren had gotten her identity right as soon as he saw her. &nbsp;A minor member of an organization shouldn't know about her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha… Who knows? What do you think……?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are almost dead, yet you have the talent to get on my nerves.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Goo-goo-goo-goo-goo!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The darkness surrounding Niberis moved in a furious manner. &nbsp;It was a darkness that caused anyone that got close to it to be cursed. &nbsp;It was hard for anyone to breathe in this darkness. &nbsp;Once one was in the darkness, one died from all kinds of poisons and diseases. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What nonsense.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a cursed darkness that would make a human magician freeze from the sight of it. &nbsp;However, Leticia spoke in a cold voice. &nbsp;&nbsp;She swung her long spear with Yuren still on her shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shweeeee!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she did, a gale with deep blue chill rose up to push the darkness away. &nbsp;As the temperature dropped rapidly, ice started to form in the surrounding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis glared at Leticia.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected of the cold-blooded queen, you have a trick or two that justifies your pretentious nickname.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys are the ones that came up with that lousy nickname.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amongst the Dragon Demon king worshippers, Leticia was known as the 'cold-blooded queen'. &nbsp;She had started her activities 8 years ago, and she had killed countless Dragon Demon king worshippers including a good number of Dragon Demon officers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see. Then you should consider it an honor and die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Numerous magical spells were initiated from within the darkness surrounding her. &nbsp;When it looked as if thunderbolts would end, a sharp wind flew in. &nbsp;When the winds fell away, fire came down like rain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn't I tell you this is nonsensical? &nbsp;Did you already forget my words?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia overcame all the magical spells. &nbsp;She still had Yuren slung over one shoulder, yet she was moving in a surprising manner. &nbsp;Leticia counterattacked as she moved to regions that weren’t influenced by the magical spells. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the explosion rang out, Niberis' barrier shook. &nbsp;Niberis was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘She was able to do that at this distance?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis had put a good amount of distance between her enemies. &nbsp;However, her barrier had cracked as if someone had struck at point blank range at full force. &nbsp;Moreover, another blow accurately struck the crack before Niberis could do anything about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-ook!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis had barely avoided the blow. &nbsp;It was terrifying. &nbsp;She had put a lot of effort into making her multi-layered barrier, yet a dozen consecutive attack was intricately focused on a single point. &nbsp;Her barrier had been pierced by the attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Niberis realized she had made a mistake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is a magical spell.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The attack from before wasn't from Leticia. &nbsp;It was a magical spell from Yuren, who looked as if he was close to death. &nbsp;When she realized this fact, Niberis was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This makes no sense. &nbsp;A human did that?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The attack that was sent a moment ago astounded Niberis. &nbsp;Was it really a magical spell used by a human?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This can't be!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis was still in doubt as she sent her magical spell. &nbsp;At the same time....</span></p>
 <p><span style>Puh-uhng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>An explosion rang out, and the barrier, which she had remade, shook again. &nbsp;As if her opponent had been waiting for her to send her magic, Yuren had sent a perfect counter attack. &nbsp;The construct of her magical spell was nullified before it could take shape. &nbsp;Moreover, a magic arrow came at her from an absolute blind spot. &nbsp;It threaded the needle before it impacted on Niberis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A human cub has this level of skill....’</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that point, Niberis shivered instead of getting angry. &nbsp;This human's applied magic was at a level that was akin to the Archmages that taught magic in the Plain of Darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh traitor Yuren. &nbsp;Is it as I had suspected? &nbsp;Is the Guardian Shadows behind your activities?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maybe… If I really had something like that backing me up.... &nbsp;It would have been much easier for me…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren's laugh didn't have much strength behind it. &nbsp;Until he developed a working relationship with Leticia, he had strictly moved on his own. &nbsp;However, from the perspective of the Dragon Demon king worshippers, they didn't believe he worked alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First, he was too talented of a magician. &nbsp;Even Niberis was surprised by his skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if one was a genius in magic, one's development was dependent on the knowledge one could learn. &nbsp;If Yuren's foundation was solid, he could rapidly develop by learning high rank magic, but who taught it to him? &nbsp;If he was self-taught, he would have to fill in the gap in his knowledge through research and hard work. &nbsp;Of course, the progress was incredibly less efficient than learning the already well-established knowledge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren suddenly spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leticia. &nbsp;Someone else...is coming here....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia understood the meaning behind Yuren's words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their surrounding was already crawling with Dragon Demon king worshippers that had chased after them. &nbsp;However, the 'someone' mentioned by Yuren had enough battle capability to be a threat to the two of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm going overtax myself a little bit. &nbsp;I'm guessing you are well enough to assist me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hoooooooo!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After speaking those words, Leticia planted her spear into the ground. &nbsp;Thin ice coated the surface of the spear, and it let out a maelstrom of cold energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An incredible amount of magic was being gathered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more surprising part was the source of the magical energy. &nbsp;Leticia was emitting Dragon Demon Magic, and another source of magical butted in to cause a multiplicative effect. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Yuren's magic. &nbsp;A magical pattern that perfectly complemented Leticia's Dragon Demon magic was formed, and it was amplifying her power to the extreme. &nbsp;There were cases where a magician used support magic to amplify a warrior's magical energy, but the effect of this amplification transcended common sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia grinned as she pulled out her spear, and she brought it down once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Awesome. &nbsp;Even if my body was in a normal state, I would have hard time generating this much power.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwah-ha-ha-ha-ha!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afterwards, a wave of cold air erupted as it was shot forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A white energy was shot forward, and a several dozen meters of the surrounding region was frozen in the shape of a fan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Oh my……!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis had been barely able to react to it, and she was astonished. &nbsp;Surprisingly, her sight line was obstructed. &nbsp;Her barrier reacted to antagonist forces, and a thick layer of ice had formed around her barrier. &nbsp;It blocked her field of vision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, a more stronger cold energy impacted on top of the first attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwah-kwah-kwah-kwah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this attack had a frightening force behind the attack. Niberis' barrier shook violently as the temperature fell rapidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the last wave of cold energy impacted Niberis, an ice pillar had formed where she stood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…no wonder she is called the cold-blooded queen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It took her a good amount of time for her to get out the ice pillar encasing her. &nbsp;When she exited it, she mumbled as she looked at her surrounding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything was frozen. &nbsp;It was as if she was in a field of ice. &nbsp;A portion of the burning forest was frozen white, and one could see large ice pillars had formed intermittently. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A person jumped over an ice pillar. He was an enormous man wearing black armor. &nbsp;It was Duran. &nbsp;He queried her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you hurt anywhere?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm not hurt. &nbsp;However, it seems I got punched. &nbsp;They aren't to be underestimated. &nbsp;We can't hold anything back when we meet them again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis hadn't underestimated Leticia in the first place. &nbsp;Niberis had spoke disparagingly towards her, but Leticia was acknowledged to be a strong foe by the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;She had accepted this fact as she started the fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she hadn’t expected the unpredictable variable called Yuren. &nbsp;He was at death's door, yet he was able to display such magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about the others?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They aren't here yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran was quick on the uptake, so he realized the intent behind her question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wasn't the only one dispatched to catch the traitor Yuren. It meant she didn’t hold autonomy over this mission. &nbsp;Her competitors from various factions were all aiming for Yuren. &nbsp;They were fighting for the meritorious deed of killing Yuren.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This happened, because those in the Plain of Darkness couldn't track down Yuren's trail. &nbsp;&nbsp;Yuren was elusive. &nbsp;He had lead pursuers on a wild goose chase numerous times before he disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why the Plain of Darkness had dispatched high ranking members to each region. &nbsp;Moreover, if one was able to kill Yuren, it would be seen as a large meritorious deed. &nbsp;Niberis was at this place, because Duran had been dogged at tracking down Yuren. &nbsp;She had received information about Yuren first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she was only slightly ahead of the others. &nbsp;The fact that she was tracking down Yuren would be notified to the people above her. &nbsp;Soon her competitors would gather here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won't allow Laura and Kieren a chance to butt into this affair.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran lowered his head.</span></p>
