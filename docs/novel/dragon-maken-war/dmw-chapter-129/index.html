 <p>Chapter 129 - Suspicious Movements (4)</p>
 <p><span style>They had attacked several waypoints to the Road of Emptiness before this, but they rarely found living troops dispatched to those locations. &nbsp;Since Undead and Golems do not need rest and sleep, they were used as dogs to guard the house. &nbsp;However, administrators were on standby to oversee them. &nbsp;Moreover…….</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Shit. &nbsp;That damned mechanism just activated.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lambda looked towards the inner tunnel. &nbsp;He sensed a powerful magical device activate. &nbsp;It was the Road of Emptiness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems someone is coming here from the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;We should welcome it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iota actually had a smile on her face. &nbsp;She didn’t know who the Plain of Darkness was sending, but it would be a powerful existence. &nbsp;She was quite happy, since she would have the chance to defeat such an existence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, they arrived at the space where the Road of Emptiness existed. &nbsp;This large space was created artificially, and in the middle, there was a round golden structure. &nbsp;This was the magical device that connected one to the Road of Emptiness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a chasm at the middle of the Road of Emptiness, and three people appeared from within. &nbsp;When she saw them, Iota smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ho-oh. &nbsp;They sent three officers. &nbsp;This will be a delightful feast.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She also lost everything to the Dragon Demon King worshippers before she became a Keeper of Prophecy. &nbsp;The fact that she could cause more harm to the Dragon Demon King worshippers made her happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You lowly bastards dare to dirty the holy artifact of the king!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man, who exited the Road of Emptiness, raged. &nbsp;As if it was responding to his anger, a powerful wave of Dragon Demon magic spread out into the surrounding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man had long black hair, and a blue colored light surrounded him. &nbsp;There were horns protruding from between his hair that was similar to a bull’s horns. &nbsp;He was the descendant of the one of the 4 legendary Dragon Demon general. &nbsp;&nbsp;His name was Almarick Jeffers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The others were Dragon Majin officers, who had followed him here. &nbsp;They were much lower in rank than Jeffers, but they were all very skilled. &nbsp;There was a restriction on how many people could travel through the Road of Emptiness. &nbsp;This was why they sent their strong members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iota laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How foolish. &nbsp;You guys are already facing a manpower shortage, yet you are throwing away precious manpower as if they are trash….. &nbsp;You are clinging to a mere tool.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Iota was in their shoes, she would have given up on the Road of Emptiness. &nbsp;She would have destroyed the magical device thoroughly, so the Guardian Shadows would be unable to learn of its secret. &nbsp;The wise move was to aim for a different opportunity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was the same story as when they attacked the previous waypoints. &nbsp;They couldn’t let go of their foolish fixation. &nbsp;The reason being the Road of Emptiness was one of Dragon Demon King Atein’s artifacts. &nbsp;It couldn’t be recreated with current knowledge of magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘We will not allow unbelievers to sully the great king’s artifact!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had an illogical obsession. &nbsp;They directed their fanaticism towards someone, who was already dead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iota mocked their foolishness. &nbsp;Of course, their foolishness was a lovely opportunity for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I bet the Dragon Demon worshippers in the vicinity are all headed here. &nbsp;Shall we enjoy the feast?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, it wasn’t enough to just send Jeffers. &nbsp;They were probably mobilizing all their fighting forces nearby. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe other officers might come through from other waypoints on the Road of Emptiness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I command upon my great name! &nbsp;Come back from the eternal battlefield! &nbsp;Dragon Arts: Storm of Blades!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hoo-ooooooooooh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jeffers knew he was at a disadvantage, so he immediately used his Dragon Arts. &nbsp;It was humiliating to use his Dragon Arts on the lowly Undeads, but he had the holy duty of protecting the great king’s relic. &nbsp;In front of such a task, his pride amounted to nothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His sword became transparent as if it was made out of glass, and a blue flame climbed up the blade. &nbsp;Iota spoke as if he watched him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That magical weapon…. &nbsp;&nbsp;Is that what they call a Dragon weapon? &nbsp;It’s an interesting item. &nbsp;The fact that I’ll be able to end the succession of this weapon makes me want to kill you more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The flame of hate started to burn within her eyes. &nbsp;She spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lambda. &nbsp;Mu. &nbsp;Take care of them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Your wish is my command..&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lambda and Mu split up to take care of the officers. &nbsp;Jeffers ran forward as he let loose his Storm of Blades.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kah-ang!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Mu blocked it with his shield. &nbsp;Then the Guardian Shadows surrounding Iota swept towards them en mass like a wave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You bastards!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blue flame whirled as it shot out into the surrounding. &nbsp;&nbsp;This attack was able to affect a wide range. &nbsp;Moreover, Jeffers could choose, who the flamed affected. &nbsp;It wasn’t a physical manifestation of heat. &nbsp;This surprising magical flame was able to ignite the magical energy within his opponents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Lambda, Mu and the Guardian Shadows were unable to break through the flames. &nbsp;When they were pushed back, the Dragon Majin officers attacked them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pahhhhhhng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, a sudden and violent magical backlash occurred. &nbsp;It was as if an explosion had gone off as light exploded forth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blue flames created by Jeffers’ Dragon weapon dissipated quickly. &nbsp;Jeffers was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It performs well, but it is easy to deal with.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iota mocked him. &nbsp;A faint gold light emanated from her hands. &nbsp;Jeffers was shocked when he saw it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That Dragon Demon magic is…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A wave of Dragon Demon magic that was on par with his own was coming out of Iota. &nbsp;The Plain of Darkness didn’t know much about the Guardian Shadows, but it was known that they were a special existence amongst Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;Moreover, they knew that humans amongst them possessed Dragon Demon magic as if they had gone through the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Jeffers couldn’t help, but be surprised at what Iota had done. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a big crysta like magical construct hanging around her. &nbsp;It was the size of a child’s fist. &nbsp;This wasn’t a simple magical product. &nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Demon magic emitted by Iota was constructed from a special image from within her mind. &nbsp;It extinguished everything from magic to Dragon Demon Qi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your magic is powerless in front of me. &nbsp;I have awakened to the power of prophecy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iota declared in an haughty fashion. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Power of Prophecy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a latent power within the Keepers of the Prophecy. &nbsp;However, only three Keepers of Prophecy was able to awaken to the power. &nbsp;This really drove home the fact that it was very hard to awaken to this power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ridiculous! &nbsp;Koo-uhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jeffers coughed up blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jeffers felt a powerful backlash just from his magic touching Iota’s magical construct. &nbsp;Moreover, she was able to specify this power to work on only the enemy’s magic!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jeffers was a Dragon Arts practitioner, but all the equipments he wore was infused with magic. &nbsp;Moreover, the magical construct flew in towards him, while he was fighting Lambda, Mu and the Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;It felt as if his innards was being ripped into pieces by the shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, his Dragon weapon was also part of the problem. &nbsp;His Dragon weapon, ‘Tempest’s Blade’ didn’t react negatively to the magical construct. However, the cursed blue flame was created from magic, so it caused a backlash. &nbsp;&nbsp;If he sealed the use of the flames, he wouldn’t have access to most of the function of his Dragon weapon</span></p>
 <p><span style>Puh-uh-uhng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-ahk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Jeffers was sent flying in a bloody mess. &nbsp;One of the Dragon Majin officers was a magician. &nbsp;His head was blown away by Mu’s mace. &nbsp;The other office was a Dragon Majin warrior, and his arms were broken. &nbsp;He backed off as he tried to gather his breath. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘W...what ridiculous power…..’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a losing fight from the beginning. &nbsp;The Guardian Shadows had the numeric superiority, and the fear of the waypoint being destroyed made them come here without much of a plan. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had come here thinking they would just buy some time. &nbsp;It was as Iota had surmised. &nbsp;Dragon Demon King worshippers were gathering to this location, so he had wanted to fight a defensive battle. &nbsp;He had thought he could turn the table on them….</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a complete miscalculation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He never expected to die in such a ridiculous manner. &nbsp;It happened when Jeffers was despairing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm. &nbsp;I guess you really are Almarick’s descendant? &nbsp;I guess I have to save you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An easygoing voice could be heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>6</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone became surprised, and they turned to look at the location where the voice had emananted. &nbsp;A Dragon Demon was coming towards them from the tunnel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iota was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He didn’t set off my detection magic?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had put up a detection magic spell. &nbsp;She wanted to keep tabs on what was going on outside. However, the Dragon Demon hadn’t triggered it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon youth had messy black hair. &nbsp;His eyes and Dragon Demon stone were a green color. &nbsp;He also had something akin to a ram’s horn that was silver with a bluish tint. His face didn’t hold any tension, and he looked kind. &nbsp;He looked as if he had come out without changing his clothes after he took a nap within his house. &nbsp;He was very loose. &nbsp;Basically, he was unarmed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why didn’t the Guardian Shadows react to him?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The problem wasn’t the fact that he was able to dodge her detection magic. &nbsp;Even the Guardian Shadows were unable to sense the presence of this youth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as that thought crossed their minds, one of the Guardian Shadows attacked him. &nbsp;The ghost closed the distance as he attacked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;What the hell?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lambda was astounded. &nbsp;The Dragon Demon youth just stood there, and he took the Guardian Shadow’s sword strike. &nbsp;However, after a moment, he could see that the youth had retreated the exact distance of the sword strike.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon youth laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow. &nbsp;You guys are so violent. &nbsp;You guys attack on sight? &nbsp;That kind of attitude will turn a non-enemy into an enemy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He leisurely avoided the sword strike to the side, and his presence started to change. &nbsp;His presence could now be felt by the Detection magic….</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Incredible Dragon Demon magic!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It felt as if all the hairs on her body was standing up on its ends. &nbsp;The relaxed looking Dragon Demon youth was letting out a boundless amount of Dragon Demon magic. &nbsp;It was a brief glimpse into his powers, but he was on a completely different level compared to Jeffers. &nbsp;&nbsp;Jeffers was outstanding in terms of Dragon Demon magic, but if one compared him to this youth… &nbsp;It was like comparing a brook to a lake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He is on a completely different level compared to any Dragon Demons I’ve seen up until now. &nbsp;He might exceed a Dragon in terms of power….!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iota had killed countless Dragon Demon king worshippers as the Keeper of Prophecy. However, no one had possessed comparable Dragon Demon magic as this person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The youth gestured to calm her down as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Calm down. &nbsp;I’m not a Dragon Demon king worshipper. &nbsp;I don’t really want to fight with you guys.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I came here to borrow and use the Road of Emptiness. &nbsp;However, the situation turned into this…. &nbsp;It would be great if you’ll allow me to take the descendant of Almarick. &nbsp;I don’t care what you do with the other afterwards.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The negotiation ends now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She attacked at the same time as she spoke. &nbsp;The clear magical constructs surrounded the youth, and the Guardian Shadows attack all at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-ahhhhhhhhhhng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was an explosion of light. &nbsp;However, the result completely differed from what Iota had expected. The entire force of Guardian Shadows were repelled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A clear light dragon was surrounding the youth’s body. &nbsp;Iota, Lambda and Mu became surprised when they saw it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What the hell is that?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a type of power they had never seen before. &nbsp;The red semi-transparent dragon of light wound itself around the youth's body and it was growling at them. &nbsp;One could feel a strong will from it as if it was alive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The youth scratched his cheeks as if he was in a bind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said I don’t want to fight, but you guys are being very aggressive. &nbsp;Well, I still haven’t decided what to do with you guys, so I’ll finish my business first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lambda! &nbsp;Mu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iota yelled out towards them. &nbsp;Lambda and Mu were like a tornado of steel as they charged the youth. &nbsp;They hadn’t completely neutralized Jeffers and the Dragon Majin officer, but this man was much more dangerous than them!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shwee, shwee, shwee, swheee!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lambda’s sword moved through the air in a dazzling display. &nbsp;A normal human would have died without seeing the sword coming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the youth evade all the sword strikes. &nbsp;He wasn’t even in a defensive stance. &nbsp;He just moved slightly to dodge with a paper thin margin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Kook!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Lambda was becoming frustrated, Mu lashed out with his shield from an angle. &nbsp;The surface area of the shield was large, so the youth had to avoid by making a big movement. &nbsp;Mu’s mace moved as if it had been waiting for this moment. &nbsp;It arrived where the youth couldn’t dodge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooht-cha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The youth blocked the mace with his bare hand. &nbsp;Mu was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;What kind of ridiculous…..!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mace had enough power to destroy a house. &nbsp;However, the youth had blocked it with one hand, and it looked as if the youth had felt a no ill effects from it. &nbsp;When the mace’s head met his palm, he pulled off a superb move by grabbing and pulling it to dissipate all of the power behind the mace. &nbsp;It was a crazy trick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afterwards, the youth disappeared from his field of vision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Too-oohng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Something brushed by Mu’s body. &nbsp;The youth had spun to the side as he applied a blow to Mu’s side. &nbsp;However, the blow was weak. &nbsp;Was he unable to put a lot of strength behind it, because he was moving so fast?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It happened as he had this thought. &nbsp;He tried to turn his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwah-jahk!</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Koo-uhkk……?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>His armor was destroyed, and his innermost bones were broken. &nbsp;Mu sank down to the floor. &nbsp;It had looked like a light attack, so did he use a skill? &nbsp;If it was a skill that penetrated armor, his magical amor should have stopped it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hoo-ooooooooooooooh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afterwards, a gust rose up. &nbsp;Lambda was a beat too late in attacking, and the youth was already gone. &nbsp;For a moment, he doubted his senses, since the youth had just disappeared. &nbsp;However, the youth was leisurely walking away, and each step moved him several meters away….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwah-kwah-kwah-kwah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>An explosion rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lambda and all the Guardian Shadows, who were running towards the youth, were all sent flying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;This… &nbsp;What a ridiculous technique……!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu was already on the floor, so he was able to see the truth behind the technique. &nbsp;The youth had used short-distance Instantaneous movements continuously, and he was off beat everytime he moved. &nbsp;It messed with everyone’s senses. &nbsp;The more surprising part was…. </span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;He isn’t just moving. &nbsp;He is using Instantaneous movement on each body part? This should be impossible!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The youth wasn’t just moving his entire body as a whole. &nbsp;His Instantaneous movement varied depending on what specific movements he wanted to perform. &nbsp;It was clear that his physical ability was outstanding, but how could his hands and feet use Instantaneous movement separate from the body? &nbsp;How were the hands and feet able to keep up?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It should be impossible. &nbsp;If an Undead like him tried this method, his bones would be crushed. &nbsp;So how was he able to pull it off with a living body? &nbsp;Just the act of repelling the Guardian Shadows should have crushed his body. &nbsp;When he forcibly stopped on a dime, the backlash should make his body explode.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh. &nbsp;You have a great eye to see that. &nbsp;You must have been very talented in life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The youth asked as if he was amused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Anyways…. &nbsp;Do you know where the miss acquired the item she is using? &nbsp;It is something I’ve seen before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The youth was a Dragon Arts practitioner, and he didn’t possess any magical items. &nbsp;This was why the magical constructs spread by Iota wasn’t responding to him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Iota spoke with a tense expression on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is no reason why I should tell you that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are being so cold. &nbsp;Box of Hate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iota flinched at his words. &nbsp;The words didn’t have any context behind it, so she thought he had spoken a word of activation. &nbsp;She was on guard for a spell. &nbsp;The youth let out a bitter laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“By your reaction, it seems you don’t know much about it even if you are using it. &nbsp;You call yourselves the Guardian Shadows….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He tilted his head, and he approached Jeffers….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-wahk! &nbsp;W...what the hell are you doing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He started stripping Jeffers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Booh-ook! &nbsp;Zzeek! &nbsp;Chul-koo-ruhk!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The armor was ripped away, and Jeffers’ clothes were torn away. &nbsp;Jeffers was scared out of his wits, so he struggled. &nbsp;However, the youth ruthlessly struck the back of Jeffers’ neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuh-uhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jeffers fainted immediately, and the youth stripped him nude in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was just dumbfounded as they watched what was happening. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>What the hell was he doing?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The youth put the nude Jeffers over his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please excuse me. &nbsp;You should get on with your work.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iota came to her senses as she yelled out, but the youth didn’t listen to her. &nbsp;He immediately kicked off the ground, and he disappeared using the Instantaneous method. &nbsp;Iota had put up magical constructs in the air, but it didn’t react to his presence. &nbsp;It was, because the youth had stripped Jeffers nude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kook!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Guardian Shadows tried to catch them, but they didn’t stand a chance. &nbsp;He was so fast that the Guardian Shadows couldn’t even react before he was past them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…that’s ridiculous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It feels like I just had a nightmare.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I agree with you.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The youth had destroyed their bodies, but the two Undead didn’t receive any critical blows. However, the blow had Dragon Demon magic behind it, so the recovery process was slowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;He could have slaughtered us all, yet he let us go… &nbsp;&nbsp;What is he thinking?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the youth had suggested in the beginning, he left behind the Dragon Majin officer after he rescued Jeffers. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>A silence had descended, and the first to break it was Iota. &nbsp;She spoke as she sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. &nbsp;There is no reason why he should stand here absent-mindedly. &nbsp;Let’s do our job then he can slowly think this over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;All right.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The remaining Dragon Majin officer's face turned pale. &nbsp;He had been listening to their absent-minded words, and now he realized his life was at an end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, a gruesome scream rang out, and their work was done.</span></p>
