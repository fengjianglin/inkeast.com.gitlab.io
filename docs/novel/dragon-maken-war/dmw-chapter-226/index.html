 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;I planned on making the decision after Kayalia comes back. &nbsp;I want to see what she’s able to achieve. &nbsp;I just know that I plan on fighting Atein. &nbsp;I plan on going against his will. &nbsp;Aside from that, I have no concrete plan.&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“…….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;Are you feeling conflicted about fighting your father?&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In truth, I am feeling conflicted. &nbsp;Why...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Saibein hesitated for a brief moment before he asked his question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why are you opposing my father?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;His plan doesn’t suit my style.&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I know your personality too well to question that answer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;I’ve always been like this.&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, my father has the same goal as before. &nbsp;Only his method of achieving his goal has changed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;It isn’t the same.&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reygus was firm in denying Saibein’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;Every being born into this world has the right to choose their fate. &nbsp;I don’t care about the details of his plan. &nbsp;I just know that he is trying to steal that right from others.&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reygus was a being that didn’t believe in the idea of good and evil. &nbsp;Most in nature lived according to their instinct. &nbsp;The concept of good and evil wasn’t something that could be applied to them. &nbsp;For example, carnivores weren’t evil for eating herbivores.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, free will was innate. &nbsp;It was a given right that allowed one to defy fate. &nbsp;It didn’t matter what species one was born to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was Reygus’ belief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During the Dragon Demon war, he had served Atein as his king. &nbsp;Reygus had observed the tragedies and turbulence caused by humanity. &nbsp;He had reasonably assumed that this was a byproduct of human nature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Atein had wanted to break this hellish death spiral caused by humans. &nbsp;He wanted to create a utopia. &nbsp;Reygus willingly gave his life to the cause. &nbsp;He thought it was something worth attempting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;Atein might be right. &nbsp;At some level, I sympathize with the despair he feels. &nbsp; I have lived a really simple life, and you get to see a lot of people. &nbsp;At some point, everyone starts to look like they are in the wrong to me.&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One had to believe in the concept of evil rather than good if one wanted people to be respectful towards each other. &nbsp;Atein thought a system where everyone feared an outsider would make people respect each other. &nbsp;He thought it would make the humans act more virtuous and moral.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Atein’s answer for the world had a foundation based on this concept.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;I don’t think the ideal world should be like a farm where the god feeds you for eternity. &nbsp;There are times when one needs to traverse a path even if it leads to bloodshed and resentment. &nbsp; If we take away the freedom to commit evil, will good really grow in its absence?&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“…….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Saibein was at a loss for words for a brief moment. &nbsp;He just stared at Reygus. &nbsp;He was impressed by the content of Reygus’ words, but it wasn’t the sole reason for his reaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“…somehow, you don’t sound like yourself, sir Reygus.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;Koohk! &nbsp;You probably thought I was an empty headed brute. &nbsp;Are you surprised by the fact that I’m able to speak coherent and logical thoughts?&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, I didn’t mean it like that…..”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;Of course, you did. &nbsp;I know I don’t sound like myself. &nbsp;In truth, this is a conversation I had with Atein a long time ago.&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You spoke about it with my father?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;Yes. &nbsp;He always liked to speak about boring specious arguments. &nbsp;I could write several dozen books about it. &nbsp;It is time for me to make him eat crow.&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reygus asked a question as he stroked his Soul Hammer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;What are you going to do, Saibein?&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I made a compact with Albatan-nim. &nbsp;I cannot interfere. &nbsp;It doesn’t matter what happens in the outside world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;Even if your daughter decides to fight Atein?&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“…….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Saibein’s expression crumpled. &nbsp;He looked tormented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fact that he was able to reunite with his daughter was a miracle in itself. &nbsp;His heart ached when he found out about the life his daughter had led. &nbsp;He felt guilty for abandoning his daughter, but….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was just happy that she was alive, and he was able to reunite with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Niberis didn’t blame him. &nbsp;However, complex emotions had developed between the two. &nbsp;It was creating difficulties between the father and daughter. &nbsp;A good amount of time had passed after she arrived here. &nbsp;However, there was an awkwardness between the two of them every time they crossed path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reygus scratched at his cheek.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;It seems I asked a churlish question.&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No. &nbsp;It is a problem that I have to own up to.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Saibien let out a sigh as he looked up at the sky. &nbsp;However, the feeling of gloominess didn’t abate at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><br></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">5</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kayalia didn’t hide anything when she told her story.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She talked about how she died during the Dragon Demon war. &nbsp;She talked about what kind of existence she was right now….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her true nature was very surprising. &nbsp;Her true self was placed within the Great Darkness, and she was able to project herself to any point in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">-There are a lot of restrictions. &nbsp;This became especially true once I decided to go against Atein….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Great Darkness was too big of a system for one being to monopolize.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Atein possessed the highest administrator privilege even if he couldn’t do as he wished with the entirety of the Great Darkness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For example, Atein could only watch as Reygus defected from his side. &nbsp;Atein had given Reygus the Soul hammer, the ability to transform and other powers. &nbsp;He couldn’t take those gifts back from Reygus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the same for Kayalia. &nbsp;If Atein wanted to eliminate the two of them, he would have to physically fight them.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Until Kayalia decided to oppose Atein, she was able to use the magical energy of the Great Darkness. &nbsp;There had been no restriction. &nbsp;Currently, there was a constraint on how much magical energy could be used by Kaylia.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">-Also, I was restricted from viewing the information that were being sent into the Great Darkness. &nbsp;The only information I’m privy to is the one I gather by projecting my image. &nbsp; That is why my movement has been restricted too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She could immediately project herself to any place on this continent, so spatial restriction had been meaningless to her. &nbsp;She had almost limitless power to do anything she wanted. &nbsp;The where and when hadn’t mattered. &nbsp;She had been an absolute being.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was true until Atein revoked her access to those powers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Currently, Kayalia needed reference points to project herself. &nbsp;It was akin to humans having to swivel their head to see where they were. &nbsp;Moreover, she had to gather all her magical energy in order to project her image. &nbsp;If she were to be attacked, her image would be destroyed.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing her out, Azell queried her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why are you revealing your weak point to us?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">-I guess that’s true.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Kayalia just accepted his words, it somehow drained the energy out of Azell. &nbsp;He had put in great efforts for his arguments, yet she just accepted everything he said. &nbsp;What was she trying to pull?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kayalia spoke.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Azell’s expression turned cold. &nbsp;Did she think he’ll gloss over everything, because she called him oppa? &nbsp;It was a ridiculous notion.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">-Even if it wasn’t me, I’m sure there were others willing to wipe your face when it became dirty, right? &nbsp;Azell oppa has always been popular.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kayalia had a sad smile on her face as she spoke.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kayalia spoke about the story she had told Reygus. &nbsp;She told Azell about her life. &nbsp;In the distant past, she had created a reincarnation technique. &nbsp;She also told him about how a first generation Dragon Demon became the Dragon Demon King’s third wife. &nbsp;She told him about the very long process in between.</span></p>
