 <p>Chapter 121 - Specters from the Past (1)</p>
 <p><span style>1</span></p>
 <p><span style>The light, which was reflecting off the surface of the water, was dancing on the walls of the cave. &nbsp;The uneven surface of the wall had been created by the hands of nature, and a mysterious sight could be seen as the light undulated on the surface of wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leone was watching this sight inside his dream. &nbsp;It was as if he was mesmerized. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was aware. &nbsp;He knew he had never been to this place, and he had never seen this sight in real life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So where did this memory originate? &nbsp;Was this an illusion created by his dream?</span></p>
 <p><span style>That wasn’t it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This site existed somewhere on this world. &nbsp;He was sure of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover….</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Another empty seat has been filled..&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone was speaking from within the light. &nbsp;It was a bleak voice. &nbsp;It was as if someone had squeezed the dregs of darkness. &nbsp;It felt as if one’s life span would shorten just from listening to that voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could someone from this world possess such a voice?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leone wondered about this question. &nbsp;However, when he saw the owner of the voice, he forgot to breathe from the surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A faint light danced above the water gathered inside the cave. &nbsp;The fragment of light looked like fireflies flying through the midsummer night, but one couldn’t see where the light originated. &nbsp;They were so faint that they looked as if they were about to be swallowed by the darkness. &nbsp;However, they were like flowers that wilted in the cold winter air before they bloomed once again in season. &nbsp;The fragments of light were beautiful and ephemeral.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the middle of this view, a silhouette wrapped up in darkness existed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strangely, Leone couldn’t see his face. The fragments of light in the surrounding brushed by this figure, but he couldn’t what was beneath the well-worn hood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Congratulations. &nbsp;You’ve been cursed.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leone was more focused on his appearance rather than his nonsensical words. &nbsp;The figure was submerged half in the water, so he looked beyond bizarre.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The well-worn robe covered his entire body, and it looked as if something was deeply embedded in its chest. &nbsp;At first, Leone thought it was a sword. &nbsp;However, the end was round. &nbsp;It was a wooden staff with a clear gem transfixed to the end. &nbsp;This wooden staff pierced through the figure’s chest, and darkness was emanating from there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, there was an oblong pillar made out of silver behind its back. &nbsp;Black chains bound him to the silver pillar, and one could see darkness crawling across the surface to form words. &nbsp;Darkness emanated from the characters as if it was a manifestation of a curse. &nbsp;It made Leone’s skin crawl. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Leone asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You don’t need to know.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;We’ve never met before, and we’ll never meet even in the future. &nbsp;You, who wanted to be cursed, will never have the opportunity to meet me if you attain your wish. &nbsp;If you do not attain your wish, you won’t have a reason to meet me either.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You’ve never been to this place, and you will never return here again. &nbsp;&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>His words rang like thunder in Leone’s ears, and the dream ended there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Guardian Shadow’s Keeper of Prophecy Leone opened his eyes. &nbsp;He had seen this ceiling for several days, so he was used to it. &nbsp;He blankly stared up at the ceiling, and soon, he realized his body was soaked with cold sweat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I hate this. &nbsp;I always have this dream when I’m in a bad spot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you mean your first memory? &nbsp;Isn’t that a good thing? &nbsp;Isn’t it proof that you are still alive?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you here, brat Jares?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When you acted like a lazy bag of bones by not waking up in the afternoon, the young lady pestered me to look in on you. &nbsp;How did you bewitch her? &nbsp;She is a beautiful lady from a good bloodline. &nbsp;There is something wrong about her being enamored with the likes of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t act arrogant like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leone snorted as he got up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was in a house of a person, who owed him a favor. &nbsp;After suffering a crushing defeat at the hands of Reygus, they had requested help from the nearby Guardian Shadows to help them evade their enemies. &nbsp;After losing their pursuers, they had come here to rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jares shrugged his shoulder as if he couldn’t understand it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve been going around acting as an agent of justice. &nbsp;You must have a lot of spare time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unlike you, the feeling of justice is still alive and well inside my heart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…isn’t that a low quality joke?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When I see your ugly mug, I can only come up with low quality jokes. &nbsp;Anyways, it is advantageous for us to rescue people when we have the time to spare. &nbsp;Currently, we are reaping the reward for what I did before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t deny that logic. &nbsp;Should I go around and do some good deeds?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“With your personality? &nbsp;It’ll be impossible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t dispute that fact. &nbsp;Hmm. &nbsp;What do you think he is, brat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When you say he, who are you talking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The guy in our dreams. &nbsp;He’s probably the guy, who made us into what we are.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s a mage. &nbsp;He’s probably someone very talented that remained hidden from the world. &nbsp;Moreover, he probably has a very deep grudge against the Dragon Demon king worshippers that can’t be washed away….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My thoughts are a little bit different from yours.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You probably tried to come up with an unconventional answer to show off to others. &nbsp;If so, you are barking up the wrong tree.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…the fact that I can’t categorically deny your accusation makes me feel a bit sad. &nbsp;Anyways, what do you think about my theory? &nbsp;What if he’s a Demon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jares grumbled. &nbsp;Leone furrowed his brows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Demon. &nbsp;What led you to have to have such a thought?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No matter how I look at it, all of this couldn’t have been created by a human. &nbsp;The Demon race loves powerful souls of humans. &nbsp;Don’t they reveal knowledge to humans to lead them to their destruction?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm. &nbsp;Then why would a Demon make the Guardian Shadows?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, I'm not a magician. &nbsp;I’m not too familiar with the Demons…. &nbsp;If you think about it, it might be a very clever ploy. &nbsp;The other Demons have to work on one subject at a time. &nbsp;Instead of convincing one person to make a contract, I think this Demon created a big farm that will bring him a continuous flow of souls to harvest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm. &nbsp;I’m not sure what you are trying to say.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First, the Demon race corrupts humans as they lead them down the road to destruction &nbsp;Let’s talk about that point. &nbsp;I’m not sure how they measure how strong a soul is….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You speak as if you are some great magician with knowledge about this subject.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, I learned about it, while I studied about magic. &nbsp;Anyways, humans have a vast quantity of desires, and it’s a reason why they fall prey to the Demons. &nbsp;When I say desires, there are different types of desires. &nbsp;Most humans desire success in society. &nbsp;Martial artists desire to become stronger. &nbsp;Magicians wants to gain forbidden knowledge that’ll put them above other magicians. &nbsp;Those in love wants to possess the subject of their affection. &nbsp;The people with grudges wants revenge….. &nbsp;If one looks at the record, the ones with the biggest desires are the ones, who become tempted by the Demons.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“ I see. &nbsp;You’ve studied hard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should focus on two things. &nbsp;First, a Demon has to have a direct relationship with the fallen. &nbsp;The soul can only be taken by the Demon, who corrupted the human. &nbsp;Secondly, in the process of corrupting the humans, the Demons are negligent in what they give out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm. &nbsp;I can see what you are thinking. &nbsp;You think a Demon created a system called the Guardian Shadows by using humans with deep resentments. &nbsp;So you are saying this system is being used to harvest souls that are about to be destroyed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;I call it the farm of ruination.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It does sound plausible even if this was something you came up with it. &nbsp;Still, how are you defining what ‘ruination’ is? &nbsp;In a typical story about the Demon race, they are very nuanced in their approach. &nbsp;They make humans abandon morality as the price of success. &nbsp;One by one humanity is stripped away from the human, and it leads to the fall…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In my opinion, that is an interpretation created, so it can be easily digested by the masses. &nbsp;Not all relationships that existed between humans and demons were known to the world. &nbsp;In the end, the process doesn’t matter. &nbsp;They just need to bring about a result that fits the word, ‘ruination’.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have a point. &nbsp;If the contract only says ‘ruination’, the word could be up for interpretation. If you put it that way, your argument does seem to have some merit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if it is true, it has nothing to with us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the same for all the Keepers of the Prophecy. &nbsp;They didn’t care how &nbsp;they had acquired their power. &nbsp;It didn’t matter if their power was given to them by a magician using a forbidden technique or an evil magician aiming for their souls. &nbsp;If they could eliminate the Dragon Demon king worshippers from this world, they would willingly hold hands with the devil.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leone spoke in exasperation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How bored were you? &nbsp;You studied about the Demon race to come up with this nonsense. &nbsp;Moreover, even if you theory is true, it wouldn’t explain the prophecy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know why the Demon race wants the human souls in the first place, so I can’t explain that. &nbsp;However….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That information is already known.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the problem with a non-mage like you. &nbsp;It isn’t as if you are great at Spirit Order either… &nbsp;Why don’t you go into a mountain to train? &nbsp;You should train as if you life is on the line.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I could have gotten stronger doing that, I would have already become a legendary swordsman.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought you just didn’t put in the effort. &nbsp;You should look at Azell Zestringer. &nbsp;He was able to catch a Dragon after training in Spirit Order for half a year.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If everyone could do what he did, Dragons would have already gone extinct early on. &nbsp;Well, let’s stop talking about useless topics. &nbsp;So why do Demons collect human souls?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know about the origin story of the Dragon Demon race?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They were born from the union of the dimwitted Dragons and the cunning Demons.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;The answer is right in front of you. &nbsp;The Dragons wanted knowledge. &nbsp;What did the Demons want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm. &nbsp;They wanted the Dragon’s power?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expect, you are dumb, brat Jares. &nbsp;Since you were spouting some plausible conjectures, for a moment, I thought you were smart. &nbsp;I was foolish for thinking that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Demons desires substance. &nbsp;They thirst for the opportunity to be able to live in this world as true inhabitants of this world. &nbsp;This fundamental reason makes the Demons act in such an irrational manner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In what way?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They hate the living, yet they thirst to live amongst the living. &nbsp;This thirst was the impetus for them to join with the Dragons to create the Dragon Demon race... &nbsp;Then they started working on obtaining human souls.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand the first part of your explanation, but you are losing me towards the end. What difference does it make for them to possess human souls? &nbsp;Will they be able to live their lives as humans?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That I do not know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just know that Demons get some sort of satisfaction from gaining a human’s soul. &nbsp;If you want a more concrete answer, you’ll have to risk your life to deal with the Demon race. &nbsp;Or you can steal knowledge from the Black Magicians, who have gained some result from researching the Demons.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you say steal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For a magician, knowledge is life. &nbsp;Moreover, the Black Magicians have no problem throwing away morality and duty of being a human. &nbsp;That is why one has no choice, but to steal the information from them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmm…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leone asked a question, while Jares thought about what had been said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think about him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He made us….. &nbsp;You aren’t talking about him. &nbsp;Do you mean Azell Zestringer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have no idea. &nbsp;In the beginning, the evidence pointed him out to be the prophesied being. &nbsp;However, if what we learned from Azell Zestringer is true, it isn’t too hard for humans to obtain the power of a Dragon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You say it isn’t difficult, but you aren’t able to do it. &nbsp;Maybe you should just fall on your sword in shame.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph. &nbsp;Anyways, there were other humans like Azell Zestringer before the Guardian Shadows were created. &nbsp;This is why our initial criteria for finding the prophesied being won’t prove that he is a unique existence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unfortunately, you are right. However, he is special.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is like a Demon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In what way?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We don’t know his identity, and he is overflowing with knowledge of unknown origin. &nbsp;Moreover, all the knowledge he revealed was being treated as something sensitive in nature by the Dragon Demon king worshippers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmm. When you put it like that, I do see the parallel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think he is the person mentioned in the prophecy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you completely made up your mind?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not yet. &nbsp;However, the more I see of him… &nbsp;I feel a sense of longing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me too. &nbsp;It is as if I’ve seen him somewhere before. &nbsp;It might be the fact that he looks almost identical to the portrait of Azell Karzark.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That might be it. &nbsp;However, there is an echo of a longing in side me for him. &nbsp;It is as if I’m meeting a long lost family member.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm… &nbsp;Did you live so long that you’ve become crazy? &nbsp;Did you remember something about your family? ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unfortunately, I can only remember that my sister’s death was incredibly sad for me. &nbsp;Aside from that, I remember nothing...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leone let out a bitter laugh. &nbsp;He was sure he had a sister he had treasured. &nbsp;He would have given up his life to protect her… &nbsp;However, he had been helpless to save her as he watched her die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The grudge he possessed allowed him to become the Guardian Shadow’s Keeper of Prophecy. &nbsp;As a price for becoming one, he had lost all memories of her. &nbsp;He couldn’t even remember her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only thing left was the occasional sound of her laugh that tickled his ears. &nbsp;This sound was the only connection he had to his memories, and it allowed Leone to hold on to his humanity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know what Balseru is thinking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not sure either. &nbsp;I’ve never been able to discern what Alpha is thinking….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru was the Keeper of the Prophecy, who went to seek out Azell. &nbsp;He was their leader, and he was given the code name Alpha. &nbsp;This didn’t mean he was the first Keeper of Prophecy. &nbsp;The very first Alpha had perished, and Balseru smoothly assumed that position. &nbsp;He was considered to be unique even amongst the Keepers of the Prophecy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leone was supposed to go, but he had received a severe injury. &nbsp;Alpha had gone in his stead. &nbsp;He went to confirm an important fact. &nbsp;Alpha hadn’t moved even when they had mobilized a Dragon to test Azell. &nbsp;So Leone wonder why Alpha insisted taking on this task. &nbsp;However, Leone predicted that the meeting between Alpha and Azell would be an important watershed moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maybe we are all… &nbsp;The end to our existence might be getting closer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I hope you are right. &nbsp;Still, I don’t think your expectations will come true.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jares grumbled. &nbsp;</span></p>
