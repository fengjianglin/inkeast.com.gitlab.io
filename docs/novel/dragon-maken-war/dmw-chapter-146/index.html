 <p><span style>Chapter 146 - Heaven and Hell (2)</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were the Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;Over 50 of them were following along as if they were guarding Azell. &nbsp;As time passed, the number grew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen had a peculiar expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it possible for us to communicate with them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems we have a hard time understanding them, but they understand us pretty well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm. &nbsp;I think you are right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Also, we aren’t really asking them to do anything difficult.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Yuren approached them, all the Guardian Shadows turned to look at him. &nbsp;They were ghost-likes figures, and they all stared at him at the exact same moment. &nbsp;It was eerie. &nbsp;Yuren gulped as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have a request. &nbsp;I don’t care what kind, but could you guys capture some of the animals nearby? &nbsp;They have to be brought back alive…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>「We can do it…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>「Beasts…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>「We hunt…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>About half of the 50 Guardian Shadows dispersed into the forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In short order, Yuren had a pile of animals in front of him. &nbsp;Either bones were broken or magic was used to immobilize the animals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is enough. &nbsp;You should use this too, Laura. &nbsp;I’ll continue Azell’s treatment for now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike Yuren, Laura’s magical energy and stamina had been exhausted. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was more effective to steal life energy rather than meditate. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren continued his treatment as he asked Kairen a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What should we do now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Azell had lost his consciousness, it was up to Kairen to lead the party.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought about taking us to the nearest city to avoid them….. &nbsp;&nbsp;However, I decided against it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know about the others, but I don't think Reygus will give up even if we go into a city. &nbsp;If we go into a city to use the civilians as shields, what happens if they do decide to attack….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A catastrophe would occur. &nbsp;If Reygus went wild at the center of a city, there would be several thousand civilian casualties.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, it’ll be hard for us to continue running away like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still, our situation won’t improve by going into a city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess you are right. &nbsp;Even if they don’t attack us, we’ll become surrounded.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For now, we have to rely on them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The number of Guardian Shadows were increasing. &nbsp;It was as if all the Guardian Shadows on the continent was gathering here. &nbsp;If the Guardian Shadows could hold back the enemies, it wouldn’t be too difficult for the party to run away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Kairen asked them a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys are all gathering here… &nbsp;As expected, Azell is the man from the prophecy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>「Prophecy…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>「The person from the prophecy…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>「Hero…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>「We put our trust…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>「The person that made our existence possible…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Guardian Shadows started to speak from all sides.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen confirmed it when he heard their words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was the prophesied being.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He is human yet he possesses Dragon Demon magic. &nbsp;He will be the vessel for a great power, and he will attain our greatest wish.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The being that created the Guardian Shadows had left behind this prophecy to the Guardians of the Prophecy. &nbsp;The person mentioned would bring total destruction to the Dragon Demon king worshippers, and he would end this fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, he had a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean by ‘the person that made our existence possible’?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>「He started…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>「He was the beginning…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>「He connects the beginning and the end….…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected, it was hard to communicate with them. &nbsp;Kairen’s face hardened from annoyance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment. &nbsp;The founder of the Guardian Shadow was….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Azell had explained his own identity, he had spoke about this very topic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘</span><span style>“His best friend, Archmage Carlos, devoted himself to completing an incredible magic. &nbsp;What if this magic was used to put Azell in a deep sleep where his aging process was suspended? &nbsp;What if he was placed in a location far away from prying eyes? &nbsp;What if he slept like a Dragon through the long years in a place where humans didn’t dare travel?</span><span style>’</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the time, he had thought Azell was talking nonsense. &nbsp;However, he now realized that Azell had confessed the truth to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed the truth had been buried, and it had been lost to the world. &nbsp;Who was the last person to know of Azell’s whereabouts? &nbsp;Who could have made a prophecy that pointed to Azell as the final hope? &nbsp;What magician was audacious enough to make ludicrous beings such as the Guardian Shadows?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen could only think of one such person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Archmage Carlos Rizester…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There might have been others that may have known where Azell had been sleeping.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when one entered the qualifier that this person had to be a caliber of a magician able to create the Guardian Shadows, the only one that came to mind was Carlos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t Reygus ask about the whereabouts of Carlos?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since Azell is Azell Karzark, it wouldn’t be strange if Carlos Rizester was still alive somewhere. &nbsp;It really is hard to believe, but the proof is right in front of us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The strongest pair from the Dragon Demon war will re-emerge into the current era. &nbsp;It really does sound like a joke.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is a story that comes up quite often between knights and magicians.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is theorized that the records from the Dragon Demon war was exaggerated. &nbsp;Still, many people try to be objective when discussing this subject. &nbsp;The magicians and knights talk about how they would have fared against the figures from the Dragon Demon war…… &nbsp;This was why I’ve heard a lot of those talks between men. &nbsp;They talked for days comparing who was stronger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen let out a bitter laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt the truth in his bones when he saw the fight between Azell and Reygus. &nbsp;He knew now that the records from the Dragon Demon war wasn’t exaggerated. &nbsp;The truth was written into the record as is.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘However, if Carlos had created the Guardian Shadows, there are still many unanswered questions….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Guardian Shadows were a secret organization, and their existence weren’t known to the world. &nbsp;So why didn’t Carlos reveal his identity to Azell and the Guardian Shadows? &nbsp;Why did he only leave behind such a vague prophecy?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, even if he had the capability to create such beings, Kairen couldn’t discern the exact purpose behind creating the Guardian Shadows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Kairen was in Carlos’ shoes, he would have done it differently. &nbsp;After faking his death from the world, wouldn’t it have been better to use his influence from the background to create an organization that could rival the Dragon Demon king worshippers?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos had hidden his existence from the Guardian Shadows, and the Guardian Shadows started their activities only after the Great Darkness. &nbsp;Kairen wonder why Carlos hadn’t opposed the Dragon Demon King worshippers before the Great Darkness when they had trampled over the human society. &nbsp;What situation prevented him from doing so?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Yuren spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, we can’t say for sure that this was done by Carlos.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The hints gathered here makes it easy to point the finger towards Carlos. &nbsp;However, there are many unanswered questions. &nbsp;Wouldn’t it be likely be the work of a descendant of Carlos that had been hidden from history? &nbsp;I’m also one of the unknown descendant of Carlos.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You say you are Carlos’ descendant. &nbsp;It seems you have no doubts to the veracity of that claim.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Azell did say I looked like Carlos.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still, it isn’t definite proof that you are a descendant of Carlos. &nbsp;Of course, there is also no reason not to believe your claim.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jeez. &nbsp;You are casting doubt on the identity of your comrade.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since we have the same goal, I’ll honor the fact that we are comrades. &nbsp;However, your identity is a bit suspect…. &nbsp;First, your guide is very suspicious. &nbsp;Don’t we have to figure out his identity first?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sadly, I can’t refute that point….. &nbsp;Anyways, I recently came up with a fun theory about the identity of the guide.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What theory?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It could be Sage Baion…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Baion? Why are you suddenly bringing him into this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen furrowed his brows. &nbsp;He had suffered through the Great Darkness, so of course, he was sensitive about that name.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren was about to reply when it occurred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-ook…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell moaned as he opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren had a look of pleasure on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Azell!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you awake? &nbsp;Can you hear me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren asked the questions. &nbsp;Azell spoke in a labored manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Loud….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop speaking so loudly……. My head…is ringing…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;I’m sorry. &nbsp;I was just so surprised.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren let out a bitter laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell let out a sigh then he opened his mouth. &nbsp;However, his mouth moved without emitting a sound, so Azell decided to communicate using Whispering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Since it is too difficult to speak, I’ll communicate through this technique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That might be fore the best.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Someone filled by body with turbid life energy.&nbsp; Did you do it, Yuren? </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was the only way we could treat you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>-It seems we didn’t have the luxury to go to a healer. &nbsp;I am worried about the side effect…. I guess it is better than dying from lack of treatment. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he spoke those words, he started actively using the life energy of the beasts injected into his body by Yuren. &nbsp;When he was unconscious, he had passively received the life energy. &nbsp;Now he was aware of the status of his body, so he could focus the life energy towards the locations that needed it the most.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren was surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems something accelerated the process?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>-It is thanks to the power of the Dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I’ve taken the power of the Dragons using the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual, but I hadn’t been able to digest it all yet. &nbsp;In the process of healing, the power is now permeating into my body. &nbsp;It is a huge waste of power, but it can’t be helped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell furrowed his brows. &nbsp;If he used the power of the Dragon for recovery, there was a downside. &nbsp;He had originally planned on using the power to strengthen his body. &nbsp;He had planned on using it to turn his magical energy further into Dragon Demon magic. That power was now being diverted. &nbsp;Still, this was the best way forward right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His body was becoming noticeably better as his recovery speed increased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The members of the party wondered if Azell could recover from such an injury. &nbsp;Even if he was able to get better, it was assumed that Azell would suffer from the aftereffects. &nbsp;His wounds were that serious. &nbsp;His bones, muscles, organs and nerves…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood flow had been stemmed through force, but now his blood circulation was slowly normalizing. &nbsp;The damaged tissues were regaining their original forms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The process was quite slow. &nbsp;His recovery speed was much faster than a normal person, but he wasn’t able to be instantly cured from a serious injury.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Please explain our current situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It has been about an hour since we’ve exited the battlefield.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Only that much time had passed?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was surprised. &nbsp;He had completely lost consciousness, so he had no idea how much time had passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren was terse as he explained the current situation. &nbsp;He also told Azell about the Guardian Shadows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…this was why we were treating you while we took a break. &nbsp;Moreover, we can’t dally here much longer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I see. &nbsp;I don’t know what method they are using, but they are able to track us….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If their tracking method is still viable, they can track us down at any moment. &nbsp;If they do track us down, we have to rely on the Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;We have no choice but to keep running away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>-The path to the Albatan forest will be quite treacherous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems you still plan on going there. &nbsp;Maybe, that location might be the safest place for us….”</span></p>
