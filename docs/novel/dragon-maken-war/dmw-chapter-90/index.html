 <p><span style>Chapter 90 - Birth of the Dragon Sword (5)</span></p>
 <p><span style>In three minutes, Azell used one hundredth of the power used by Seigar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar was using the ability of his superhuman body to try to regain his broken stance. &nbsp;His senses were accelerated to the extreme using Dragon Demon magic, and he was even using the Dragon Arts technique that he had drilled at ad nauseum. &nbsp;Azell moved in a relaxed manner compared to him. &nbsp;He was emitting mental waves through Spirit Order, and he was stimulating Seigar's senses. &nbsp;He was using it to bring out the response he wanted. &nbsp;It was as if he had the power to foresee the future. &nbsp;Azell took one or two step at a time as he stabbed his sword in an easygoing manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just by doing that Seigar wasn't able to get up. &nbsp;In terms of Magical Energy, techniques dealing with senses, and the gap in insight regarding a battle... &nbsp;In every facet, Azell was on a different stratosphere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, a sound of an explosion rang out, and Seigar body flew into the air. &nbsp;He had no sense of balance as his body spun in the air. &nbsp;Seigar's body struck the ground, and he rolled across the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he got up, Seigar was a total wreck. &nbsp;He wasn't wounded, but he was out of breath. &nbsp;He was dripping with sweat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huhk, huhk, huh-uhk…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar's stamina was absolute. &nbsp;He was able to swing a large sword, while wearing heavy armor, for an extended amount of time. &nbsp;However, he had been continuously rolling on the floor. He hadn't be able to tell the difference between up, down, left or right. &nbsp;As he rolled, he had felt his Energy Pulse being blocked intermittently, and his stamina had been drained at an incredible pace. &nbsp;His stamina had just bottomed out right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He intentionally let me up.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Azell had wanted to, he could have forced Seigar to roll on the ground until he had fainted. &nbsp;Seigar realized this fact. &nbsp;He knew Azell had intentionally left open an opening, so he could get out of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, he had suffered all kinds of difficult situation as he was trained by Kairen. &nbsp;However, this experience was uncharted territory for Seigar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell approached as Seigar sucked in air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You took a spanking of this magnitude, yet all you can do is try to get your breath back? &nbsp;You are soft as they come.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-oohk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar felt an unprecedented fear as he faced Azell. &nbsp;Seigar had lost his composure, and he unconsciously swung his sword when Azell closed the distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a strike powerful enough to split a boulder in half. &nbsp;However, Azell didn't dodge it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shweeeeeng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I missed?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar's eyes bulged. &nbsp;Azell hadn't dodged, yet he had walked inside his strike to close the distance. &nbsp;Seigar's attack met no resistance as it cut through the air, and his stance broke down again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A combination of the Cloning technique, Concealment technique and the mental wave, which stimulated the senses, was used to produce this result. &nbsp;Azell had come into Seigar's personal space a beat late as if by magic. &nbsp;Azell was still unhurried as he leisurely took a step forward. &nbsp;Seigar's stance had been broken, so he couldn't do anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Too-hahk!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell didn't even use his sword. &nbsp;He struck his fist against Seigar's shoulder before he could right himself. &nbsp;This wasn't just a simple blow. &nbsp;Seigar had been forcefully righting himself, and Azell's blow was perfectly timed. &nbsp;It accurately severed the flow of his Energy Pulse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar was about to fall over once again. &nbsp;He gritted his teeth, and he used his powerful lower body to endure. &nbsp;Then he lashed out with his sword....</span></p>
 <p><span style>Too-kahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The counter came even before Seigar could swing his sword half way. &nbsp;Azell lightly backhanded Seigar's body with the hand holding his sword. &nbsp;The impact penetrated through his midsection, and the pain could be felt in his bones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Kuh-huhk……!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar was having a hard time breathing, and he felt his body folding. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he realized this, Seigar tried to use his Dragon Arts....</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tuhng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if he had been waiting for this move, Azell focused his mind. &nbsp;In an instant, he planted a counter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This… is… impossib……!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar felt as if he was in a nightmare. &nbsp;It felt as if his opponent could see everything that was going on within his body, and every one of his actions were countered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This wasn't something one could do just because one's techniques were good. &nbsp;Azell's extreme senses were able to read everything about Seigar. &nbsp;However, one needed an ungodly reflexive speed that good react to these sensory inputs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This exchange repeated itself several time, and it was hard for Seigar to even grip his sword. &nbsp;However, he refused to fall. &nbsp;Even as he was steadily moving backwards, Seigar gritted his teeth, and he stood on his own two feet....</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is my chance!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>After intentionally baiting a counter, Seigar leaned in to deflect the blow with his shoulder. &nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he jumped, and he brought down his sword with everything he had.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That wasn't too bad. &nbsp;If you did this about 5 exchanges earlier, I might have given you a passing score.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell sounded as if he was enjoying this, and his words chilled Seigar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Seigar continued to receive frightening blows, he had saved his energy for a chance to attack. &nbsp;However, it seemed even this had been within Azell's design.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell countered Seigiar's sword strike head on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the sound of an explosion rang out, Seigar flew through the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I lost the hold of my sword……!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a fight, he was taught to hold onto the sword no matter what. &nbsp;This mandate was almost like scripture to him. &nbsp;However, for the first time in his life, he had received such an overwhelming blow that even his steel gauntlet exploded. &nbsp;He lost the grip on his sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-dahng-tahng-tahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Accompanying the loud sound, Seigar rolled several times across the floor before he became sprawled out on the ground. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>When it quieted down, Azell asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Would you like to continue this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No… &nbsp;It's fine. &nbsp;It is my defeat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar acknowledged his defeat with a tired voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>8</span></p>
 <p><span style>On that night, Azell was in front of a mirror, and he was letting someone handle his hair. &nbsp;Enora was standing on a step, and she was brushing out Azell's hair. &nbsp;Azell had roughly cut his hair to keep it at a reasonable length, but it seemed Enora wasn't satisfied with his haircut. &nbsp;She volunteered her services.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She suddenly asked him a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why were you so wicked against the prince?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He isn't just any person. &nbsp;He is the prince. &nbsp;Weren't your actions a bit too much?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn't I do something similar to Boar?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell thought about the time Boar requested a sparring match as he spoke. &nbsp;Enora thought for a brief moment before she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…now that I think about it, you are right. &nbsp;You have always been reckless, sir Azell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? &nbsp;Reckless? &nbsp;In what way?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can you be so shameless? &nbsp;You treated the prince that way. &nbsp;No one would even think about doing what you have done. &nbsp;Do you know how afraid I was as I watched? &nbsp;If the prince became angry, he could have asked for your head! &nbsp;What would you do if he did that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I carried out the deed, because I assessed the the prince wasn't that narrow-minded. &nbsp;Anyways, I wanted to avoid it if possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From Azell's perspective, he didn't feel the need to be considerate towards Seigar. &nbsp;It wasn't as if they had gone through a life and death situation alongside each other. &nbsp;Seigar was Kairen's student, and brother of Arrieta, nothing more, nothing less. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why Azell didn't want to bring unnecessary attention on himself. &nbsp;He didn't make himself known to Seigar. &nbsp;He was a bit bothered by the fact that the Dragon Demon king worshippers were targeting Seigar, but Seigar had experienced an attempted kidnapping once. &nbsp;Azell assumed Seigar would be careful on his own.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On top of it all, Kairen had always been a bit too eager for Azell to fight Seigar, and there was some distaste from that fact too. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar had experienced bone-weary hardship, and he had seen everything with his own two eyes. &nbsp;However, he wasn't able to let go of his self-conceit. &nbsp;Why should Azell look kindly on a person like that?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enora spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir Azell is really.... &nbsp;You look as if you aren't afraid of people in high places.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In truth, I'm not afraid of them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, he tried to spare himself from the trouble. &nbsp;If he fought with a person with power and rank, it would inevitably cause harm to the people in his surrounding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No. That's not entirely correct either.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he thought about it, no one in the Nadick Empire dared to get on his nerve after the Dragon Demon war. &nbsp;He was someone that had access to Carlos and the emperor. &nbsp;Moreover, he had many friends in high places, and the people had loved him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Now that I think about it, if someone accused me of leading a reckless life, I have no argument against it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enora worked as a maid to the royal family, so Azell's attitude shocked her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enora was astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this because you are the legendary hero?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmm. &nbsp;Do you believe my story, Ms Enora?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maybe?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enora had the eyes of a surprised bunny when Azell started talking about his own identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wondered what thoughts were going through her head. &nbsp;Azell laughed when he had this thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of answer is that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don't know. &nbsp;If I think about it logically, it doesn't make sense. &nbsp;Do you know what I mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn't something you should try to confirm with me."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm. &nbsp;Is that so? &nbsp;Anyways.... &nbsp;If it is true, I would be a little bit disappointed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“From the time I was young, I grew up listening to the story of hero Azell Karzark until my ears hurt.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were a lot of heroes in history. &nbsp;However, how many hero had received universal praise from everyone like Azell?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even in this era, Azell Karzark was the most well known and popular hero. &nbsp;Many children during the Dragon Demon war grew up hearing the tales of Azell's heroism, and many young women dreamed about him showing up in front of them like a knight in shining armor. &nbsp;As time passed, Azell became an idol, and his image became engraved as the epitome of a hero.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, sir Azell is a bit... &nbsp;How should I say this...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enora tilted her head as she thought about what to say. &nbsp;Then she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are like the brother next door.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That's new.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell laughed. &nbsp;He had never heard himself described as the brother next door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enora spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is as if the brother next door had a somewhat mysterious and secretive past. &nbsp;Moreover, this person had defeated a Dragon by himself. &nbsp;All of this just makes everything surreal. Sometimes it feels like I'm listening to a story dreamed up by a bard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sometimes reality can outstrip one's imagination.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess so. &nbsp;If it really is true, it does sound really incredible. &nbsp;At the same time, it feels as if it isn’t that big of a deal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the heck?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell couldn't help but laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enora suddenly spoke. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let's say it is true.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? &nbsp;Do you mean what if I am the real Azell Karzark?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. That is my supposition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should just say you don't believe me. &nbsp;What the heck is up with a supposition?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don't be so picky about my answer. &nbsp;If a man shows such a behavior, he won't be popular with the ladies.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll just shut up and listen to you. &nbsp;Please continue, miss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think the era was like when hero Azell was alive? &nbsp;People were tormented by the Dragon Demon race, and there were a lot of righteous people willingly sacrifice their lives for other people. &nbsp;How different was that era?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell put on a bitter smile at her questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unexpectedly, there isn't much of a difference. &nbsp;At the very least, the people are the same.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really? &nbsp;”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yup.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, if I hear about the tales describing the old times, it doesn't sound like it....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As time passes, they only remember the memorable events. &nbsp;They remember the beautiful blinding moments, and they remember the evil events that one can't look away from... &nbsp;However, &nbsp;&nbsp;those events didn’t make up the entirety of that era.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the time, people had to join forces to fight an enormous enemy that threatened their future. However, even in such a dire situation, people continued to fight those within the same organization for profit. &nbsp;There were those that tried to avoid facing death when it was time to cooperate each other. &nbsp;Discrimination occurred regardless of one's position.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“During that era, everyone was backed up against a wall. &nbsp;When people have nowhere to run, their true character is revealed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One wouldn't know if a person was truly hideous or noble unless they reached this point. &nbsp;It didn’t matter if a person normally acted like a crook or if that person acted with integrity. &nbsp;When people were driven into a corner, they sometimes chose the coward’s way out. &nbsp;They also chose to act villainous at times. &nbsp;Then there was the people that were noble, and they sacrificed for others. &nbsp;He had seen it all play out too many times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There were highborns, baseborns, young, old, the weak, the strong.... &nbsp;It was all the same. &nbsp;It was an era where one's worth could only be proven only by one's actions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had seen countless people. &nbsp;There were those that had been abominable, and there were those that had been pure. &nbsp;Then there were the unsure people that had been too weak. &nbsp;They were like reeds that shook from the hardships of life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Dragon Demon worshippers...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he woke up in the era, the most shocking part had been the existence of the Dragon Demon king worshippers. &nbsp;It wasn’t the fact that the remnant of the group he had fought still existed in this age. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was shocked at the fact that the Dragon Demon king had become deified as time had passed in this world. &nbsp;This wasn’t just Dragon Demons and Dragon Majins. &nbsp;He couldn’t understand why the ‘humans’ were worshipping him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why do they worship him in this era? &nbsp;It is an evil that had ended a long time ago....’</span></p>
