 <p>Chapter 114 - To the Land of the Demons (5)</p>
 <p><span style>7</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I was awakened after a very long time, so I went out to enjoy a fight. &nbsp;Yet it seems the really interesting news was actually waiting for my return. &nbsp;Is it true that the heir of Aunsaurus betrayed us?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The amused Reygus asked the question. &nbsp;He had died once to become an Undead, but he had not fallen into depression like the other Undeads. &nbsp;Instead of despairing, he remained cheerful. &nbsp;It made one wonder what his personality was like when he was alive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was one of the four Dragon Demon Generals, and there weren’t many figures he admired in this world. &nbsp;The Dragon Demon King’s first wife Aincera was one of the the rare ones to hold his esteem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;How did that come about?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have no idea. &nbsp;In the first place, I could never tell what that child was thinking inside. &nbsp;Maybe, the Aunsaurus tribe is at fault for improperly educating her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Hmm. &nbsp;I shouldn’t bother you by pressing for more details. &nbsp;I’ll ask my subordinate about it.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are unchanged.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I’ll accept that as a compliment. &nbsp;I was resurrected from death, yet I remain unchanged. &nbsp;Isn’t it splendid?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus barked out a laugh. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he was alive, Reygus was very informal with his subordinates. &nbsp;&nbsp;He joined the rank and file to drink alcohol, and in recent days, he enjoyed gossiping and playing around with the servants. &nbsp;In the past, Aincera had been very overt in showing her displeasure with his overall attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, her attitude was completely different now. &nbsp;She had told him he had remained unchanged. &nbsp;However, her voice and expression remained indifferent. &nbsp;She didn’t show any emotions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I think the Queen has changed a lot.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A lot of time has passed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I don’t think that’s the only reason.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is a tribulation I must endure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aincera knew very well what she had lost. &nbsp;However, she didn’t have any emotions left to recoil at her change. &nbsp;Her soul was nothing but a thick husk. &nbsp;She only wanted to achieve her heart’s wish. &nbsp;She prioritized her task above all else...</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;…….&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus just looked at her. &nbsp;He was an Undead, so at a time like this, he was able to hide all emotions. &nbsp;It was an unpleasant sight, but Aincera just accept his scrutiny. &nbsp;She was like an unfeeling doll.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Aincera asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What result were you able to achieve through the fight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Hmm. &nbsp;The fight was very good. &nbsp;It was beyond expectation. &nbsp;As expected, the king’s magic is incredible. &nbsp;I thought it was an absolute travesty when I realized I was an Undead. &nbsp;However, since I’ve woken up, I’m liking this body more and more. &nbsp;It is a bit troubling.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s fortunate. &nbsp;Your existence has already been revealed to the Guardian Shadows, so I’m not going to be conservative in how I use you. &nbsp;I expect your active participation from now on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;If I can run amok, I’ll welcome it. &nbsp;This is why I spurned the courtship of the netherworld to come back here.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ll have plenty of opportunity to do so. &nbsp;Also… &nbsp;Did you find out anything about Carlos?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Unfortunately, I couldn’t force those bastards to speak. &nbsp;We’ll have to wait for the trackers to bring back some useful information.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus had put down a trap for the Keepers of the Prophecy. &nbsp;He had done it to find out more about Carlos. &nbsp;However, Delta and Zeta got in his way until the end, and they didn’t divulge any information.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aincera spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However… &nbsp;I'm skeptical. &nbsp;I don’t think the sinner Carlos is still alive. &nbsp;&nbsp;In all these years, the Great Darkness was never able find his trace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I don’t know if he is alive. &nbsp;However, I’m sure he exists somewhere in the world. &nbsp;In my opinion, the Guardian Shadows are a strong candidate.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are saying he might have become an Undead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Yes. &nbsp;My opinion was reinforced after I met the Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;They were almost a complete product just like me. &nbsp;Moreover…….&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is something bothering you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus stopped speaking for a brief moment as he fell into his thoughts. &nbsp;Aincera queried him. &nbsp;Reygus organized the thoughts floating around inside his head before he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Hmm. &nbsp;It is nothing. &nbsp;I’ll speak to you about it once I get a firmer grip on this idea. &nbsp;Anyways, it is my opinion that the magicians, who are able to pull this off, is uncommon. &nbsp;This is true even if one considered the magicians across the ages.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the moment Reygus was awakened, he just knew Carlos was alive somewhere in this world. &nbsp;Atein’s magic was like a divine revelation, and this truth was delivered to Reygus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When this information was disseminated, the Plains of Darkness was turned upside down. &nbsp;At the same time, they devoted all their efforts into finding any trace left behind by Carlos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I’ll see myself out.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus did a courtly bow, and the gesture did not look right on his bulky body. &nbsp;Afterwards, he left Aincera.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Reygus exited the Queen’s room, Reygus saw an old Dragon Demon with gray horns waiting for him. &nbsp;The old Dragon Demon approached him, and the old Dragon Demon gave back the massive battle hammer to him. &nbsp;Reygus hadn’t been able to take his weapon into the meeting with the Queen, so he had left it behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;The Queen has sacrificed a lot of herself.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We exist now, because of her sacrifice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old Dragon Demon named Chanes had a cold expression on his face. &nbsp;He was Reygus’ lieutenant during the Dragon Demon war. &nbsp;Now he was one of the influential being that ruled over the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;However, when Reygus awoke as an Undead, Chanes insisted on assisting Reygus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Chanes spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I never expected all of this to take this long.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I agree. When I heard that it was 223 years since the king’s death, I thought it was a joke. &nbsp;It took so long to raise an Undead like me. &nbsp;I guess it means the capabilities of this body should be excellent. &nbsp;Still, I’m not sure what to think about all of this.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus had awakened as an Undead in recent days. &nbsp;He was brought back through the magic of the Dragon Demon king, so he was a very special Undead. &nbsp;He was an Undead, yet his memories and his thought process remained crystal clear. &nbsp;He wasn’t swept up by the madness. &nbsp;Even his five senses remained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus was dead, yet it almost felt as if he was still alive. &nbsp;The fact that he was having a difficult time differentiating between the two state was confusing, yet he liked having such a dilemma..</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that he was awake, the Plain of Darkness took it as a sign that the king’s revival was near. &nbsp;It seemed he was tied to the Ritual of Revival that was ongoing in the basement of the Dragon Demon Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chanes spoke..</span></p>
 <p><span style>“By the look of you, I think it was well worth the time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;If one looked only at my battle capabilities, it definitely was worth the time.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>While he was giving his reply, a question popped up inside Reygus’ mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Those bastards were very similar to me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the fact that he had refrained from telling Aincera. &nbsp;The Guardian Shadow’s Undeads felt somehow very similar to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Are those bastards related to the king’s magic? &nbsp;Well, the king was very lax about protecting his magic. &nbsp;There’s a chance that someone might have developed a similar magic using the remnants of spells left behind by him… &nbsp;&nbsp;If not, did Carlos really become involved in their creation?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>After thinking about it for a brief moment, Reygus opened his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You look really old now.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A lot of time has passed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two hundred twenty three years wasn’t a short amount of time even for Dragon Demon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the time of the Dragon Demon wars, Chanes was a young man. &nbsp;Now he was a white haired old man. &nbsp;It really drove home the fact that a lot of time had passed. &nbsp;In truth, Reygus was very surprised that Chanes was still alive. &nbsp;Chanes wasn’t a 1st generation Dragon Demon, yet he had lived well past 400 years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You should be letting the young ones do all the work, while you play around. &nbsp;Why did you come running to me? &nbsp;You should have sent your decent subordinates to me.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve raised several promising ones. &nbsp;I’ll introduce them to you soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;As expected, you probably don’t want to do all the odd jobs at your old age.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t it to be expected? &nbsp;I’ve advanced enough in my station where I’m able to put my nose in the air.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You are still the same. &nbsp;Such a long time had passed, yet you are the same. &nbsp;I like it.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus was elated, so he tried to hum. &nbsp;However, the sound of air leaking out was heard, and a dark energy of the Curse was dispersed. &nbsp;He couldn’t make the sound he wanted to make. Naturally, he tried to click his tongue in dismay, but he didn’t have a tongue. &nbsp;It was impossible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;This body is a masterpiece. &nbsp;It is a masterpiece, yet I have a long way to go before I accept it as my own body. &nbsp;It isn’t a hindrance in battle, but I’m not satisfied with that.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Skeleton cackled as his shoulders shook.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I want to eat meat dripping with blood. &nbsp;I’m sad, because it is a dream that is forever out of my reach. &nbsp;Well, it’s all right. &nbsp;I’m sure there are other edibles that are considered to be delicacies for the Undead. &nbsp;Maybe, I’ll go look for that.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you want something, I’ll help &nbsp;you acquire it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I’m just saying anything that crosses my mind. &nbsp;Hmm. &nbsp;You still haven’t answered my question.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have two reasons. &nbsp;One is an official reason, and the other one is a personal reason.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Tell me the official reason first.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“While you were gone, I’ve advanced enough in my station where I’m now in charge of leading a faction. &nbsp;It isn’t something too impressive. &nbsp;It pales in comparison to your achievements. &nbsp;However, now that everyone is saying the king’s revival is drawing near, I have a chance to secure a foothold with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I’m just a walking corpse now. &nbsp;What benefit will you gain by sticking by me?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t really have anyone else I can curry favor with.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I see. &nbsp;All right. &nbsp;So what is the personal reason?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My life isn’t fun anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Mmm?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I usually hide here with a devious smile on my face. &nbsp;I just plot against the humans, and I find such work to be boring. &nbsp;If I’m with the general, this old man will have a chance to jump into a fight where my blood will boil.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;That is very… &nbsp;You aren’t really acting your age.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now that I think about it, I remember the common criticism against you was the fact that you didn’t act your age….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Ha. &nbsp;Now that you’ve aged a little bit, you are trying to act cheeky towards me. &nbsp;I’m already dead, so who care what my age is? &nbsp;After Balun’s death, no Undead counts their age.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Balun?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Mmm? &nbsp;Ah. &nbsp;I guess kids from these days won’t know about him.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…I’m not of the younger generation, yet I do not know about him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You would have known his name if you’ve lived 400 years longer. &nbsp;This was in the distant past, and the bastard had numerous bouts with the king.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He fought against the king? That is news to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Well, there are countless beings that were killed by the king. &nbsp;Currently, the name Atein is officially entered into the public records as someone against the world. &nbsp;However, at one time, he was considered to be a hero, who had saved the world. These kinds of events happened quite often throughout history.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus went over the past events. &nbsp;Before he was killed, he had lived a very long time. &nbsp;He was basically a walking history book. &nbsp;He was born to no parents, so he was a 1st Generation Dragon Demon. &nbsp;He had transcended mortality to live a very long life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;At that time, I wasn’t serving the king as a Dragon Demon General… &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;I was a companion of the wise, yet whimsical magician named Atein.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chanes’ ears perked up. &nbsp;He was of an age where he told the younger generation about the old stories. &nbsp;However, at that moment, he felt as if he was thrown back to his childhood. &nbsp;He had listened to the stories from the adults with a twinkle in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;The King, Almarick and I got together to carry out this task. &nbsp;Truthfully, I didn’t have a great relationship with Almarick during that time... &nbsp;Hmmm. &nbsp;I’ll skip that part of the story. &nbsp;At the time, we weren’t even acquainted with Aunsaurus and Baldazark yet.. &nbsp;Anyways, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that Balun was the worst foe we’ve ever encountered.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He was that powerful? &nbsp;He must have been one of the 1st Generation Dragon Demon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;No. &nbsp;He was a human. &nbsp;To be precise, he used to be a human.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A human? &nbsp;A human was a threat to the three of you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You sound skeptical. &nbsp;You should keep in mind that we lost to a human in the Dragon Demon War.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is true…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Well, Balun wasn’t a living human being. &nbsp;The king designated him as being ‘The First to Deny Death’. &nbsp;He was also called the ‘Originator of the Black Magicians’.....&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balun was a being, who had lived for a very long time. &nbsp;Countless beings lived on the surface of the world, yet he was the first to deny death. &nbsp;He had raised himself as an Undead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Basically, Undeads didn’t exist before Balun. &nbsp;According to our king’s words, most of the Necromancy skills that exist right now was cultivated by Balun.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My god. &nbsp;Such a being existed in this world?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;He existed. There is a first for everything. &nbsp;Balun was as unique as the first king anointed by the Dragon Demons.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the time, Balun wanted to change the world. &nbsp;He theorized that the pain one received over the course of &nbsp;one’s life happened, because one was alive. &nbsp;This was why he wanted all the beings on this world to transcend life and death… &nbsp;In some aspects, he was a bigger calamity to the world than Atein. &nbsp;However, in the end, Atein and his companions was able to take him down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he finished his story, Reygus suddenly remembered something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Come to think of it, I heard some of our kids were betrayed. &nbsp;What happened?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The surviving members of each tribe devoted their efforts into developing the future generation. &nbsp;This resulted in the current young generation being quite skilled even though they are inexperienced. &nbsp;&nbsp;However, it seemed the mental aspect of their education was deficient..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I don’t want to hear about the boring details.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Would you like to hear about the child who betrayed us first? &nbsp;Or would you like to hear about the children, who were beaten to a pulp?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Tell me about the one that betrayed us. How inhospitable were we to her that a child of that station abandoned everything? &nbsp;Why would she run away?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm. &nbsp;In truth, she wasn’t treated well. &nbsp;This is especially true for the Aunsaurus tribe. &nbsp;They are out of control….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;In what way?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know the full story. &nbsp;This was all gathered through rumors.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chanes was a survivor of the Dragon Demon war, so he was one of the heavyweights that ruled over the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;However, during the Dragon Demon war, he had merely been a lieutenant serving under Reygus. &nbsp;This was why he had less power than the survivors with blood ties to Aunsaurus and Baldazark. &nbsp;This was why he could only rely on information gathered from spies and rumors to discern what was going on in the different factions. &nbsp;The Great Darkness within Aincera united the Plain of Darkness under the same banner, but factions within the Plain of Darkness weren’t unified.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Aunsaurus tribe conducted countless tests and rituals to be able to artificially create a perfect heir. &nbsp;It is rumored that the betrayer Laura Aunsaurus was the product of their efforts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Mmm? They did something that insane?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus was surprised. &nbsp;Regyus was one of the main principles, who helped Atein, light the world on fire through war. &nbsp;However, even he was taken aback by Chanes’ story.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it is true, it was stupid of them. &nbsp;The child was made using their blood. &nbsp;Basically, they put forth a doll made through magic as the heir of Aunsaurus.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Hmmm…….&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus expressed a really complicated, yet subtle feeling. &nbsp;The beings, whom he had fought with against the world, were showing signs of madness. &nbsp;It really hammered home the fact that &nbsp;a lot of years had passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;In regards to that story, I’ll hear the details later. &nbsp;What about the kids, who were beaten up?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a short amount of time, Reygus heard the full story from Chanes. &nbsp;&nbsp;The light within the eye sockets couldn’t hide the surprise and interest he felt.</span></p>
