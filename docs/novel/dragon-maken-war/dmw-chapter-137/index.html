 <p>Chapter 137 - Gathering Legends (3)</p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Laura spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you go mad, because your death is drawing nigh? &nbsp;What the hell are you talking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When I think about the past, I didn’t try to win against all of you guys. &nbsp;I didn’t care if I won or not. &nbsp;If I failed, I wouldn’t have thought much on it. &nbsp;I didn’t have anything worth caring about.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a faraway look in Laura’s eyes. &nbsp;Dikal was confused. &nbsp;He couldn’t tell what Laura was thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A person who didn’t have the desire to live survived as the others, who desperately wanted to live, were eliminated. &nbsp;I know how insulting this sounds. &nbsp;I didn’t realize this until not too long ago.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maybe, the life lived by Laura in the past couldn’t be considered as her living her life. &nbsp;She hadn’t possessed any enthusiasm or desire for anything. &nbsp;She had merely been a puppet that did whatever her creators wanted her to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her life started from the moment she started to follow Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had thought her inner self had been killed, yet her flame had been rekindled. &nbsp;For the first time in her life, she had made her own decision on how she wanted to live. &nbsp;Color returned to her gray world, and she was able to feel new emotions each day. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is why…. &nbsp;&nbsp;I have to win now. &nbsp;I don’t want to win, because I have to win. &nbsp;I want to win, because I want to win. &nbsp;I want to live, so I’ll survive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What nonsense. &nbsp;Do you think tragedy won’t befall you, because your perspective on life has changed? &nbsp;&nbsp;I’ve always had a hard time discerning what you were thinking about, but it seems you aren’t of sound mind. &nbsp;You should die in the grips of your madness. &nbsp;You should become my stepping stone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal surrounded Laura with his cursed swords, and he let out a cruel laugh. &nbsp;If it wasn’t for her, his name wouldn’t have been stolen. &nbsp;A cursed mask wouldn’t have been placed on him, and he wouldn’t have fallen to become part of the disposable troops. &nbsp;He had recovered his original position, so it was time to get the compensation he deserved for the pain he had endured up until now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me be clear about this one thing. &nbsp;You are too arrogant, Dikal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal became angry at Laura’s declaration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Puh-uhng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura’s magic penetrated his defense, and it ignited. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-uhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal’s defense was strong. &nbsp;Moreover, he had gained experience through battle over the years, so she shouldn’t have been able to get the better of him so easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Laura circumvented all of his defense, and she sent a shockwave towards him. &nbsp;Dikal was a bloody mess as he fell towards the ground. &nbsp;He was barely able to regain altitude. &nbsp;Laura turned the table as if the previous fight had been a lie. &nbsp;She let out magic spells in a torrent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-pah-pah-pahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cursed swords were hit with magic almost simultaneously. &nbsp;They were flung away. &nbsp;After he took control of his scattered Dragon Demon magic, he saw something very intricate had gotten better of him. &nbsp;It gave him goosebumps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This… How did you get through my defense…..!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve been stuck in one place for far too long.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura looked at Dikal with sad eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal most definitely possessed a wealth of magic. &nbsp;He had borrowed the power of the magic weapons, and he had finished the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual. &nbsp;His strength wasn’t in doubt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if they were all born inside an artificial womb, they weren’t all Dragon Majins. &nbsp;Even if the Dragon Majins were considered to be the most outstanding candidates, the Aunsaurus family performed a variety of experiments with Dragon Demons and Dragon Majins. &nbsp;They were all made to be candidates for the position of heir.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal had been peerless amongst the Dragon Majins, and in some aspects, he exceeded the Dragon Demons. &nbsp;He was talented enough to compete with Laura until the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this happened a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t have my Dragon weapon, but…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura started canceling Dikal’s defensive magic one by one. &nbsp;Dikal desperately tried to match her feat, but he was no match for her. &nbsp;Everything he had built up was being brought down like a sand castle being toppled over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You came here too soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, Laura was able to break through the silent exchange of magic. &nbsp;Her magic started to manifest one or two at a time. &nbsp;She had taken control of the situation. &nbsp;Lightning exploded, and heat started to boil up to threaten the life of her enemy. &nbsp;On the other side, Dikal’s magic was still being sealed before it could manifest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At a glance, one could tell that there weren’t much difference between the two in terms of how much Dragon Demon magic they possessed. &nbsp;It was true that Laura possessed a little bit more, but Dikal had just finished the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual. &nbsp;Moreover, he had Aunsaurus’ swords. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had unusually high amount of power right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, in terms of skill as a magician, Laura was overwhelmingly superior. &nbsp;It wasn’t just her use of magic. &nbsp;The types of spells she had learned was also at a much higher level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It couldn’t be helped. &nbsp;Even if one possessed a genius level talent, one had to still study magic. &nbsp;It took time to go through the process of researching and training one’s magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Laura became the heir, &nbsp;she continued to improve herself as she took full advantage of all the opportunities she was afforded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If one compared Dikal to her, his access to knowledge was severed when he became disqualified. &nbsp;He had to fight with what he had learned up until that point in time. &nbsp;He was basically a tool with a fixed setting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had assumed he would be able to close the gap by using a good magic weapon. &nbsp;However, he had underestimated Laura too much. &nbsp;Laura had been pushed back until now, because her heart was in turmoil. &nbsp;It wasn’t because she was lacking in skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura had a resolute expression on her face as she made a declaration towards Dikal. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I still have a lot I want to see. &nbsp;After waking up everyday, I yearn for more. &nbsp;That is why I will live. &nbsp;I will not live as the puppet they’ve created. &nbsp;I want to see what is at the end of the road that was chosen by me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Laurahhhhhhhhhhk…..!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal let out a scream. &nbsp;Her surrounding was completely under her control now. &nbsp;The six cursed swords, which was imprinted with blood, was being interfered with Laura’s magic. &nbsp;Their movement was a mess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to say this is the end, but…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura mumbled to herself. &nbsp;At that moment, lightning came at her from all sides.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gwah-gwah-gwahng! &nbsp;Ggwah-gwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Laura was able to escape the storm of lightning without taking any damage. &nbsp;Her gaze left Dikal. &nbsp;She looked towards the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She could feel the numerous resonance of powerful Dragon Demon magic. &nbsp;There were over 30 of them. &nbsp;In terms of the quantity of Dragon Demon magic they possessed, they rivalled the officers on field. &nbsp;They were emitting their killing intent towards Laura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were the Shadow’s Sword Belt, who had come here with Dikal. &nbsp;Dikal ordered them to be on standby, so he could face Laura alone. &nbsp;However, it was a situation where they had to interfere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, something Azell said came to mind in Laura’s thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘</span><span style>Unfortunately, this isn’t a problem with a ready made remedy that’ll make you feel better. &nbsp;There are many problems in this world, and there are some like this one where you can’t do much about it.</span><span style>’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her siblings had been born from the artificial wombs to be tools. &nbsp;At some point, they became worthless to her. &nbsp;She hadn’t been wounded, and she hadn’t felt any pain when they disappeared after their disqualification.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, at this moment…. &nbsp;Her chest hurt when their killing intent was aimed at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…I understand. &nbsp;I have no choice but to end this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura put on a sad smile as she renewed her resolve.</span></p>
 <p><span style>3</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Dikal started his fight with Laura, Kairen and Leticia was once again placed in deep trouble. They focused only on defense, yet they became bloody messes in short order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-uhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen was kicked by Reygus. &nbsp;He was sent flying to the ground. &nbsp;He was barely able break his fall, but he faltered to his knees.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huhk, huhk, huh-uhk…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The battlefield was filled with the sound of battle, yet he was feeling drowsy. &nbsp;He was injured, and his stamina was running out. &nbsp;It was evidence that his concentration was faltering. &nbsp;The fight with Reygus hadn’t been long, but it was too brutal for his body and mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the same for Leticia. &nbsp;She looked as she was out of strength too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Ah ah. &nbsp;This really makes me think about the past.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus spoke in front of them. &nbsp;The two of them had shown their floor now. &nbsp;If it wanted to, it could end them at any moment. &nbsp;However, it wasn’t taking its time, because it was arrogant. &nbsp;It was for a sentimental reasons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Humans and other races acted foolishly in battle. &nbsp;While they were killing each other, they sought to look cool. &nbsp;They sought out romanticism. &nbsp;Reygus wasn't an exception either. &nbsp;He had come back from death, so he savored the sensation of fighting against outstanding foes. &nbsp;The fact that the fight had ended made him feel very wistful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koohk…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen grinded his teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had taken too much damage when he was taken unawares in the beginning. &nbsp;If it wasn’t for that, he would have lasted a little bit longer.....</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia spoke with a venomous voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are acting like an old man. &nbsp;You’ve already died once, yet you aren’t pressed for time. &nbsp;Didn’t you learn in your past life that being so confident will actually shorten your lifespan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Are you trying to insult me in an attempt to kill you faster?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus tilted its head in puzzlement. &nbsp;Leticia snickered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess I can’t help it If it sounds like that to you. &nbsp;It has been awhile since I’ve experienced being the weaker one in a fight…. &nbsp;As expected, it isn’t a good feeling. &nbsp;I’ve always known your organization was powerful as a whole, but I’ve never faced an individual that was this strong. &nbsp;It is something I haven’t experienced in a long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus was puzzled as he looked at her. &nbsp;Was she giving herself up to despair, because her back was up against the wall? &nbsp;However, the attitude she displayed while sweeping back her bangs indicated that this wasn’t the case.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, it is a bit early to bask in your victory, legendary Dragon Demon general.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Do you have some hidden technique you’ve held back? &nbsp;If so, you should hurry up and show it to me. &nbsp;I’m crazy in the fact that I like seeking out danger.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are an idiot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;My comrades often expressed such sentiments to me. &nbsp;However, wouldn’t it be a waste not to see everything a strong foe has to offer? &nbsp;This is what makes my life worthwhile.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Comrades… Yes, that is what I’m putting my trust in. &nbsp;It is a bit awkward, since I don’t have much experience in doing so…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Mmm?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It happened when Reygus was trying to make sense of her words. &nbsp;The ground beneath it disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;What the hell?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ground beneath its feet was acting weird. &nbsp;The ground cratered inward. &nbsp;Reygus’ body was being sucked below.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sometimes, magicians softened the ground in front of a charging enemy in order to trap them, but this was different from such low-grade technique. &nbsp;Reygus didn’t feel anything before the ground beneath its feet disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Reygus understood what was happening, a white bolt of lightning rose up from the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gwah-roo-roong! &nbsp;Gwah-gwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Shit! &nbsp;This is Aunsaurus’ trick!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus was able to defend against it by a hair’s breadth as it jumped into the air. &nbsp;The thunderbolt followed after him. &nbsp;Reygus aimed the head of the hammer towards an opening in the attack. &nbsp;The thunderbolt exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwahhhhhh……!</span></p>
 <p><span style>From behind it, a young man with swirling red hair made his appearance. &nbsp;It was Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Ho-oh!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus was sent flying from the ambush attack, but its voice was filled with extreme happiness. &nbsp;The red haired young man was holding a sword that was rippling with a blue sheen. &nbsp;Thunder erupted from his entire body. &nbsp;He looked exactly like someone Reygus knew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It is as I suspected. &nbsp;It really is you!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It couldn’t hold back its laughter. &nbsp;It shouted as it laughed out loud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Azell! &nbsp;You really are alive!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then a weird silence descended on the battlefield.</span></p>
