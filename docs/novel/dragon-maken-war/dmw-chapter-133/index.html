 <p>Chapter 133 - Fallen Demon (3)</p>
 <p><span style>4</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back to the present.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The air was cold. &nbsp;At least, this 200 year old ruin had good ventilation. &nbsp;They had no trouble breathing. &nbsp;However, the cold air that was emitted from the Undead in front of them was making the temperature of the room drop slightly. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell thought about the old stories as he looked at the Undead claiming to be the Demon King Balserk. &nbsp;He asked it a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you really are Balserk, I have couple questions I want to ask you….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You can ask me anything. &nbsp;I exist here to answer your questions.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That really sounds like something a Demon would say.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;No, I don’t mean it like that. &nbsp;It is as I’ve said. &nbsp;I am here to answer your questions. &nbsp;I was placed here for that exact purpose. &nbsp;To be precise, it was....arranged to be this way.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was surprised. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balserk tapped its finger on its head as it spoke. &nbsp;Its fingers were all bones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It was made so that I couldn’t renew myself anymore. &nbsp;I was imprisoned here with my knowledge intact, so I could pass it onto a suitable person. &nbsp;&nbsp;You can ask me anything. &nbsp;If I can answer it, I will. &nbsp;Everything about me ceased to move forward around 300 years ago, so I can’t give you any fresh information.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell furrowed his brows. &nbsp;Was this something arranged by Carlos? &nbsp;However, the facts didn’t add up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The foremost problem is when it was imprisoned. &nbsp;What is going on?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guide had revealed the second gift, and it was something clearly left behind by Carlos. &nbsp;However, this one seemed to have no connection with Carlos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell hid his confusion as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You claim to be a Demon. &nbsp;So how am I supposed to trust your words?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You seem to know much about the Demon race, yet you speak such words? &nbsp;Demons can’t lie.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, they subtlety bend the truth to lead others down the path of destruction. &nbsp;First, I have a hard time believing you are a Demon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Why?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Demons are existences with no real body. &nbsp;So how can one become an Undead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;That is a pertinent question. &nbsp;Before I became like this, I thought it was impossible too. &nbsp;Since </span></p>
 <p><span style>you already know a little bit about me and the Demon race… &nbsp;Weren’t you a bit suspicious about the story that was being told about my demise?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you talking about how a Demon without a corporeal form was killed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;That’s right.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My friend had a theory that even the Demon King’s demise was part of its plan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Ho-oh. &nbsp;That is an interesting story. &nbsp;Could you go into further details?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Basically, Balserk was an existence that someone summoned in an attempt to make the world realize the existence of the Demon Race, and the danger they posed….that was his interpretation. &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it sounds like a crazy plan, but we are talking about a being, who upended the world. &nbsp;So the crazy seems likely.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Ha ha ha. &nbsp;So the disappearance of the Demon King was intentional? &nbsp;It’s a fun conspiracy theory. &nbsp;Unfortunately, he was wrong. &nbsp;There was someone superior to me roaming this world, and I was caught by him. &nbsp;He imprisoned me. &nbsp;He had knowledge that the Demon race didn’t know about, and he had the ability to use that knowledge. &nbsp;I was put in a living human being. &nbsp;I was able to to feel pain and the depth of despair that can only be felt by the living….&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who was it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I’m not in a position where I can tell you that. &nbsp;I want to tell you, but unfortunately, I’m prohibited from telling you. &nbsp;I really hope you realize that I am sincere. &nbsp;Usually, Demons like to speak and preen. &nbsp;I’m not sure if I can call myself a Demon anymore… &nbsp;Ah. &nbsp;Ah. &nbsp;The fact that I’m able to speak to someone is a good thing. &nbsp;This is fun, and it makes me happy. &nbsp;I want to do anything for you, who makes me feel this happy. &nbsp;Is this perhaps….&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balserk spoke after he went over its thoughts for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Is it love?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…probably not.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;However, if we go by the definition of love, I think the emotion I’m feeling is love.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If that is true, it is unfortunate. &nbsp;I cannot reciprocate your love.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell furrowed his brows. &nbsp;A Demon King, who left his name in history, was talking such nonsense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, he could understand why it was happy. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t a false assertion when it said that it was happy just to have a conversation with him. &nbsp;It’s mental wave was flowing out unfiltered, and it confirmed the veracity of the Balserk’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;That is sad to hear. &nbsp;Well, it is said that first love is never realized. &nbsp;All right. Let us continue to exchange questions and answers.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it is as you’ve said, the person that put you in this predicament probably had a grudge against you. &nbsp;That kind of person left something behind for me…. &nbsp;&nbsp;How can I trust such a person?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;A grudge? &nbsp;He might have had one. &nbsp;Please believe me. &nbsp;That is my only request. &nbsp;I’ll tell you everything. &nbsp;I have to fulfill my duty.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you gain from doing so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Death.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I can’t do anything anymore. &nbsp;I can’t get out of here. I cannot die, and I can’t even go mad. &nbsp;This place is my own personal hell. &nbsp;I just want to be released from it. I can achieve that goal by fulfilling the task I was given. &nbsp;Shall we do an experiment? &nbsp;Get me to tell a lie.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you really the Demon King Balserk?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Nope. &nbsp;Everything I’ve said before is a lie. &nbsp;In truth, I’m…..&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, the light in Balserk’s eyes disappeared. &nbsp;Azell stepped back in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the hell is this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time as Azell mumbled to himself, all the bones making up Balserk’s body fell to the floor. &nbsp;Yuren was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There were no warning… &nbsp;The magical energy forming the Undead just disappeared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Undead was already dead, and a foul technique was used to tie the soul down to the body. &nbsp;Basically, if the magical energy that was maintaining the spell disappeared, the soul could no longer remain in this plane of existence. &nbsp;Basically, the nucleus of the Undead would be gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, something strange was going on here. &nbsp;The fact that one was able to become an Undead meant one had a soul that possessed a strong will or a lot of resentment. &nbsp;It would linger around for awhile upon its destruction like a ghost…. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it had been snuffed out like a candle?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Doo-roo-rook…….</span></p>
 <p><span style>It happened at that moment. &nbsp;Within the shock and silence… &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fallen bones started to move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as time was being rewound. &nbsp;The bones, which had fallen in a disorderly manner, rose into the air. &nbsp;They reassembled to form the skeleton of a human. After the process ended, the phantom fire started to burn with the skull, and the uneasy magical energy forming the Undead started to emit an ominous magical wave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Hah…….&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>A tormented sound came out of the skeleton’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I would have preferred death to that. &nbsp;The time…. &nbsp;Uh? &nbsp;How much time has passed?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balserk asked with a trembling voice. &nbsp;It was as if it couldn’t think straight, because of the fear it was feeling. &nbsp;Everyone was confused by this fact. &nbsp;Azell answered the question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It wasn’t even a minute..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Only… &nbsp;It was only about… &nbsp;I was sent into the emptiness, and you guys only….&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balserk hugged its body with both arms. &nbsp;It looked as if it was feeling cold, but the cold didn’t affect the Undead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It took awhile before it calmed down. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Balserk spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;…if I break one of the rules set by that bastard, I would suffer that fate. &nbsp;I cannot lie at all. If I do, I’m shut in an emptiness where I cannot perceive anything. &nbsp;Even my senses doesn’t exist at all. &nbsp;I even start to doubt if my thoughts exist. &nbsp;You don’t know how awful it is…..&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What will you say if I said you are putting up a pretty good acting performance?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Then…….&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>At Azell’s cold question, Balserk answered with a trembling voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It’ll be unfortunate. &nbsp;That means anything I say won’t be believed. &nbsp;I don’t care if you believe me or not. &nbsp;I would have to beg for you to just hear me out.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It’s words were plaintive. &nbsp;It had revealed itself to be a Demon King, who once caused massive chaos in the world. &nbsp;Now it was in a situation where it was begging them to just listen to its words. &nbsp;It didn’t even care if its words were taken as the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Azell’s eyes were cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If its words were to be believe, it had suffered a very cruel fate. &nbsp;Death through torture seemed like a kinder fate. &nbsp;It was a through violation of its soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, he decided to think further on it. &nbsp;How much chaos and destruction was caused by the Demon King Balserk?</span></p>
 <p><span style>What is this was done by someone, who had a unfathomable hatred for the Demon King? &nbsp;If so, would this be considered excessive?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It isn’t up for me to decide that…..’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell stopped thinking about it as he spoke to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. &nbsp;You are the Demon King Balserk, and you have words you have to deliver to me. &nbsp;I’ll believe you for now. &nbsp;I’ll just how useful your information is after I hear it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Thank you very much.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>There wasn’t a single drop of sarcasm in his words. &nbsp;The other party members excluding Azell looked at each other in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let me ask you this first. &nbsp;Someone imprisoned you, and someone wanted you to give me a message. &nbsp;Are they the same person?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren’s eyes became wide. &nbsp;Azell was able to identify and ask the question that was at the heart of the confusion. &nbsp;Balserk gave an answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;No.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As I’ve expected. &nbsp;Then are you able to tell me the identity of the person, who arranged all of this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I also cannot speak about him.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm. &nbsp;So both of them didn’t want their identity known? &nbsp;Yet they wanted some important truth to be know…. &nbsp;Is the knowledge you possess something that can be known to anyone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;That’s right. &nbsp;Let’s put aside the discussion for now as to whether it is useful or not. &nbsp;This isn’t a secret that can't be disseminated. &nbsp;However, most Demons do not know about this knowledge, so it is high in scarcity value.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see. &nbsp;&nbsp;It makes me more curious as to who’s playing this mischief on me…. &nbsp;Ah, I have one more question regarding him. &nbsp;Was the person, who arranged all of this, a human magician?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;That’s right. &nbsp;Yes, he was at a caliber where it was hard to believe he was a human magician.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s expression turned serious. &nbsp;It was a useful clue in figuring out, who the guid was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. &nbsp;Then...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell thought for a brief moment before he asked the question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did he want you to tell me? ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Balserk’s existence was found out to be arranged by the guide, Azell knew the truth that would be told to him was set from the beginning. &nbsp;If he couldn’t ask for the guide’s identity, he was just going to ask only for the pertinent information.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren was surprised, so he joined the conversation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh. &nbsp;Wait a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If one read between the lines of what it said, wouldn’t it be released after telling you the message?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t it so, Balserk?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I believe so.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Balserk answered in the affirmative, Yuren was put in a sticky situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s ask that question later. &nbsp;I have couple things I want to ask it. &nbsp;If Demon King Balserk was so amazing, he must have been a big figure within the Demon race. &nbsp;Even if it is knowledge 300 years out of date, it probably possesses knowledge that’s worth a lot….. &nbsp;&nbsp;It might be the break we need to increase our power in groundbreaking fashion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm. &nbsp;I can see why you feel that way as a magician.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shouldn’t it be the same for you? The knowledge of the Demon race isn’t only useful to magicians…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are right, but I don’t want to risk my life on a baseless information given to us by some unknown being. &nbsp;I can see why this Demon is attractive to magicians. &nbsp;It presents itself as a Demon that won’t lead others down the path of destruction.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell took a glance, and it seemed Laura was showing some interest too. &nbsp;She didn’t reveal her feelings through her expression, but there was a light in her eyes as if she was itching to ask it a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. &nbsp;Let me express my apology to your first, Balserk. &nbsp;It seems your liberation will have to be pushed to a later time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It doesn’t matter to me. &nbsp;The fact that I’m able to converse with someone brings me great joy. &nbsp;I’ll think of it as entertainment before this lowly being meets its end. &nbsp;Even this is too go for me.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell retreated, so Yuren and Laura could converse with Balserk. &nbsp;He sat in a corner as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We should meditate. &nbsp;I’m pretty sure this will be long and boring. &nbsp;Since there’s no time restriction, this might go on for several days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At those words, Kairen and Leticia let out a groan. &nbsp;As expected, when the two high ranked magician started to converse with Balserk, their words sounded like alien words to the two swordsman. &nbsp;Laura, who was normally quiet, was asking various questions with a twinkle in her eyes. &nbsp;They could already tell the waiting period would be long and tortuous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the wait was unexpectedly short.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-roo-roong……!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only an hour had passed when an explosion from the surface shook the ruin.</span></p>
