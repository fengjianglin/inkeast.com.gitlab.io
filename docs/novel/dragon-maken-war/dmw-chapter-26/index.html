  <p><span style><span style>Chapter 26 - The 220 year gap (4)</span></span></p>
  <p></p>
  <hr>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes. Especially the Magician’s Association and the Medical Association will buy it at an expensive price. I heard from the princess that you put your life on the line to distract the dragon, so she could escape?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It somehow worked out that way.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Everyone is talking about that story. There are a lot of people who want to hear your tale of heroism.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hahaha.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell laughed awkwardly. Truthfully, he did more than just distract the dragon. He had killed it, but he couldn’t say that. He had decided it wasn’t time to reveal everything about himself.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Also, I’m too weak to boast about killing a dragon.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Dragon Maken, which he was able to use through an arrangement made by Carlos, was the main reason why he was able to defeat the Earth dragon. If he didn’t have the Dragon Maken then he would have been eaten after losing.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Azell had earned a lot of things through the fight.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The magical energy from the Dragon Maken had flowed into his energy pulse, and while it remained there, he was able to absorb it through meditation. Then he was able to take a part of the dragon’s strength through the Dragon Slayer’s ritual.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This in turn made Azell’s body more powerful. A seed of strength that could never be earned through training was planted in Azell’s body.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Also, his magical energy had greatly increased. His energy pulse became sturdier, and he had completed dual banding his first Ring of Life. Also, his second Ring of Life was nearly finished.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The fact that he was able to construct the dual banding into reality was a huge accomplishment.</span></p>
  <p><span style>From theory to tests, he had gathered enough evidence that said it would succeed, but he had no idea if it would actually work. He succeeded in constructing an analogous model using animal experimentation, but when using the magical energy on himself, he didn’t know what variables might pop up.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, he had deployed it in practice, and he had now confirmed the theory through the advantages he learned while building the structure.(TLN: structure of the ring)</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘What would have happened if the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual didn’t happen?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>His magical energy had steeply increased because he had taken the dragon’s power, and the dual band was formed from it. This was his lucky break, but it also left much to be desired.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He had skipped the trial and error process, and he was drunk off the fruit of success.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He knew he should count his blessing and stop complaining. However, in Azell’s perspective, he couldn’t help but feel a sense of frustration.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I was able to gather Dragon Demon magic to that degree….’</span></p>
  <p><span style>When he took the dragon’s power, Azell’s magical energy slightly took on the properties of Dragon Demon magic. Unlike regular magic, it was able to alter the present surrounding just by emitting it… (TLN:I’m guessing you can make direct changes to the world with Dragon Demon magic)</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was the basis for making the Dragon Maken. However, he still had to travel a long road before he was able to make the Dragon Maken again.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Princess declared that you have the right to receive a certain portion of the compensation from the dragon’s corpse. ”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ho-oh.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Princess wanted to tell you directly about the compensation, so you could look forward to that.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m looking forward to it.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell didn’t really mean what he said.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Also, I heard that you are following the princess back to the capital as an escort.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It somehow worked out that way.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I guess we’ll spend a good amount of time together. I was also assigned to the troops escorting her.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ah, I guess so.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ve lost a lot of subordinates, so I’m not too happy being reassigned to this mission.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell watched Giles smiling bitterly, so he kept his mouth shut.</span></p>
  <p><span style>When the Dragon’s Shadow attacked the ruin excavation site, Gile’s unit suffered a major loss. He was able to recover a lot of them, but around 1/3 of his unit was killed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“However, it is better to be inserted into a military force where I am needed rather than becoming an experienced rookie commander with nothing to do. Let’s get along.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Western Border guard wasn’t able to transfer many troops into Arrieta’s escort. Therefore, they decided to reassign people like Giles, whose competence was guaranteed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell replied.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Please take care of me.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Soon, they arrived at the location of the dragon’s corpse.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, the sight was much different than what Azell had expected. The dragon’s corpse wasn’t transported here intact. It was cut and distributed into couple dozen barrels.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I guess they couldn’t just move the whole thing.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>It would be possible if they used a large cart used to transport large scale of goods. However, one need a well maintained road for it to be a workable solution. If they wanted to bring a dragon’s corpse, which was fallen in the middle of a forest, then they had no choice but to hack it into pieces.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Soon, Azell spotted Arietta within the crowd.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ve come at your summons.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmm. You came.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I had no idea a dragon’s corpse could be turned into money.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>In Azell’s time, magicians used various parts of a dragon’s corpse. If the dragon’s blood was processed then one could make magic recovery potion or wound medication. The bones, scales and leather was so tough that it was used as ingredients for weapons or armor.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, he never thought that it could be exchanged for money.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I had know idea either. This is the first time I’ve seen a dead dragon. The scouting party’s magician saw it and he advised us to collect it with haste. We followed his direction, so he brought it here after dismembering it… However, there is one thing that is bothering me.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The dragon’s eyes are missing.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The eyes?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Both disappeared as if it had been scooped out. Do you have any theory as to why someone would do this?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmmm. I have no idea.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell shook his head from side to side.</span></p>
  <p><span style>When he defeated the Earth dragon, he hadn’t damage the eyes. However, the eyes had disappeared as if it had been scooped out….</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta lowered her voice and spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Those bastards might have done it.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The probability is high.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The bastards they were talking about were, of course, the Dragon’s Shadow. A magician would have known the value of a dragon’s corpse. It wasn’t strange that someone had avoided the eyes of the Western Border guards to only dig out the dragon’s eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ve heard the dragon eyes are sources of powerful magical energy. This is unfortunate.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Well, we can do nothing about it. We are fortunate that they weren’t able to get their hands on the heart.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I guess so. I heard the heart was entirely ripped apart….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It’s possible since it had fought against another dragon.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Is that so?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta smiled at Azell, who was obviously lying. It was a smile of an accomplice that shared the same secret.</span></p>
  <p><span style>6</span></p>
  <p><span style>Regina was a follower who had a relatively high position in the secret organization called the ‘Dragon’s Shadow. However, she couldn’t be compare to the member that was considered to be the back bone of the organization.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I see. You failed.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The woman who spoke held a high position that couldn’t even be compared to Regina.</span></p>
  <p><span style>She had long black hair and dark brown eyes. She looked to be in her late 20s and she was a cold beauty.</span></p>
  <p><span style>She didn’t look like a Dragon Demon. She looked like a pure human, but Regina knew she had changed her original appearance through magic.</span></p>
  <p><span style>She spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You lost a lot of your comrades.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m sorry.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You don’t really look like you are sorry. For a mere job of kidnapping the Dragon Demon Princess, you mobilized that much manpower yet you failed. Do you have any excuse? There probably won’t be a better opportunity to kidnap her.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>When she thought of the powerful Dragon Demon princess Arietta, she thought it was ridiculous to use the expression ‘mere’.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, the manpower she had rounded up would have been enough to finish the job. There were 4 Dragon Demon and two high level human mages. It was true that Arrieta was powerful, but if one assessed her power, three of the members deployed could have overpowered her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Nevertheless, Regina had failed. However, she had an excuse.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“There was an unexpected disrupter.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Regina gave a detailed report about Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>At first, the black haired lady listened apathetically, but her complexion turned serious mid-report when Regina mentioned a certain event.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Wait. Did you just say Dragon Slayer’s ritual?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes? Yes, I did.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Did that man really say it was the Dragon Slayer’s ritual?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m sure of it.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Can you guarantee it with your life on the line?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>A cold energy assaulted her senses. Her murderous intent made one hard to breath. Regina spoke, while she gulped.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“This isn’t something we can dismiss.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The black haired lady mumbled seriously. Regina carefully asked a question.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“May I ask what this Dragon Slayer’s ritual is?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You may not.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It is a level of information you aren’t allowed to know. First, carefully tell me what you had seen and heard. ”</span></p>
  <p><span style>At those words, Regina carefully told her the rest of the story.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell had requested the Dragon Slayer’s ritual, and the Earth dragon had accepted. Then they started to fight.</span></p>
  <p><span style>When she went back afterwards, the Earth dragon had already died.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The Western Border guards were mobilized, so I was only able to bring this.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Regina brought out two red globes, and it was as big as a small child’s body.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was the dragon eyes. As Arrieta had guessed, Regina had dug the dragon eyes out, while she avoided detection from the Western Border guards.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The black haired lady held it up in her hands. Then the two dragon eyes started floating into the air.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“There was a person who knew about the Dragon Slayer’s ritual, and he also killed a dragon….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I have no idea if that man killed it. It is true that he possessed frightening skills, but it is hard to see him being able to fight one-on-one against a dragon. Moreover, if one considers the storm that occurred there, I think another dragon intruded…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That is impossible.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Regina gave a logical deduction, but the black haired lady flatly denied it. She spoke while she carefully observed the dragon eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“There is no way such an event would have occurred if the Dragon Slayer’s ritual was being held. Moreover, the proof is in the dragon eyes.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes? How….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“There isn’t even twenty percent of original magical energy left inside the eyes.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The eyes of a dragon was a powerful source of magical energy. After the heart, it had the most magical energy within a dragon’s body.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Azell had stolen the essence of power from the dead Earth dragon through the Dragon Slayer’s ritual. Therefore, most of the power a dragon’s eyes usually held was mostly gone.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Since Regina had never killed a dragon, she wasn’t aware of this fact. She just assumed the dragon eyes held powerful magical energy. However, the black haired lady immediately saw through to the truth. She spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You should use this.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes? But…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It is your reward.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Regina became confused at those words. She had failed in her mission and she had lost valuable manpower. She had thought she would be punished. To minimize it, she had told the lady about Azell and she also gave her the dragon eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Instead, she received a reward?</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, the black haired lady didn’t elaborate any further.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hoo hoo. Azell Zestringer.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>For those who worship the Dragon Demon King, it was an unbearably ill-omened name. When they ran across anyone with the name Azell, they killed them all no matter if they were young or old.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It is a name with a lot of sin. This is interesting. I’ll have to see him at least once.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The black haired lady wore a cold smile and she started walking into the darkness.</span></p>

 <p><span style>Azell laughed awkwardly. Truthfully, he did more than just distract the dragon. He had killed it, but he couldn’t say that. He had decided it wasn’t time to reveal everything about himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Also, I’m too weak to boast about killing a dragon.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Maken, which he was able to use through an arrangement made by Carlos, was the main reason why he was able to defeat the Earth dragon. If he didn’t have the Dragon Maken then he would have been eaten after losing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Azell had earned a lot of things through the fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The magical energy from the Dragon Maken had flowed into his energy pulse, and while it remained there, he was able to absorb it through meditation. Then he was able to take a part of the dragon’s strength through the Dragon Slayer’s ritual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This in turn made Azell’s body more powerful. A seed of strength that could never be earned through training was planted in Azell’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Also, his magical energy had greatly increased. His energy pulse became sturdier, and he had completed dual banding his first Ring of Life. Also, his second Ring of Life was nearly finished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that he was able to construct the dual banding into reality was a huge accomplishment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From theory to tests, he had gathered enough evidence that said it would succeed, but he had no idea if it would actually work. He succeeded in constructing an analogous model using animal experimentation, but when using the magical energy on himself, he didn’t know what variables might pop up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he had deployed it in practice, and he had now confirmed the theory through the advantages he learned while building the structure.(TLN: structure of the ring)</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What would have happened if the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual didn’t happen?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>His magical energy had steeply increased because he had taken the dragon’s power, and the dual band was formed from it. This was his lucky break, but it also left much to be desired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had skipped the trial and error process, and he was drunk off the fruit of success.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew he should count his blessing and stop complaining. However, in Azell’s perspective, he couldn’t help but feel a sense of frustration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I was able to gather Dragon Demon magic to that degree….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he took the dragon’s power, Azell’s magical energy slightly took on the properties of Dragon Demon magic. Unlike regular magic, it was able to alter the present surrounding just by emitting it… (TLN:I’m guessing you can make direct changes to the world with Dragon Demon magic)</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the basis for making the Dragon Maken. However, he still had to travel a long road before he was able to make the Dragon Maken again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Princess declared that you have the right to receive a certain portion of the compensation from the dragon’s corpse. ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ho-oh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Princess wanted to tell you directly about the compensation, so you could look forward to that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m looking forward to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell didn’t really mean what he said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Also, I heard that you are following the princess back to the capital as an escort.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It somehow worked out that way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess we’ll spend a good amount of time together. I was also assigned to the troops escorting her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, I guess so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve lost a lot of subordinates, so I’m not too happy being reassigned to this mission.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell watched Giles smiling bitterly, so he kept his mouth shut.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the Dragon’s Shadow attacked the ruin excavation site, Gile’s unit suffered a major loss. He was able to recover a lot of them, but around 1/3 of his unit was killed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, it is better to be inserted into a military force where I am needed rather than becoming an experienced rookie commander with nothing to do. Let’s get along.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Western Border guard wasn’t able to transfer many troops into Arrieta’s escort. Therefore, they decided to reassign people like Giles, whose competence was guaranteed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please take care of me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, they arrived at the location of the dragon’s corpse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the sight was much different than what Azell had expected. The dragon’s corpse wasn’t transported here intact. It was cut and distributed into couple dozen barrels.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I guess they couldn’t just move the whole thing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would be possible if they used a large cart used to transport large scale of goods. However, one need a well maintained road for it to be a workable solution. If they wanted to bring a dragon’s corpse, which was fallen in the middle of a forest, then they had no choice but to hack it into pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, Azell spotted Arietta within the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve come at your summons.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm. You came.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I had no idea a dragon’s corpse could be turned into money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Azell’s time, magicians used various parts of a dragon’s corpse. If the dragon’s blood was processed then one could make magic recovery potion or wound medication. The bones, scales and leather was so tough that it was used as ingredients for weapons or armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he never thought that it could be exchanged for money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I had know idea either. This is the first time I’ve seen a dead dragon. The scouting party’s magician saw it and he advised us to collect it with haste. We followed his direction, so he brought it here after dismembering it… However, there is one thing that is bothering me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The dragon’s eyes are missing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The eyes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Both disappeared as if it had been scooped out. Do you have any theory as to why someone would do this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm. I have no idea.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell shook his head from side to side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he defeated the Earth dragon, he hadn’t damage the eyes. However, the eyes had disappeared as if it had been scooped out….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta lowered her voice and spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Those bastards might have done it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The probability is high.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bastards they were talking about were, of course, the Dragon’s Shadow. A magician would have known the value of a dragon’s corpse. It wasn’t strange that someone had avoided the eyes of the Western Border guards to only dig out the dragon’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve heard the dragon eyes are sources of powerful magical energy. This is unfortunate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, we can do nothing about it. We are fortunate that they weren’t able to get their hands on the heart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess so. I heard the heart was entirely ripped apart….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s possible since it had fought against another dragon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta smiled at Azell, who was obviously lying. It was a smile of an accomplice that shared the same secret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>6</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regina was a follower who had a relatively high position in the secret organization called the ‘Dragon’s Shadow. However, she couldn’t be compare to the member that was considered to be the back bone of the organization.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see. You failed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman who spoke held a high position that couldn’t even be compared to Regina.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had long black hair and dark brown eyes. She looked to be in her late 20s and she was a cold beauty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t look like a Dragon Demon. She looked like a pure human, but Regina knew she had changed her original appearance through magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You lost a lot of your comrades.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t really look like you are sorry. For a mere job of kidnapping the Dragon Demon Princess, you mobilized that much manpower yet you failed. Do you have any excuse? There probably won’t be a better opportunity to kidnap her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she thought of the powerful Dragon Demon princess Arietta, she thought it was ridiculous to use the expression ‘mere’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the manpower she had rounded up would have been enough to finish the job. There were 4 Dragon Demon and two high level human mages. It was true that Arrieta was powerful, but if one assessed her power, three of the members deployed could have overpowered her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nevertheless, Regina had failed. However, she had an excuse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There was an unexpected disrupter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regina gave a detailed report about Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At first, the black haired lady listened apathetically, but her complexion turned serious mid-report when Regina mentioned a certain event.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait. Did you just say Dragon Slayer’s ritual?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes? Yes, I did.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did that man really say it was the Dragon Slayer’s ritual?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sure of it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you guarantee it with your life on the line?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A cold energy assaulted her senses. Her murderous intent made one hard to breath. Regina spoke, while she gulped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This isn’t something we can dismiss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black haired lady mumbled seriously. Regina carefully asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“May I ask what this Dragon Slayer’s ritual is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You may not.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is a level of information you aren’t allowed to know. First, carefully tell me what you had seen and heard. ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At those words, Regina carefully told her the rest of the story.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had requested the Dragon Slayer’s ritual, and the Earth dragon had accepted. Then they started to fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she went back afterwards, the Earth dragon had already died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Western Border guards were mobilized, so I was only able to bring this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regina brought out two red globes, and it was as big as a small child’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the dragon eyes. As Arrieta had guessed, Regina had dug the dragon eyes out, while she avoided detection from the Western Border guards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black haired lady held it up in her hands. Then the two dragon eyes started floating into the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There was a person who knew about the Dragon Slayer’s ritual, and he also killed a dragon….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have no idea if that man killed it. It is true that he possessed frightening skills, but it is hard to see him being able to fight one-on-one against a dragon. Moreover, if one considers the storm that occurred there, I think another dragon intruded…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is impossible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regina gave a logical deduction, but the black haired lady flatly denied it. She spoke while she carefully observed the dragon eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is no way such an event would have occurred if the Dragon Slayer’s ritual was being held. Moreover, the proof is in the dragon eyes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes? How….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There isn’t even twenty percent of original magical energy left inside the eyes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eyes of a dragon was a powerful source of magical energy. After the heart, it had the most magical energy within a dragon’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Azell had stolen the essence of power from the dead Earth dragon through the Dragon Slayer’s ritual. Therefore, most of the power a dragon’s eyes usually held was mostly gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Regina had never killed a dragon, she wasn’t aware of this fact. She just assumed the dragon eyes held powerful magical energy. However, the black haired lady immediately saw through to the truth. She spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should use this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes? But…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is your reward.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regina became confused at those words. She had failed in her mission and she had lost valuable manpower. She had thought she would be punished. To minimize it, she had told the lady about Azell and she also gave her the dragon eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instead, she received a reward?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the black haired lady didn’t elaborate any further.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoo hoo. Azell Zestringer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For those who worship the Dragon Demon King, it was an unbearably ill-omened name. When they ran across anyone with the name Azell, they killed them all no matter if they were young or old.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is a name with a lot of sin. This is interesting. I’ll have to see him at least once.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black haired lady wore a cold smile and she started walking into the darkness.</span></p>
