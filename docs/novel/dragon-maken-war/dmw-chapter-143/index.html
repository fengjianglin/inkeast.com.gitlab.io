 <p>Chapter 143 - Second Coming of a Legend (6)</p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Your techniques have improved. &nbsp;This is true even if I discount the very odd function developed by the Sky Splitter. &nbsp;I should have stuck around a little bit longer to see how far you were able to develop.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoo-ooh. &nbsp;I was able to regain my breath thanks to your speech, so I shouldn’t be saying this…. &nbsp;&nbsp;You always get too absorbed in the fight. &nbsp;You forget your goals. &nbsp;Doesn’t your side hate this part about you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Ha ha ha. &nbsp;I’ve always been a bit manly. &nbsp;A man should always act manly. &nbsp;Of course, such actions buys hate from the narrow-minded beings. &nbsp;However, how can I live in a manly way if I try to appease them?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…you do realize I’m disparaging you by calling you an idiot right now, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I don’t care if I hear such words or not. &nbsp;This world doesn’t hold much interests to me. &nbsp;My life doesn’t hold much that interests for me either. &nbsp;I can’t even enjoy the best alcohols any more. &nbsp;What is there left to enjoy in my life? &nbsp;If they are small minded enough to try to restrict the activities that brings joy to my soul, I’d rather they leave our side.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was impressed. &nbsp;This guy was more of an idiot than he had imagined. &nbsp;It wasn’t as if Reygus didn’t know it was doing something idiotic. &nbsp;It knew it was doing something stupid, yet it went through with his actions. &nbsp;Reygus did whatever it felt like doing!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…ah. &nbsp;Truthfully, you did annoy me, but in a weird way, I didn't hate you. &nbsp;That is how dumb you were.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Koo-uh. &nbsp;This is quite unfortunate. &nbsp;If you were a beautiful woman, I would have accepted that as a confession. &nbsp;How can I not enoy myself fully when someone like you is in front of me. I, Reygus, live and fight as a warrior. &nbsp;I don’t want to leave any regret behind!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You died, because you ignored what was going on in your surrounding yet you haven’t changed. &nbsp;Amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;The fact that I didn’t change is a good thing. &nbsp;Humans think change as a virtue. &nbsp;There is a beauty to something that never changes, and humans can’t stand that. &nbsp;I fought next to the king for this very value.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus spoke in an imposing manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His words made it clear that this being was a completely disqualified from being a general. &nbsp;Reygus also knew this truth. &nbsp;It had the title of Dragon Demon general, but Reygus always let its underlings command the battle. &nbsp;It fought on its own. &nbsp;It did whatever it wanted, yet Reygus was an indispensable part of the Dragon Demon king’s army.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many strategists from the Demon King army spoke about it lament.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If general Reygus fixed his personality a little bit, he would be the best!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many in the human allied forces had the same thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘We are quite fortunate that Reygus has such a personality.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus was unchanging even at the end. &nbsp;That was why he had died. &nbsp;It was also why Reygus could laugh without any regret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had woken up as an Undead after 220 years, yet it hadn’t changed..</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Azell asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You haven’t changed, but everything around you have changed. &nbsp;Do you really think the bastards in the Plain of Darkness is worth fighting with?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Hmmm. &nbsp;Are you trying to sow discord? &nbsp;Knock it off. &nbsp;It isn’t like you to do this.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not doing that. &nbsp;I’m simply curious. &nbsp;When I awoke in this era, I was shocked to find the existence of the Dragon Demon king worshippers. &nbsp;Moreover, I was shocked in many ways to see what kind of actions were carried out by the bastards within the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;During the Dragon Demon war, I hated you guys, but how should I say this…. &nbsp;It feels as if things have progress to the extreme.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You words…. &nbsp;&nbsp;So you haven't been active while I was asleep. &nbsp;It means your consciousness was put to sleep for a long time. &nbsp;You awoke in this era like me?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Ee-yah. &nbsp;I gained information through my enemy making an a slip of the tongue. &nbsp;This is quite a novel experience.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ughh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s expression crumpled. &nbsp;Of all the people he could have made a slip of the tongue to, he had made the mistake against the being that was the prime example of someone that gave away information to the enemy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus laughed uproariously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Yes. &nbsp;In truth, I don’t like what our guys are doing these days. &nbsp;They lack a backbone and guts. &nbsp;Above all else, they are quite gloomy!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…mmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus was an Undead with only its skeleton left. &nbsp;From within the darkness, it spoke such dismal words that would have undermined the morale of his allies. &nbsp;If the Demon King worshippers could here this, wouldn’t they feel aggrieved?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus continued to speak as Azell had these thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;They completely changed into a religious cult, so I do feel bad for the young ones. &nbsp;They should be able to see and think for themselves. &nbsp;Even the option of choosing with their heart had been stolen away. &nbsp;I hate to see pretty ladies feeling depressed when such dark madness are imposed on them. &nbsp;If it was the past, I would have consoled them with my fabulous body, but I can’t any more. &nbsp;It is a shame in many ways.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Still, my heart remains unchanged. &nbsp;I sympathize with whatever orders given by the magician Atein. &nbsp;He is my king, and that fact remains true even now.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected, it seems Atein’s revival isn’t too far off. &nbsp;Your awakening is a precursor to that event.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;We are even with this… Or did I reveal something that is worth more? Tsk tsk. &nbsp;Well, I don’t care, since I’m always like this.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really are incorrigible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Ha ha ha. &nbsp;Since I've given you this much time, you should have recovered your breathe by now. &nbsp;Why don’t you reveal some of your hidden cards now? &nbsp;I really regret the fact that I wasn’t able to fight you when you defeated the true king. &nbsp;I paid an incredible price to become this strong….. &nbsp;I can no longer eat meat again, and my flag downstairs will never be raised again...&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the great Azell was at a loss for words.&nbsp; He should want to trip Reygus up, yet he was having a hard time putting himself in the mood to do so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Even I had ended the fight when you were weakened, wouldn’t it have been a waste? &nbsp;Since I did something very stupid, a smart guy like you should bring out a move that would turn the table on me. &nbsp;It’ll be delicious when I volley your move and crush you!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will show my respect towards the stupidity that had endured for over 200 years. &nbsp;I’ll do as you wish. &nbsp;It is as you’ve said, you wasted enough time for me to be able to use my secret card.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he spoke, Azell’s voice started erupting with power. &nbsp;As he walked, it looked as if there was an image superimposed over Azell. &nbsp;He took one step as his image shook. &nbsp;&nbsp;When he took a second step, an exact replica of himself appeared next to him. &nbsp;Both figures took a third step as the superimposed images shook. &nbsp;When they took the fourth step, the number of Azells doubled once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a flash, 32 Azells were surrounding Reygus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You Incarnation skill have gotten much better. &nbsp;Even Almarick couldn’t do what you are doing right now.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Almarick… &nbsp;He looked like an idiot, but he really was great with techniques. &nbsp;He’s the opposite of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s voice rang from all direction. &nbsp;They didn’t open their mouths at the same time, yet the words were strung together perfectly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;However, this can’t be everything, right? &nbsp;I acknowledge that you are able to amplify your power by combining your sword and your clones. However, it won’t work against me. &nbsp;Moreover, you are running out of magical energy.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus’ observation was sharp and right on target.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was given time to gather his breathe, but his magical energy was constantly on the decline. &nbsp;He kept using power that overflowed from his vessel, and this was the backlash of constantly using that method. &nbsp;Even if he was exceptional in skill and will, there was nothing he could do about his physical limitations. &nbsp;The limit to using his Dragon weapon was fast approaching.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 32 Azells let out a savage laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, this isn’t all of it. &nbsp;Well, Reygus! &nbsp;I’ll do as you wish! &nbsp;I’ll show you the true worth of the Sky Splitter, which was able to cut down Atein!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Majin had replicated alongside the 32 Azells, and they roared at once. &nbsp;The swords abandoned their physical form, and they resolved into something that looked like flame and thunder at the same time. &nbsp;The pure white light moved through the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Mmm!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus was faster and stronger compared to when it was alive. &nbsp;However, it was impossible to dodge the Sky Splitter. &nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how fast its reaction speed had increased, it was impossible for Reygus to see the Sky Splitter which had dematerialized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only thing Reygus could do was to create a broad barrier and endure the attacks. &nbsp;When opponents faced the dematerialized Sky Splitter, they gave up on pin-point defense. &nbsp;It wasted a lot of power, but one had no choice but to use a broad defense. &nbsp;Reygus was no exception. &nbsp;No, such a tactic was actually Reygus’ specialty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the current situation was a bit different from before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His reaction speed had increased significantly, so Reygus was able to see a world that he had never been able to see before. &nbsp;He could now clearly discern the path of most Instantaneous movements. &nbsp;He had entered the world of ultrahigh speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the reason why Azell was on the losing end as he attacked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s attacks weren’t weak. &nbsp;Even if Reygus style had reached the pinnacle of tanking attacks, it couldn’t avoid having its movements restricted. &nbsp;It couldn’t avoid taking damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Reygus was able to defend in a more efficient manner, and it cut into the effectivenss of Azell’s attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Up until now, all his enemies had given up defending the dematerialized Sky Splitter with accuracy. &nbsp;However, Reygus was able to do so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Left chest.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This didn’t mean it could counteract every attack. &nbsp;The attacks from the dematerialized Dragon Majin was too numerous. &nbsp;It was hard to tell which attacks held power behind it and which attacks were feints.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Reygus was able to identify some of the attacks. &nbsp;It couldn’t pick up the attacks that were coming in at speed of light. &nbsp;However, there were times when Azell’s clone had to transform back into physical form. &nbsp;When it caught sight of them, it was able to read the path of the attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Right knee.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A human who hadn’t learned Spirit Order couldn’t dodge an arrowing using one’s eyes. &nbsp;However, it was possible to observe the archer’s movement to predict the timing and path of the arrow. &nbsp;It would allow one to dodge the attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus was using the the same concept right now. &nbsp;Countless attacks were coming towards it, yet Reygus was able to pick out certain attacks. &nbsp;It allowed Reygus to properly defend against several blows. &nbsp;Every time it was successful in its defense, it cut through the shower of light attacking it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’ll be the same again!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The attacks performed by Azell’s 32 forms were like a real storm. However, they couldn’t breakthrough Reygus!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was at that moment when he had a thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Reygus, do you know why my Dragon Majin is called the ‘Sky Splitter’?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of Azell’s clone locked weapons with Reygus as he whispered those words. &nbsp;When it put strength into the hands gripping the Soul Hammer, the resistance disappeared. &nbsp;From beyond the clone, Reygus saw a sight it had never seen before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;This is……!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sky parted. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t as if the sky was cloudy. &nbsp;It was a clear sunny day. &nbsp;However, an oppressive amount of light pierced through the sky. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if an enormous tree made out of light that sprouted. &nbsp;A pillar of light connected the earth and the sky. &nbsp;Moreover, there were numerous branches made out of light extending outwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if someone had magnified an image at the moment when thunderbolt hit the ground. &nbsp;The branches of light extended in all directions. &nbsp;In the middle of the light, Azell was glaring down at Reygus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;This is your secret card!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus voice couldn’t hide the overflowing joy it was feeling. &nbsp;It gripped its Soul Hammer as it cocked it backwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There wasn't a single iota of fear in Reygus. &nbsp;It was like facing a comet when it was coming straight towards the beach. &nbsp;In the face of certain calamity, Reygus’ fighting spirit was unyielding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It’s burning! &nbsp;Koo-hahaha! &nbsp;Soul Hammer! &nbsp;Make the earth tremble!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-goo-goo-goo-gooo!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The earth shook as Reygus stood at the epicenter. &nbsp;Clouds of dust rose into the air. &nbsp;From deep within the earth, an enormous power arose as it was focused within the Soul Hammer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus’ presence was becoming more and more larger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a brief moment, they exchanged gazes. &nbsp;Azell didn’t wait for it to reach its peak power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’ll end it with this!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Reygus had surmised. &nbsp;Azell’s magical energy was in decline. &nbsp;The time limit in which he could summon the Dragon weapon was approaching. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could last longer using a complete Dragon weapon in the Vitan’s Chalice. &nbsp;However, he decided to use the final attack with the Sky Splitter. &nbsp;The time he could bring out the Dragon Majin had increased considerably when he increased his magical energy and the vessel that held his power. &nbsp;However, there was a limit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why this was his last chance. &nbsp;He was fortunate that Reygus was obssessed with the process of a battle instead of winning and losing. &nbsp;This was why he was given the chance to bring up all his remaining power. &nbsp;He was able to use his best secret technique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sun Lightsaber!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the pillar of light connecting sky and earth dispersed into countless swords.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hundreds, thousands, hundred thousands, millions…. &nbsp;It was impossible to count them all. &nbsp;The overwhelming number of light swords flew through the air. &nbsp;There was so many swords that it looked as if they combined to make a tidal wave. &nbsp;It swallowed everything in sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;This is it……!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment Reygus regretted the fact that it didn’t have a heart. &nbsp;It couldn't feel its heart beat faster at watching this splendid sight! &nbsp;Its body was dead, but its soul had pursued this exact moment for a thousand year. &nbsp;At the crescendo of the attack, its soul hunger for more as it burned!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It really was an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The enormous pillar of light had been like the world tree that connected the sky to the earth. &nbsp;When the numerous light swords erupted forth, an unforgettable image was seared into the mind of all who was watching. &nbsp;The tsunami of light hit its target and it created a large vortex.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seared the eyes as the song of destruction rang out. &nbsp;The sound of this transcendent calamity could overpower even a Dragon’s Roar. &nbsp;Just the aftereffect of the attack burned the vision of the spectators, and the mental waves moved like rapid currents to burn their minds.</span></p>
