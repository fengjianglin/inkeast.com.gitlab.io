 <p>Chapter 103 - The Sword that Split the Heavens (6)</p>
 <p><span style>He hadn’t realized he had suffered a mental attack up until a moment ago. &nbsp;He hardened his mental barrier in response, and he put a very skillful lock over this barrier. &nbsp;When he felt the movement of his body slacken a little bit, he continuously changed his mental defensive pattern to protect his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However… &nbsp;Azell started to slowly deceive his sense again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In all he did, Duran's reaction was incrementally getting slower. &nbsp;His eyes took in the sight. &nbsp;The information was processed, and he tried to decide on how to respond... &nbsp;Still, he still found that he was slightly slower than he ought to be, and Duran was at a disadvantage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Where is he attacking me from?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was sure his mind was being attacked from some angle. &nbsp;He had thought he had blocked every avenue that could be used to attack his mind, so how was Azell doing this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke as Duran was gripped in his confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected, there are techniques that I don't know about. &nbsp;You used a technique that uses reflexive response, which doesn't require the control of the conscious mind. &nbsp;This technique didn't exist in the Dragon Demon war. &nbsp;Since it isn't a forgotten secret technique, I'm guessing it was developed afterwards?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles and Boar had also used simiar techniques. The movement was independent from the order given by one's mind. &nbsp;The reflexive responses were engraved into the body, and it could be used to reach the state of Detachment. &nbsp;One would be able to reach peak efficiency in one's movements.... &nbsp;Azell didn't know any technique that dealt with such concepts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are superb. &nbsp;You remind me of a Spirit Order practitioner I met a long time ago. &nbsp;However, you haven't completely mastered the meaning behind the concept of 'seeing'.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-ahk!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was unbelievable, but Duran's side was split open as blood fountained forth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a flash, Duran realized his sight had been narrowed to the extreme. &nbsp;It wasn't just his sight. &nbsp;All of his senses were hyper-focused on Azell, who was in front of him. This had created a blind spot in his senses. &nbsp;Normally, he wouldn't allow such a thing to happen. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>When his vision suddenly dimmed to a pin prick, he came to an understanding. It hadn't just been his sight. &nbsp;All his senses had been focused on the Azell in front of him. &nbsp;This act had created a blindspot in his senses that would have never existed in normal times. &nbsp;When his weak point was revealed, Azell's clone had appeared next to Duran, and it had stabbed him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell retracted his clone. &nbsp;He spoke as he walked past the falling Duran.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You only focused on the opponent in front of you. &nbsp;This is the reason behind your death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…seeing. I see. Vision… No, you manipulated me into paying attention only to you...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran was on his knees. &nbsp;His mumbled words sounded like a groan. &nbsp;He was also a high rank Spirit Order practitioner. &nbsp;Azell had given him a small hint, yet he was able to figure out why he had lost. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When a person only focuses on a target in front of oneself, one’s field of vision became narrowed. &nbsp;Even a person, who normally looks at his surrounding, would become preoccupied by a sword coming towards one's body from the front. &nbsp;If one frantically blocked the incoming sword strikes, one would have no idea what was going on in the back or the side of oneself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had used this characteristic to his advantage. &nbsp;He used the fact that they were looking into each other's eyes, and he mixed in illusions to cause minor errors in how Duran perceived his movements.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He used this tactic to fluster Duran, and at the same time, he ate away at Duran’s sense using his mental wave. &nbsp;He made it so that Duran became solely focused in blocking his attack. &nbsp;When he confirmed there was a big blind spot formed in Duran’s senses, Azell used his clone to deliver a critical blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This man is a monster. I can't do anything...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran shuddered when he realized the gulf between Azell and himself. &nbsp;However, he couldn't just fall like this. &nbsp;Even if it was a hopeless situation, he had to get up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No way. &nbsp;I cannot fall here... &nbsp;Miss... &nbsp;My mistress...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His wound was too deep. &nbsp;The sword had cut through his bones, and it had even punctured his heart. &nbsp;He had no answer for this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, there had been a curse like power within Azell's sword. &nbsp;It made a mess of the flow of his magical energy within his body. &nbsp;He couldn't even use Spirit Order to stem his bleeding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Saibein-nim. &nbsp;I was incapable of... Your daughter... I wasn't able to protect here. I'm sorr....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran crumpled before he could finish his words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>8</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis was lying on the floor, and she couldn’t even move the tips of her fingers. &nbsp;She had suffered too serious of an injury. &nbsp;Even if she focused on healing, she wouldn’t be healed enough to re-enter the battle. While she was in such a state, their situation was getting worse by the minute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Duran.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Duran died, Niberis knew it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had been a human saved by her father, Saibein. &nbsp;He had repeatedly distinguished himself in battle, and Duran had risen to a rank where all the Dragon Demons respected him. &nbsp;In truth, he wasn’t someone she could order around as if he was an underling beneath her. &nbsp;However, he insisted on acting like a subordinate, because he wanted to repay the favor shown to him by Saibein. &nbsp;He tried his best to help her in any way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since she was born to a noble bloodline, she had grown up with everything at her beck and call. &nbsp;She took his devotion for granted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, at times, he had an attitude of monitoring her as if she was a child playing near water. &nbsp;She had been annoyed by his mothering, and she considered him to be bothersome.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, her heart was hurting right now. &nbsp;This was the first time she had experienced something like this since she became an adult. &nbsp;This was the first time she had shed tears for losing someone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Don't be sorry. &nbsp;There is no reason why you should feel sorry.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the first time in her life, she hated her own incompetence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn't as if this was the first time she found her abilities to be deficient. &nbsp;In the past, her pride had taken a big hit when she failed her mission thanks to Azell. &nbsp;She became self-aware that her abilities were lacking, so she had dedicated to re-training herself. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it hadn't been enough. &nbsp;She had lost again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was her past self, her pride would have gotten hurt again, and she would have lashed out in anger. &nbsp;However, she hated her own deficiency so much that she couldn’t stand herself. &nbsp;It was the reality that she hadn't been able to do anything when someone devoted to her had lost his life... &nbsp;It hurt more than her impending death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Guardian Shadows… Even they are here...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Azell was sweeping through his enemies like a gale, the Guardian Shadows appeared as they used the Dragon Sword Duke as a marker they could trace. &nbsp;The Dragon Demon king worshippers were already in poor shape, yet they had lost the numerical advantage. &nbsp;They were now being trampled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…Niberis.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even in such a situation where she couldn’t do anything, there was a voice murmuring towards her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kieren Baldazark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was the heir to the great Dragon Demon General Baldazark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was the most talented of his generation to be produced from the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;He was a competitor, who threatened her standing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… &nbsp;At the very least, you must...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She knew why he struggled to speak even as his voice was filled with pain. &nbsp;She even saw him shedding tears for her. &nbsp;She also knew why he hadn't hesitated in using his body to shield her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If she could speak, she wanted to say these words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Duke Baldazark. &nbsp;You were always a crier.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>After her coming of age ceremony, Niberis treated Kieren with a cold heart. &nbsp;The elders tried to trigger her competitive spirit, so they had always compared her to Kieren. It chafed her so much that she couldn't bear it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she always knew what emotion was in his eyes as he looked at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was so open about it, so how could she not know?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, the relationship between the two had been completely different before they went through their coming of age ceremonies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Don't cry. &nbsp;You look like an idiot. You are the descendent of the great Baldazark. You've inherited such noble blood, yet your actions will besmirch your rank.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, he was considered to be an outstanding individual, but when he was young, he had been a weak crybaby. Unlike Niberis, Kieren had a lot of siblings vying for the honor of being Baldazark's heir. &nbsp;Even if he had been a crybaby, Kieren had been very talented, so his siblings subjected him to all kinds of torment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whenever he cried, Niberis gave a stern scolding, and she was able to correct his mindset. &nbsp;When they were in their childhood, the two of them researched magic, and they always talked about their future. &nbsp;They grew close to each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Kieren. &nbsp;I’ve never truly hated you, not even once.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their positions required them to be antagonistic towards each other. &nbsp;However, after establishing themselves as heirs, she had thought the two of them might have a future together. &nbsp;However, the elder were gripped by the fear of the world, and they were overtaken by the fanaticism towards the Dragon Demon King. &nbsp;The elders damaged the progress of their relationship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Niberis.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis suddenly heard another voice. &nbsp;At the same time, she felt a spike of anger and irritation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Laura.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura had suddenly appeared from nowhere to become her competitor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike Kieren, Niberis had never met Laura during childhood. &nbsp;After several years after her coming of age ceremony, Laura had suddenly appeared out of nowhere. &nbsp;She had appeared when her predecessor fell by the hands of the Guardian Shadows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them had never gotten along.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that they were competitors wasn’t the only reason. &nbsp;Of course, she was annoyed by the appearance of another competitor, but she was also annoyed by the fact that she didn’t know what Laura was thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis felt bad when she looked into her eyes. &nbsp;It was as if Laura was able to ignore all feelings, and it felt as if Laura’s eyes didn’t attach any value to Niberis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please don't die. &nbsp;I don't like you...no, I don't like all of you, but... &nbsp;Still, if you die, I'll feel bad for Duke Baldazark.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis became angry. &nbsp;Even now, Laura was making her feel annoyed. &nbsp;Could Laura not hold herself back from annoying her even in such a situation?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, unlike her words, what Laura did next was beyond imagination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>9</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura had never liked Niberis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In truth, this wasn't only limited to Niberis. &nbsp;She disliked Kieren, Jeffers, and the Plain of Darkness... &nbsp;She hated everything around her. &nbsp;She detested the beings, who had given birth to her. &nbsp;She detested her upbringing, and she hated that she had become Aunsaurus' heir.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she only knew this way of life. &nbsp;She was a Dragon Demon king worshipper, and her role as the heir of Aunsaurus solely defined who she was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first memory Laura could recall was around the time when she looked like a 4 year old human child. &nbsp;She opened her eyes in a large glass tube filled with special liquid made by the alchemists.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had been completely ignorant of her own self until she was pulled out of glass tbe. &nbsp;She had no idea what was going on as she looked at her surrounding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You are number 47. &nbsp;You should remember that. Well, there is no way you’ll forget it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she came out of the glass tube, she didn't have a name. &nbsp;At the time, she had exactly 139 siblings, and they were all called by their numbers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For reference, there were only 139 other beings that were labeled. &nbsp;When she first came out, she saw 10 of her siblings not receive any numbers, and they were sent away to never to be seen again. &nbsp;At the time, she hadn't known what had happened to them, but now she knew. They had failed to meet some requirement, so they were scrapped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You were all born with the blood of the great Aunsaurus within you. &nbsp;However, only one of you will inherit his name.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of her siblings were intelligent, and they had talent in magic. &nbsp;It had only been 1 year since they came out of the the glass tubes, yet they had already learned how to speak and write. &nbsp;When they learned the basic knowledge, they started learning magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, a high amount of danger followed anyone, who studied magic. &nbsp;They only had one year to learn the magic in peace. &nbsp;Afterwards, they were ordered to face monsters, and they were told to summon evil spirits using magic.... &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>They faced dangerous situations daily where it hadn’t been surprising to see her sibliings die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During this process, the number of siblings she had dropped steadily. &nbsp;Moreover, a variety of methods were used to measure their abilities and potential. &nbsp;If one failed several times at a task, one would be labeled a failed product. &nbsp;These beings were branded before they disappeared to an unknown location.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After 10 years, half of their original number remained. &nbsp;At that point, all her sibling including herself was able to receive a name instead of a number.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Laura Aunsaurus.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the day she was given her first name, Laura was swept up by an indescribable feeling. &nbsp;From the time she came out of the glass tube, she had always been called by a number. &nbsp;As her intelligence and wisdom increased, she realized how demeaning this practice was. &nbsp;This was why she always dreamed of the day when she received her name. &nbsp;She would be accepted as a legitimate and unique individual. </span></p>
 <p><span style>On the day she received her name, Laura repeated her name several hundred times. &nbsp;It was the most she had spoken in a single day since her birth.</span></p>
