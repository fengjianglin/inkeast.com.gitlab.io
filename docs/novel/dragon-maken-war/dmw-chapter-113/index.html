 <p>Chapter 113 - To the Land of the Demons (4)</p>
 <p><span style>5</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one could comprehend Azell's actions. &nbsp;However, Azell didn't explain himself. &nbsp;The only one, who could question Azell’s choices, was Kairen. &nbsp;However, he decided not to ask Azell anything. &nbsp;Many parts of Azell was a mystery to Kairen, but it seemed he had decided to just observe Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So… Where do you plan on going next?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Azell came to the County of Karzark, he never spoke about his future plans. &nbsp;His head had been filled with the idea of reaching this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm not sure. &nbsp;I might…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell did have a plan in mind. &nbsp;After he woke up in this era, he always thought about what he should do. &nbsp;Two hundred twenty years had passed, and he wanted to find a survivor. &nbsp;He wanted someone, who he could talk to about the old days. He didn't want to find such a being , because he wanted to fill the emptiness caused by his longing. &nbsp;There must be someone out there that could fill in the blank that had been caused by his sleep. &nbsp;Moreover, he needed allies, who were like himself. He needed beings, who would fight alongside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, the only survivors he confirmed were his enemies. &nbsp;He even checked with Kairen. &nbsp;No one, who went through the Dragon Demon war, was still alive on his side. &nbsp;He even read official accounts that confirmed the deaths of all the Dragon Demons from that time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their deaths couldn’t be solely blamed on time. &nbsp;The Dragon Demon King worshippers might have made sure that they didn’t survive. &nbsp;Anyways, Azell only had one hope he could cling to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm going to the Albatan Forest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm? &nbsp;Perhaps… &nbsp;Are you talking about the land of the demons on the east of the continent?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen asked in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Land of Demons Albatan Forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was before the fracture of the Nadick Empire. &nbsp;This storied land of the Demons rebuffed any attempt of human invasion. &nbsp;Numerous Dragons took residence in this land a long time ago, and even at the height of the Nadick Empire, they didn’t dare to make this place their territory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell nodded her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you going to such a faraway location? &nbsp;Moreover, the only information known about that place is the fact that it is dangerous and the place is full of Dragons….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm going to go meet a Dragon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen’s eyebrows rose. &nbsp;It wasn’t just him. &nbsp;Everyone looked as if they couldn’t understand Azell’s decision. &nbsp;Laura asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you plan on doing the Dragon Slayer’s ritual, you don’t have to go there. &nbsp;There are plenty of Dragons elsewhere.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That isn’t it. &nbsp;Actually, I might as well do the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual, since I’m visiting there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…you might as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura was dumbfounded. &nbsp;Even in the Plain of Darkness, the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual was only performed by those accomplished in terms of skills and achievements within the organization. &nbsp;It was an honorable tribulation where one had to put one’s life on the line. &nbsp;She knew Azell challenged and won in the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual. &nbsp;However, she never expected him to speak so lightly of the ritual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell asked her a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How much does the Plain of Darkness know about the Albatan Forest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We don’t have a lot of information about that place. &nbsp;We know there are Dragons there, and there’s a group there, who worship the Dragons.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are those who worships the Dragons? &nbsp;What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The one to pose the questions was Kairen. &nbsp;Laura answered him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We don’t know anything definite. &nbsp;&nbsp;However, they were very strong, so we couldn’t be rash in acting against them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you are basically saying there is another organization aside from the Dragon Demon King worshippers and Guardian Shadows that resides in the shadow of the world? &nbsp;Aren’t there also other secret societies and groups of Black Magicians that aren’t affiliated with you guys?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are a lot of them. &nbsp;However, we do use some of them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was astute enough to pick out what Laura had omitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this how you guys are able to operate without revealing yourselves as Dragon Demon King worshippers? &nbsp;Or are you guys trying to take advantage of the fact that Guardian Shadows don’t intervene unless the Dragon Demon King Worshippers involves themselves?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. Moreover… It is an attempt to obfuscate the eyes of the humans.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon king worshippers would have to be eradicated even in human society. &nbsp;The deep wounds had been created in the Dragon Demon war, and while 200 years had passed, the wounds hadn’t healed yet. &nbsp;This was also why the Dragon Demon king worshippers had worked hard to hide their existence even when there weren’t in any danger from the Guardian Shadows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean by you are going to meet a Dragon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen was having a trouble comprehend what was going on. &nbsp;Azell was speaking as if he was going to go see an acquaintance. &nbsp;However, the only reason Azell had to seek out a Dragon was to conduct a Dragon Slayer’s Ritual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You already know why Dragons conducts the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If the Dragon wins, it can gain wisdom from the humans.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the past, a lot of humans and Dragon Majins conducted the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual. &nbsp;There were people like me, who were able to take the power of the Dragons, to become much stronger. &nbsp;However, there were also losers, who had to give up their wisdom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you trying to say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What if… &nbsp;On this world, what if there were Dragons, who were able to win numerous Dragon Slayer’s Ritual? &nbsp;What would have happened to those Dragons, who achieved their ultimate wish?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…the Dragon’s wish is to gain wisdom. &nbsp;Are you saying a wise Dragon resides in the Albatan Forest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen asked the question, and his expression indicated that he was having hard time believing the story.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell grinned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The ruler of the Albatan Forest is the only Dragon I know, who had freed itself from the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual. &nbsp;This particular Dragon had gained the wisdom it had wanted, so it has no reason to carry out the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The name of the Dragon known by Azell was Albatan. &nbsp;It was a Dragon, who had freed itself from its own fate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>6</span></p>
 <p><span style>After leaving the County of Karzark, they immediately headed east. &nbsp;Kairen grumbled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We left one land of the Demons to go to another land of the Demons. &nbsp;I feel like an explorer, who seeks out land of the Demons.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Events somehow turned out like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you perhaps going to another land of the Demons after the Albatan Forest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They do sound like attractive destinations to visit. &nbsp;I’ll take it into consideration. The continent is large and there are a lot of land of demons.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They bantered with each other as the party started moving at an astonishing speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they were trying to find a suitable place for a lunchbreak, Laura asked a question. &nbsp;She sounded fed up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you guys always travel at this speed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Before you guys joined us, we traveled much faster.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The party had been traveling for four hours, and they were traveling in a straight line at 60 km/h. &nbsp;It didn’t matter what the terrain was like. &nbsp;They were traveling at a surprising speed, but while they were coming to the County of Karzark, Azell and Kairen had traveled at 300 km/h. &nbsp;Basically, they were travelling at a very leisurely speed right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren looked as if he couldn’t believe that statement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…you traveled faster than this? &nbsp;That sounds preposterous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren was a magician, so he was able to use Flight magic. &nbsp;He wasn’t affected too much by the terrain. &nbsp;It wasn’t as if the terrain had no effect on him. &nbsp;If one flew higher, one needed more skill, and the magical energy was consumed at a faster rate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had bee flying over mountains, lakes, forests and plains for the past four hours. &nbsp;They were traveling in a straight line to their destination at 60 km/h. &nbsp;It was pushing Yuren to his limit. &nbsp;His magical reserve was being squeezed dry, and it made him wonder if he was better off running on the ground. &nbsp;He was so tired that he didn’t think he could travel any more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, they were actually travelling at a slow pace?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke in a nonchalant manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are just matching your speed. &nbsp;Do you realize how far the Albatan Forest is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…are you perhaps thinking about running all the way towards the Albatan Forest? &nbsp;You are going to run from the midwest of the continent to the eastern portion of the continent?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What other method is there? &nbsp;If you are suggesting we ride horses, it is a nonstarter. &nbsp;Horses are too slow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you can’t even keep up with this pace, we can go our separate ways. &nbsp;I’ll just drag Laura along.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura was having a much easier time keeping up with them compared to Yuren. &nbsp;Azell still had a shunt in her energy pulse, but he allowed her to use her magical energy. &nbsp;He could monitor her in real time, so he could seal her magical energy at any time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura spoke when she heard Kairen’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve seen files that said the Dragon Sword Duke transcends common sense… &nbsp;You are amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does the Plain of Darkness really view me like that? &nbsp;What else do they say about me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are know as someone, who hasn’t learned the forgotten secret techniques. &nbsp;However, you were known as someone with abundant power, so if possible, we were instructed to avoid you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he met Azell, Kairen hadn’t been able to learn any secret techniques. &nbsp;However, he was someone that was still feared by the Dragon Demon King worshippers. &nbsp;He may be a blank slate in terms of skills learned, but he had developed his powerful Dragon Demon magic to the extremes. &nbsp;Moreover, he had been able to make the Dragon Sword through his own research. &nbsp;&nbsp;He was able to reach a frightening level by combining his technical sense of manipulating the Dragon Demon magic and his fearsome battle capabilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen grinned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see. &nbsp;It is an old assessment of me, but I’ll take it as a compliment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After meeting Azell, Kairen now knew secret techniques. &nbsp;His overall fighting power was much higher than before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Azell remarked in admiration at how fast Kairen was able to learn techniques. &nbsp;He had been a master for over 100 years, but he was able to absorb Azell’s teaching as if he was a &nbsp;young man in his growth phase. &nbsp;He was growing at a very rapid pace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Our agents couldn’t track you, so we thought you had some kind of high speed transportation device. &nbsp;However, you were moving in such a primitive way….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Guardian Shadows were a big mystery to those in the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;Therefore, whenever they didn’t understand something about the Guardian Shadows, they assumed that the Guardian Shadows were using some special method. &nbsp;When it looked as if Kairen was using some kind of abnormal travel ability to move around the continent, they were suspicious as to whether the Guardian Shadows had a mode of transportation similar to the ‘Road of Emptiness’. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen asked in puzzlement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…Road of Emptiness?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is a legacy left behind the king.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura described the Road of Emptiness.&nbsp; Kairen was astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are able to jump space to get to various locations on the continent. &nbsp;Such ridiculous magical device exists? &nbsp;So this the reason why you guys are so elusive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it nearby?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell, who had been listening silently, suddenly intruded into the conversation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura tilted her head in puzzlement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll have to look at a map. &nbsp;Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll have to modify our course. &nbsp;While we are heading towards the Albatan Forest, we’ll attack as many waystations connected to the ‘Road of Emptiness.’”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At those words, Laura’s eyes turned round. &nbsp;She never expected him to attack these locations as soon as he heard about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It would be pointless in eliminating all the troops guarding the Road of Emptiness. &nbsp;It can’t be used by outsiders.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is unfortunate. &nbsp;However, I think it’ll be worth it to just destroy it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should refrain from doing so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren butted in. &nbsp;When Azell looked at him, he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Road of Emptiness is a legacy that is controlled through the Great Darkness residing with Queen Aincera. &nbsp;The mere act of approaching it would alert Aincera of your existence. &nbsp;This is the reason why Leticia and I never attacked the few waystations we were aware of.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell furrowed his brows. &nbsp;If it is as Yuren described, he had to weigh the benefit of suppressing the enemy’s transcendent mobility against exposing his location to his enemies. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, which would be more beneficial?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to think this through.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The threat level of the Road of Emptiness was too high to leave it alone. &nbsp;The fact that they could exchange information in real-time was a overwhelming advantage. &nbsp;Moreover, it also allowed the transport of people… &nbsp;This device did not exist in the era of the Dragon Demon war.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Mmm? Wait a moment.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It meant Atein had finished creating this legacy before he died. &nbsp;So why hadn’t he used this in the Dragon Demon war?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he asked about this point, Laura answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Only a limited number of people can travel through it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Road of Emptiness had limited fixed destinations it can travel to, and it was impossible to move a large number of troops through it. &nbsp;This was why they formed attack organizations across the continent. &nbsp;The officers were the only ones that would be able to use the Road of Emptiness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell accepted the explanation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see. &nbsp;I’m glad there are such limitations to the device. &nbsp;It wasn’t probably known during the Dragon Demon war, but they probably used it to transport small amount of troops.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What should we do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At Kairen’s question, Azell thought about it for a bit before he made a decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll give up on my idea. &nbsp;If we could use it, it’ll be worth attacking the waystations even if we overextend ourselves. &nbsp;Since we can't use it, it would be better for us to operate under the radar for a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It would be great if we can alert the Guardian Shadows to attack the waystation in my kingdom….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That I can agree with. &nbsp;Is that possible?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…mmm. &nbsp;In truth, it might be impossible to arrange it right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had already crossed two borders, so it would be difficult to get a message to the Rulain Kingdom. &nbsp;They could enlist the Guardian Shadows, but it was uncertain if they would deliver the message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell felt regret at the missed opportunity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is too bad. &nbsp;If we could use it, we could immediately infiltrate the Plain of Darkness….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Larua was surprised by his words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even you will get killed trying to pull that off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell passively accepted her assessment. &nbsp;The core forces of the Dragon Demon King worshippers were all gathered at the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;It wouldn’t be easy to take all of them down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still, we have to do something. We have to stop the Revival Ritual before Atein is able to revive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you looking at me like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m really curious as to who you really are.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can continue to be curious until you figure out the answer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Meanie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura’s lips made a small pout.</span></p>
