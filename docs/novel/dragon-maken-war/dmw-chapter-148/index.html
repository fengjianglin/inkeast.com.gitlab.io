 <p>Chapter 148 - Heaven and Hell (4)</p>
 <p><span style>&lt;We are the offspring of evil. &nbsp;We were born from the malice of humans. &nbsp;We were tossed into hell. The malice within hell kept growing without bounds…. &nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, we became the existences called the Demons.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>They couldn’t sleep, and they couldn’t forget. &nbsp;The Demon race was in constant torment as their malice grew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They hated humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Humans were members of a world where they could communicate with each other. &nbsp;The Demons were so jealous of them that it was unbearable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;We were in such a state when…. &nbsp;A life line in the form of black magicians appeared.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>At some point in history, the black magicians discovered the existence of the Demon race.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was truly a chance discovery. &nbsp;For some unknown reason, there were places where the barrier between the world and hell was blurred. &nbsp;The black magicians were able to perceive them at these locations, so they started finding ways to bring forth the Demons into this world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;We were seen as an intelligence of unknown origin. &nbsp;We occupied a different world as theirs, so the black magicians couldn’t leave this discovery alone.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It took a very long time before the first Demon was summoned back into the world. &nbsp;It couldn’t be achieved in a single lifetime. It took over 400 years worth of research and experimentation. &nbsp;The results of these research were passed down, and the summoning technique was perfected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;When we were summoned through black magic…. &nbsp;The Demons gained something they desired the most.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was ‘communication’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Then we found out something.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>By communicating with the humans, they could gain the souls of humans by leading them to their own destruction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they gained the soul, it was possible for them to participate in a world that they could only observe previously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;This was how we became the ‘evil Demons’. &nbsp;Do you get why the Demon race had no choice but to act malicious towards humans?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was at a loss for words. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was as Balserk had said….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Something is awry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t pinpoint what went wrong. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the existence of the Demon race itself seemed wrong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rules of the world had birthed the Demon race, and there was a fundamental defect in those rules!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell asked the question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you telling me this? &nbsp;I’m not a scholar or a magician. &nbsp;Even if you tell me that there is a fundamental defect to the rules of this world, I don’t think I will dedicate my life to fixing it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was sincere in asking his question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balserk’s story was a mythological truth. &nbsp;However, the story didn’t really move Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the first place, the world was full of unfairness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Each human were born with different fate. &nbsp;There were those that were born strong, and there were those that were born weak. &nbsp;There were those that were born into wealth, and there were those that were born into poverty. &nbsp;There were children that had guardians from birth, and there were children that were abandoned at birth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The truth of the Demon race was just one of the many unfairness in this world, so it didn’t really tug at his heart strings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The world has always been a fucked up place. That is why everyone is trying to make this place better. &nbsp;We are fighting ad nauseum to create a place where everyone can live alongside together.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was worse, the Dragon Demon war wasn’t fought with such intention in mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Each person’s thoughts on what was a ‘good world’ differed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell fought and hated the members of the Dragon Demon king’s army, but…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was cognizant of the fact that they were also fight for their own version of a ‘good world’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you telling me these truths?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I don’t know.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I was given an order to tell you this story. &nbsp;I was told I would be freed from this torment that was worse than hell if I followed his order. &nbsp;That is why I’m just doing what I am told.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…I see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;May I tell you my last story?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since I’m running out of time, you should do so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I’m thankful that I was able to speak to you like this. It had been such a painful experience that I wanted everything to end, but….. &nbsp;My last act will be a conversation with someone. It is a really good thing, but unfortunately, we have to end it here.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balserk hesitated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the moment he had been dreaming about. &nbsp;He dreamed about being freed from the pain worse than hell and the emptiness….. &nbsp;However, the simple act of conversing with someone made him have a lingering attachment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if he was mocking himself for being tormented by all of this. &nbsp;He threw out his last words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;The wise Dragon will inform you of the path you will have to take.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>When his words ended, the energy maintaining Balserk’s Undead form dissipated. &nbsp;There was only his skeleton left. It crumpled like a poorly constructed toy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell mumbled to himself as he watched the bones noisily fall to the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…who’s trying to plan out my fate?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>4</span></p>
 <p><span style>The party continued to head east.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Somehow, they had to make it through the Iellos kingdom to reach demonic land located in the east. &nbsp;They had to go to the Albatan Forest. The truth about the Demon race was revealed through Balserk, and this unknown being left a message for him. &nbsp;The need to follow up on the lead had grown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the problem was the enemies tracking them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was unknown as to what method they were using, but the Dragon Demon king worshippers were able to track down the party’s location. &nbsp;The party had started their escape only a day ago, yet the hands of their enemies stretched out towards them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first to realize the ambush was Kairen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was sleeping like the dead as he received Yuren’s ministrations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was still in very bad shape, and it was impossible for them to transport him through the air for an extended amount of time. &nbsp;They had to stop intermittently to rest and heal Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Kairen sensed someone watching them, he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…did they catch up to us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not sure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia detected the gaze a beat late. &nbsp;She got into her battle stance as she turned to look at Laura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it possible for you to discern who is observing us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen and Leticia could tell that a hostile gaze was on them. &nbsp;However, they had no idea from where they were being observed. They also couldn’t discern if they were being observed by magic or the naked eyes. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can do it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura nodded her head as she used her observation magic. &nbsp;She looked through her surrounding, then she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They are coming. &nbsp;There are around 50 of them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is Reygus amongst them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are several who possess massive amount of magical energy, but…. &nbsp;Reygus is not with them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus’ magical energy was quite distinct. &nbsp;Moreover, if the stories were accurate, Reygus didn’t like stealth. &nbsp;It would be easy to identify him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen thought for a brief moment before he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This means they probably predicted our route, and they used the Road of Emptiness to move their troops nearby.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Probably.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since Reygus isn’t here, it seems they predicted multiple paths.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Road of Emptiness allowed one to travel a long distance in an instant. &nbsp;However, there was a limit on how many members could go through it. Also, one could only travel to fixed waypoints. &nbsp;Even if Azell was injured, the party was moving at considerable speed. It wouldn’t be easy to dispatch forces into their predicted paths.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This reveals a truth that gives us hope.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Leticia asked the question, he quickly answered her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is true that our enemies can locate us. &nbsp;However, it seems the precision of the method is low.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If they could locate them in real time with precision, Reygus would have been dispatched here. &nbsp;Since he wasn’t, it was evidence that their method of tracking had several restrictions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia smirked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are awfully optimistic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The fact that they don’t precisely know what we will do is very important..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, they party planned on taking the shortest distance to the Albatan forest. &nbsp;If one thought about the mobility of the party, it was possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the Guardian Shadows sent a message during their travel. &nbsp;The Guardian Shadows wanted the party to follow them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The exact reason was unknown, but the Guardian Shadows were guiding them in a slightly roundabout way….. &nbsp;&nbsp;It probably had to do something with throwing their enemies off their scent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since Reygus isn’t here, we have no need to be afraid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is a high probability that Reygus will arrive in short order.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We just have to slaughter them all before we escape. &nbsp;In terms of firepower, we can overwhelm them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I agree, but…. &nbsp;Our core fighting power isn’t in good shape. &nbsp;I would like you to take that into consideration.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as Leticia had said. The party was in rough shape. &nbsp;They were able to recover somewhat using the black magic of Yuren and Laura. &nbsp;They looked fine on the outside, but the internal injuries hadn’t fully healed. &nbsp;Moreover, they hadn’t had proper rest, so they were exhausted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We have no choice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is annoying, but I agree with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen grumbled as he looked away from Leticia. &nbsp;He looked towards Laura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Laura.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll leave Azell to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? Why…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura was taken aback. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yuren is healthier than you. &nbsp;Moreover, if we are going to leave behind one person to guard Azell, I believe a magician would be better than a warrior. &nbsp;Please take care of support from the rear.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…understood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura nodded her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen, Leticia, Yuren and the Guardian Shadows moved to attack their enemies. &nbsp;They used gaze detection and observation magic to suss out the location of the enemies. &nbsp;It was better to hit them first rather than wait for them to attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon king worshippers calmly greeted the party.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon majin, who looked to be the leader, spoke as he clashed his sword against Kairen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess I was being too shameless in thinking that our ambush would succeed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t the case with all the their members, but at the very least, the commander of this party was an elite from the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;Such a being was able to detect Laura using her observation magic on them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Majin let out his killing intent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want you to throw away any hope of escaping this place with your lives intact.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll return those exact words to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two exchanged fierce sword strikes. &nbsp;Kairen was impressed by his opponent's skill. &nbsp;&nbsp;His opponent had smoothly negated the ambush earlier, and his sword strikes were sharp enough to send chills up Kairen’s spine. &nbsp;His swordsmanship was excellent, and his body was clearly superior to Kairen’s injured body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He’s strong. &nbsp;Has he gone through the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he was a Dragon Majin, it was hard to discern this truth. &nbsp;Still, the Dragon Majin was strong in his Dragon Demon Qi and Dragon Arts that it naturally made Kairen wonder about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kah-ahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sparks flew as the two swords exchanged blows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a short, but intense exchange. &nbsp;The fight ebbed and flowed between the two. &nbsp;The injured Kairen was inferior in term of strength and speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he possessed techniques he had cultivated for over a hundred years. &nbsp;His twin swords danced in a precise and skillful manner. Kairen stopped the Dragon Majin before he could gain any momentum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Majin spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected, the fame of the Dragon Sword Duke wasn’t unfounded! &nbsp;However, all five of you are wounded! Even if you have some of the Guardian Shadows by your side, this will be your grave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmm. &nbsp;Thank you for the information.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen grinned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This confirms it. &nbsp;You guys don’t have accurate information regarding our situation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
