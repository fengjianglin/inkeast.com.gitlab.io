 <p>Chapter 120 - Guide's Gift (6)</p>
 <p><span style>10</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had been awhile, since Niberis had returned to the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;The wound inflicted by Azell was so deep that it took four days for her to regain consciousness. &nbsp;Even after waking up, she had to refrain from moving. &nbsp;She had to focus only on healing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two weeks had passed by like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis was north of the Dragon Demon castle. &nbsp;She was visiting the resting place of the dead. &nbsp;It was where the truly revered members rested in eternal peace. &nbsp;These were members acknowledged by the Plain of Darkness</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to some stories she had heard before, this space had been quite desolate. &nbsp;It was a place where thousand soldiers could hold a parade, but only a few individuals had been buried here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, one or two headstones were added as time passed. &nbsp;The number of graves placed here grew. &nbsp;Currently, there was still a lot of empty space, but there were 300 headstones here. &nbsp;It wasn’t a small number.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis was looking for a specific headstone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Dragon Demon Prince’s Consort Elveris’</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the bottom, there were flowery words added eulogize the dead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis’ mother was buried here. &nbsp;She had been much young than Saibein, and as a Dragon Demon, she had been weak in constitution. &nbsp;When one was part of the nobility class in the Plain of Darkness, one had to carry out duties that was befitting one’s station. &nbsp;However, her mother was unable to do anything. &nbsp;All she could do was wither away in the cold land, which was separated from the rest of the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis remembered the story told to her by her mother when she was young.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This might be silly for me to say, but your father was very prince-like. &nbsp;The humans tell of a prince on a white horse in their stories. &nbsp;You father was that prince on a white horse.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Niberis’ memories, Elveris had always looked labored and tired. &nbsp;Her weak constitution wasn’t the only cause behind this. &nbsp;She had always lived with immense pressure placed on her. &nbsp;She was of high station, yet she couldn’t carry out her duties. &nbsp;There was always pressure from the outside for her to bear more children.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she was young, Niberis had lived a carefree life compared to Kieren and Jeffers. &nbsp;Niberis was only child between Saibein and Elveris. &nbsp;This was why she didn’t have to fight others to ascend to her position as the heir. &nbsp;Moreover, her father hadn’t been strict, and he didn’t want her to suffer by witnessing death and suffering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite this fact, Niberis insisted on living a difficult life even at an early age.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis witnessed the elders berate her mother. &nbsp;They didn’t hesitate to speak insulting words like how she should be propagating the great bloodline by having more children if she couldn’t fulfil her other duties. &nbsp;It lit a fire inside Niberis’ young heart whenever she heard those words. &nbsp;The ancient and honorable blood flowed through Niberis’ veins. &nbsp;If she proved her ability, she had thought her mother would no longer hear such words…. &nbsp;She had thought that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elveris spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If it wasn’t for your father, I would have died much earlier. &nbsp;In the past, I felt as if I was living in a cold prison. &nbsp;However, after meeting your father, I was able to breathe for the first time.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Saibein had been a kind man. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The marriage between the two individuals had been a pure political match. &nbsp;Saibein had been born before the Dragon Demon war, but Elveris had been born after the surviving remnant of the Dragon Demon army settled in the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;There was an age gap of 100 years between the two. &nbsp;Moreover, Saibein hadn’t even known what she had looked like until the marriage ceremony was underway.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, Saibein came to love Elveris, who had become his wife. &nbsp;His love was reflected in his actions. &nbsp;He didn’t hesitate to act like a fool just to make her laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Elveris died, Saibein went missing. &nbsp;When Niberis awoke from her slumber, she had learned the tragic news that her mother had died, and her father had gone missing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Mother, I….. &nbsp;I lost the person left behind by father.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis spoke to her mother’s grave inside her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He always tried to give me everything I wanted… &nbsp;I couldn’t do anything for him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she had lost her parents, Niberis’ heart had frozen over. &nbsp;She had given her affection to noone. &nbsp;She acted cold and ruthless towards others as she moved towards the power that was her birthright.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, a crack had formed on the cold castle wall that had been protecting her heart. &nbsp;She had lost to Azell in a way that didn’t leave any room for doubt, and she had lost Duran. &nbsp;She didn’t know what to do right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis was deep in her thoughts when she flinched. &nbsp;A very bleak energy reached her senses. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Hmmm.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a voice that was unique to the Undead. &nbsp;It sounded fiendish. &nbsp;Niberis’ eyes turned towards the source of the voice, and she saw a big Dragon Demon undead, who dwarfed all Dragon Demons. &nbsp;He was over 3 meters tall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It seems I’ve disturbed you. &nbsp;I’m sorry.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>An Undead that looked like a Skeleton Knight was being very careful with his words. &nbsp;It was somehow a bit gross. &nbsp;However, Niberis quickly calmed her agitation as she gracefully gave her greeting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s nice to meet you, sir Reygus.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The large Undead was none other than the legend from the Dragon Demon war. &nbsp;He was the Dragon Demon general Reygus. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus had been about to scratch his cheek when his hand paused in mid-air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Ah. &nbsp;Damn it. &nbsp;I can’t fix my habits.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had been awake as an Undead for a good amount of time now, but the habits he had in life appeared naturally. &nbsp;He awkwardly dropped his hand as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You are prince Saibein’s daughter? &nbsp;You are Ms Niberis?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It is a pleasure to meet you. &nbsp;I’m Reygus.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the first time the two of them had met. &nbsp;However, everyone within the Plain of Darkness knew about Reygus. &nbsp;This was why she was able to identify him at a glance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Actually, I’m here, because I wanted to ask you about something…. &nbsp;It seems this isn’t the right time to do so. &nbsp;I’ll meet you at a later date.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You wanted to speak to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis looked at him in confusion. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>What did he want to ask her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus didn’t speak as his stride quickly brought him near the headstone. &nbsp;He mumbled to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I’m a corpse walking through amongst the graves. &nbsp;It is funny… &nbsp;On the other hand, there are a lot of name here that I know.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first to be buried here were the surviving forces of the Dragon Demon king’s army. &nbsp;These were the beings, who died after returning to the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;However, as time passed, those who died an honorable death in the Dragon Demon war was place here as a way to respects them. &nbsp;Their corpses weren’t buried here, but they felt duty bound pay tribute to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The silence went on for a while. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus turned away as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I’m sorry I bothered you. &nbsp;I’ll find you again at a more suitable location.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No… &nbsp;We can speak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis also turned away from the headstone as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let us have the conversation somewhere else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Thank you.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus walked away as he took big strides. &nbsp;He suddenly turned around to look at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Ah. &nbsp;Damn it. &nbsp;I keep forgetting I walk unnecessarily fast. &nbsp;Whether in life or death, that hasn’t changed.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus had been a mountain of a man, so he walked very quickly with his long strides. &nbsp;In the past, his lieutenant Chanes had to run to keep up with him. &nbsp;Reygus still had this habit, so even at his old age, Chanes had to run to keep up with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus didn't care if a males had difficulty keeping up with him or not. &nbsp;However, he wanted to be respectful towards this young lady.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them left the final resting place of the dead, and they started walking. &nbsp;They walked across a large hallway that was flowing with cold air. &nbsp;Niberis asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What would you like to hear from me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It’s just that…. &nbsp;I heard you inherited prince Saibein’s ‘Book of Darkness.’&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>At his words, Niberis flinched. &nbsp;Everyone in the Plain of Darkness knew about it, so she didn’t have a good reason to react this way. &nbsp;However, she felt a complicated emotion wash over her as she remembered the old memories she had thought about in front of her mother’s grave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;From your report, you weren’t able to meet prince Saibein.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This had occurred before Laura was sent out to kidnap Seigar. &nbsp;Niberis received orders from her elders to to search for her missing father Saibein. &nbsp;After she conducted a diligent search, she had found a trace leading her to his whereabouts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it wasn’t easy to approach this location. &nbsp;It was one of the land of demons. &nbsp;It was a place that was known to be difficult to penetrate akin to the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;The elders attempted to send in troops into this land several times to find Saibein. &nbsp;In the end, all of them went missing or they returned as corpses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a very dangerous mission, yet there were two reason why she was chosen. &nbsp;Niberis was Saibein’s daughter, and she was talented enough to extract herself from danger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Niberis wasn’t able to meet Saibein in the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You probably heard this already…. &nbsp;It really was a strange event.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;A Dragon delivered your Dragon Weapon. &nbsp;I’ve been briefed on it.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was a Water Dragon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A Water Dragon lived in a body of water, and it could freely control the flow of water. &nbsp;This being had appeared in front of her, and it delivered Saibein’s Dragon weapon to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was as if I was dreaming. &nbsp;I never expected such a thing to be possible. &nbsp;However… &nbsp;The water dragon retreated, and the Book of Darkness was passed on to me. &nbsp;I could feel the faint imprint of my father’s thought resting within it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It delivered his will for her to take the book. &nbsp;It also told her to return to where she came from. &nbsp;The voice didn’t have any substance. &nbsp;It was a feeling that was delivered to her, so it was hard to tell if Saibein was still alive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, she felt the urge to follow his instruction. &nbsp;Niberis returned to the Plain of Darkness with only the Book of Darkness to show for her efforts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I see…….&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus’ voice was filled with sadness. &nbsp;Now that he had talked to her directly, he confirmed that Niberis had not been lying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Thank you for telling me your story. &nbsp;I want to apologize again for disturbing you during such an important time. &nbsp;&nbsp;I’ll...&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis grabbed him.&nbsp; Reygus turned to look at her, and she couldn’t decipher his emotions. &nbsp;Niberis asked as she looked into the eye sockets of the skull.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know if humans…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Humans?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m talking about the past. &nbsp;When the king conducted his holy war to right the world order…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis hesitated for a moment as she brought up a story regarding the Dragon Demon war. &nbsp;She had grabbed Reygus on impulse, but she was unsure if she should ask this question. &nbsp;However, her curiosity won out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…did humans use an insulting title to refer to my father?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Which insulting title are you talking about?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis hesitated once again. &nbsp;When she heard the title for the first time, she felt so angry that it felt as if her blood was flowing in the wrong direction. &nbsp;She felt humiliated by the fact that she would have to repeat such words with her own mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Simpleton Prince….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;…….&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus was speechless for a moment. &nbsp;Niberis was embarrassed as she looked at him. &nbsp;However, she had no idea what the Undead was thinking. &nbsp;She couldn’t read his expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a brief moment, Reygus asked in a harsh tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Who told Miss about that title?&gt;</span></p>
