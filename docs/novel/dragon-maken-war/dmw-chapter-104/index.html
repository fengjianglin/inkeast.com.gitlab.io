 <p>Chapter 104 - The Sword that Split the Heavens (7)</p>
 <p><span style>The next day Laura realized almost half of her siblings were gone. &nbsp;The chosen received their names, and the rest were culled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that point, Laura had a good idea what they were doing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Aunsaurus tribe had come up against their limitation. &nbsp;Aunsaurus was one of the 4 great Dragon Demon Generals, and he was a first generation Dragon Demon. &nbsp;Basically, he was born without parents, and his power couldn't be compared to the normal Dragon Demons. &nbsp;Even if his descendants were proud of carrying his blood, there was a clear limitation to their powers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn't enough to intermarry between Dragon Demons. &nbsp;They needed a more surefire way to gain a talented successor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected of magicians, they came up with an insane solution. &nbsp;If marriage between good bloodlines weren't enough, they would just add magic to artificially make talented offsprings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was how Laura and her siblings were born.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In truth, the word 'born' was an inadequate description. &nbsp;Artificial wombs were created using the secret arts of Black Magic. &nbsp;If one didn't use such a method, it would have been impossible to gather over 100 siblings of the same age.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the beginning, they were made to be the perfect successor of Aunsaurus. &nbsp;They were a product made with great care and effort. &nbsp;Their growth process was a period of time where their makers could check which product was defective or not.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it ended there, it would have great. &nbsp;However, the Ausaurus family wanted perfection.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if there were no defects, they weren't satisfied. &nbsp;They merely wanted the one that transcended beyond all standards. &nbsp;In the end, they wanted a single exceptional being.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The one that never fails will inherit his name. &nbsp;We don't want failures.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The failures disappeared one by one. &nbsp;Laura knew what happened to them. &nbsp;In the initial phase, the unnamed ones were sent to the Black Magic research facility to be used as lab rats. &nbsp;If one had received a name, their fate was bound by Black Magic. &nbsp;They were forever forbidden to reveal themselves as they sacrificed their whole lives for the tribe. &nbsp;They became tools for battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, the last one standing was Laura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Congratulations. &nbsp;From now on, you are Laura Aunsaurus..’</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the day when all her siblings were gone and she was all alone, Laura became an Aunsaurus. &nbsp;She inherited the cursed Dragon Demon weapon called the Vitan's Chalice not too long after. &nbsp;Then she was officially introduced to the world through her coming of age ceremony. &nbsp;She had an identity in this world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afterwards, Laura lived in an achromatic world. &nbsp;No, if she thought about it, she had exited her glass cage, and she had found the world to be gray. &nbsp;She hated everything that had surrounded her. &nbsp;There was nothing of worth around her. &nbsp;This was true for the bloodline of Aunsaurus, and it even extended to her life, which had been manufactured for her to become the heir.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In such a world, the only thing that could move her hardened heart were her competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was unbelievably jealous of Niberis, who was able to display hate and a competitive spirit towards her. &nbsp;From the start of her life, Niberis never had to doubt her own existence, and she had been revered by everyone around her. &nbsp;Niberis had everything Laura never possessed. &nbsp;This was why she hated and envied Niberis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the same for Kieren. &nbsp;He grew up fighting with his numerous siblings for the honor of being the heir. &nbsp;This was where all the similarity ended. &nbsp;He was born into the world through a natural process, and he had experienced each steps of his life like a normal being. &nbsp;This was why Laura disliked Kieren too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Kieren was competent, yet in many ways, his heart was absurdly delicate. &nbsp;This was why she looked at him in a slightly more favorable light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had everything he could want in this world, yet he ate his heart out as he looked at Niberis. &nbsp;Laura found the situation to be amusing and pitiful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, Kieren treated Laura like a person even though she had been thoroughly molded into being a tool. &nbsp;She had been able to feel human-like emotions through him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I'll repay my debt right now, Duke Baldazark.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura opened her mouth as this thought crossed her mind. &nbsp;She walked towards the most dazzling being she had ever seen up until now. &nbsp;She headed towards the being that had stirred her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Azell Zestringer. &nbsp;I have a proposal for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>10</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura dispersed her Dragon Demon weapon, and she walked towards Azell. &nbsp;It was as if she had a death wish. &nbsp;However, she had retracted her Dragon Demon weapon and her defensive magic. &nbsp;She was completely defenseless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the white hem of her skirt fluttered, the Guardian Shadows charged towards her. &nbsp;It didn't matter what she said. &nbsp;They didn't show any signs of compromise in their actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell got in the way of the Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;When he swung his sword, the thunderbolt stretched out to stop the movement of the Guardian Shadows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In any battlefield, it isn't honorable to kill a defenseless person, who wants to talk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>「Enemy…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>「Have to kill... &nbsp;At all cost…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>「No forgiveness…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That's your problem. &nbsp;I'll decide if I want to cut her down after I hear her story. Or are you willing to fight me to see if I'm serious?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke with a cold voice. &nbsp;The Guardian Shadows became confused as they looked at Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>「Why…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>「We have to kill…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>「But… He…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was anyone other than Azell, the Guardian Shadows wouldn't have hesitated to carry out their attack. &nbsp;However, Azell might be the one they had been waiting for. &nbsp;He might be the one foretold in the prophecy, so they put a brake to their actions. &nbsp;In the end, the Guardian Shadows whispered to each other in a heated discussion as they retreated backwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell yelled out loud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone stop!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His voice rang out like a lion's roar. &nbsp;Everyone unconsciously stopped fighting, and as if it was a lie, a silence descended on the surrounding. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In this unnatural silence, Laura's clear voice rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll surrender myself to you. &nbsp;Instead, I want you to let the rest of my group go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you really think your proposal is reasonable? &nbsp;You may be from the bloodline of Aunsaurus, but this is revered only in the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;Your bloodline is worthless here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon king worshippers were already defeated. &nbsp;Their complete destruction was only a matter of time. &nbsp;In such a situation, why would he let everyone else go, because Laura surrendered herself to him? &nbsp;The sensible move was to slaughter every Dragon Demon King worshippers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am well aware of that fact. &nbsp;This is why I'll give you something of equal value.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you have that will make me spare their foolish lives?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll give you my Dragon Demon weapon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“……!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell, who had been making sarcastic remarks, stopped breathing from the surprise he felt. &nbsp;It wasn't just him. &nbsp;All of the Dragon Demon king worshippers were taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duchess Aunsaurus! &nbsp;What are you saying!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis and Kieren were in critical condition. &nbsp;The only one able to speak against her was Jeffers Almarick. &nbsp;He was so surprised that he didn't even maintain his guard against Leticia. &nbsp;He stared at Laura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a really stupid move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just want to kill you right now... &nbsp;However, I'll wait and see how this turns out. &nbsp;How unfortunate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia had used this opportunity to put the blade of her spear up against Almarick's neck. &nbsp;From Almarick's perspective, he had made a really silly mistake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kook……!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura didn't pay attention to Almarick's advice as she continued to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll let you inherit my Dragon Demon weapon 'Vitan's Chalice'. &nbsp;I believe that is more than enough to strike a bargain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell labored over the decision. &nbsp;This proposal was really beyond his imagination. &nbsp;He had to admit it. &nbsp;This expressionless Dragon Demon girl got one over him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon weapon could be transferred to another person only if the owner sincerely desires it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was impossible to inherit the Dragon Demon weapon by killing or threatening the owner. The Dragon Demon weapons had a form of sentience, so it could discern the true feeling of its owner. &nbsp;If one stole it using threats, it would provoke an unpredictable reaction from the Dragon Demon weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, it wasn't a guaranteed she'll go through with the transfer even if Azell accepted her proposal. &nbsp;If she was willing to sacrifice her own life to kill Azell, the inheritance of the Dragon Demon weapon could...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to observe from your side. &nbsp;Maybe, you are the one that will give us the chance to turn back the fate of the king.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you talking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you accept my proposal, I'll answer any questions you are curious about.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmm…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duchess Ausaurus! &nbsp;Are you betraying us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jeffers had heard enough. &nbsp;He grinded his teeth. &nbsp;From the perspective of a Dragon Demon King worshipper, Laura's proposal was unacceptable. &nbsp;This was a precious Dragon Demon weapon passed down from the Dragon Demon wars. &nbsp;How could she just give it away to an enemy? &nbsp;Moreover, she was planning to spill confidential information.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn't as if Laura knew all the secrets, yet the ones she knew could be lethal to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the young Dragon Demons here possessed the highest of pedigree. &nbsp;However, their duty was more important than their lives. &nbsp;Until the day their savior returns, they had to fulfill their duty even if it required the sacrifice of their lives.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jeffers yelled out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don't make me laugh! &nbsp;This is do or die! &nbsp;Fight! &nbsp;Everyone… &nbsp;Kuhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn't finish the sentence. &nbsp;Leticia unhesitatingly hit his face with the flat of her spear head. &nbsp;Her attack flowed like water to strike him, and Jeffers fell unconscious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if you fight to the death, there aren't many of you left. &nbsp;How ridiculous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, there were only 10 members of the Dragon Demon King worshippers that were in any shape to fight. &nbsp;If the fight started up again, they'll be slaughtered in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia snorted as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It does make me feel a little bit better. &nbsp;You there. &nbsp;I recommend you don't take this deal. &nbsp;I would love to kill this bastard right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…Hmmm. Now that I've heard Miss's words, I feel the need to act in a more rational manner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia had on an expression as if Azell had said something very offensive. &nbsp;From her appearance, she did look like a young woman. &nbsp;However, it had been very long, since she had been called by that term.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell smirked as he asked her a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Would you like to be called madam?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He remember having a similar conversation before. &nbsp;At the time, he had been speaking to the Dragon Demon King worshipper named Regina.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia answered him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you want to die, you can call me that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a scary Miss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell shrugged his shoulder then he looked at Laura. &nbsp;He looked at her to read her true intentions, but he couldn't. &nbsp;There was no expression on Laura's face, and there were barely any emotions revealed in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. &nbsp;I'll accept your proposal. &nbsp;However, I have a condition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is your condition?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want you to incinerate all the dead bodies here with your hands.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At those words, the Dragon Demon King worshippers became restless. &nbsp;Even Laura showed signs of unrest. &nbsp;However, Azell was adamant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I let them take the intact corpses, won't your side bring back the useful members as Undeads? &nbsp;I'm used to destroying beings returned from the dead, but it isn't as if I enjoy doing it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…all right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura nodded her head slightly. &nbsp;Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want the survivors to be gathered, and they can run away like dogs with their tails lit on fire. &nbsp;I'll give you all three minutes for everyone to get out of my sight. &nbsp;Moreover...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell looked at Kieren, who had wrapped his body around Niberis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you want to say something, I want you to speak it out loud. &nbsp;I don't like little Dragon Demons talking in secret. &nbsp;This situation has deteriorated too much for me to feign ignorance. If you are recovered enough to use Whispering, you should be able to speak it out loud.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“H... How...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kieren was surprised. &nbsp;He had been secretly Whispering towards Laura, yet Azell seemed to have sensed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I accepted her proposal. &nbsp;Guardian Shadows... &nbsp;Will you disagree and go against my decision?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>「We don't know…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>「Don't… understand…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>「But…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>「We won't stand against…….」</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, the Guardian Shadows decided to give up on opposing Azell's will. &nbsp;Then the Dragon Demon worshippers retreated as if a fissure was about to swallow them from behind. Laura created fire as she burned every single corpse to ashes.</span></p>
