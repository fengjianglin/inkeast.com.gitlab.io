  <p><span style><span style><span style>Chapter 4 - Azell Zestringer (4)</span></span></span></p>
  <p></p>
  <hr>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>Magic and Spirit Order is a secret art that is not taught thoughtlessly to others, and no one trains in front of others. However, Azell knew about Rick’s presence. He resonated with the mana without paying attention to him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmm.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>There was a faint ball of light that rose up in front of Azell as he continued to resonate with the mana. After seeing this, Rick instantly recognized what it was.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Is that a mana aggregate? He didn’t have a single ring of life, so how was he able to create such a dense aggregate of magical force?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>The rings of life of a person, who had mastered the Spirit Order, was a representation of how much strength the person could use. As the number of rings of life increases, one could release more stronger power.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, when Rick observed him, Azell hadn’t properly activated his energy and he had no rings of life. So how was he able to make such a dense aggregate of magical force, which had materialized in a form of light?</span></p>
  <p><span style>If Azell had heard Rick’s question, then he would have answered like this.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Even if I do not have the rings of life, my control over the magical force is high and this allows me to freely manipulate the magical force.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell had already perfected the Spirit Order, and he had reached the highest stage before. Of course, he was unrivalled in manipulating the magical force.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The other practitioners would only absorb a portion of the power they had raised through the mana resonance. However, Azell gathered all the power into one place, and he supported it with both hands.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Then he drank it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Ricks eyes became round.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“He ate…the mana aggregate?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>He had never heard of such an event. Azell had drunk the mana aggregate he had made as if it was water!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hoo-ooh.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>This caused a considerable amount of magical energy to flow into his dried energy pulse.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell circulated the magical force throughout his whole body’s energy pulse. After it soaked in, he gathered the leftover power to draw a ring.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I won’t be able to do it in a day’</span></p>
  <p><span style>As expected, the job of forming the ring of life was tough. With this amount of magical force, he wasn’t even able to maintain the small origin that’ll become the ring of life’s circle.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell tried to raise the mana resonance again to form another mana aggregate, but suddenly the vision in front of his eyes spun.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Oook…..”</span></p>
  <p><span style>He was sitting cross-legged, but he almost lost his balance. He was barely able to avoid from falling to the ground, and Azell realized his problem.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Shit. My body won’t be able to endure it.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The condition of his body was so bad that he could only resonate the mana for a short period of time, and after receiving one magic aggregate he had reached his limit. Spirit order was a</span></p>
  <p><span style>secret art that strengthened the body through magical force. One had to train the body and magical force equally to see a synergistic effect. If one side is deficient then it’ll affect the other side too.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Don’t over do it. Where did you learn to make a mana aggregate and drink it? I know the basics of Spirit Order, but this is the first time I have seen that method.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“….maybe?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell turned his head in puzzlement.</span></p>
  <p><span style>His attitude indicated that he didn’t know either. Of course, he was acting, but he had laid down a cover story earlier. So Rick just let it go.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I have a request, army doctor Rick.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmm?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The meals tomorrow… Could you give me the normal amount?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was able to speak properly now. His voice was extremely hoarse, but he was able to articulate clearly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick shook his head.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No. Do you think your body could digest a normal meal?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m only asking, because I believe I can.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You only feel like that. You might defecate bloody stools.” (TLN: ew &gt;.&lt;)</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No, really. I’m unsure about my memory, but… I’m able to control my body through Spirit Order. I only went to the restroom once today.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘His body is in such a state that it may not be able to absorb all the nutrients…. Still that shouldn’t be normal?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell spoke to the dubious Rick.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“First, I’ll eat tomorrow’s breakfast and I’ll stop if it is a burden. Please let me at least attempt it?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmm. Ok. However….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick spoke with an unsatisfied expression.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You are very natural at speaking casually to me?” (TLN: again korean has casual/respectful way of speaking. MC was speaking casually == no respect)</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Did I? By the way, didn’t you, army doctor Rick, do the same thing?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m someone even the army’s Centurions respect?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“In the past, I also got special treatments. Maybe. Since I can’t really remember it.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Jeez.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick clicked his tongue, but he didn’t say anything. In the first place, he didn’t have the personality to tie his neck in a noose over someone not addressing him with honorific.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Also, this guys is oddly familiar?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>At first, he was slightly afraid of the person who didn’t look like a human then he felt pity.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Now that he had heard some of his story, he was oddly familiar. This caused him to treat him in a very relaxed manner even if his appearance was like that.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After Azell saw his reaction, he smiled inside.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Fortunately, I’m able to manipulate the energies pretty well.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was common for a person to feel a unique feeling when one sees another person. The feeling could be called a normal impression. Some people are comfortable, some are threatening and some people’s impression is so faint that one can’t tell if the person is there or not.</span></p>
  <p><span style>When the practitioner of Spirit Order reaches the highest, one is able to control the energy that is emitted, and in turn, one can change one’s impression. Earlier Giles was softly emitting an imposing feeling. This was the same principle. (TLN: he gave Giles as an example.)</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was able to utilize this technique. He intended to give off a friendly atmosphere with no pressure. Rick ate it up.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick complained.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Sir Giles picked up a strange guy.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>He didn’t call Giles a Centurion, but he called him ‘Sir’, which was an honorific for knights.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell thought this was strange, but he started asking a different question.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ah. Do you think I could ask you couple question?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Do you realize that someone in your position shouldn’t talk like this?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I know I’m the one who should be questioned, but I can’t remember anything. ”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I don’t know who you are but…. I bet you lived shamelessly.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I think so too.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell laughed bitterly. If he wasn’t shameless, then he wouldn’t have invested an enormous amount of resources to save his own life by emulating the dragon’s hibernation. He wouldn’t have even attempted it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Anyways, Carlos was chomping at the bits to do the experiment.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Carlos did everything in his power to save his friend, Azell. However, as a magician, he probably felt ecstatic that he would be able to implement his methods. Originally, magicians are that kind of breed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell asked a question.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Where is this place?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“We are with the Balan forest located in the Rulain kingdom’s western border.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The Rulain kingdom….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Now that he thought about it, Giles introduced himself as belonging to the Rulain kingdom’s western border guards. At the time, he didn’t have the presence of mind to pay attention to it, but now that he thought about it….</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘That country doesn’t exist.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>According to Azell’s knowledge, the country called Rulain kingdom didn’t exist.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, he did remember a figure called Rulain. Amongst the noble family of the Nadik kingdom, there was one called Duke Rulain.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell asked the most important question.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“By the way, what year is this according to the Atein calendar?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Each country on the continent used the years since they were formed. However, there was a separate system called the Atein calendar. The magicians started counting the time since the Dragon Demon King Atein was destroyed and when the humans was freed from his threat. This method started being widely used.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick answered.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It’s the year 222.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Year 222? Did you say year 222?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes. Also, today is the 4th month 8th days.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Huh… No, wait a moment.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell put his hand on his forehead, while making a shocked expression. The shock was too large that he lost the ability to speak for a moment.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“220 years…..’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell had fallen asleep 2 years after he had slain the Dragon Demon King Atein. According to Rick, 220 years had passed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I can’t believe this.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>He had already guessed that he had been asleep for a long time.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Unlike other animals, the dragons hibernate for at least couple decades. Since the time he was awake, he had somewhat accepted the fact that he had been asleep for a very long time.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, he would have never imagined that such an enormous amount of time had passed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘That explains it.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>He was sure it was the same language, but words he didn’t know was mixed in with it. It wasn’t because he was in a region where he never visited, but neew words he didn’t know were formed after a vast amount of time had passed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Everyone I knew… They are all dead.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was despairing when he heard a voice carefully asking him a question. This woke him up.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick was staring at him with a worried face.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell replied.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ah, I’m ok.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What’s wrong? Was it a memory related to the date?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“A little bit.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What did you remember?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I think… I lost several years worth of memory.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell lied about it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The surprised Rick asked a question.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“How many years?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m not certain. However, the last date I remember was the year 218.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Therefore, there was a 4 year gap in his memory. Azell decided to tell him this.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Of course, this was an event that would make one shocked.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick questioned.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“How old are you, Azell?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I don’t know. I don’t think I’m 30 yet…..”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yeah?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick was surprised. Azell asked while frowning.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Why are you reacting like that?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No, how should I say this. You don’t seem that old. When I look at your appearance, I can’t determine your age at all.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmm. That’s how it should be.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell laughed bitterly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After the conversation, Rick went to sleep, so he also went to lie down on his bunk. Even though his body required sleep, he was up all night, because of the confusion and shock.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Carlos…..’</span></p>
  <p><span style>He wanted to see his friend that he could never meet again. (TLN: Q_Q)</span></p>
  <p><span style>5</span></p>
  <p><span style>The next morning Azell called after a soldier and they went looking for Giles.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was morning, but Giles appearance was impeccable. He looked delicate, but he seemed to try hard to act with discipline.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles asked him a question.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Have you eaten?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Thanks to you.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After getting Rick’s permission, Azell was able to have a normal meal as breakfast. Rick was surprised at seeing Azell eat all the of meal that the soldier brought.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You look way better than yesterday.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That I do?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>He looked scary since he was still very skinny, but his appearance was way more human-like compared to yesterday.</span></p>

 <p><span style>The rings of life of a person, who had mastered the Spirit Order, was a representation of how much strength the person could use. As the number of rings of life increases, one could release more stronger power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when Rick observed him, Azell hadn’t properly activated his energy and he had no rings of life. So how was he able to make such a dense aggregate of magical force, which had materialized in a form of light?</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Azell had heard Rick’s question, then he would have answered like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Even if I do not have the rings of life, my control over the magical force is high and this allows me to freely manipulate the magical force.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had already perfected the Spirit Order, and he had reached the highest stage before. Of course, he was unrivalled in manipulating the magical force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other practitioners would only absorb a portion of the power they had raised through the mana resonance. However, Azell gathered all the power into one place, and he supported it with both hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he drank it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ricks eyes became round.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He ate…the mana aggregate?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had never heard of such an event. Azell had drunk the mana aggregate he had made as if it was water!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoo-ooh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This caused a considerable amount of magical energy to flow into his dried energy pulse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell circulated the magical force throughout his whole body’s energy pulse. After it soaked in, he gathered the leftover power to draw a ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I won’t be able to do it in a day’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected, the job of forming the ring of life was tough. With this amount of magical force, he wasn’t even able to maintain the small origin that’ll become the ring of life’s circle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell tried to raise the mana resonance again to form another mana aggregate, but suddenly the vision in front of his eyes spun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oook…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was sitting cross-legged, but he almost lost his balance. He was barely able to avoid from falling to the ground, and Azell realized his problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Shit. My body won’t be able to endure it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The condition of his body was so bad that he could only resonate the mana for a short period of time, and after receiving one magic aggregate he had reached his limit. Spirit order was a</span></p>
 <p><span style>secret art that strengthened the body through magical force. One had to train the body and magical force equally to see a synergistic effect. If one side is deficient then it’ll affect the other side too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t over do it. Where did you learn to make a mana aggregate and drink it? I know the basics of Spirit Order, but this is the first time I have seen that method.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“….maybe?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell turned his head in puzzlement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His attitude indicated that he didn’t know either. Of course, he was acting, but he had laid down a cover story earlier. So Rick just let it go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have a request, army doctor Rick.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The meals tomorrow… Could you give me the normal amount?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was able to speak properly now. His voice was extremely hoarse, but he was able to articulate clearly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. Do you think your body could digest a normal meal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m only asking, because I believe I can.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You only feel like that. You might defecate bloody stools.” (TLN: ew &gt;.&lt;)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, really. I’m unsure about my memory, but… I’m able to control my body through Spirit Order. I only went to the restroom once today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘His body is in such a state that it may not be able to absorb all the nutrients…. Still that shouldn’t be normal?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke to the dubious Rick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First, I’ll eat tomorrow’s breakfast and I’ll stop if it is a burden. Please let me at least attempt it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm. Ok. However….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick spoke with an unsatisfied expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are very natural at speaking casually to me?” (TLN: again korean has casual/respectful way of speaking. MC was speaking casually == no respect)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did I? By the way, didn’t you, army doctor Rick, do the same thing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m someone even the army’s Centurions respect?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the past, I also got special treatments. Maybe. Since I can’t really remember it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jeez.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick clicked his tongue, but he didn’t say anything. In the first place, he didn’t have the personality to tie his neck in a noose over someone not addressing him with honorific.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Also, this guys is oddly familiar?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>At first, he was slightly afraid of the person who didn’t look like a human then he felt pity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that he had heard some of his story, he was oddly familiar. This caused him to treat him in a very relaxed manner even if his appearance was like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Azell saw his reaction, he smiled inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Fortunately, I’m able to manipulate the energies pretty well.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was common for a person to feel a unique feeling when one sees another person. The feeling could be called a normal impression. Some people are comfortable, some are threatening and some people’s impression is so faint that one can’t tell if the person is there or not.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the practitioner of Spirit Order reaches the highest, one is able to control the energy that is emitted, and in turn, one can change one’s impression. Earlier Giles was softly emitting an imposing feeling. This was the same principle. (TLN: he gave Giles as an example.)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was able to utilize this technique. He intended to give off a friendly atmosphere with no pressure. Rick ate it up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick complained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir Giles picked up a strange guy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t call Giles a Centurion, but he called him ‘Sir’, which was an honorific for knights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell thought this was strange, but he started asking a different question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. Do you think I could ask you couple question?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you realize that someone in your position shouldn’t talk like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know I’m the one who should be questioned, but I can’t remember anything. ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know who you are but…. I bet you lived shamelessly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think so too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell laughed bitterly. If he wasn’t shameless, then he wouldn’t have invested an enormous amount of resources to save his own life by emulating the dragon’s hibernation. He wouldn’t have even attempted it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Anyways, Carlos was chomping at the bits to do the experiment.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos did everything in his power to save his friend, Azell. However, as a magician, he probably felt ecstatic that he would be able to implement his methods. Originally, magicians are that kind of breed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where is this place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are with the Balan forest located in the Rulain kingdom’s western border.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Rulain kingdom….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that he thought about it, Giles introduced himself as belonging to the Rulain kingdom’s western border guards. At the time, he didn’t have the presence of mind to pay attention to it, but now that he thought about it….</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘That country doesn’t exist.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to Azell’s knowledge, the country called Rulain kingdom didn’t exist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he did remember a figure called Rulain. Amongst the noble family of the Nadik kingdom, there was one called Duke Rulain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell asked the most important question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“By the way, what year is this according to the Atein calendar?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Each country on the continent used the years since they were formed. However, there was a separate system called the Atein calendar. The magicians started counting the time since the Dragon Demon King Atein was destroyed and when the humans was freed from his threat. This method started being widely used.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s the year 222.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Year 222? Did you say year 222?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. Also, today is the 4th month 8th days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh… No, wait a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell put his hand on his forehead, while making a shocked expression. The shock was too large that he lost the ability to speak for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“220 years…..’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had fallen asleep 2 years after he had slain the Dragon Demon King Atein. According to Rick, 220 years had passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can’t believe this.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had already guessed that he had been asleep for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike other animals, the dragons hibernate for at least couple decades. Since the time he was awake, he had somewhat accepted the fact that he had been asleep for a very long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he would have never imagined that such an enormous amount of time had passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘That explains it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was sure it was the same language, but words he didn’t know was mixed in with it. It wasn’t because he was in a region where he never visited, but neew words he didn’t know were formed after a vast amount of time had passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Everyone I knew… They are all dead.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was despairing when he heard a voice carefully asking him a question. This woke him up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick was staring at him with a worried face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, I’m ok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s wrong? Was it a memory related to the date?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A little bit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you remember?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think… I lost several years worth of memory.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell lied about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surprised Rick asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How many years?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not certain. However, the last date I remember was the year 218.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, there was a 4 year gap in his memory. Azell decided to tell him this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, this was an event that would make one shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick questioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How old are you, Azell?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know. I don’t think I’m 30 yet…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick was surprised. Azell asked while frowning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you reacting like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, how should I say this. You don’t seem that old. When I look at your appearance, I can’t determine your age at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm. That’s how it should be.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell laughed bitterly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the conversation, Rick went to sleep, so he also went to lie down on his bunk. Even though his body required sleep, he was up all night, because of the confusion and shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Carlos…..’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wanted to see his friend that he could never meet again. (TLN: Q_Q)</span></p>
 <p><span style>5</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next morning Azell called after a soldier and they went looking for Giles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was morning, but Giles appearance was impeccable. He looked delicate, but he seemed to try hard to act with discipline.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles asked him a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you eaten?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thanks to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After getting Rick’s permission, Azell was able to have a normal meal as breakfast. Rick was surprised at seeing Azell eat all the of meal that the soldier brought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You look way better than yesterday.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That I do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked scary since he was still very skinny, but his appearance was way more human-like compared to yesterday.</span></p>
