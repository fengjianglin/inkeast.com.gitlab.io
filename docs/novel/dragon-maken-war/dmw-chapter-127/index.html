 <p>Chapter 127 - Suspicious Movements (2)</p>
 <p><span style>3</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Azell’s party arrived, the town had gone to hell. &nbsp;A small group of humans were leading a horde of 50 Orcs. &nbsp;They were killing every person in sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll leave the command to you, Duke.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. &nbsp;Laura and Yuren should skim the place with magic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen immediately started to give orders. &nbsp;Azell also had extensive experience in commanding a group during the Dragon Demon wars as an officer. &nbsp;However, he would rather use his personal martial skills to accomplish missions rather than focusing on commanding others. &nbsp;This was why he determined it would be better for Kairen to be in command.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll prioritize tracking down and eliminating the hostile magicians.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The enemy forces were bringing forth the darkness by extinguishing all the light not because the Orcs could see well within the darkness. &nbsp;Magicians were supporting them with magic. &nbsp;It allowed their troops to discern objects in darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood. &nbsp;Their magicians are pretty powerful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are also two Dragon Majins.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a flash, the two of them had sensed the magicians. &nbsp;At Laura’s words, everyone turned to look at her. &nbsp;Azell asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you sure it is them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, they are camouflaging the Dragon Demon magic as normal magic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were using a magic tool to skillfully cover up the presence of Dragon Demon magic. &nbsp;However, Laura knew about the existence of such magical tools, and she was able to identify its presence. &nbsp;At that moment, Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We will scatter to defeat the enemies one by one. &nbsp;Laura and Yuren will take down the enemy magicians, then they will guide the townspeople to safety.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They decided not to charge in immediately. &nbsp;They were on standby as Yuren placed a magic communication spell over the party. &nbsp;When the communication network was completed, Kairen and Azell ran like the wind. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia was about to follow after them when she asked a question to Yuren.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you sure about this? &nbsp;Is it ok to deploy us like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She still didn’t completely trust Laura. &nbsp;Azell had put in a magical shunt within her, but Leticia had no idea how Laura would act when no one was close by to keep an eye on her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren shrugged his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We have no choice but to trust Azell’s judgement.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are being irresponsible by trusting him so much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve already bet everything on him. &nbsp;If his judgement is wrong, I’ll probably be stabbed in the back. &nbsp;I’ll survive somehow and I’ll give him a piece of my mind afterwards.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You sound like a man, who lost his wallet as well as his soul by falling for a bad girl. &nbsp;You might have a predisposition for being a pushover. &nbsp;”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia gave those sarcastic remarks before she left him. &nbsp;Yuren grinned as he looked at Laura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shall we go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Should I say thank you for believing in me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura asked the question. &nbsp;Yuren shook his head from side to side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t as if I trust you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As I said before, I trust Azell’s judgement. &nbsp;Moreover, I’m not someone that’ll go down easily even if you try to stab me in the back. &nbsp;Let’s just go for now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he spoke those words, Yuren extended his hand into the air. &nbsp;A marble made out of light rose up, and it exploded. &nbsp;A powerful wave of magical energy spread into the surrounding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This had the effect of breaking the magic spell that allowed their enemies to see in the night as if it was midday. &nbsp;The enemy magicians were pretty talented, but they were of no trouble to Yuren.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, then….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren winked towards Laura before he launched into the air. &nbsp;For a brief moment, Laura stared at his back. &nbsp;She mumbled absent-mindedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Trust….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She let out a small sigh as she launched herself into a different direction. &nbsp;She headed towards one of the magicians.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren had just broken his magic spell, so the enemy magician was flustered. &nbsp;When he caught sight of Laura, he was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Traitor Laura Aunsaurus!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The news of Laura’s betrayal had spread even to the rank and file members. &nbsp;It seemed specific information about her was spread too. &nbsp;If not, how could he recognize her in an instant when she was disguised as a human?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had expected this, but it still felt very weird. &nbsp;She had yet to earn trust from her new allies, yet the people, who couldn’t even look at her straight in the past, was glaring at her with hate in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura used her magic to prevent the magician from contacting the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unfortunately, I only want one thing from you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you talking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura unraveled her disguise spell, and she revealed herself as a Dragon Demon. &nbsp;Her tsunami-like Dragon Demon magic swept over the enemy magician.</span></p>
 <p><span style>4</span></p>
 <p><span style>A new wind picked up as it swirled around the site of the slaughter. &nbsp;An Orc had been dragging along a screaming woman by her hair. &nbsp;It stopped in surprise when a change suddenly occurred. &nbsp;It had been able to see its surrounding as if it was daylight, but now its sight had darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t as if it couldn’t see. &nbsp;Originally, Orcs were night creatures, so they saw better at night compared to humans. &nbsp;However, until a moment ago, it had been able to see everything clearly. &nbsp;The difference was so stark that it had a hard time discerning shapes for a brief moment. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pee-eet!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Orc heard a sound ring out. &nbsp;It was as if someone was plucking a string. &nbsp;In a flash, it flinched when it felt something tap against its neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-roohk……?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wanted to speak out in confusion, but its voice wouldn’t come out. &nbsp;It was because half of its neck had been severed. &nbsp;Soon, blood shot out from the wound, and it lost consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peet! Peet! Pee-bi-bi-beet!</span></p>
 <p><span style>An unseen opponent was slaughtering the Orcs. &nbsp;It was a phantom-like existence. &nbsp;This being was so fast in slicing through Orcs that it would have been hard to keep track of this being even in daylight. &nbsp;The Orcs didn’t even know what hit them. &nbsp;They were falling in droves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell didn't stay in one place. &nbsp;He continued to run as he used his senses to acquire targets. &nbsp;He cut down all his targets. &nbsp;He didn’t worry about saving and comforting each townspeople. &nbsp;He prioritized killing his enemies. &nbsp;&nbsp;Kairen was doing the same thing. &nbsp;It had been less than 2 minutes, yet the number of Orcs decreased in half.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell only stopped when he saw two old Spirit Order practitioners going up against one of the enemies. Azell dispersed his senses as he felt the fluctuation of magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Detection magic? There is a magician here.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s gaze moved upwards. &nbsp;There was a magician hidden at the back of the roof. &nbsp;He was using an invisibility spell. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the old men had already fallen from a sword strike from the enemy. &nbsp;The other old man was letting out a shout of grief when the enemy tried to cut him down too. &nbsp;However, the enemy suddenly turned around to face Azell. &nbsp;The magician using the detection magic must have notified the swordsman down below about Azell’s presence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kah-ahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After receiving Azell’s sword strike, the swordsman flew backwards before he landed on the ground. &nbsp;It seemed he was unable to completely disperse the power of Azell’s strike. &nbsp;He slid backwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>Their tactics are getting dirtier with each passing day</span><span style>.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke with a cold voice. &nbsp;The surviving old man was taken aback, so he asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W…who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll introduce myself at a later time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the swordsman caught sight of Azell responding to the old man, he became frightened. &nbsp;The swordsman, who had blocked Azell’s sword, spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you perhaps the person, who possesses the name steeped in sin? &nbsp;Why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the perspective of Dragon Demon king worshippers, Azell was already on the list of figures that should be avoided in a direct fight. &nbsp;Even high ranking officers were told to avoid him if there wasn’t a plan in place to deal with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It has been awhile since I’ve heard that really long and annoying title.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huhk?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The enemy swordsman was frightened. &nbsp;Azell was clearly walking towards him front the front, but his voice was heard from the swordsman’s back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he hadn’t taken his eyes off of Azell. &nbsp;Azell struck out with his sword as he tried to take advantage of his enemy’s surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zzuh-uhng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The enemy swordsman received Azell’s sword. &nbsp;&nbsp;A light exploded forth as the ground below the two combatants boiled like soup before it exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwah-gwah-gwah-gwah-gwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m guessing you aren’t part of the regular troops?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was surprised. &nbsp;From what he experience up until now, all the rank and file members of their troops had fallen for the voice that was heard from the back. &nbsp;They were all killed with a single strike.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this person had blocked Azell’s attack. &nbsp;His concentration had been disturbed, yet he was able to follow Azell’s movements. &nbsp;It was surprising.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why don’t you guys stop it with the lame disguises? &nbsp;Even if you are able to hide your Dragon Demon magic, your Dragon Arts can’t imitate Spirit Order, Dragon Majin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koohk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The enemy swordsman grinded his teeth. &nbsp;They had hidden their true skills as a ploy to disguise their identities. &nbsp;In truth, this mission was capable of being completed without using their full power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, they couldn’t afford to hold back now that Azell had appeared. &nbsp;From the information they possessed, they couldn’t win against this opponent even if they used all their power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ooooooooooooh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The disguised swordsman dispelled his disguise to show his true form. &nbsp;He was a young Dragon Majin male with dark red horns and red eyes. &nbsp;Dragon Demon magic swirled around him as he charged Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit! &nbsp;&nbsp;I won’t go down so easily!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As I thought, you aren’t part of the regular troops. &nbsp;Are you an officer, who came out from the Plain of Darkness?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell exchanged frantic sword strikes with him as he asked the question. &nbsp;He had gained a lot of information regarding the Plain of Darkness thanks to Laura, Yuren and Leticia. &nbsp;Aside from high ranking officers like Niberis and Laura, there were plenty of officers composed of Dragon Demons and Dragon Majins. &nbsp;A portion of this population had enough power to conduct the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Majin confronting Azell was very skilled. &nbsp;If one considered only physical capability, he was on par with Azell. &nbsp;He was also using techniques that were considered to be high level Dragon Art techniques. &nbsp;Moreover….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-bahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>From a completely different angle from the sword, a ball of light came towards Azell. &nbsp;He deflected it with his shoulder. &nbsp;An orb made out of light was floating around the Dragon Majin. &nbsp;It wasn’t something made out his Dragon Arts. &nbsp;It was a product of magic. &nbsp;The magician hidden atop the rooftop was supporting the Dragon Majin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They work well together.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was very hard to support a fighter using physically destructive magic especially when the person was fighting a close combat with swords. &nbsp;This meant their minds were connected as the Dragon Majin decided the timing and the location of the magic attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pa-pa-pa-pa-pah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Majin’s sword flew toward Azell from the front, and the orb of light formed by the magicians moved all over the place to attack with light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the magician used other magic spells in succession. &nbsp;He was attempting to use curses that affect one’s sight, hearing and perception. &nbsp;He even tried to move the earth to trap Azell’s feet. &nbsp;The magician was able to assist with the orb of light , while attacking with quick and accurate magic attack. &nbsp;The magician was very skilled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘These two are quite skilled.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Majin wasn’t as skilled as Duran, whom he had killed. &nbsp;However, he was skilled enough to defeat Arrieta and Seigar by himself. &nbsp;The magician also displayed much more skill than the magicians from the Dragon’s Shadow..</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pahhhhhhng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Light exploded from atop the roof. &nbsp;Azell furrowed his brows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Did information about me get passed around? &nbsp;Did they come up with how to cope with me or….?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t show any outward signs as he suddenly sent a dagger towards the magician. &nbsp;However, it was blocked. &nbsp;The fact that he was able to anticipate such an attack meant that there might be a Reaction type defensive barrier in use here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was a bit doubtful to think that the magician’s excellent skill enabled him to deal with Azell’s sudden attack. &nbsp;Maybe, they had a record of all the battles he had conducted with them, and they had analyzed the records. &nbsp;Did they make a manual on how to fight Azell?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Will you not answer my question?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will inform you when your soul, which is deeply steeped in sin, departs your lowly body.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is unfortunate. Doesn’t that mean I will never get to hear your answer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you really think so? &nbsp;Rumble beneath my dignity!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-uhhhhhhhhhh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he spoke the cantrip, an oppressive mental wave spread into the surrounding. &nbsp;It wasn’t limited to a mental wave. &nbsp;A shockwave with physical properties followed behind the mental wave. &nbsp;It shook the surrounding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koohk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an attack that couldn’t threaten Azell. &nbsp;However, the problem was the fact that Dillons was behind him. &nbsp;A regular person would die from the shockwave, so Azell had no choice to block the attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Majin used this opportunity to press his advantage. &nbsp;A sword strike surrounded by light fell towards Azell like a rain shower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pa-pa-pa-pa-pah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once he was put at a disadvantage, Azell struggled as he was pushed backwards. &nbsp;The problem faced by Azell wasn’t caused only by the attacks from the Dragon Majin. &nbsp;The orb of light was increasing in number, and it was driving him into a sticky situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t give you time to summon your Dragon weapon!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Azell was able to summon his Dragon weapon, the situation would be turned on its head in an instant. &nbsp;Since the two knew this, they planned on ending the fight by going all out with their attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was focused on defense, so his movements were becoming more restricted. &nbsp;Now that he was put on the defensive, he was busy keeping up his defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-paht! &nbsp;Pa-pa-pa-pa-pah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The falling light kept getting past the defense of his sword. &nbsp;As expected, the magic spells were the problem. &nbsp;The magician kept using a different spell each time, and his defense was disrupted when blocking the incoming spells.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the magician was sending his spell, he diligently increased the omnidirectional attack. &nbsp;The orbs of light supporting the Dragon Majin’s sword strikes had already reached 10 in number.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Majin’s eyes shone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Amazing defense! &nbsp;However, it is only a matter of time!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Majin, who was pushing against Azell’s defense, couldn’t hold back his shock. &nbsp;Azell was pushed up against the wall, yet he didn’t allow a single attack to scratch him. &nbsp;He blocked and deflected the sword strikes. &nbsp;He also trusted his armor’s defensive capability as he used the rounded parts of his armor to receive the attack at an angle to avoid damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he had a limit. &nbsp;At some point, Azell’s movement slipped…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>Too-ahhhhhhhhhng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A powerful shockwave swept over the Dragon Majin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What the hell?’</span></p>
