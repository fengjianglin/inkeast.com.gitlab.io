 <p>Chapter 186 - Two Persons (4)</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>6</p>
 <p>A silence descended between the two of them.</p>
 <p>“…….”</p>
 <p>Azell’s face hardened for a brief moment, but he patiently waited for Carlos to continue his story.</p>
 <p>Carlos read trust from Azell’s demeanor. &nbsp;No matter what, Azell’s trust in him didn’t waver. &nbsp;Even if they were to become adversaries, Azell would assume he had a good reason for his actions. &nbsp;Azell had absolute trust in him.</p>
 <p>‘Ah ah…….’</p>
 <p>The fact that he could enjoy the confidence of someone was moving.</p>
 <p>He had made the right choices. &nbsp;He had pursued this even at the expense of his body, and he hadn’t been wrong.</p>
 <p>Carlos regretted the fact that he could no longer shed tears.</p>
 <p>It had been a long time for him.</p>
 <p>The time exceeded the lifespan of a human. &nbsp;He armored himself with a firm conviction as he fought for the future.</p>
 <p>However, even if one possessed a strong conviction, humans were endlessly wavering creatures.</p>
 <p>Even a object from nature like the boulder became weathered over time. &nbsp;Humans were continuously changing creatures. &nbsp;How hard would it have been for a human to remain unchanging?</p>
 <p>It was the same for Carlos.</p>
 <p>Carlos hadn’t had anyone to support him through the fight he waged on his own. &nbsp;He felt endless regret, doubt and despair.</p>
 <p>&lt;Azell.&gt;</p>
 <p>Carlos regretted the fact that he could no longer put on a bright smile.</p>
 <p>&lt;The fact that I was able to meet you again…. &nbsp; I’ve been compensated for the pain I’ve felt up until now.&gt;</p>
 <p>He had hope.</p>
 <p>Even if his soul wore down from the despair, he felt….</p>
 <p>He believed there would come a day when someone would tell him that he had been right.</p>
 <p>However, those words couldn’t come from just anyone.</p>
 <p>It had to be spoken by one person, and he had used every method in his arsenal to give this person a life and a future. &nbsp;Carlos had waited for him. &nbsp;He wanted the reliable and strong person from his memories to show up one day. &nbsp;He had wanted to see this person laugh again.</p>
 <p>He had persevered in the darkness of despair, and at this moment, he had received his reward.</p>
 <p>Azell smirked.</p>
 <p>“Stop talking nonsense. &nbsp;It is the same problem now as in the old times. &nbsp;You pretend as if something is of great import to test the reaction of others. &nbsp;We’ve already exhausted every test we can pose each other.”</p>
 <p>&lt;It has been over 200 years, but it seems old habits die hard.&gt;</p>
 <p>Carlos cheerfully gave an explanation.</p>
 <p>&lt;As you probably know, I created the Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;However, it wasn’t created solely through my power.&gt;</p>
 <p>The Guardian Shadows were an amazing piece of magic. &nbsp;However, it was something that transcended magic.</p>
 <p>It used every person on this world as a surveillance net for the Dragon Demon king worshippers. &nbsp;Moreover, the Guardian Shadows were made up of members that died with an eternal enmity against the Dragon Demon king worshippers.</p>
 <p>&lt;At its foundation, the structure of the Guardian Shadows is similar to the Great Darkness. &nbsp;It’s because I made them using the Great Darkness..&gt;</p>
 <p>The Great Darkness used transcendent beings like Belrun as ‘pillars’.</p>
 <p>However, they weren’t the only ones that were present within the Great Darkness. &nbsp;There were other doomed souls that wished for eternal life. &nbsp;There was a large cluster of souls that made up the Great Darkness.</p>
 <p>&lt;Amongst these souls, some are able to manifest in this world as supernatural beings. &nbsp;Reygus and Almarick is an example.&gt;</p>
 <p>Their essence remained within the Great Darkness. &nbsp;That was why they were revived every time they were killed.</p>
 <p>If the body remains intact, they were revived back to their living state. &nbsp;If the body was destroyed, they were brought back as an Undead.</p>
 <p>&lt;The power of Belrun is the main engine that powers the revival. &nbsp;Aside from this ability, the power of many other beings were added to Atein’s technique. &nbsp;I became part of the Great Darkness, and I stole part of his power. &nbsp;I was able to create a technique that was independent from Atein.&gt;</p>
 <p>It was similar to Great Darkness within the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;Both Aincera and Almarick had access to the Great Darkness.</p>
 <p>Carlos had gone through a different process, so he wasn’t beholden to Atein. &nbsp;He was able to create the Guardian Shadows.</p>
 <p>&lt;Aside from the Keepers of Prophecy, the Guardian Shadows are immortals. &nbsp;They can’t be easily killed, and even if one is able to kill them, they are revived after time passes.&gt;</p>
 <p>“Is that why their numbers continue to grow even after fighting the Demon King worshippers over the years?”</p>
 <p>&lt;Yes. &nbsp;For example, there are over 3,000 Guardian Shadows gathered outside of this mountain. &nbsp;There are many more Guardian Shadows that are spread across the continent, and they are thwarting the plans of the Dragon Demon king worshippers. &nbsp;&gt;</p>
 <p>“If there are 3,000, that is almost the amount that assembled last time. &nbsp;Are you saying you can bring more of them here?”</p>
 <p>&lt;It means that there are that many beings, who hold a grudge against the Demon King worshippers. &nbsp;I’ve gathered such numbers even though I started the Guardian Shadow technique less than a hundred years ago.&gt;</p>
 <p>Carlos let out a bleak laughter. &nbsp;The number of Guardian Shadows was directly correlated to the number of wicked deeds carried out by the Dragon Demon king worshippers.</p>
 <p>&lt;Why do you think the Keepers of the Prophecy weren’t immortals like the Guardian Shadows?&gt;</p>
 <p>“It’s because you wanted to deliver the Dragon weapons and Dragon Demon magic to me. &nbsp;Why did you use that particular method?”</p>
 <p>Azell had given all his Dragon weapons to Carlos before he went to sleep. &nbsp;Why had he chosen to use the Keepers of the Prophecy to bring the weapons into this era?</p>
 <p>&lt;They were needed. &nbsp;I was able to preserve the Sky Splitter by connecting it to you. &nbsp;I couldn’t do that with the other Dragon weapons.&gt;</p>
 <p>“Why didn’t you give it to others…….”</p>
 <p>&lt;It was my selfishness. &nbsp;I wanted to give it all back to you when you returned. &nbsp;If you look at the result, I think I made the right choice.&gt;</p>
 <p>He was right. &nbsp;If Carlos had given Azell’s Dragon weapons to other people, the Dragon Demon king worshippers would have made sure to destroy them.</p>
 <p>&lt;Also, it isn’t as if I tried to preserve all of them. &nbsp;I passed on two Dragon weapons.&gt;</p>
 <p>He had given one to Azell’s adopted child, who took over the County of Karzark after Azell. &nbsp;The other one was given to the country’s most promising hero.</p>
 <p>Hower, they weren’t able to pass on their weapon.</p>
 <p>&lt;Then there’s the one….. &nbsp;I blew it.&gt;</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>&lt;I’ll tell you about it a little bit later.&gt;</p>
 <p>Azell was taken aback, but Carlos waved his hand to calm him.</p>
 <p>Carlos’ explanation left much to be desired. &nbsp;However, Azell had seen the exception to what he was describing.</p>
 <p>“Weren’t the Dragon weapons of the Dragon Demon generals preserved in the Great Darkness?”</p>
 <p>&lt;I tried to do the same thing. &nbsp;However, I wasn’t able to perfect it like Atein. &nbsp;I couldn’t find a solution that dealt with the wear and tear that accumulated over time. &nbsp;In the end, I needed living vessels, so I created the Keepers of Prophecy out of need.&gt;</p>
 <p>“I see…….”</p>
 <p>&lt;I am part of the Great Darkness, but that doesn’t mean I’m capable of doing everything Atein is capable of doing. &nbsp;The other side can’t create the Guardian Shadows like me. &nbsp;I’m able to copy certain things created by Atein, but there are also things I cannot copy. &nbsp;Did you see Reygus? &nbsp;He’s only an Undead, yet he was able to use his Dragon weapon. &nbsp;On top of that, he’s able to temporarily use his Dragon Demon magic.&gt;</p>
 <p>“Ah. &nbsp;That was jaw dropping.”</p>
 <p>&lt;It is possible, because Reygus and the Soul Hammer resides within the Great Darkness. &nbsp;I decided to impart the Dragon weapons and Dragon Demon magic to the Keepers of Prophecy, and I kept them from aging.&gt;</p>
 <p>“It seems I owe a lot to my descendants.”</p>
 <p>Azell let out a bitter laughter.</p>
 <p>It didn’t matter what an amazing feat of magic the Keepers of Prophecy were. &nbsp;He could only express his respects towards the Keepers of Prophecy, and he would continue their will.</p>
 <p>Carlos looked into the empty air as he spoke.</p>
 <p>&lt;I did them wrong, but there was no other choice. &nbsp;There was no choice left for them and me…...&gt;</p>
 <p>“I didn’t say those words, because I blame you.”</p>
 <p>&lt;I know.&gt;</p>
 <p>Carlos sneered at himself as he continued to speak.</p>
 <p>&lt;I was able to take over part of the Great Darkness, and it was the foothold needed for me to create the Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;Instead of giving the Keepers of Prophecy immortality, I imbued them with special powers.&gt;</p>
 <p>Alpha was able to suppress Undead power using his gaze. &nbsp;This was possible, because he had imbued part of Belrun’s power to Alpha.</p>
 <p>Omega was able to peek into the Great Darkness that was under the control of Aincera. &nbsp;This was possible, because their essence were within the Great Darkness.</p>
 <p>&lt;…if Atein was alive, this would have been impossible. &nbsp;He would have recognized my presence, and he would have acted accordingly to counter my actions. &nbsp;However, Aincera and Almarick received only a limited power over the Great Darkness. &nbsp;They are merely custodians.&gt;</p>
 <p>Aincera was limited to keeping the system created by Atein rolling. &nbsp;Just doing this had caused her sense of self to erode.</p>
 <p>“You were the one that stopped Aunsaurus and Baldazark from being revived?”</p>
 <p>&lt;That’s right. &nbsp;As I’ve explained to you before…. &nbsp; This was one of the advantages I gained from joining the Great Darkness.&gt;</p>
 <p>The four Dragon Demon generals had become part of the Great Darkness.</p>
 <p>However, only Reygus and Almarick had been revived. &nbsp;Aunsaurus and Baldazark had met their true death. &nbsp;This was a feat accomplished by Carlos from within the Great Darkness.</p>
 <p>&lt;So the fact that they were killed instead Reygus and Almarick wasn’t a coincidence?&gt;</p>
 <p>“I chose that outcome. &nbsp;As always, I aim for the optimal result..”</p>
 <p>&lt;Yes. &nbsp;In truth, I could have buried either Almarick and Reygus if I had chosen to do so. &nbsp;I could have theoretically eliminated three Dragon Demon generals, but I chose not to.&gt;</p>
 <p>He could bury two for certain. &nbsp;Carlos chose certainty in his fight. &nbsp;He picked Aunsaurus and Baldazark.</p>
 <p>They were magicians. &nbsp;In terms of battle capabilities, they were Archmages that rivaled Atein.</p>
 <p>“If they were revived, they would have been able to manage the Great Darkness better. &nbsp;Is that the reason why they were chosen?”</p>
 <p>&lt;That’s correct.&gt;</p>
 <p>If Aunsaurus and Baldazark were present, Carlos might not have been able to make the Guardian Shadows.</p>
 <p>Carlos changed the topic.</p>
 <p>&lt;Azell. &nbsp;You talked to my thought construct before, right? &nbsp;After you went to sleep, the world faced two threats.&gt;</p>
 <p>“I did.”</p>
 <p>Carlos’ thought construct had told him this. &nbsp;Absolute calamities that threatened the entire humanity had appeared, and the death of Atein had released them onto this world.</p>
 <p>“In the context of our previous conversation, this being had been sealed within the Great Darkness?”</p>
 <p>&lt;Yes.&gt;</p>
 <p>“You became like this in the process of blocking them.”</p>
 <p>&lt;Correct.&gt;</p>
 <p>Carlos shrugged his shoulders as he gave an explanation.</p>
 <p>&lt;You might not be too interested in this, but it is important for me to explain what kind of being she was.&gt;</p>
 <p>“The second calamity….. &nbsp; I think I know what it is even if you don’t tell me.”</p>
 <p>&lt;Let’s talk about the first one for now. &nbsp;Our comrades that survived the Dragon Demon war fought against the first being that was unsealed…… &nbsp; We joined forces with the younger generation to stop her. &nbsp;This incident spurred me to research the dangers of the Great Darkness.&gt;</p>
 <p>“Which being was it?”</p>
 <p>&lt;She was the first to create the Dragon weapon. &nbsp;Her name was Iksseru.&gt;</p>
 <p>Azell’s eyes widened in surprise.</p>
 <p>&lt;I heard from Albatan at a later date that she was from the era of the Five Star Kingdom. &nbsp;I believe she was a descendant of Atein.&gt;</p>
 <p>“I heard about her. &nbsp;She’s a female Dragon Demon?”</p>
 <p>&lt;It seems the old man have already told you that story.&gt;</p>
 <p>“It was in passing. &nbsp;He didn’t put much importance on the story.”</p>
 <p>Azell grumbled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It would have been better if Albatan had told him this story earlier.</p>
 <p>Carlos cackled as he spoke.</p>
 <p>&lt;She was… That’s right. &nbsp;She wasn’t a magician. &nbsp;She was a Dragon Arts practitioner. &nbsp;She created the first Dragon weapon, and it allowed her to realize a desire she shouldn’t have had.&gt;</p>
 <p>“What kind of desire?”</p>
