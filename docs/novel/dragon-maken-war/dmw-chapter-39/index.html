  <p><span style>Chapter 39 - When I Met Someone Who Was Dead (4)</span></p>
  <p></p>
  <hr>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>4</span></p>
  <p><span style>When Niberis saw the corrupted being and her underlings running towards Azell, she turned her back on him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Well, now…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Pah-ji-ji- jeeek!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta swung her sword down towards her. A barrier formed automatically, and blue sparks flew as it clashed with the white sword. Arrieta didn’t hesitate to charge her when she had judged Niberis had put her guard down.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Oh Evil Darkness, Rend Apart!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta had used the repelling force to retreat as she swung her sword. Then a sword made out of light struck towards Niberis.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Niberis didn’t show any signs of nervousness. As if she was on a leisurely stroll, she walked across the air then she slightly shook her hand. This resulted in Arrieta’s sword of light sliding off of her barrier, and it collapsed in the air.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta was taken aback.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘She was able to slip my attack so easily!’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis’ attack followed afterwards. Arrow made out of light formed in mid-air, and it was shot towards Arrieta in a dizzying manner.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Sacred Valor bless this sword!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>With a shout, a barrier formed and it blocked the light. However, a sound of an explosion was heard from behind.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kwang! Kwa-gahng!</span></p>
  <p><span style>The projectiles exploded, and it blew Arrieta away. Arrieta was thrown towards the ground, and she was barely able to turn her body to kick the ground. She looked like a skipping stone as she kicked, rotated, kicked again and so on. Niberis smiled as she looked at her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hoo-hoot. You are a princess of a country, but you are floundering about like a street performer.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>At the same time, she lightly shook her hand. This caused two sphere of light to form, and it head towards another direction.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kwah-ahh-ahhng!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Kook….!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Boar let out a moan as he blocked with his shield. This was an attack aimed at the other party member, who were separated from Arrieta.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“My workload is too much for me to deal with bugs like you.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What did you say?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Boar became angry.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis no longer looked towards him. Instead, the remaining monsters rushed towards him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Sir Giles!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I already know!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The two knights stood up as they looked at each other.</span></p>
  <p><span style>During all of this, Enora had been shaking in terror.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Boar assessed his surrounding as he spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Don’t worry, Ms Enora! Not even a single hair of yours will be hurt as long as I’m around!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You stole what I wanted to say. Let’s quickly get rid of these filthy bastards then we can help the princess!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles also spoke in a noble manner. However, several dozen monsters ran towards them.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“There are a lot of them!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles’ sword energy was swung towards the approaching enemies like a gale. The sword energy was fast yet delicate. It cut down the unruly monsters one by one.</span></p>
  <p><span style>There were most definitely a lot of enemies. Most of them were larger and sturdier than humans.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, the Spirit Order practitioners who had reached the level of Quadruple master were super humans.</span></p>
  <p><span style>They could cow them with their mental wave, and they used an electric-like attack to take the monster’s lives. They put fear into the monsters.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Confusion and hesitation started to spread within the ranks of the monsters. Giles had faced large numbers of monsters in the Balan Forest, so he was used to facing off against such opponents.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Boar also wasn’t outdone by Giles.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hoong! Dirty bastards! I guess you are desperate to dirty my shield with your blood!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Boar had a shield, so the way he faced off against the monsters were entirely different from Giles.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Too-hahk!</span></p>
  <p><span style>A group of orcs were running toward him. Boar smashed the lead orc with his shield, and it flew into the air. It looked like it was hit by a running horse. The orc’s muscular body was much bigger than a human, but it flew several meters into the air. It flew over the head of the monsters.</span></p>
  <p><span style>While the monsters were frozen watching the orc fly, Boar stabbed his sword over his shield. Another monster’s throat was pierced like meat being skewered, and it fell to the floor.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The flustered monsters ran towards Boar in unison, and they swung their weapons. Three of them ran in at Boar.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Boar glared with his eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ha-ahhhhhhh!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Instead of yelling like a person, he roared out a bestial cry. It was similar to what Azell had used. It was a roar containing a domineering mental wave.</span></p>
  <p><span style>In a flash, the monsters’ movements slowed. As he blocked the discouraged enemies’ attack with his shield, Boar stomped with all his might.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Booom!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Accompanying a heavy thud, the ground started to shake. The weapons swung by the monsters were deflected with great force, and the owners of the weapons fell to the floor.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ha-ah!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Boar quickly ran in, and he cut them down with his sword. Then he returned to guard his original position.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles and Boar look at each other with sidelong glances after they killed a batch of enemies.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The two of them didn’t get along. From the start of the trip, Boar treated Giles like a country knight, and Boar had ignored him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>They got on each other’s nerves at every step, and they had fought each other for the leadership role.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After Boar was annihilated by Azell, his attitude had changed. However, the relationship between Giles and Boar was still uncomfortable. Both of young knights were chosen as representative for their respective group, so this situation was inevitable.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Sir Giles. How about we compete to see who could take down the most opponents?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ll take you up on that..”</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, at that moment, the two of them agreed on something. They had to protect Enora, and they had to help Arrieta. This was why they didn’t hesitate to fight with their backs against each other. Even though their movements were restricted from being surrounded by several dozen monsters, the two knights were in a difficult ordeal where they had to defeat all the monsters.</span></p>
  <p><span style>5</span></p>
  <p><span style>Currently, everything was going as the Dragon’s Shadow had intended.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Their target was Arrieta. She had been separated from Azell, who they were wary of, and the 3 others. If one discounted Azell, the several dozen monsters were surrounding Giles, Boar and Enora. They were in a significant danger.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Arrieta couldn’t help them. Niberis was walking towards her emitting an oppressive magical energy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Well, we’ve finally broken free from the disrupters…. Dragon Princess. We share the same blood, so I will show you some mercy. I have a proposal for you.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“A proposal?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If you obediently follow us, I’ll spare your underling’s lives..”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m telling you to surrender. It’s obvious what the result will be, so let’s not tire each other out.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Bullshit!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta kicked off the ground. She accelerated using her instantaneous movement, and in a flash, she had arrived at Niberis’ back. Then she didn’t hesitate to attack!</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Niberis was gone. Arrieta was surprised when she felt herself strike empty air.</span></p>
  <p><span style>From her side, she heard Niberis’ languid voice.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“All those who wield swords are uniformly simple.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Illusion?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis had predicted what Arrieta would do, so she had used set up an illusion. Niberis’ skill in magic was too fast and complex. Arrieta didn’t even realize what she had done.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Boom!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta was struck by lightning, and she was sent flying. Arrieta was barely able to right her body and land on the ground. Niberis spoke as she looked at her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“This is the second time. The rumors said you are intelligent. So isn’t it about time you realize your place?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Kook……!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Well, it’s ok. If you want to be stubborn, I’ll break that stubborness. I’ll make realize the reality of your situation.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>When Niberis said, ‘This is the second time.’, it was the number of times Niberis could have taken Arrieta’s life. She aimed to capture Arrieta alive, so even though she had the chance to deal a critical blow, she had refrained.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta shouted.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Don’t look down on me! You of the Dragon Demon race! Light of the Ferocious Beast that Burns away the Darkness, Roar!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>An orange flame climbed up the white blade. Unlike a normal flame, it wasn’t emitting a lot of heat. However, this was a magical flame with a massive amount of destructive force dormant within its magical flame.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Go!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>When she swung her sword, the fire elongated like a whip, and it struck against Niberis.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This wasn’t a one-off move. Arrieta breathed in, then she let out a couple dozen malleable sword energy. It created a dizzying white trace across the empty air, and it hit Niberis.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Hwahhhhhhk!</span></p>
  <p><span style>The flame exploded on impact. From where the attack ignited to behind several dozen meter, explosive flames spread out in a fan shape.</span></p>
  <p><span style>She proved that her reputation as the Dragon Demon princess wasn’t false. She displayed a devastating power. It was an attack capable of killing dozens of enemy in a flash. However, Arrieta wasn’t done yet. She brought her sword down as she ran.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Oh fire dragon. Let out your anger!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The orange flames surrounding the sword started to emit heat, and it changed into a real flame. Arrieta’s fierce sword strike was able to split even a castle wall.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…aren’t you satisfied after squirming this much?</span></p>
  <p><span style>In the next moment, a languid voice entered into Arrieta’s ear.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Boom!</span></p>
  <p><span style>At the same time, Arrieta was struck from the side with no warning. Arrieta couldn’t even scream as she was thrown to the ground.</span></p>
  <p><span style>In front of her, Niberis was walking out of the fiercely burning magical flame. Not even a single hair was damaged.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After rolling several times on the ground, Arrieta gritted her teeth as she got up.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I guess it was another illusion.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis was walking from a location entirely different from where Arrieta had predicted. This time she had been prepared for Niberis to use her illusion magic. However, she had still been completely fooled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Pitiful.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis words held pity within it. However, the voice didn’t come out of the Niberis walking out from the flame.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Multiple illusion?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta’s eyes widened.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis was walking towards her from all direction. There were a total of 7 Niberis, and all of them looked like the real body.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Moreover, there was a strong magical wave that was interfering with Arrieta’s senses. Even if she tried to sense Niberis’ life energy, she couldn’t’ tell which one was the real one.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If you come obediently, then everything will be easier.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>As if her words were a spell, consecutive lighting strikes exploded forth. The lightning strikes exploded as it ripped through the darkness. Arrieta mindlessly ran away.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I can’t read the signs!’</span></p>
  <p><span style>When a warrior fights against a magician, the warrior reads the flow of the magical energy. Once the warrior sees the sign that magic is being used, one could react to the magic. Even if one couldn’t tell what kind of magic it was, one could still block it if one knew when the magic was coming.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Niberis didn’t have a tell in her magic. It seemed like she wasn’t doing anything when the lighting struck.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘This basically means… That woman is just playing with me.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>One after another she was hit with lightning that was powerful enough to instantly kill a normal person. However, Niberis was just flicking her finger as if she was barely putting her strength into the attack. Even if one possessed powerful magical strength, one still needed an effective techniques to use. She hadn’t even gathered her power in one place to amplify her magic. She had omitted steps yet she was able to produce this much power.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Your defense is pretty admirable. I heard you were taught by the Dragon Demon Duke. It seems he taught you well.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You know my teacher?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ve never personally seen him. However, I’ve heard about his reputation enough times to make my ears bleed. Now that I see his student I could tell your teacher has great skill.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis genuinely gave a compliment to Arrieta’s skills.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Of course, this was a judgement made by a person who was in a much superior position. It was like saying, ‘She’s better than I thought?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis continued to use lightning to incapacitate Arrieta. Normally, even if you block the lightning itself, the clap of the thunder damages ones eardrum. It’ll be impossible for the person to move properly. afterward</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta had been worried about this, so she had used her Dragon energy to protect her eardrums from the beginning. Even if the lightning didn’t incapacitate her, a single damaged eardrum would make her lose her fighting capability.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I can’t win against this enemy with just my strength.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta coldly calculated her chances.</span></p>

 <p><span style>Chapter 39 - When I Met Someone Who Was Dead (4)</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>4</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Niberis saw the corrupted being and her underlings running towards Azell, she turned her back on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, now…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-ji-ji- jeeek!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta swung her sword down towards her. A barrier formed automatically, and blue sparks flew as it clashed with the white sword. Arrieta didn’t hesitate to charge her when she had judged Niberis had put her guard down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh Evil Darkness, Rend Apart!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta had used the repelling force to retreat as she swung her sword. Then a sword made out of light struck towards Niberis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Niberis didn’t show any signs of nervousness. As if she was on a leisurely stroll, she walked across the air then she slightly shook her hand. This resulted in Arrieta’s sword of light sliding off of her barrier, and it collapsed in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘She was able to slip my attack so easily!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis’ attack followed afterwards. Arrow made out of light formed in mid-air, and it was shot towards Arrieta in a dizzying manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sacred Valor bless this sword!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a shout, a barrier formed and it blocked the light. However, a sound of an explosion was heard from behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwang! Kwa-gahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The projectiles exploded, and it blew Arrieta away. Arrieta was thrown towards the ground, and she was barely able to turn her body to kick the ground. She looked like a skipping stone as she kicked, rotated, kicked again and so on. Niberis smiled as she looked at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoo-hoot. You are a princess of a country, but you are floundering about like a street performer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, she lightly shook her hand. This caused two sphere of light to form, and it head towards another direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwah-ahh-ahhng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kook….!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boar let out a moan as he blocked with his shield. This was an attack aimed at the other party member, who were separated from Arrieta.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My workload is too much for me to deal with bugs like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boar became angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis no longer looked towards him. Instead, the remaining monsters rushed towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir Giles!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I already know!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two knights stood up as they looked at each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During all of this, Enora had been shaking in terror.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boar assessed his surrounding as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, Ms Enora! Not even a single hair of yours will be hurt as long as I’m around!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You stole what I wanted to say. Let’s quickly get rid of these filthy bastards then we can help the princess!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles also spoke in a noble manner. However, several dozen monsters ran towards them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are a lot of them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles’ sword energy was swung towards the approaching enemies like a gale. The sword energy was fast yet delicate. It cut down the unruly monsters one by one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were most definitely a lot of enemies. Most of them were larger and sturdier than humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the Spirit Order practitioners who had reached the level of Quadruple master were super humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They could cow them with their mental wave, and they used an electric-like attack to take the monster’s lives. They put fear into the monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Confusion and hesitation started to spread within the ranks of the monsters. Giles had faced large numbers of monsters in the Balan Forest, so he was used to facing off against such opponents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boar also wasn’t outdone by Giles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoong! Dirty bastards! I guess you are desperate to dirty my shield with your blood!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boar had a shield, so the way he faced off against the monsters were entirely different from Giles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Too-hahk!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A group of orcs were running toward him. Boar smashed the lead orc with his shield, and it flew into the air. It looked like it was hit by a running horse. The orc’s muscular body was much bigger than a human, but it flew several meters into the air. It flew over the head of the monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the monsters were frozen watching the orc fly, Boar stabbed his sword over his shield. Another monster’s throat was pierced like meat being skewered, and it fell to the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The flustered monsters ran towards Boar in unison, and they swung their weapons. Three of them ran in at Boar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boar glared with his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha-ahhhhhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instead of yelling like a person, he roared out a bestial cry. It was similar to what Azell had used. It was a roar containing a domineering mental wave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a flash, the monsters’ movements slowed. As he blocked the discouraged enemies’ attack with his shield, Boar stomped with all his might.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Booom!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Accompanying a heavy thud, the ground started to shake. The weapons swung by the monsters were deflected with great force, and the owners of the weapons fell to the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha-ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boar quickly ran in, and he cut them down with his sword. Then he returned to guard his original position.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles and Boar look at each other with sidelong glances after they killed a batch of enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them didn’t get along. From the start of the trip, Boar treated Giles like a country knight, and Boar had ignored him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They got on each other’s nerves at every step, and they had fought each other for the leadership role.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Boar was annihilated by Azell, his attitude had changed. However, the relationship between Giles and Boar was still uncomfortable. Both of young knights were chosen as representative for their respective group, so this situation was inevitable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir Giles. How about we compete to see who could take down the most opponents?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll take you up on that..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, at that moment, the two of them agreed on something. They had to protect Enora, and they had to help Arrieta. This was why they didn’t hesitate to fight with their backs against each other. Even though their movements were restricted from being surrounded by several dozen monsters, the two knights were in a difficult ordeal where they had to defeat all the monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>5</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, everything was going as the Dragon’s Shadow had intended.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their target was Arrieta. She had been separated from Azell, who they were wary of, and the 3 others. If one discounted Azell, the several dozen monsters were surrounding Giles, Boar and Enora. They were in a significant danger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Arrieta couldn’t help them. Niberis was walking towards her emitting an oppressive magical energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, we’ve finally broken free from the disrupters…. Dragon Princess. We share the same blood, so I will show you some mercy. I have a proposal for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A proposal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you obediently follow us, I’ll spare your underling’s lives..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m telling you to surrender. It’s obvious what the result will be, so let’s not tire each other out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bullshit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta kicked off the ground. She accelerated using her instantaneous movement, and in a flash, she had arrived at Niberis’ back. Then she didn’t hesitate to attack!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Niberis was gone. Arrieta was surprised when she felt herself strike empty air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From her side, she heard Niberis’ languid voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All those who wield swords are uniformly simple.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Illusion?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis had predicted what Arrieta would do, so she had used set up an illusion. Niberis’ skill in magic was too fast and complex. Arrieta didn’t even realize what she had done.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta was struck by lightning, and she was sent flying. Arrieta was barely able to right her body and land on the ground. Niberis spoke as she looked at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the second time. The rumors said you are intelligent. So isn’t it about time you realize your place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kook……!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, it’s ok. If you want to be stubborn, I’ll break that stubborness. I’ll make realize the reality of your situation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Niberis said, ‘This is the second time.’, it was the number of times Niberis could have taken Arrieta’s life. She aimed to capture Arrieta alive, so even though she had the chance to deal a critical blow, she had refrained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t look down on me! You of the Dragon Demon race! Light of the Ferocious Beast that Burns away the Darkness, Roar!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An orange flame climbed up the white blade. Unlike a normal flame, it wasn’t emitting a lot of heat. However, this was a magical flame with a massive amount of destructive force dormant within its magical flame.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she swung her sword, the fire elongated like a whip, and it struck against Niberis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This wasn’t a one-off move. Arrieta breathed in, then she let out a couple dozen malleable sword energy. It created a dizzying white trace across the empty air, and it hit Niberis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hwahhhhhhk!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The flame exploded on impact. From where the attack ignited to behind several dozen meter, explosive flames spread out in a fan shape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She proved that her reputation as the Dragon Demon princess wasn’t false. She displayed a devastating power. It was an attack capable of killing dozens of enemy in a flash. However, Arrieta wasn’t done yet. She brought her sword down as she ran.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh fire dragon. Let out your anger!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The orange flames surrounding the sword started to emit heat, and it changed into a real flame. Arrieta’s fierce sword strike was able to split even a castle wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…aren’t you satisfied after squirming this much?</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next moment, a languid voice entered into Arrieta’s ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Arrieta was struck from the side with no warning. Arrieta couldn’t even scream as she was thrown to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front of her, Niberis was walking out of the fiercely burning magical flame. Not even a single hair was damaged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After rolling several times on the ground, Arrieta gritted her teeth as she got up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I guess it was another illusion.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis was walking from a location entirely different from where Arrieta had predicted. This time she had been prepared for Niberis to use her illusion magic. However, she had still been completely fooled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pitiful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis words held pity within it. However, the voice didn’t come out of the Niberis walking out from the flame.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Multiple illusion?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta’s eyes widened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis was walking towards her from all direction. There were a total of 7 Niberis, and all of them looked like the real body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, there was a strong magical wave that was interfering with Arrieta’s senses. Even if she tried to sense Niberis’ life energy, she couldn’t’ tell which one was the real one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you come obediently, then everything will be easier.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if her words were a spell, consecutive lighting strikes exploded forth. The lightning strikes exploded as it ripped through the darkness. Arrieta mindlessly ran away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can’t read the signs!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>When a warrior fights against a magician, the warrior reads the flow of the magical energy. Once the warrior sees the sign that magic is being used, one could react to the magic. Even if one couldn’t tell what kind of magic it was, one could still block it if one knew when the magic was coming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Niberis didn’t have a tell in her magic. It seemed like she wasn’t doing anything when the lighting struck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This basically means… That woman is just playing with me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>One after another she was hit with lightning that was powerful enough to instantly kill a normal person. However, Niberis was just flicking her finger as if she was barely putting her strength into the attack. Even if one possessed powerful magical strength, one still needed an effective techniques to use. She hadn’t even gathered her power in one place to amplify her magic. She had omitted steps yet she was able to produce this much power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your defense is pretty admirable. I heard you were taught by the Dragon Demon Duke. It seems he taught you well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know my teacher?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve never personally seen him. However, I’ve heard about his reputation enough times to make my ears bleed. Now that I see his student I could tell your teacher has great skill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis genuinely gave a compliment to Arrieta’s skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, this was a judgement made by a person who was in a much superior position. It was like saying, ‘She’s better than I thought?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis continued to use lightning to incapacitate Arrieta. Normally, even if you block the lightning itself, the clap of the thunder damages ones eardrum. It’ll be impossible for the person to move properly. afterward</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta had been worried about this, so she had used her Dragon energy to protect her eardrums from the beginning. Even if the lightning didn’t incapacitate her, a single damaged eardrum would make her lose her fighting capability.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can’t win against this enemy with just my strength.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta coldly calculated her chances.</span></p>
