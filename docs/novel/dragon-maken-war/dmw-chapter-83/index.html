 <p>Chapter 83 - The Scar Left on the World (3)</p>
 <p><span style>While Azell was conducting the Dragon Slayer's Ritual, Kairen chased after Laura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was chasing after her by himself, and he lost her trail when she hid herself inside Vitan's Maze. &nbsp;Fortunately, the Guardian Shadows were able to pick up on her whereabouts again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then…….</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Hmm. Legendary runt. I used my artistic sense to decorate your eyes, but now it is back to its mundane appearance.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I neatly cleansed your ugly looking Skeleton, yet it seems it has become dirty again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen growled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The one making the sarcastic remarks as soon as it saw Kairen was the Dragon Demon Undead named Delta. &nbsp;It was allied with the Keepers of Prophecy. &nbsp;Its skull was crushed in the fight against Kairen, but it arrived to battle Laura after it had recovered its original appearance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;We don't have the luxury to unnecessarily squabble over our feelings.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The one to speak in such an annoyed tone was the Undead Magician Theta. &nbsp;Kairen grumbled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, Skeleton Magician. Can't you tell me if I'm in a nightmare or not? &nbsp;Then maybe I'll have some impetuous to be more thankful towards you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You should try biting your tongue to see if you are of right mind. You are fighting in a united front with the dirty Undeads. &nbsp;That is an undeniable reality.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You've lived for a pretty long time, yet you haven't experienced this before. &nbsp;You should be more accepting of these new emotions. &nbsp;It is best to have a flexible mind in regards to this arrangement.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are an annoying bastard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;What a very unoriginal assessment.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>From Kairen's perspective, he was really annoyed, but he couldn't deny the fact that Delta and Theta were reliable allies. &nbsp;This was especially true of Theta. If it wasn't for Theta's magic, he would have already lost Laura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys are really persistent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura let out a sigh. She was clearly vexed by all of this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, one could feel a sense of danger coming from within her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I never expected him to attempt the Dragon Slayer's Ritual.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had planned on escaping, while letting the Thunder Dragon deal with most of her pursuers. &nbsp;However, her plan had gone awry. &nbsp;This was especially true in regards to Azell. &nbsp;He had occupied the Thunder Dragon by using the Dragon Slayer's ritual. &nbsp;This possibility was completely outside of her calculations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, did he really have the requisite power to face off against it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Kairen had arrived, Theta, Delta and several other Guardian Shadows had surrounded her, and they sent fierce attacks towards her. &nbsp;She hadn't been able to travel very far when Kairen suddenly appeared. &nbsp;He had sent an attack towards her without a moment's notice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwah-kwah-kwah-kwah-kwah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything looked as if it was burning bright. &nbsp;Afterwards, Kairen struck atop her barrier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The barrier shook violently. Kairen's attack was so fierce that it made her blood run cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘As it stands now, I'll be in danger.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had been completely wrong in her calculations. &nbsp;There were too many strong enemies for her to fight and defeat them. &nbsp;She was well-informed of these beings. &nbsp;Aside from Kairen, these two Undeads were beings that had been killed in a fight with Laura's predecessor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Basically, they were Laura's sworn enemies, but it didn't rise to a threshold where she held a bitter resentment against them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the first place, Laura didn't hold any affection towards the previous heir of Aunsaurus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘During that fight, all the members of this organization hadn't gathered in a single location... Moreover, the Dragon Sword Duke is also formidable.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she was having these thoughts, she was exchanging attacks in the fierce battle. &nbsp;Laura was using all kinds of magic in an attempt to escape this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the encirclement by her enemies was too sturdy. About half of her magic was being offset by Theta. &nbsp;While the Guardian Shadows annoyed her by attempting to slow her down, Kairen and Delta rushed in close to hit her with terrifying sword strikes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What should I do?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn't as if she didn't have any methods that'll allow her to escape from this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She just had to withdraw the Vitan's Maze being used to imprison Seigar. &nbsp;She had to turn the full ability of the Vitan's Chalice towards her enemies. &nbsp;However, that would cause her to fail her mission.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I don't want that to happen…….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her head knew which choice was sensible. &nbsp;If one considered the merits she had accrued until now, a single failure wouldn't cause too much harm to her. &nbsp;Wasn’t this something even her rival, Niberis, had failed?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I do fail, I’ll be fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura mumbled to herself as if she was convincing herself. &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;It'll be alright if she failed. &nbsp;The right move was to concede Segiar to them, so she could get out of here safely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there was a stuffy feeling at the corner of her chest as if there was an obstruction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It won't be too late to give them a name after we sort them out.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she was young, she didn't know much about the world, and she hadn't received her name of Laura yet. &nbsp;She remembered the adults speaking as they coldly looked down at her. Their eyes had looked at her as if they were judging the worth of an item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Only those who don't fail will be given a name. &nbsp;We don't need failures.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She always heard a variation of those words. &nbsp;Laura had once been pitted against the children for the seat of being an heir. &nbsp;Those who failed were weeded out through natural selection. &nbsp;They only wanted the children, who achieved results. &nbsp;Only these select children were given names.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The children, who were weeded out, disappeared from this world. The children were tools that would be used to achieve their earnest wish. &nbsp;This was why many children were 'produced', and only those that met the requirements were left alive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-oohk……!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the first time there was a change to Laura's expressionless face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She made a sensible and cool judgement. &nbsp;She decided to give up on this mission. &nbsp;Her well-being had to be prioritized. &nbsp;This was suppose to be a simple decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, a wound had been engraved into her mind starting from her childhood, and it was getting in the way of her making this simple choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwah-ha-ha-haht!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her barrier was cut open. &nbsp;While her concentration was faltering, Delta and Kairen used the opportunity to focus their attacks on a single point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kyahhhhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura let out a scream. &nbsp;Her sturdy barrier was broken, and her long dress was torn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are having idle thoughts during a battle. &nbsp;You must be overflowing with confidence, Miss!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the perfect opportunity. &nbsp;Laura had been flung away. &nbsp;Kairen stormed in front of her, and he unhesitatingly brought his sword down. &nbsp;This would be the end for her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a light exploded in front of his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen was shocked. &nbsp;The light hadn't caused him any harm. His vision was momentarily obstructed, but he didn't suffer any physical damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he didn't feel anything at the end of his sword. &nbsp;He capitalized on the perfect opportunity, yet his sword had swung down on empty air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha-ahhhhh…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura was letting out a deep sigh in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Kairen couldn't believe his eyes. &nbsp;The light had ignited in front of him, but he had closed his eyes instantly. &nbsp;He hadn't been blinded by the light. However, the sight in front of his eyes were distorted as if he was seeing a heat shimmer in an early summer day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Theta spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It is a distortion of space.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vitan's Chalice gathered the light from the sky, and it was a tool that distorted the space. The distortion of space could be used to create a completely secluded space. &nbsp;It was also possible to cause a local distortion of space other than creating the 'Vitan's Maze'.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moments ago, Laura was in a desperate situation, so she had created a distortion in space. &nbsp;Kairen was accurate in his strike, but the distortion made him cut through empty air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I failed…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A pale-faced Laura mumbled to herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had created a distortion in space, and at the same time, the Vitan's Maze had been broken. &nbsp;Azell's assessment was spot on. &nbsp;Laura was still inexperienced in using the Vitan's Chalice. She couldn’t maintain the Vitan's Maze and cause a distortion in space at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The unconscious Seigar was on the floor next to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seigar!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen yelled out in surprised. &nbsp;However, Seigar had lost complete consciousness. &nbsp;He didn't respond to Kairen’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Laura spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since things turned out like this, it would have been great if he followed me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Light was emanating far in the distance. &nbsp;A powerful surge of Dragon Demon magic was felt a beat later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wooooooooooooooo…….</span></p>
 <p><span style>The air was shaking slightly. &nbsp;In the midst of a battle, Laura, Kairen, Delta and Theta all looked backwards. &nbsp;This wasn't the time to take one's eyes from one's opponent, but the wave of Dragon Demon Magic that swept over them from the back had been too powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura mumbled to herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the end, he slayed the Dragon. &nbsp;Azell Zestringer. &nbsp;Maybe you are... &nbsp;Maybe you are descended from the one, who saved the world from the King's Destiny.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you just say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had never expected to hear such words from her. &nbsp;Kairen turned around to look at her in surprise. &nbsp;However, instead of giving an answer, she lifted Seigar with her magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was able to come to a decision regarding this failure thanks to you, Dragon Sword Duke.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she spoke those words, she waved her hand once. &nbsp;Seigar's body was flung towards the wrong direction, and he started to fall off a cliff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen unhesitatingly threw his body off the cliff to follow after Seigar. &nbsp;No, he didn't just throw himself off the cliff. &nbsp;He was running down the cliff. &nbsp;He couldn't use his movement skills if he didn't have any place to step on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Kairen was sent away from her, Laura moved her body. &nbsp;Of course, Theta and Delta wouldn't just standby as she ran away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They immediately ran towards her, but....</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bye now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if she had been waiting for them to move, the distortion of space was used to flip the space. &nbsp;They had been running full force towards her, but they were now running in the opposite direction as her. &nbsp;When they realized this fact, Laura had already hidden herself with magic, and she exited the location at high speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The angry Guardian Shadows started to chase after her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>7</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell started to slowly open his eyes as the light surrounding him was dimming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Slayer's ritual was over. &nbsp;The defeated Thunder Dragon had offered everything it had to the winner, Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell momentarily closed his eyes, and he felt the Dragon's power permeate his body. &nbsp;He could feel it. &nbsp;The enormous power he had taken from the Dragon was twitching within him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he wanted to digest all this power, he would need a good amount of time. &nbsp;However, at that moment, he was full of energy as if his body’s previous state had been a lie. &nbsp;All his wounds had healed, and the magical energy he had consumed to the extreme was now full. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now I should....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he had his way, he wanted to immediately go into meditation to digest this power. &nbsp;He wanted to give this task his full attention. &nbsp;However, he didn't have the luxury to do that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was at that moment. &nbsp;Azell let out his killing intent as he asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…are you so eager to die?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Keeper of Prophecy Leone had appeared in front of him. &nbsp;Unlike Jares, he had come here with his true body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. I just wanted to let you know that you don't have to be in a hurry any more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean by that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We lost the Aunsaurus' heir. &nbsp;However, we were able to rescue the Dragon Demon Prince.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see. &nbsp;At the very least, you doused the most immediate fire. I guess it is time for me to solve a personal business now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What personal business are you talking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should immediately send out the bastard called Zeta. &nbsp;I'll destroy him. &nbsp;Then I'll go after Jares next. &nbsp;I'll make it so that he won't be able to think about doing this ever again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“About Jares.... Hmmm. I won't defend that runt's action, but…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Runt?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell's eyes opened wide. &nbsp;Leone spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. I may look like this, but I'm much older than you, sir Azell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When one becomes a Keeper of the Prophecy, it means you forfeit your life of living as a human. &nbsp;I was born during the Great Darkness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell swallowed his breath when he heard those words. It was hard to believe his story. &nbsp;If he was born during the Great Darkness, wasn't he at the very least an old man over 60?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You aren't a Dragon Demon or a Dragon Majin.... &nbsp;Does this mean you avoided the flow of time for all these years?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;However, you don't have to treat me like an old man. &nbsp;I've already thrown away my past.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leone was speaking about an incredible story, yet he was smiling brightly. &nbsp;Azell was temporarily at a loss for words, so Leone spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I'll return to talking about Jares. &nbsp;I fully understand sir Azell's feelings, but his &nbsp;unnecessary method hatched a good result for you. &nbsp;May you take that fact into consideration?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Birds of a feather flock together. &nbsp;You are only looking at the result.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was true that the Frost Dragon was used to lure away the Dragon Demon King worshippers. &nbsp;This in turn allowed him to block the Thunder Dragon. &nbsp;However, if Azell thought about the original reason why Jares had prepared the Frost Dragon, he couldn’t forgive Jares.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see. &nbsp;Well, that is too bad. &nbsp;It seems Jares will have to look out for his own life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think it'll be more convenient for me to torture you. &nbsp;It’ll prompt him to show up in front of me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unfortunately, we aren't tied to each other through affection. &nbsp;We all prioritize our own safety over others.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys are trash.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won't deny that fact. &nbsp;However, the reason behind our choices may differ from what you are thinking, sir Azell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is a reason why we emphasise putting our own safety above all others. &nbsp;Our lives are a tool being used to achieve our earnest wish. &nbsp;The Keepers of Prophecy gave up our lives as humans by choice. &nbsp;We are now the tools being used to eradicate the Dragon Demon King worshippers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So this is why you are suddenly a bit more free with the information you offer. &nbsp;This is why you continue to flap your lips. &nbsp;You want me to feel pity towards you. Do you expect me to sympathize with you guys?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We never considered such a thing. &nbsp;We assessed that there was a high chance that you are the person mentioned in the prophecy. &nbsp;This is the only reason why we are being more cooperative with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, I have no plans to cooperate with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you are able to destroy the Dragon Demon worshippers, then that is the best kind of cooperation you can give.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It didn't matter what words were said. &nbsp;Leone kept smiling, and his face was really like a mask. &nbsp;Azell furrowed his brows as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, all right. &nbsp;I'll hunt down Jares myself, and I'll make him suffer. Give me the bastard called Zeta.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I refuse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you just say?”</span></p>
