 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Chanes wanted to end the fight with Reygus before that happened. &nbsp;He wanted to end Reygus with his own hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, Chanes realized that there was a fatal flaw to his plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His assessment of the situation was correct. &nbsp;He gave the best possible orders he could give.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, his soldiers couldn’t properly carry out his orders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were elite troops, but only a few of them had experienced the Dragon Demon war. &nbsp;Most of them didn’t have experience in fighting extremely strong foes. &nbsp;Moreover, Reygus was a legend in their eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When faced with these two realities, the shock and confusion felt by his troops was taking too large a toll. &nbsp;The swiftness and the precision needed to carry out the plan suffered as a result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, they weren’t facing easy opponents that would let such an opportunity pass them by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;Soul Hammer! &nbsp;Show me your will!&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before the troops around him could increase the intensity of their attack, Reygus started to rush forward within the cloud of dust. &nbsp;He minimized the magical energy allocated for his defense, and he tried to dodge as many attacks being rained down upon him. &nbsp;He compressed his power, and he brought down his hammer using all his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wasn’t attacking in order to affect the entire region. &nbsp;The seismic wave spread in a conical shape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sir Reygus! &nbsp;Go!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Saibein started a fierce attack against the confused enemies. &nbsp;Corrupted Beings and vindictive spirits wielded their cursed power against the Dragon Demon King worshippers. &nbsp;The horrible screams of the Dragon Demon King worshippers rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It really looked like hell had manifested in this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ha ha ha ha!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Black magic was known to violate death. &nbsp;It infringed upon what was called the final rest of living beings. &nbsp;There was someone laughing like a mad man as this dark power defiled the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was Chanes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reygus was coming for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reygus was destroying all the traps prepared for him. &nbsp;He was pushing through the troops under Chanes’ command.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This truth made his heart race in a crazy manner. &nbsp;How long had it been since he’d experienced such excitement?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“…ha! &nbsp;It feels amazing, yet I’m having a hard time breathing. &nbsp;This is why it sucks to have an old body. &nbsp;However, it is better than becoming a shriveled up Undead!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;Are you insulting me?&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you think that was an insult, I’m fine with that!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chanes pointed his sword towards Reygus, who was closing the distance at high speeds. &nbsp;The troops, who were tasked his guarding Chanes, rushed forward to greet Reygus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kwahng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reygus sent the lead warrior flying. &nbsp;It was as if he swatting away a fly. &nbsp;However, these were elite troops. &nbsp;In an instant, they focused on their movement. &nbsp;They split off in both directions as they tried to attack from both sides.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;You should know your place, you brats!&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reygus used one of his shoulders to receive an attack. &nbsp;The attack glanced off his shoulder, and he used that same shoulder to blow away the head of an attacker. &nbsp;He let the other side of his body take on another attack. The powerful sword strike left a deep mark, but it couldn’t penetrate the armor. &nbsp;The warrior was surprised by Reygus’ preternatural sturdiness. &nbsp;He tried to back out, but it was too late.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Puh-uhk!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reygus brought up his knee, and the warrior’s body was pulverized. &nbsp;The magicians continued to let out beams of light as they tried to gain distance from Reygus. &nbsp;He brought down his foot, and an explosion erupted underneath the magicians. &nbsp;Earth and rocks assaulted them. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As expected!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chanes laughed as he watched his underlings lose against Reygus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There had been 12 troops guarding him. &nbsp;It took Reygus less than 10 seconds to break through them. &nbsp;Reygus didn’t even change direction as he fought them. &nbsp;The only thing that changed was the fact that his speed had decreased a little bit. &nbsp;Reygus continued to charge in a straight line as he slaughtered everyone in his path. &nbsp;He approached Chanes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reygus was clearly weakened. &nbsp;His armor was in tatters, and his magical energy was noticeably lower. &nbsp;Still, he was on a different level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was all brute force. &nbsp;He was like a walking fortress, yet he was surprisingly fast. There was precision to his movements. &nbsp;He had cultivated his techniques until it could be called a work of art.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chanes had raised his sword against such a being. &nbsp;He used his Dragon Arts to shoot out continuous beams of light. It was as if a dozen archers was shooting at Reygus. &nbsp;It was a continuous stream of attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reygus didn’t stop</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;Let’s go! &nbsp;Chanes!&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reygus didn’t care if the beams of light hit him or not. &nbsp;He didn’t slow down at all as he arrived in front of Chanes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chanes had stopped giving a fuck at that moment. &nbsp;He knew it would be useless, yet he attacked Reygus when he came in range. &nbsp;He charged forward as he let out a sword strike containing all the power within his body. &nbsp; He greeted Reygus, who was taking big strides towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kwahng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An explosion rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a flash, Chanes’ vision was dyed with darkness. &nbsp;He didn’t feel any pain. &nbsp;He lost his five senses. &nbsp;He lost his sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he regained them, his senses were so faint that he could no longer get a grip on reality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ha ha ha…….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chanes laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could see the sky. &nbsp;His messed up senses was starting to deliver their bleak information.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His body had been sent flying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battle was decided with a single strike. &nbsp;He thought about his past self as he put every ounce of his power into the attack. &nbsp;Reygus answered him with a heroic counterattack. &nbsp;The attack ruthlessly broke his body, and he was sent flying for several dozen meters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a wonder that he hadn’t died on impact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it wasn’t a miracle. &nbsp;Chanes knew this would happen from the start. &nbsp;He had made preparations, so he would be able to have a final conversation with Reygus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A large shadow appeared above the dying Chanes. &nbsp;Chanes saw two burning red orbs within this dark silhouette. &nbsp;When he saw this, he knew it was Reygus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;Hmm. &nbsp;What the hell? &nbsp;Your body is old and withered, but your spirit remains strong.&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“…haha. &nbsp;Koo-luhk!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chanes was laughing, but he suddenly vomited blood. &nbsp;He was dying, but he fought to stay conscious. &nbsp;He used his Dragon Arts, so his words were clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you for the compliment. &nbsp;It is shameful, but my spirit isn’t strong. &nbsp;I’m a coward.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;Yes, your actions up until now was cowardly.&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are still &nbsp;quite ruthless.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;Still, you fought like a man right now. &nbsp;You are going to the other side before me. &nbsp;Find a place for us, and wait for me. &nbsp;The day of our reunion won’t be far off.&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chanes saw an illusion through his blurred vision. &nbsp;He didn’t see the Undead skeleton of Reygus. &nbsp;It was a vision of Reygus when he was alive. &nbsp;He saw Reygus grinning towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past 220 years, he had gotten old, and he had lost his honor. &nbsp;He had fallen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He told himself that he had no choice, but he knew it was a poor excuse. &nbsp;If he had a firm resolve, he would have been able to choose a different path for himself. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He used his injuries as an excuse. &nbsp;He told himself that he had to get along with the others. &nbsp;He used it as an excuse to not change the flow of events. &nbsp;He let himself be dragged along.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why he was happy right now. &nbsp;Reygus hadn’t changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reygus had died. &nbsp;He jumped 220 years to appear in this era as an Undead, yet he remained the same….&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reygus was still his hero.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“…I was afraid of standing by your side.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chanes’ vision became blurry as he confessed his true feelings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If I chose that path, I would have merely been an old man that had nothing. &nbsp;I would have become a burden that would be of no help to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why he chose to go against Reygus. &nbsp;In his ugly descent into corruption, he had built up a lot of things. &nbsp;He was able to become a powerful foe that could become a threat to Reygus. &nbsp;Instead of dying as a useless burden, he decided to put everything he had on the line. &nbsp;He wanted to become a threat to Reygus.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew it was a cowardly choice. &nbsp;He knew this to be true, but he was already walking down that path before he knew it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;It is the same now as in old time. &nbsp;You have too much unnecessary thought. &nbsp;That’s your problem.&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reygus was baffled so he laughed. &nbsp;Then he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;Anyways, I had fun. &nbsp;What about you?&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I…….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chanes’ voice faded away as he spoke. &nbsp;He smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“…it was fun. &nbsp;It really has been so long.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were his last words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A darkness erupted beyond the corpse of Chanes, and it started to surge forth in front of Reygus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">4</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reshoo returned to the Plain of Darkness when he received Atein’s summon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He should be protecting seal of the god of Rest, but there were two reasons why he had left the job to Chanes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">First, Chanes had prepared a trap for Reygus if he decided to come that way. &nbsp;The other reason….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;Atein!&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reygus looked at the Dragon Demon that appeared from within the surging darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Atein floated in the air as his black hair whipped around him. &nbsp;He looked down at Reygus. The surging darkness looked as if it would disperse into the surrounding, but it suddenly changed direction. &nbsp;The darkness gathered around Atein.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No, it wasn’t gathering only around Atein. &nbsp;A portion of the darkness was being sucked into Reygus, and it helped in his recovery. &nbsp;As his magical energy was replenished, even his destroyed armor was restored.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;This is the Darkness Incarnate. &nbsp;Were you preparing this?&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This darkness was part of the Great Darkness. &nbsp;Reygus was part of the Great Darkness, so he was able to receive benefits from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Atein’s Dragon Demon weapon had appeared in front of Reygus. &nbsp;The Darkness Incarnate resolved itself into a clone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the clone was different from the one that had appeared when Almarick had died at the hands of Azell. &nbsp;Kayalia had interfered, so Atein couldn’t manifest the clone fully. &nbsp;Atein was able to manifest a perfect clone here. &nbsp;Chanes had bought enough time in his fight against Reygus.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A silence descended upon the battlefield. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Saibein stopped breathing for a moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Father……!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Atein was his father. &nbsp;He was his teacher in magic. &nbsp;Furthermore, he was like a god-like figure in his eyes. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been 220 years since he saw Atein last. &nbsp;He thought time had eroded his feelings, but he felt long lost emotions come alive within his heart. &nbsp;Confusion and fear spread like a wildfire within his soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Saibein flinched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He looked to his side, and he could see Niberis holding his hand. &nbsp;She was looking at Atein, but he could feel her hand shaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he saw this, he amazingly felt himself calm down. &nbsp;In place of fear and confusion, the new resolve he made when exiting the Albatan forest returned to his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmmm…….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Atein had been looking at the empty air before he spoke. &nbsp;To be precise, his clone, which had manifested through the Darkness Incarnate, spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I never expected this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He never expected the process of manifesting the Darkness Incarnate to heal Reygus. &nbsp;Atein’s consciousness had been sent to this place, and the first thing to catch his interest was this phenomena.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;As expected, you didn’t intend to do it? &nbsp;I knew it wasn't like you to do so. &nbsp;You don’t like a fair fight.&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If it is a fight against you, I might do something unreasonable like healing you. &nbsp;There are times when I do treasure my feelings over logic.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;Koohk koohk. &nbsp;The situation turned quite interesting. &nbsp;I was disappointed that Reshoo wasn’t here. &nbsp;It seems I was too hasty in feeling that way!&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Has it been 270 years since we’ve last met each other as enemies?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;It doesn’t feel that long ago to me, but in reality, it has been that long.&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At times, Atein and Reygus had been allies. &nbsp;However, there were numerous instances where they had fought each other as foes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These two beings lived for a long time. &nbsp;The lifespan of a human wasn’t comparable. &nbsp;Their stances and circumstances changed over time. &nbsp;Above all else, Reygus wanted to fight powerful foes. &nbsp;He would make up excuses to fight powerful foes. &nbsp;This was why he had challenged Atein numerous times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Atein spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have 7 wins, 2 losses and one tie against you. &nbsp;We will renew our fight, but it will also be our last fight.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&lt;Don’t give me that bullshit. &nbsp;Who said I won two times? &nbsp;I lost all 10 times.&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reygus refuted Atein’s words.</span></p>
