  <p><span style>Chapter 35 -&nbsp;</span><span style>Those Who Teach (4)</span></p>
  <p></p>
  <hr>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes. Moreover, he was also an one-eyed person.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell’s second teacher didn’t have a left eye or a left arm. He was an one-eyed and one-armed swordsman.</span></p>
  <p><span style>His name was Balf, but he didn’t tell Arrieta his name. At the time, he was one of the most well known name amongst the mercenaries in the eastern part of the continent.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Logic would dictate a person with physical disabilities wouldn’t be able to function on a battle field. If he was any other mercenary, he would have been forced into retirement.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, no one could disregard Balf.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“He was a Sextuple Master.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“He was a Sextuple Master? A mere mercenary was able to rise to such heights?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Sextuple master was a height only a select few had reached inside the entire Rulain Kingdom. However, the person with such skills was a mere mercenary?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“He wasn’t even a Master before he lost his eye and arm. When he was confined to his bed, he had fiercely cultivated his mind. He was undaunted by his disabilities, and he was able to reach such height with much efforts.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Balf became interested in Azell when they had fallen into a devastating trap.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The monsters controlled by the Dragon Demon race used the night as cover to ambush the humans. They were fundamentally nocturnal creatures, so their night eyes were much better than the humans.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Of course, the humans knew about this, so they were very vigilant during the night. However, at that moment, the company affiliated with Azell and Balf had fallen into a trap set by the Dragon Demon race. Their command structure had been shattered, and they were in the process of fleeing.</span></p>
  <p><span style>When the fleeing soldiers finally felt they had barely escaped, the enemies had tracked them down, and the night attack started.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Confusion and fear started spreading like wildfire. The soldiers weren’t even able to resist as they fell one by one.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Few amongst them fought back, but they couldn’t turn the tide of battle.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell wasn’t fighting to turn the tide of the battle. He just wanted find a way to survive. During the confusion, Azell defeated the enemies one at a time, and before he knew it his back was against Balf.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Balf eyed Azell, and he realized Azell wasn’t a Spirit Order practitioner. However, he was surprised Azell was able to use his developed senses to stay alive as he accurately assessed the situation.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Hey, kid. You want to be my disciple?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>After they were able to escape the enemy’s encirclement, Balf made the suggestion. From Azell’s perspective, he had no reasons to refuse his proposal. If he looked back on it, he was able to earn this opportunity, because of his first teacher Rogan.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell guessed Rogan was a noble in hiding. He suspected this since the sword art he taught was structured. Moreover, Azell didn’t know this at the time, but he had taught him the foundation he needed to learn Spirit Order. This was why his senses were superior to others.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“My second teacher focused on developing my senses to the extreme.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>As a Spirit Order practitioner, it was natural for one to train the mind and senses. However, Balf had obsessively focused on teaching these aspects.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“A typical example was dodging attacks in the dark. In the latter stages, he would hang swinging knives on the ceiling then we would spar in a room in absolute darkness.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It was a brutal training method, but I would venture you had an easy time overcoming it.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Truthfully, that is so. It wasn’t that hard up to that point.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell truthfully acknowledged it. If he looked back on it, he was a very talented student. Each obstacle thrown at him by his teacher was solved in order by him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Balf wasn’t satisfied with this. He covered Azell’s eyes, and Balf forbid him from piercing through the darkness with Spirit Order techniques. Later on he even plugged his ears to seal his hearing.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I even learned about reacting to threats with parts of my body tied.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Sometimes, he had to fight with one of his arms tied.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Another time, he had to block torrent of attacks sitting down with his legs tied together.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He also had to train with both arms tied behind his back, then he was taught to fight while he was hung backwards on his feet.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The point of the training was to never lose one’s senses in any type of situation.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Balf’s training was so harsh that Azell had almost died numerous times. Even a powerful Spirit Order practitioner like Balf couldn’t completely control the dangerous training scenarios.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That is… Isn’t it abuse instead of training?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I won’t deny it. At times, I thought he was really crazy. I thought my teacher had gone crazy, and he was trying to kill me.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What happened to him?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“He died. He had an illness.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was the reason why Balf took in Azell as his disciple. He wanted to pass on his skill he had earned through overcoming his disabilities.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, once he took in Azell as his disciple, his potential was so high that Balf got greedy. He wasn’t satisfied with just passing down his techniques. He wanted Azell to reach a level he was never able to.</span></p>
  <p><span style>His impending death stirred up a madness within him. He lost all his sense of reason, and he drove Azell to the brink a couple times as Azell had to overcome numerous near-death experiences. Most of the enormous wealth Balf had accumulated during his mercenary days were used to treat Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I learned under him for 2 years.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>When Balf passed away, Azell was already a Quadruple Mast at age 17. Moreover, his senses had surpassed Balf’s, and it had approached a level only Balf could dream about.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘His grave might still be there.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>After the Dragon Demon war ended, Azell had moved Balf’s grave to the territory of Marquis Karzark. Did any remnant of the grave survive until the present day?</span></p>
  <p><span style>After thinking up to this point, Azell asked Arrieta a question.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“How was it for princess?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmmm? You aren’t going to tell me about your 3rd teacher? You are asking for my story?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“My story had gone on long enough. When I have the chance, I promise I’ll tell you the story. I want to hear about the teaching you received from the Dragon Demon Duke. ”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You are trying to dig up a girl’s past? It is rude, and it isn’t an action befitting of a knight.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After Arrieta made the joke, she started talking about herself.</span></p>
  <p><span style>6</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Well. That person… If I borrow a description given to him by others, he was a mad man.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…what?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Mad man. Basically, he was a crazy person.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The legendary figure in the kingdom, and the person, who had taught the Dragon Demon Princess her sword art, was called such a name? Azell was taken aback, and Arrieta could only laugh at this sight.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Initially, my teacher was offered the position. When he came to the royal throne, he came to ask for a permission.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What did he ask for permission?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“He didn’t want any outside interference when he taught me. Moreover, he wouldn’t treat me like a royal. If his conditions weren’t met, then he wouldn’t accept the position as my teacher.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Teaching a royal family member was prestigious in and of itself. However, one had to be careful when dealing with the royals. This was the reason why the Dragon Demon Duke refused to be the royal family’s teacher. He declared he couldn’t teach, while he had to ingratiate himself to his student.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Dragon Demon Duke’s attitude was well known, but they still invited him to teach the siblings Arrieta and Seigar…</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ah, Seigar is my brother.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ve heard about him.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Dragon Demon Prince, Seigar Weil Rulain, was 2 years younger than Arrieta. He had his coming of age ceremony this year, and he had entered into the battlefield.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Anyways, we insisted on inviting the Duke of Tarantos as our teacher, because he is a relative of our mother.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta and Seigar was an indirect descendant of the Duke of Tarantos on their mother’s side.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Since they had that connection, they aggressively requested him to be their teacher.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘These children has to go out into the world to fight. We need a teacher who’ll train them to be stronger than everyone.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was the argument given by the Dragon Demon queen.</span></p>
  <p><span style>In every generation, there could be only one Dragon Demon prince and princess. There were times when only one of them existed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After they have their coming-of-age ceremony, they’ll be sent into battles, so their destiny was very arduous. After the crown was given to the next in line, the new Dragon Demon queen weds the sovereign. She would have to fight for the honor of the throne until she gave birth to her children.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Of course, the throne was very selective in which battles they would enter. However, live battles were unpredictable, and unexpected events happened. Moreover, there were many people relying on their powerful strength, so some had died fulfilling their duties.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This truth made the Dragon Demon queen want her children to possess enough power to face their oncoming destiny.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The throne accepted his conditions, so I started receiving his guidance when I was eight.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Did you train with your brother?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No. From the beginning, he didn’t have confidence in teaching two people. He told Seigar to come when he reached my age. Therefore, I was solely able to receive his instructions for two years.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta was dragged outside of the influence of the throne, then she received instruction on the battle field by the Dragon Demon Duke for 2 years.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That person was as much of an ill-tempered person as your teacher, Sir Azell. For example, after teaching me for around half a year, he dropped me deep inside a forest with only one sword in my possession. He required me to survive and live alone for one month.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Around half a year… Weren’t you still 8 years old?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“How could he do such an act to a 8 year old girl….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It was also winter at the time. I really thought I was going to die.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta laughed bitterly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>She was a young 8 year old girl, but she was also a Dragon Demon. With instructions from the Dragon Demon Duke, her physical ability had already exceeded a grown adult’s capability. She had also learned the basics of the Dragon Energy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Still, she had to survive in the winter wilderness with only a sword, so it was a brutal tribulation. If she thoughtlessly made a fire then it would attract the monsters. She had also gone into dangerous areas as she chased after her quarry. She had to overcome frequent brushes with death….</span></p>
  <p><span style>If she thought about it right now, she felt a more sense of crisis during that time compared to when she first stepped into her first battle. At that time, she was weak and inexperienced in every facet.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“There were also other unforgettable experiences. He dropped me in the middle of an unknown city rampant with criminals, then he ordered me to come back to the estate without being seen….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>She had received a lot of training in areas unrelated to martial arts and Dragon energy. At the time she wondered what she was doing, but she understood the purpose of the training now.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was impressed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Indeed. I understand why princess’ personality is like this now.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>From Azell’s perspective, Arrieta was really weird. Even if one was part of the royal family, one develops a sense of reality when one come into frequent contact with the lives of one’s subordinate. Even if he took this into account, Arrieta was too informal compared to her station as a princess.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘It’s because of her teacher.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta had a teacher with an excessively unfettered and disordered mind, so she looked at the world differently from the other royal family members. Even if one was of common birth, she treated them like people. She also developed an eye for evaluating the other’s skill without any bias.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I want to meet him at least once.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You want to?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If you return to the royal palace, I could probably set up a meeting. I’m sure he would be amused to see someone like you..”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Well, I’m fine with that.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Also…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta spoke after she hesitated for a little.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If you have time, could you face off against me?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Face off against you… What do you mean?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I meant sparring.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmm. It won’t be a problem for me, but Ms. Enora will get angry.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That is why I’ve been holding myself back until now. However, my body is restless when I see you spar daily with Sir Giles.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Even if she was a 17 year old girl, Arrieta was a martial artist, who had trained rigorously since her childhood. During this trip, she wasn’t in a position to use her sword, so she quietly acted as an authority figure. Therefore, she was a bit restless.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ms. Enora won’t stand for this.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ll just order her to watch us obediently.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That is abuse of authority.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Isn’t authority meant to be used in a situation like this?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Moreover, she can’t do anything towards her superior, so she will turn her grievance towards me….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Then just take the beating from Enora. I heard subordinates are suppose to be protectors for their superiors.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“….Wow. You are too much.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>When Azell started to shake, Arrieta laughed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was how the night progressed.</span></p>

 <p><span style>“Yes. Moreover, he was also an one-eyed person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s second teacher didn’t have a left eye or a left arm. He was an one-eyed and one-armed swordsman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His name was Balf, but he didn’t tell Arrieta his name. At the time, he was one of the most well known name amongst the mercenaries in the eastern part of the continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Logic would dictate a person with physical disabilities wouldn’t be able to function on a battle field. If he was any other mercenary, he would have been forced into retirement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, no one could disregard Balf.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He was a Sextuple Master.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He was a Sextuple Master? A mere mercenary was able to rise to such heights?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sextuple master was a height only a select few had reached inside the entire Rulain Kingdom. However, the person with such skills was a mere mercenary?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He wasn’t even a Master before he lost his eye and arm. When he was confined to his bed, he had fiercely cultivated his mind. He was undaunted by his disabilities, and he was able to reach such height with much efforts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balf became interested in Azell when they had fallen into a devastating trap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The monsters controlled by the Dragon Demon race used the night as cover to ambush the humans. They were fundamentally nocturnal creatures, so their night eyes were much better than the humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the humans knew about this, so they were very vigilant during the night. However, at that moment, the company affiliated with Azell and Balf had fallen into a trap set by the Dragon Demon race. Their command structure had been shattered, and they were in the process of fleeing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the fleeing soldiers finally felt they had barely escaped, the enemies had tracked them down, and the night attack started.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Confusion and fear started spreading like wildfire. The soldiers weren’t even able to resist as they fell one by one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Few amongst them fought back, but they couldn’t turn the tide of battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell wasn’t fighting to turn the tide of the battle. He just wanted find a way to survive. During the confusion, Azell defeated the enemies one at a time, and before he knew it his back was against Balf.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balf eyed Azell, and he realized Azell wasn’t a Spirit Order practitioner. However, he was surprised Azell was able to use his developed senses to stay alive as he accurately assessed the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Hey, kid. You want to be my disciple?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they were able to escape the enemy’s encirclement, Balf made the suggestion. From Azell’s perspective, he had no reasons to refuse his proposal. If he looked back on it, he was able to earn this opportunity, because of his first teacher Rogan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell guessed Rogan was a noble in hiding. He suspected this since the sword art he taught was structured. Moreover, Azell didn’t know this at the time, but he had taught him the foundation he needed to learn Spirit Order. This was why his senses were superior to others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My second teacher focused on developing my senses to the extreme.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a Spirit Order practitioner, it was natural for one to train the mind and senses. However, Balf had obsessively focused on teaching these aspects.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A typical example was dodging attacks in the dark. In the latter stages, he would hang swinging knives on the ceiling then we would spar in a room in absolute darkness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was a brutal training method, but I would venture you had an easy time overcoming it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Truthfully, that is so. It wasn’t that hard up to that point.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell truthfully acknowledged it. If he looked back on it, he was a very talented student. Each obstacle thrown at him by his teacher was solved in order by him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Balf wasn’t satisfied with this. He covered Azell’s eyes, and Balf forbid him from piercing through the darkness with Spirit Order techniques. Later on he even plugged his ears to seal his hearing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I even learned about reacting to threats with parts of my body tied.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sometimes, he had to fight with one of his arms tied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another time, he had to block torrent of attacks sitting down with his legs tied together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He also had to train with both arms tied behind his back, then he was taught to fight while he was hung backwards on his feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The point of the training was to never lose one’s senses in any type of situation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balf’s training was so harsh that Azell had almost died numerous times. Even a powerful Spirit Order practitioner like Balf couldn’t completely control the dangerous training scenarios.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is… Isn’t it abuse instead of training?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t deny it. At times, I thought he was really crazy. I thought my teacher had gone crazy, and he was trying to kill me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened to him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He died. He had an illness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the reason why Balf took in Azell as his disciple. He wanted to pass on his skill he had earned through overcoming his disabilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, once he took in Azell as his disciple, his potential was so high that Balf got greedy. He wasn’t satisfied with just passing down his techniques. He wanted Azell to reach a level he was never able to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His impending death stirred up a madness within him. He lost all his sense of reason, and he drove Azell to the brink a couple times as Azell had to overcome numerous near-death experiences. Most of the enormous wealth Balf had accumulated during his mercenary days were used to treat Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I learned under him for 2 years.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Balf passed away, Azell was already a Quadruple Mast at age 17. Moreover, his senses had surpassed Balf’s, and it had approached a level only Balf could dream about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘His grave might still be there.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the Dragon Demon war ended, Azell had moved Balf’s grave to the territory of Marquis Karzark. Did any remnant of the grave survive until the present day?</span></p>
 <p><span style>After thinking up to this point, Azell asked Arrieta a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How was it for princess?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm? You aren’t going to tell me about your 3rd teacher? You are asking for my story?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My story had gone on long enough. When I have the chance, I promise I’ll tell you the story. I want to hear about the teaching you received from the Dragon Demon Duke. ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are trying to dig up a girl’s past? It is rude, and it isn’t an action befitting of a knight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Arrieta made the joke, she started talking about herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>6</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well. That person… If I borrow a description given to him by others, he was a mad man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mad man. Basically, he was a crazy person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The legendary figure in the kingdom, and the person, who had taught the Dragon Demon Princess her sword art, was called such a name? Azell was taken aback, and Arrieta could only laugh at this sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Initially, my teacher was offered the position. When he came to the royal throne, he came to ask for a permission.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did he ask for permission?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He didn’t want any outside interference when he taught me. Moreover, he wouldn’t treat me like a royal. If his conditions weren’t met, then he wouldn’t accept the position as my teacher.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Teaching a royal family member was prestigious in and of itself. However, one had to be careful when dealing with the royals. This was the reason why the Dragon Demon Duke refused to be the royal family’s teacher. He declared he couldn’t teach, while he had to ingratiate himself to his student.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon Duke’s attitude was well known, but they still invited him to teach the siblings Arrieta and Seigar…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, Seigar is my brother.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve heard about him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon Prince, Seigar Weil Rulain, was 2 years younger than Arrieta. He had his coming of age ceremony this year, and he had entered into the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Anyways, we insisted on inviting the Duke of Tarantos as our teacher, because he is a relative of our mother.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta and Seigar was an indirect descendant of the Duke of Tarantos on their mother’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since they had that connection, they aggressively requested him to be their teacher.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘These children has to go out into the world to fight. We need a teacher who’ll train them to be stronger than everyone.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the argument given by the Dragon Demon queen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In every generation, there could be only one Dragon Demon prince and princess. There were times when only one of them existed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they have their coming-of-age ceremony, they’ll be sent into battles, so their destiny was very arduous. After the crown was given to the next in line, the new Dragon Demon queen weds the sovereign. She would have to fight for the honor of the throne until she gave birth to her children.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the throne was very selective in which battles they would enter. However, live battles were unpredictable, and unexpected events happened. Moreover, there were many people relying on their powerful strength, so some had died fulfilling their duties.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This truth made the Dragon Demon queen want her children to possess enough power to face their oncoming destiny.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The throne accepted his conditions, so I started receiving his guidance when I was eight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you train with your brother?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. From the beginning, he didn’t have confidence in teaching two people. He told Seigar to come when he reached my age. Therefore, I was solely able to receive his instructions for two years.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta was dragged outside of the influence of the throne, then she received instruction on the battle field by the Dragon Demon Duke for 2 years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That person was as much of an ill-tempered person as your teacher, Sir Azell. For example, after teaching me for around half a year, he dropped me deep inside a forest with only one sword in my possession. He required me to survive and live alone for one month.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Around half a year… Weren’t you still 8 years old?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could he do such an act to a 8 year old girl….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was also winter at the time. I really thought I was going to die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta laughed bitterly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was a young 8 year old girl, but she was also a Dragon Demon. With instructions from the Dragon Demon Duke, her physical ability had already exceeded a grown adult’s capability. She had also learned the basics of the Dragon Energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, she had to survive in the winter wilderness with only a sword, so it was a brutal tribulation. If she thoughtlessly made a fire then it would attract the monsters. She had also gone into dangerous areas as she chased after her quarry. She had to overcome frequent brushes with death….</span></p>
 <p><span style>If she thought about it right now, she felt a more sense of crisis during that time compared to when she first stepped into her first battle. At that time, she was weak and inexperienced in every facet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There were also other unforgettable experiences. He dropped me in the middle of an unknown city rampant with criminals, then he ordered me to come back to the estate without being seen….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had received a lot of training in areas unrelated to martial arts and Dragon energy. At the time she wondered what she was doing, but she understood the purpose of the training now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was impressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Indeed. I understand why princess’ personality is like this now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>From Azell’s perspective, Arrieta was really weird. Even if one was part of the royal family, one develops a sense of reality when one come into frequent contact with the lives of one’s subordinate. Even if he took this into account, Arrieta was too informal compared to her station as a princess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s because of her teacher.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta had a teacher with an excessively unfettered and disordered mind, so she looked at the world differently from the other royal family members. Even if one was of common birth, she treated them like people. She also developed an eye for evaluating the other’s skill without any bias.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to meet him at least once.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you return to the royal palace, I could probably set up a meeting. I’m sure he would be amused to see someone like you..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, I’m fine with that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Also…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta spoke after she hesitated for a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you have time, could you face off against me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Face off against you… What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I meant sparring.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm. It won’t be a problem for me, but Ms. Enora will get angry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is why I’ve been holding myself back until now. However, my body is restless when I see you spar daily with Sir Giles.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if she was a 17 year old girl, Arrieta was a martial artist, who had trained rigorously since her childhood. During this trip, she wasn’t in a position to use her sword, so she quietly acted as an authority figure. Therefore, she was a bit restless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ms. Enora won’t stand for this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll just order her to watch us obediently.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is abuse of authority.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t authority meant to be used in a situation like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Moreover, she can’t do anything towards her superior, so she will turn her grievance towards me….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then just take the beating from Enora. I heard subordinates are suppose to be protectors for their superiors.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“….Wow. You are too much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Azell started to shake, Arrieta laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was how the night progressed.</span></p>
