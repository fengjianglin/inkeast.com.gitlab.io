 <p><span style>Chapter 92 - Those who Seek Their Own Destiny (1)</span></p>
 <p><span style>1</span></p>
 <p><span style>The harsh winter that had frozen the whole world had come to an end. &nbsp;As the new years passed, the snow and ice started to melt. &nbsp;Greens could be seen everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the 4th month of the year, and the color of spring was out in full force... &nbsp;Azell finally decided to go on a long journey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Now that I think about it, it's been exactly 1 year.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The thought came over Azell as he looked out the window. &nbsp;He had woken up in the Balan Forest one year ago today. &nbsp;He had gone through a lot after he woke. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he had his way, he would have left much earlier. &nbsp;However, he had made relationships here, and he had a lot of things he had to do before he could leave his friends.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past 3 months, Azell and Kairen had focused on their training. &nbsp;Azell had taught a lot of things to Kairen. &nbsp;In turn, Kairen passed on the knowledge to Arrieta, Seigar and Giles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three month could be considered to be long or it could be considered to be short depending one’s perspective. &nbsp;However, everyone's ability increased drastically in this period of time. &nbsp;The chaos caused by the fall of the Nadick Empire, the Great Darkness and the machination of the Dragon Demon King worshippers had caused the loss of concepts and techniques. &nbsp;They had the very rare opportunity to learn these lost concepts and techniques from Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll be leaving.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell didn't have much to pack. &nbsp;Usually, people packed heavily for a long trip, but Azell only packed the items he thought were a necessity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm. &nbsp;Are you really going to leave?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Azell came out with his pack, Giles was waiting for him with a question. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;In truth, I've been here too long.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to thank you for all you have taught me. &nbsp;I don't know how I'll repay this kindness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is hardly necessary to say such a thing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, techniques were exchanged and shared during the Dragon Demon War. &nbsp;He just did something that would have occurred during that time. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had woken up after a long sleep, and he had developed valuable relationship with these people. &nbsp;However, they weren't his family or his students.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm sure there will come a time when you'll need power. &nbsp;I want you to choose trustworthy people, and you should build up your ranks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn't have to teach them, but he felt that it was a necessary task. &nbsp;This was why he hadn't hold back in his teachings. &nbsp;He was sure the remnants of darkness was roiling beneath the surface of the world, and there will come a time when it'll wake up once again. &nbsp;Even a single person, who would fight alongside him, would be a boon for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will do my best.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell patted Giles' shoulder once, and he exited the corridor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he arrived at the front door, Arrieta, Seigar and Enora was waiting for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta spoke. &nbsp;She had on a slightly sullen expression as she spoke. It was an expression that one never saw on her, and it made her look her age. &nbsp;Azell unconsciously smiled at the sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it true that you aren't taking the horse I gifted you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;I appreciate the thought, but a horse is too slow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell grinned as he spoke. &nbsp;This was the reason why he didn't have much luggage. &nbsp;Azell didn't plan on traveling like a normal traveler. &nbsp;He planned on running to his destination in the shortest amount of time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta burst out laughing as if he had said something absurd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You said a horse is slow... &nbsp;If people don’t already know you, people will think you are crazy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fortunately, you know me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;It is unfortunate, but you are right. &nbsp;If I knew this would have happened, I would have prepared something else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is the thought that counts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell grinned. &nbsp;Arrieta spoke that way, but it wasn't as if he hadn’t received anything from her. &nbsp;He was given travel money, and the amount was much more than he needed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell suddenly felt a gaze on him, so he looked to the side. &nbsp;Seigar was also looking at him with a sullen expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike the others, the relationship between Azell and Seigar never improved. When he arrived at the Dukedom of Taranton, Seigar had suffered a thorough defeat at the hands of Azell. &nbsp;Afterwards, Seigar acknowledged Azell's superiority, but he never displayed a friendly attitude. &nbsp;This was why Azell had made no efforts in trying to become friendly with Seigar. &nbsp;He had no reason to make such overture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, he had learned a lot from Azell, so there was respect in Seigar's attitude. &nbsp;Segiar spoke as he brought up his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll pray for your success in future battles. &nbsp;I'll work hard, so I can vindicate myself next time we meet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll look forward to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell still smiled as he shook Seigar's hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enora stayed still until that moment. &nbsp;She was of lesser station, and she couldn't open her mouth until she was prompted by a person of higher rank. &nbsp;Azell was aware of this fact, so he initiated the conversation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When I see you next, Ms Enora would have grown into a slender lady. &nbsp;Since Ms Enora is great at your work, you'll probably be a veteran maid for the royal family. &nbsp;I bet you'll have a lot of people working for you by that time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you planning on not coming back for that long?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enora asked with round eyes. &nbsp;The new year had come, but her birthday was in the summer. &nbsp;She was only a 14 year old girl. &nbsp;She was in the midst of her puberty, so she had grown a lot from the time he had met her. &nbsp;However, she was still a young girl, who still hadn't lost her baby fat. &nbsp;If he planned on seeing her when she was a slender lady, how many years was he talking about?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, it'll be great if I get to see you before that happens. &nbsp;Anyways... &nbsp;I owe a lot to Ms Enora.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“At least, you are aware of it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After giving his farewell to Enora, he also gave a farewell to Havanz and the staffs of the estate. &nbsp;Finally, he searched for Kairen. &nbsp;Havanz let out a bitter laugh as he told Azell to head outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are too slow. &nbsp;By the time you finish your farewell, the day might come to an end.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen had come out early, and he had been waiting for Azell. The problem was the clothes he was wearing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell queried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…are you going somewhere today, Duke?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen wore his armor, and he had equipped his two Dragon Swords. &nbsp;He was fully armed. &nbsp;Moreover, he had on a magic tool that hid his horns, pointed ears, and the Dragon Stone. &nbsp;He was disguised as a human knight. &nbsp;On top of it all, he had a travel pack strapped to his back. &nbsp;No matter how one looked at it, it looked as if Kairen was planning on leaving for a trip.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm guessing you are going to the former county of Karzark. &nbsp;I believe you are going to a region taken over by monsters.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…duke?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have talented people under me, so my territory will be managed well even if I'm not here. &nbsp;Don't worry about it. &nbsp;You know how talented Havanz is. &nbsp;Even if I'm gone for an extended amount of time, it won't be a problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. &nbsp;Wait a moment...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell furrowed his brows. &nbsp;He had never considered this scenario. Kairen was one of the great nobles of this country. He was a shield that protected the people from the Dragon Demon King worshippers, and he was a member of the Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;Azell never expected someone of his personage to just follow him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, no one seemed surprised by his intentions. &nbsp;It seemed Kairen had told them about his decision beforehand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell sighed as he asked the question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you serious about this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, I'm serious. &nbsp;I hid it, because I wanted to see your expression. &nbsp;I have a legitimate reason, so don't look at me as if I'm some thoughtless child.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…you accurately figured out what I was feeling, and I want to thank you for packaging your words in such a manner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen ignored Azell's words as he explained the reasons behind this move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As a member of the Guardian Shadows, I've fought against the Dragon Demon King worshippers.... &nbsp;I have a gut feeling that I have to go with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel as if your existence and what I experienced recently portends the beginning of something big. &nbsp;It is not my style to be in the dark. &nbsp;I don't want to react and cope with the situation blindly. &nbsp;If I stay with you, I have a feeling that I'll be able to get to the heart of this problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen didn't lie. &nbsp;He told the truth. &nbsp;Kairen had fought the Dragon Demon king worshippers for over several dozen years, yet he had never been able to get to the core of the problem. &nbsp;On top of it all, he didn't even know the real identity of his own organization.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, events started to change rapidly when Azell came into the scene. &nbsp;The real identities of his enemies were slowly peeled away, and he was able to find out about the Guardian Shadow’s secret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So how could he not follow after Azell? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn't patient enough to step away from a fight, and wait for the result to come out. &nbsp;He always ran to the heart of a fight, and he dictated the result with his own hands. &nbsp;This was why he was the living legend of the Rulain kingdom. &nbsp;This was why he was called the Dragon Sword Duke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After listening to Kairen's determined words, Azell looked at him for a brief moment. &nbsp;In the end, he had to laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you are resolute on this, I won't say no to you. &nbsp;I just feel a bit sorry for Mr. Havanz.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Duke has done this many times before. &nbsp;Please look out for the Duke.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Havanz spoke with a voice mixed with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was how the two men left the Dukedom. They would have to cross two borders, but in Azell's mind, the distance didn't seem too far away. &nbsp;Kairen and Azell crossed mountains and plains as they ran like the wind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>2</span></p>
 <p><span style>The forest had been calm and still only an hour ago, and the darkness of the night ruled over the land. &nbsp;However, an explosion accompanied by fire shattered the darkness, and the fire started to spread.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran put on the appearance of the Black Knight as he conducted a slaughter within the forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah-ahk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the flames burned the forest, Duran cut down a boy that hadn't even reached puberty. &nbsp;He had killed the boy with a single strike, and he immediately headed towards his next target.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a blue thunder struck Duran, and it stalled his advance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gwah-gwah-gwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he was a normal human being, he would have died on the spot. &nbsp;However, Duran used the Insulation technique to ground the electricity. &nbsp;He glared at his enemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The enemy was a young girl. &nbsp;A freckled young girl was shaking in fright.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can't you tell your resistance is useless? &nbsp;It'll be easier for you if you accept this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl flinched at his words, which had come out like a sigh. &nbsp;She raised her magical energy. &nbsp;She was young, but she was a magician with enormous magical power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-hahk!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she looked inexperienced and lacking in front of Duran. &nbsp;Before her concentrated magical energy could do anything, his sword cut her throat open. &nbsp;She fell as blood sprayed out of her. &nbsp;Her eyes were wide open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You evil bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A bloodied young man cried out in despair, and he approached Duran from the side. He wasn't a magician. &nbsp;He was a Spirit Order practitioner like Duran.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You threw away your faith, and you killed your master. &nbsp;How dare an immoral person like you say such a thing to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran spoke as he easily parried the other's sword strike. &nbsp;Fire burned within the young man's eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are a crazy devil! &nbsp;You aren't qualified to talk about immorality and duty!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are wrong. &nbsp;You guys are the ones that are crazy. &nbsp;You had the chance to follow the true faith, yet you voluntarily turned away from it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man used to be a prospect that the Dragon Demon king worshippers had groomed for his combat potential. &nbsp;He had been indoctrinated with the true faith from a young age, yet he had killed his teacher. &nbsp;He had tried to escape with the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this young man wasn't the true mastermind behind the escape attempt. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man was lured away by sweet talk, and he had committed a deadly sin. &nbsp;He was a pitiable soul. &nbsp;Duran knew this, so he asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yuren chose to take up the name seeped in sin. &nbsp;What did this evil traitor do to you all? &nbsp;What words caused you to commit such foolish actions?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren was recently causing a lot of problem within the ranks of the Dragon Demon king worshippers. &nbsp;He had killed all his comrades affiliated with the organization he was affiliated with, and now he was on the run. &nbsp;Moreover, he was going around destroying the bases connected to his organization.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The problem was the fact the there was no strict structure to how the Dragon Demon king worshippers were organized. &nbsp;This was why even the ruling class in the Plain of Darkness wasn't able to keep up with all the activities of the various organizations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Yuren was able to find out the overlapping points in these organizations, and he continued to attack the Dragon Demon King worshippers. </span></p>
 <p><span style>From the perspective of the Dragon Demon king worshippers, Yuren's action was so astounding that words didn't even come out of their mouths.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Until a year ago, Yuren had been a prospect placed in a secret training facility for magicians. &nbsp;Basically, he hadn't even been officially recognized as a magician.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, he was only a 20 years old human. &nbsp;Unlike the Dragon Majin, he hadn't been born with naturally high reservoir of magic. &nbsp;Moreover, he was only an apprentice, so he hadn't received any valuable knowledge. &nbsp;The valuable techniques were only given when one did something of merit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite all of that, Yuren had already killed Dragon Demon king worshippers in the hundreds. &nbsp;There were many Dragon Majin included in this number.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I don't understand that bastard.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duren still haven't seen Yuren in person. It was only in recent days that the upper management had inserted high quality individuals like Duran.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Duran followed the traces left behind Yuren, Duran was getting further away from understanding this young man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the first place, why did Yuren betray the Dragon Demon king worshippers? &nbsp;Moreover, how was he able to improve his skills so much? &nbsp;However, as time passed, Duran didn't worry about such thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We now know the truth. We know how crazy and evil you guys are!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The real problem was the existence like the young man pointing his sword towards Duran.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The human Dragon Demon King worshippers were divided into two categories. &nbsp;There were the humans nurtured within the organizations. &nbsp;Then there were the humans akin to Duran. &nbsp;The truth was told to an outsider, and this human outsider became a convert.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The children nurtured from within were mostly orphans. &nbsp;They were indoctrinated with the beliefs of the Dragon Demon King worshippers from the time they were able to talk. &nbsp;The children were indoctrinated in a completely controlled environment, so they shouldn’t have any selfish desires.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However... &nbsp;Something had happened to Yuren, and it made him have a change in heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Even if was a magic that affected the mind, it would take a very long time and massive effort to change an inflexible mind. &nbsp;So how is this possible?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran held the question in his heart as he looked at the young man, who swung his sword. &nbsp;The young man didn't care about his own safety. &nbsp;His strike had the intent of taking both of them out. &nbsp;However...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are foolish until end.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before the young man could swing his sword, Duran's sword sliced through the young man's neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the teen fell, Duran approached a young Dragon Majin. &nbsp;The Dragon Majin youth was wearing the same armor as Duran. &nbsp;He spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yuren is on the run with the cold-blooded queen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran was an exception. &nbsp;He was a human given that was given a high rank. &nbsp;Naturally, he had command over both humans and Dragon Majins. Everyone knew about Duran's skill and accomplishments, so no one objected to his command. &nbsp;They respected him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did they get to safety as they threw these powerless children into the maw of a Dragon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don't think that is entirely true…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At his words, the young Dragon Majin let out a bitter laugh. &nbsp;Duran looked at him with a puzzled expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm?”</span></p>
