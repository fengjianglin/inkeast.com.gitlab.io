 <p>Chapter 107 - The One that Chose the Name Soaked in Sin (3)</p>
 <p><span style>There was a part of him that resembled Carlos. &nbsp;It was undeniable. &nbsp;Normally, Carlos possessed a very cold demeanor, but when he was with Azell, Carlos acted a bit dopey. Yuren, who was in front of him, gave off a similar impression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, from Azell's perspective, Yuren was an amalgamation of very troubling elements. &nbsp;He looked similar to Carlos, yet he used to be a Dragon Demon king worshipper. &nbsp;Moreover, he took on the name Rizester as an act of betrayal....</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is he really Carlos’ descendant?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike Azell, Carlos accrued fame even into his latter years as an Archmage. &nbsp;It wouldn't be weird to find out that he had descendants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, Carlos didn't have any children.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He didn't officially have any heirs. &nbsp;However, in the nature of things, affairs happen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm. If that is true…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What if it is so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You'll also go bald when you get old.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren had a dumbfounded expression on his face. Then his face reddened, and he started stuttering his words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T...that isn't true! &nbsp;My hair is very thick! &nbsp;Moreover, even if I am Carlos' descendant, there is a several generational gap between me and him. &nbsp;How can you say I'll go bald like him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…it seems you've worried over this topic before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell chuckled. &nbsp;At the very least, this reaction proved that Yuren himself believed he was a descendant of Carlos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, the problem of authenticity can't be determined right now, so let's push that aside for now. &nbsp;First, I would like to learn more about both of you. ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmm. Doesn't one normally introduce oneself when asking such a question?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia was a bit further away, and she asked in a cold manner. &nbsp;Kairen, who had been quiet, stepped forward when he heard her words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are being too harsh. &nbsp;We rescued both of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...we can't deny what you did for us. &nbsp;It is a bit annoying, but I guess we are at a disadvantage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Leticia grumbled, Yuren smirked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, I planned on revealing everything in the first place. &nbsp;You don't have to be so prickly, Leticia.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is your stance. &nbsp;I don't plan on taking the same approach.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, you came along according to my will, so it is already a done deal. &nbsp;Since you stayed silent on the issue, you've tacitly agreed to my agenda.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sometimes I have an urge to beat you, and I'm having a hard time holding myself back right now, Yuren.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The fact that you are able to hold yourself back like this means you possess a sound mind. &nbsp;Anyways… Mmmm. &nbsp;If you don’t want to talk, you can give a cursory introduction. &nbsp;I used to be a Dragon Demon king worshipper, and I betrayed them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>4</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren didn't hide anything about his past. &nbsp;He told them how he came to be a Dragon Demon king worshipper, then he talked about how he escaped from their brainwashing. &nbsp;He spoke how he chose the road to being a traitor....</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen, who had been listening to the story, furrowed his brows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That just sounds too absurd. &nbsp;An unknown voice appeared suddenly in your dreams, and it started guiding you? &nbsp;This was the reason why you betrayed the Dragon Demon king worshippers.... &nbsp;Do you really want me to believe such nonsense?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know it is a hard to believe tale. &nbsp;However, it is the truth. &nbsp;If it wasn't for the dreams sent by my guide, I would still be a Dragon Demon king worshipper. &nbsp;I was made to be loyal through the brainwashing, and I prayed each day for the revival of the Dragon Demon king. &nbsp;Sometimes officers would come to speak to us about the Dragon Demon war, and I was moved to tears by the stories I heard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…does the Dragon Demon king worshippers really live like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think I'm joking? &nbsp;I'm not. This was especially true at these institutes, which fostered the children. &nbsp;They were very thorough in observing these types of formalities. &nbsp;Moreover, everyone considered it to be normal and natural. &nbsp;From a very young age, we were instilled with the ideology of the Dragon Demon king worshippers, and anything that didn’t fall within this ideology was considered to be wrong. &nbsp;Moreover...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One could make a fanatic through brainwashing. &nbsp;It was almost impossible to reverse this process, yet the Dragon Demon king worshippers weren’t satisfied with just that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are tiers to being a Dragon Demon king worshippers. &nbsp;In the end, Dragon Demons are on top, the Dragon Majins are in the middle, and the humans make up the floor. &nbsp;However, they never fully trust a human. &nbsp;This policy may have arose when they suffered defeat at the hands of the humans.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was observed when Azell battled and ultimately killed Duran. &nbsp;Duran had dedicated his life to the worship of the Dragon Demon king, and he had distinguished himself numerous times in battle. &nbsp;He was a human, who was allowed to live inside the Plains of Darkness. &nbsp;However, his advancement ended there. &nbsp;He received very little support compared to the Dragon Demons and Dragon Majins.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Currently, no 'humans' amongst the Dragon Demon king worshippers possess Dragon Demon Qi. &nbsp;Humans aren't allowed to go through Dragon Slayer's Ritual.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only humans and Dragon Majins could enter into a Dragon Slayer's Ritual. &nbsp;However, the Dragon Demon king worshippers refused to set up a stage where a human would be able to go through the Dragon Slayer's Ritual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Our story strayed a little bit off topic. &nbsp;Anyway, they weren't satisfied with a thorough mind control regiment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All their foods were drugged. &nbsp;This drug was moderately addicting, and a specific smell could put the subject into a state of trance. &nbsp;During the indoctrination of the children, the children was put in a trance state, and the worship of the Dragon Demon King was imprinted deep within their subconsciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It's a heinous act. &nbsp;However, it doesn't end there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All children went through a monthly verification process to see if the ideology had taken hold. &nbsp;In the process, the children’s minds were thrown open to be manipulated by magic. &nbsp;Childhood are a time when these children are supposed to develop self-identities. &nbsp;However, they were already in the inescapable grip of the madness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was like that. &nbsp;When I first dreamed of my guide, I wanted to kill myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guilt was the main reason. &nbsp;As a Dragon Demon king worshipper, I thought I had committed an egregious sin. &nbsp;I believed I was being successfully tempted by an evil being.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why he told no one about the dreams. &nbsp;In the end, it had been a wise decision for him to do so. If he had told the instructors, Yuren would have immediately been labeled as a failed product. &nbsp;He would have been transferred over to a division where they would have experimented on his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When I had the dream for the first time... &nbsp;It was weird. &nbsp;The things I considered to be obvious no longer seemed to be so obvious inside my dreams.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he kept having these dreams, the ideas put into his head was accepted as being illogical. &nbsp;This was the effect of the dream. &nbsp;The ideology ingrained in him felt natural as breathing. &nbsp;However, the ways of the Dragon Demon king worshippers felt weird inside his dream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A fissure appeared inside his mind. &nbsp;As he kept dreaming about the guide every night, Yuren started to see the madness that was slowly eating him alive. &nbsp;He shook from fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It took me 10 years for me to bring myself to escape that place. &nbsp;As a Dragon Demon king worshipper, I was already a broken product. &nbsp;However, my guide inside my dream gave me methods, which allowed me to hide this fact.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At an early age, Yuren was classified as a candidate for becoming a magician. &nbsp;He learned magic from childhood. &nbsp;His instructors were thorough in teaching Yuren about practical Black Magic. &nbsp;There were also children, who were taught traditional magic, since they would be sent to infiltrate the outside world. &nbsp;However, Yuren wasn’t part of that group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During all of this, Yuren was simultaneously being instructed by the guide inside his dreams. &nbsp;He learned magic that weren’t taught by his instructors. &nbsp;After 10 years, Yuren far outstripped his instructors. &nbsp;He developed into being a magician able to rival the Dragon Demon officers from the Plains of Darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I never found out the identity of my guide. &nbsp;I still do not know. &nbsp;In truth, I am not totally comfortable with the guidance I received. &nbsp;The guide taught me how to call and control a Demon. &nbsp;However, at the very least, I don’t think the guide is a Demon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is still a possibility. &nbsp;The Demon race possesses knowledge of unknown origin. &nbsp;Their goal is to lead humans to destruction using this knowledge….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke. &nbsp;Not many people knew about the Demon race. &nbsp;Unless one was a Black Magician, there was no need for one to approach the Demons. &nbsp;However, during the Dragon Demon wars, Carlos had approached the Demon race to gain a power that’ll destroy the hopelessness hanging over the world. &nbsp;The knowledge he had gained had been worth the risk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren let out a bitter laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still… &nbsp;If it wasn't for my guide, I would have never found myself. &nbsp;I would have wasted away as a tool for the Dragon Demon king worshippers. &nbsp;This is why I trust it. &nbsp;Even if my guide was a Demon working towards my destruction, I am still thankful. &nbsp;I was given an opportunity to perish as a human.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he spoke, Yuren hesitated before he put a disclaimer to his statement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…Ah. &nbsp;Of course, if it is really leading me down a path of destruction, I’ll direct my hatred and resentment towards it with my last breath.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pfft.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell let out a laugh at those words. &nbsp;Yuren clear his throat before he spoke again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm hmm. &nbsp;The guide inside my dream said I’ll meet the man of my destiny here. &nbsp;It said that this person would remind me of Azell Karzark, who had defeated the Dragon Demon king. &nbsp;It seemed my guide was right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Azell Karzark…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell let out a bitter laugh. &nbsp;If Yuren found out he was the actual Azell Karzark, he was curious as to what kind of expression would appear on Yuren’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In truth, your story is highly suspicious, and it has a lot of holes. &nbsp;The only part that is trustworthy is the fact that you opposed the Dragon Demon king worshippers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know my story is hard to believe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t particularly like conspiracy theories, but… &nbsp;This might have all been scripted by the Dragon Demon king worshipper. &nbsp;Isn’t that so? &nbsp;&nbsp;You opposed Niberis, and you almost died in the process. &nbsp;However, that can be faked.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, the Dragon Majin officers were almost wiped out by you. &nbsp;I’ll point out that fact as a point in my favor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maybe, they underestimated me. &nbsp;Moreover, during the Dragon Demon war, the Dragon Demon king even threw his children away as bait if the battle was important enough. &nbsp;It isn’t too farfetched to think that the Dragon Majin officers were used as baits.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you are so highly suspicious… &nbsp;Mmmm. &nbsp;There is no way I’ll be able to earn your trust. &nbsp;In the first place, I knew the story of a guide within my dreams sounded baseless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren let out a bitter laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After staring at Yuren for a brief moment, Azell asked a question to Laura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think, Laura?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…you are asking for my opinion?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura was taken aback. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Why would he ask for her opinion in such a situation?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason being Azell could now tell if Laura was speaking a lie or not. Her words would give another data point, which Azell could use to come to assess the situation.</span></p>
