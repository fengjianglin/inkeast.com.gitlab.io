  <p><span style>Chapter 41 -&nbsp;</span><span style>When I Met Someone Who Was Dead (6)</span></p>
  <p></p>
  <hr>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>As she worked as a member of the Dragon’s Shadow, she had fought and killed a lot of humans. She also had plenty experience fighting against Spirit Order practitioners.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, amongst them, no one fought like Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Of course, this was the case. The run of the mill Spirit Order practitioners wouldn’t be able to imitate the techniques devised by Azell. Azell had once reach the pinnacle level, so he could use such unreasonable technical skills.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I can’t win against him…….’</span></p>
  <p><span style>The certainty of defeat ruled over her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>If he showed an overwhelming strength, then it would have been easier for her to swallow this defeat. However, Azell used sophisticated techniques, and deceptive tricks to make surprise attacks. Her allies with great power were cut down so easily that it was absurd. She couldn’t comprehend what was happening, and this created a fear inside her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Should I run away?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, she wasn’t allowed to do so. She had to stall until Niberis captured the Dragon Demon Princess….</span></p>
  <p><span style>She started to retreat haltingly when Azell suddenly appeared in front of Regina. The moment he sensed her agitation, he immediately used his Instantaneous Movement to charge after her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kah-ahng!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Sword hit against sword as sparks flew. Her balance was broken, but Azell pulled back from striking a critical blow. The reason being the corrupted being had ran in at that moment. Regina stabbed with her sword towards Azell in an almost reflexive manner. The enemy in front of her hesitated in attacking her, and her ally was attacking from Azell’s rear. She had thought it would be the best chance for her to attack.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Regina soon realized she had fallen into a trap.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘This was also planned by this person!’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell had a cold smile on his face.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The moment she started her attack his figure disappeared as if he had been waiting for this moment. He had prepared his movement technique as if he had been waiting for her move. He activated it with exquisite timing where she couldn’t pull pack her attack.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Regina’s field of vision was swallowed by the corrupted being’s enormous body. Then….</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kwaaahhhhhhh!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell appeared behind the corrupted being and his fierce strike exploded. The lightning flash sliced and ripped into the corrupted being’s large body. Regina, who was on the other side of they body, was also swept up in the attack.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘We were dancing on top of his palms from beginning to the end. Even one from the Dragon Demon race won’t be able to face…..’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Regina, who had fallen int despair, couldn’t continue her thoughts. The exquisite pain swirling around her entire body made her lose her consciousness.</span></p>
  <p><span style>6</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis furrowed her brows.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“She’s really tenacious..”</span></p>
  <p><span style>In front of her, Arrieta was covered in dirt, and she was breathing raggedly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta couldn’t even harm a single hair on Niberis. She was busy focusing only on defense.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was impossible for her to run away. Niberis used a delicate magical fog to prevent Arrieta from escaping a certain area. Her movements were being restricted.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Unlike her calm exterior, Niberis wasn’t as relaxed inside.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I never expected this mission to turn out to be this annoying.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>If she wanted to kill Arrieta, this would have already ended. The problem was the goal of her mission. She had to capture the Dragon Demon Princess Arrieta, while causing minimal damage to her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>She couldn’t cause damage that couldn’t be healed. She had to catch Arrieta intact, and it was a really tricky proposition. If would have been easier for her if she could use a curse or a binding magic to subdue Arrieta. However, Arrieta’s skills were outstanding. Niberis had no choice but to send lukewarm attacks to methodically cut down her stamina.</span></p>
  <p><span style>She smiled when she saw Arrieta pant.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Is this the end……?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Anyone could tell by looking at Arrieta that she was refusing to yield.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis didn’t get angry. Instead, she let out a sigh.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If my underlings were a little bit more useful, then this assignment could have been done more easily.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What……?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>It happened when Arrieta was puzzling over Niberis’ words.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Pah-jee-jee-jeeek!</span></p>
  <p><span style>A blue flame sparked in front of Niberis’ eyes. Before she knew it, Azell had approached her from the front, and he had brought down his sword.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You are a troublesome person like the report indicated.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell whistled as he pressed against her barrier.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I guess you aren’t dumb like your underlings?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis’ barrier hadn’t activated from conscious command right now. She had prepared for a scenario where she would be ambushed. The barrier magic was prepared in a way where it would activate when certain conditions were met.</span></p>
  <p><span style>From the moment Niberis’ barrier activated, the magical pattern was changing fluidly. She used the magical alignment to negate, and cut off the backlash.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You with the name seeped in sin…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Why don’t you just call me Azell? Isn’t it annoying to use such a long name, Niberis Ahjoommah?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What did you say?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>When Niberis heard the word ‘Ahjoommah’, her eyebrows rose.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kwa-gwang!</span></p>
  <p><span style>At the same time, a lightning strike exploded atop the barrier. It let out a bright light into the surrounding, and it felt like the white light could sear the eyes in an instant. Afterwards, the thunderclap shook the surrounding.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis was taken aback.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘He’s unscathed?!’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Her thunder strike had the power to demolish a mountain. However, he wasn’t damaged at all, and he was looking down at her. Niberis felt her heart sink when she saw Azell laugh coldly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Did you think Insulation magic could only be used by a magician? Do you really think you can solve everything with a thunder strike? You are sorely mistaken if you think you can take on the world even if you are a high level magician. ”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell changed his magical energy into an insulator. He wrapped his magical energy around himself, then he let the thunder strike pass through him. Magical energy could be changed into any attribute. Since it was obvious to Azell that the opponent was going to to use a thunder strike, he was able to easily defend against it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell’s continued to attack.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Earth’s Sage!’</span></p>
  <p><span style>He tilted his sword slightly as he moved in an odd fashion. Niberis’ lower body inside the barrier received a weak impact from the sword as it passed by. The impact wasn’t enough to hurt her. However, Niberis was shaken when she realized Azell had pierced through her barrier, and the attack had affected her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘This is……?!’</span></p>
  <p><span style>In front of the surprised Niberis, Azell used another technique.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Storm Dragon’s Claw!’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell slightly pull his sword back, then he struck.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The result was extraordinary. The movement shouldn’t allow a human body to deliver such power. In a flash, the accelerating blade moved faster than the speed of sound. It ripped through the barrier, then a shock wave exploded.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kwahhhhhhng!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Accompanying an explosive sound, Niberis was flung away.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Kook……!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Before she collided with the ground, she was barely able to change the trajectory of her flight. Niberis moaned. There was a slight rip near the clothes on her chest, and blood dripped down near her lips.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“As expected. Your possession of the name soaked in sin wasn’t for show…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis was speaking, while refusing to yield, when she became startled. At that moment, Azell had appeared behind her back, and he had swung his sword.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Pahhhhhhhhh!</span></p>
  <p><span style>The barrier with the pre-programmed instructions barely activated in time.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Azell had predicted this would happen. When the sword strike collided with the barrier, he didn’t resist against the force. He was flung away as he rotated his body.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Then Azell disappeared. He made use of the repulsive force, then he used the Instantaneous Movement in mid-air even though he didn’t have any place to push off from!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis’ instincts warned her of her imminent death, so she desperately yelled out.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The Dragon in my blood, Awake!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>At the same time, a strong shock-wave exploded with her at the center.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kwahhhhhhhhg!</span></p>
  <p><span style>The ripple of destruction spread out in a circle, and the radius of several dozen meters were destroyed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ha-ah, ha-ah…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis was dripping with cold sweat. She was breathing hard since he had quickly poured out her magical energy. She did it because the fear of death had crawled up to the back of her neck. If she hadn’t prepared a trump card, her head would have been separated from her neck.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I knew it, you bastard…. You are a person who’ve studied the forgotten techniques.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis spoke as she covered her face with one hand. She wasn’t just speaking to him. Her voice itself was a magic trying to oppress the opponent.</span></p>
  <p><span style>From across the dirt cloud, she heard Azell’s voice.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Forgotten techniques?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes. I know about men like you. They are morons with swords, but they also know how to reach the great wisdom. I’ve watched what you’ve done. You did impossible feats that most others couldn’t replicate.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Since you are talking like that, it must mean your organization hasn’t forgotten about the knowledge. They must have preserved it.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The conversation between the two were a part of the battle. They used their voice in an attempt to over power each other, and they were trying to confuse the other’s senses. At the same time, they were furiously scanning the surrounding for each other’s location.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Maybe…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell continued to speak, but she couldn’t see him through the cloud of dust. She could only make out a faint silhouette.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Niberis already knew that the silhouette wasn’t Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…did you guys steal the knowledge from humans?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The voice kept coming from different places.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Moreover, the silhouette’s location kept changing.</span></p>
  <p><span style>She was using her Search magic to chase after his life signature, but Azell wasn’t that easy of an opponent. He was overtly spreading his life signature to various locations. It basically made it impossible for her to determine where he was.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis also tried to use his voice to determine where he was. However, Azell was able to bewilder her on that front too.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Truthfully, if he said he was a high level magician instead of a Spirit Order practitioner, I would have believed him.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis knew high level Spirit Order practitioners were a ludicrous existence. She knew it since her organization also had Spirit Order practitioners who had inherited the lost knowledges.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Still, Azell was an enigma to Niberis.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You, who knew about and performed the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis asked in a quiet voice.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Did you really kill a dragon?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…what if I did?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It’s weird. You most definitely possess outstanding techniques. However….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis voiced her doubt.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Your magical energy is too weak. You might be able to kill a high ranking magician with that quantity of power, but it would be impossible to kill a dragon.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>When Spirit Order practitioners reach a certain level, their magical energy increases proportionally. As a Spirit Order practitioner becomes more skillful, the person can efficiently deal with more magical energy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The skills and magical energy shown by Azell was unbalanced. The magical energy couldn’t be compared to Azell’s skill. If Azell didn’t have sufficient magical energy, then it would have been impossible for him to reach such a high skill level.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“However, you were able complete the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual. What method did you use?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If I give you an answer, will you let us live?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I might.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If you are going to tell a lie, why don’t tell a better one?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell snorted.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m telling you the truth. I’ll guarantee your lives. I promise on my name.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It basically means you are going to imprison us as new recruits.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“This negotiation has come to an end.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That’s a shame.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis really felt regret. Many people wrecked their lives from trying to satisfy their curiosity, and magicians were the front runners in leading such a life. Even Niberis couldn’t’ escape from the magician’s disposition. She felt regret at the fact that she had to kill Azell, who was a box full of mysteries.</span></p>
  <p><span style>As the dust cloud slowly settled, Niberis decided on how she should act.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Hoooooooooooooooh!</span></p>
  <p><span style>A whirlwind rose up and the cloud of dust disappeared. At that exact moment, Azell appeared in the front and in the back at the same time.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis couldn’t wait any longer, so she cleared the dust cloud. However, Azell was aiming for this opportunity. When she raised a whirlwind, the area around her fuzzed for a brief moment. From inside the dust cloud, Azell had created two clones, and when both were discovered, her attention would focus them.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“As I suspected.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The person who felt a frightening sensation was Azell.</span></p>

 <p><span style>Chapter 41 -&nbsp;</span><span style>When I Met Someone Who Was Dead (6)</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>As she worked as a member of the Dragon’s Shadow, she had fought and killed a lot of humans. She also had plenty experience fighting against Spirit Order practitioners.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, amongst them, no one fought like Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, this was the case. The run of the mill Spirit Order practitioners wouldn’t be able to imitate the techniques devised by Azell. Azell had once reach the pinnacle level, so he could use such unreasonable technical skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can’t win against him…….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The certainty of defeat ruled over her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he showed an overwhelming strength, then it would have been easier for her to swallow this defeat. However, Azell used sophisticated techniques, and deceptive tricks to make surprise attacks. Her allies with great power were cut down so easily that it was absurd. She couldn’t comprehend what was happening, and this created a fear inside her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Should I run away?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she wasn’t allowed to do so. She had to stall until Niberis captured the Dragon Demon Princess….</span></p>
 <p><span style>She started to retreat haltingly when Azell suddenly appeared in front of Regina. The moment he sensed her agitation, he immediately used his Instantaneous Movement to charge after her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kah-ahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sword hit against sword as sparks flew. Her balance was broken, but Azell pulled back from striking a critical blow. The reason being the corrupted being had ran in at that moment. Regina stabbed with her sword towards Azell in an almost reflexive manner. The enemy in front of her hesitated in attacking her, and her ally was attacking from Azell’s rear. She had thought it would be the best chance for her to attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Regina soon realized she had fallen into a trap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This was also planned by this person!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had a cold smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment she started her attack his figure disappeared as if he had been waiting for this moment. He had prepared his movement technique as if he had been waiting for her move. He activated it with exquisite timing where she couldn’t pull pack her attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regina’s field of vision was swallowed by the corrupted being’s enormous body. Then….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwaaahhhhhhh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell appeared behind the corrupted being and his fierce strike exploded. The lightning flash sliced and ripped into the corrupted being’s large body. Regina, who was on the other side of they body, was also swept up in the attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘We were dancing on top of his palms from beginning to the end. Even one from the Dragon Demon race won’t be able to face…..’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regina, who had fallen int despair, couldn’t continue her thoughts. The exquisite pain swirling around her entire body made her lose her consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>6</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis furrowed her brows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s really tenacious..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front of her, Arrieta was covered in dirt, and she was breathing raggedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta couldn’t even harm a single hair on Niberis. She was busy focusing only on defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was impossible for her to run away. Niberis used a delicate magical fog to prevent Arrieta from escaping a certain area. Her movements were being restricted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike her calm exterior, Niberis wasn’t as relaxed inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I never expected this mission to turn out to be this annoying.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If she wanted to kill Arrieta, this would have already ended. The problem was the goal of her mission. She had to capture the Dragon Demon Princess Arrieta, while causing minimal damage to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn’t cause damage that couldn’t be healed. She had to catch Arrieta intact, and it was a really tricky proposition. If would have been easier for her if she could use a curse or a binding magic to subdue Arrieta. However, Arrieta’s skills were outstanding. Niberis had no choice but to send lukewarm attacks to methodically cut down her stamina.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She smiled when she saw Arrieta pant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this the end……?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyone could tell by looking at Arrieta that she was refusing to yield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis didn’t get angry. Instead, she let out a sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If my underlings were a little bit more useful, then this assignment could have been done more easily.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What……?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It happened when Arrieta was puzzling over Niberis’ words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-jee-jee-jeeek!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A blue flame sparked in front of Niberis’ eyes. Before she knew it, Azell had approached her from the front, and he had brought down his sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are a troublesome person like the report indicated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell whistled as he pressed against her barrier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess you aren’t dumb like your underlings?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis’ barrier hadn’t activated from conscious command right now. She had prepared for a scenario where she would be ambushed. The barrier magic was prepared in a way where it would activate when certain conditions were met.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the moment Niberis’ barrier activated, the magical pattern was changing fluidly. She used the magical alignment to negate, and cut off the backlash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You with the name seeped in sin…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why don’t you just call me Azell? Isn’t it annoying to use such a long name, Niberis Ahjoommah?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Niberis heard the word ‘Ahjoommah’, her eyebrows rose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwa-gwang!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, a lightning strike exploded atop the barrier. It let out a bright light into the surrounding, and it felt like the white light could sear the eyes in an instant. Afterwards, the thunderclap shook the surrounding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He’s unscathed?!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her thunder strike had the power to demolish a mountain. However, he wasn’t damaged at all, and he was looking down at her. Niberis felt her heart sink when she saw Azell laugh coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you think Insulation magic could only be used by a magician? Do you really think you can solve everything with a thunder strike? You are sorely mistaken if you think you can take on the world even if you are a high level magician. ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell changed his magical energy into an insulator. He wrapped his magical energy around himself, then he let the thunder strike pass through him. Magical energy could be changed into any attribute. Since it was obvious to Azell that the opponent was going to to use a thunder strike, he was able to easily defend against it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s continued to attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Earth’s Sage!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He tilted his sword slightly as he moved in an odd fashion. Niberis’ lower body inside the barrier received a weak impact from the sword as it passed by. The impact wasn’t enough to hurt her. However, Niberis was shaken when she realized Azell had pierced through her barrier, and the attack had affected her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is……?!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front of the surprised Niberis, Azell used another technique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Storm Dragon’s Claw!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell slightly pull his sword back, then he struck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The result was extraordinary. The movement shouldn’t allow a human body to deliver such power. In a flash, the accelerating blade moved faster than the speed of sound. It ripped through the barrier, then a shock wave exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwahhhhhhng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Accompanying an explosive sound, Niberis was flung away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kook……!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before she collided with the ground, she was barely able to change the trajectory of her flight. Niberis moaned. There was a slight rip near the clothes on her chest, and blood dripped down near her lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected. Your possession of the name soaked in sin wasn’t for show…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis was speaking, while refusing to yield, when she became startled. At that moment, Azell had appeared behind her back, and he had swung his sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pahhhhhhhhh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The barrier with the pre-programmed instructions barely activated in time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Azell had predicted this would happen. When the sword strike collided with the barrier, he didn’t resist against the force. He was flung away as he rotated his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Azell disappeared. He made use of the repulsive force, then he used the Instantaneous Movement in mid-air even though he didn’t have any place to push off from!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis’ instincts warned her of her imminent death, so she desperately yelled out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Dragon in my blood, Awake!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, a strong shock-wave exploded with her at the center.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwahhhhhhhhg!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ripple of destruction spread out in a circle, and the radius of several dozen meters were destroyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha-ah, ha-ah…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis was dripping with cold sweat. She was breathing hard since he had quickly poured out her magical energy. She did it because the fear of death had crawled up to the back of her neck. If she hadn’t prepared a trump card, her head would have been separated from her neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I knew it, you bastard…. You are a person who’ve studied the forgotten techniques.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis spoke as she covered her face with one hand. She wasn’t just speaking to him. Her voice itself was a magic trying to oppress the opponent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From across the dirt cloud, she heard Azell’s voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Forgotten techniques?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. I know about men like you. They are morons with swords, but they also know how to reach the great wisdom. I’ve watched what you’ve done. You did impossible feats that most others couldn’t replicate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since you are talking like that, it must mean your organization hasn’t forgotten about the knowledge. They must have preserved it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The conversation between the two were a part of the battle. They used their voice in an attempt to over power each other, and they were trying to confuse the other’s senses. At the same time, they were furiously scanning the surrounding for each other’s location.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maybe…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell continued to speak, but she couldn’t see him through the cloud of dust. She could only make out a faint silhouette.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Niberis already knew that the silhouette wasn’t Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…did you guys steal the knowledge from humans?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The voice kept coming from different places.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, the silhouette’s location kept changing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was using her Search magic to chase after his life signature, but Azell wasn’t that easy of an opponent. He was overtly spreading his life signature to various locations. It basically made it impossible for her to determine where he was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis also tried to use his voice to determine where he was. However, Azell was able to bewilder her on that front too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Truthfully, if he said he was a high level magician instead of a Spirit Order practitioner, I would have believed him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis knew high level Spirit Order practitioners were a ludicrous existence. She knew it since her organization also had Spirit Order practitioners who had inherited the lost knowledges.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, Azell was an enigma to Niberis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You, who knew about and performed the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis asked in a quiet voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you really kill a dragon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…what if I did?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s weird. You most definitely possess outstanding techniques. However….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis voiced her doubt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your magical energy is too weak. You might be able to kill a high ranking magician with that quantity of power, but it would be impossible to kill a dragon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Spirit Order practitioners reach a certain level, their magical energy increases proportionally. As a Spirit Order practitioner becomes more skillful, the person can efficiently deal with more magical energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The skills and magical energy shown by Azell was unbalanced. The magical energy couldn’t be compared to Azell’s skill. If Azell didn’t have sufficient magical energy, then it would have been impossible for him to reach such a high skill level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, you were able complete the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual. What method did you use?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I give you an answer, will you let us live?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I might.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you are going to tell a lie, why don’t tell a better one?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m telling you the truth. I’ll guarantee your lives. I promise on my name.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It basically means you are going to imprison us as new recruits.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This negotiation has come to an end.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s a shame.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis really felt regret. Many people wrecked their lives from trying to satisfy their curiosity, and magicians were the front runners in leading such a life. Even Niberis couldn’t’ escape from the magician’s disposition. She felt regret at the fact that she had to kill Azell, who was a box full of mysteries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the dust cloud slowly settled, Niberis decided on how she should act.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hoooooooooooooooh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A whirlwind rose up and the cloud of dust disappeared. At that exact moment, Azell appeared in the front and in the back at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis couldn’t wait any longer, so she cleared the dust cloud. However, Azell was aiming for this opportunity. When she raised a whirlwind, the area around her fuzzed for a brief moment. From inside the dust cloud, Azell had created two clones, and when both were discovered, her attention would focus them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As I suspected.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person who felt a frightening sensation was Azell.</span></p>
