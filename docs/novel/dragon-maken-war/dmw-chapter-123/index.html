 <p>Chapter 123 - Specters from the Past (3)</p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>They are quite interesting figures. &nbsp;Could you perhaps tell me about what the Dragon Demon named Reshoo looked like?</span><span style>”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His hair color was very unique. &nbsp;It was a metallic blue color.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t a color that appears normally amongst humans. &nbsp;No, it is hard to find such coloring even amongst the Dragon Demons…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about your teacher?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He has black hair.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He definitely isn’t the one from my memories. &nbsp;Still, the more I see of your Dragon Arts it reminds me of Reshoo. &nbsp;This also applies to your training method..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m talking about the training method where one receives the drops of water. &nbsp;I taught Reshoo that drill. &nbsp;Of course, I told Reshoo to do it with his kicks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What an interesting coincidence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, it is a training method easily devised by anyone. &nbsp;I guess it can happen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, Reshoo could have taught the drill to someone else, while Azell was asleep. &nbsp;Maybe Leticia’s teacher learned it from Reshoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, Azell couldn't stop thinking about it. &nbsp;Leticia’s martial arts, the way she used her Dragon arts and the basic philosophy she followed was almost identical to the last time he saw Reshoo. &nbsp;If she was completely unrelated to him, she wouldn’t make him have such a visceral reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Of course, it could just be a coincidence….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell let out a bitter laugh. &nbsp;He was obsessing over this problem, because he wanted to meet Reshoo if he was still alive. &nbsp;Reshoo was a Dragon Demon, who hadn’t paid attention to the Dragon Demon war. &nbsp;If one factored in the fact that he was a first generation Dragon Demon, he could still be alive. &nbsp;Azell wanted to meet him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had been thrown into the future by himself. &nbsp;It was a span of 220 years. &nbsp;Of course, he would obsess over someone, who had lived in the same era as him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>3</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s party was moving at high speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had been 10 days since he acquired the White Dragon armor. &nbsp;The party followed the guide’s instruction, and they travelled in a straight line for 400 kilometers. &nbsp;They were able to find another ruin left behind by Carlos. &nbsp;At this point, Azell’s emotions was so complicated it was beyond expression as he looked Yuren.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“After the White Dragon armor, I expected to find some kind of amazing magical instrument…. &nbsp;It’s a skill manual.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The item preserved in this ruin was a form of training method. &nbsp;Carlos’ thought manifestation gave an explanation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The old man Nidel gave this to me for safekeeping instead of leaving behind a will. &nbsp;He said you didn’t wake up before his death, so he said he had won. &nbsp;He wants you to come to his grave later, and he wants you to declare yourself the loser.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>…at that moment, it felt as if Azell’s blood was flowing backwards. &nbsp;Unfortunately, he didn’t have a place to vent his anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘That old man is really….!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The relationship of Azell and Croix Nidel could be described as them being each other’s teacher. &nbsp;Their first meeting occurred when they were at a drinking party. &nbsp;As soon as they met, they started speaking words in an attempt to annoy the other. &nbsp;It escalated into them exchanging blows with their swords. &nbsp;After the end of the fight, they acknowledged each other. &nbsp;They had given recognition to each other for their skills, but they hadn’t developed a close relationship. They didn’t become comrade in arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Croix was the one, who started it. &nbsp;On the next day, he came looking for Azell, and he showed off a technique in front of Azell. &nbsp;Croix sneered as he spoke to Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You are gifted for someone so young, but I bet you can’t do this. &nbsp;You are a valuable talent of the alliance force, so if you bow down to me, I might teach you this technique.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had become angry. &nbsp;He had lived through all sorts of hardship, and he had learned all kinds of techniques from his four teachers. &nbsp;These were skills that couldn’t be replicated by others. &nbsp;He immediately showed off a technique as a counterattack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I acknowledge that your techniques are incredible. &nbsp;However, the times are changing, old man. &nbsp;If we are talking about the latest techniques of Spirit Order, it should be of this caliber. &nbsp;If I learn such an old technique, it’ll be a net loss for me. &nbsp;However, I have respect for someone that still fights by dragging along his old body. &nbsp;I’ll accept the unequal exchange as a sign of respect for you. &nbsp;Shall I teach you what I just did?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>…at that point, the two of them had become angry again. &nbsp;Another fight was inevitable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afterwards, the two of them tried to outdo each other using all of their might. &nbsp;Everyday they kept showing off techniques that would have have made the eyes of normal Spirit Order practitioners spin. &nbsp;They also argued about martial arts and tactics in battle. &nbsp;It was a petty battle for one’s pride, but everyone was flabbergasted when the two of them rapidly increased their skill through these fights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the Dragon Demon war ended, Azell had won. &nbsp;At the time, they had pretty much bottomed out on what they could show each other, yet Azell had been able to get the final word by teaching Croix for the last time. &nbsp;His nose had been in the air, since he had won.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he never expected such a counterattack after 220 years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Shit! &nbsp;That old man didn’t grow up even at his death bed! &nbsp;Moreover, this is cheating! &nbsp;He didn't make this by himself!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t pay back the old man back for sucker punching him like this!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike what he was feeling…. &nbsp;The skill manual possessed a very surprising content.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I never expected such a method could be used to produce Dragon Demon qi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had explained how to produce Dragon Demon qi to Kairen before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was something that arose from oneself through Spirit Order, Dragon Arts or magic rituals. &nbsp;Humans and Dragon Majins could accelerate this process through the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were two ways to shorten this process. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>First, one could receive help from other Dragon Demons or Dragon Majin, who already possessed Dragon Demon qi. &nbsp;This helper had to sacrifice one’s own power by pushing it into a person to create Dragon Demon qi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The second way was to use the corpse of a Dragon. &nbsp;There was a lot of power stored within the corpse of a Dragon. &nbsp;One could bring out this power to accelerate the production of Dragon Demon qi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The manual was talking about a variation of the first method.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This training method is a win-win proposition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, the high ranking Spirit Order practitioner or magician, who possessed Dragon Demon magic, had to sacrifice their power by pouring it into a person. &nbsp;However, if he followed the training method in the manual, both sides would benefit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos had constructed a magical circle, and this device would provide the magical energy. This process was used alongside Dragon Demon qi, and it strengthened the Dragon Demon magic. &nbsp;&nbsp;The participants continuously went through a cycle of acceleration, circulation and amplification.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The participants would receive more output of magical energy compared to the amount they put in. &nbsp;Moreover, the person without the Dragon Demon magic could gradually acquire it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Anyone could come up with this idea, but I would have never expected it to be such a complete product. &nbsp;Moreover, this method increases the Dragon Demon magic by such a large quantity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This training method was a fusion of Spirit Order and magic. &nbsp;Croix Nidel probably came up with the idea, and Carlos took steps to flesh it out. &nbsp;The sensitive part of of the process would have needed to have gone through countless experiments to iron out the kinks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell immediately gathered his party members, and he tried out the training method. &nbsp;He brought out the Sword that Splits the Heavens and the Vitan’s Chalice. &nbsp;He recruited Laura to participate alongside the two Dragon Weapons and the result was….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone became surprised at the efficacy of the method.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…this is incredible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was astonished. The efficacy of the training method increased depending on the participants. &nbsp;Aside from Yuren, everyone either possessed Dragon Demon qi or they were born with natural Dragon Demon magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘At this pace, I might be able to summon the Sword that Splits the Sky without an aid. &nbsp;I won’t have to summon it through the Dragon sword.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It even accelerated his digestion of the Dragon’s power he took using the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems I have the least to gain here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She barely gained anything from this training method. &nbsp;In truth, the vessel that holds her power within her body was almost complete. &nbsp;She would continue to grow in terms of becoming more proficient in technical aspects of being a magician, but she shouldn’t expect her Dragon Demon magic to grow much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the same for Kairen. &nbsp;This training method could only accelerate the process of him making his own Dragon weapon..</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t think so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ll be able to make your own Dragon weapon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura’s expression turned a bit peculiar. &nbsp;Azell asked in puzzlement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…it is nothing. &nbsp;I just never thought about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve always only thought about becoming the inheritor of the Vitain’s Chalice…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If one became the heir of Aunsaurus, one had to inherit the Vitan’s Chalice. &nbsp;This was why she hadn’t even had the choice of making a Dragon weapon through putting in her own effort and time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura mumbled to herself in a dumbfounded manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see. &nbsp;I can make my own Dragon weapon...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an obvious truth, so he found it amusing that she had just realized it. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura burst into laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell grinned as he asked her a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t believe you hadn't thought about that. &nbsp;Did you never get to make decisions for yourself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…not at all?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I look hard enough, I could find minor decisions I had made before on my own. &nbsp;However, all the big decisions were made by my family.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura hadn’t been ordered to look for it, yet she had looked through the old records during her own free time. &nbsp;She also chose to look up and speak to the nameless elder. &nbsp;She had made her own decisions in those instances.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, even as she had those thoughts, she knew her freedom of choice had been within the restrictions placed on her by her family. &nbsp;She wasn’t told what she could do during her free time, but she was told which activities were forbidden to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I think about it, the only real choice I made in my life was to follow you, Azell Zestringer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are making a strange expression.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura had spoken those words as she tilted her head. &nbsp;Azell furrowed his brows. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura started to speak again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know I’m putting you in a tough spot. I’m not sure why you are feeling that way. &nbsp;Did something within my story make you uncomfortable?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…is that how I looked to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell let out &nbsp;a bitter laugh. &nbsp;If anyone else other than Laura had seen his expression, they would have been able to identify the expression on his face. &nbsp;Azell had been feeling pity towards her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘She can’t even identify…. &nbsp;I guess she really did only live her life as a tool.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As time passed, he didn’t know how he should treat her. &nbsp;It made him confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, Laura wasn’t the only one where he didn’t know how he should act.</span></p>
 <p><span style>4</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wouldn’t it be better if you just followed us out in the open? &nbsp;I can rent you a room.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had approached a man camping 100 meters away from the inn where Azell’s party was staying. &nbsp;The man wasn’t asleep. &nbsp;He was sitting in front of the campfire as he ate the soup he had made. &nbsp;He was the Guardian Shadow’s Keeper of Prophecy. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>After their first meeting, Balseru kept a fixed distance away from Azell’s party as he followed them. &nbsp;Unlike the other Guardian Shadows, he didn’t mask his presence. &nbsp;However, when he didn't move, his presence disappeared like a ghost. &nbsp;So there were times when Azell almost lost track of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you for the suggestion, but I’ll have to decline.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why? Are you afraid I’ll stab you in the back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. &nbsp;I don’t want to stab you in the back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean by that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I’m close, I’ll be able to see the members of your party. &nbsp;It’ll be hard for me to suppress my killing intent. &nbsp;I know myself too well”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He spoke those words, but Balseru’s expression and voice didn’t show any signs of emotion. &nbsp;His lack of emotions was almost at the level of Laura, and it felt as if there was a big gulf between them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Balseru spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm. &nbsp;I have to thank you for giving us the information. &nbsp;We are putting it to good use.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you destroyed some of the way-points for the Road of Emptiness?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Currently, we destroyed two locations. &nbsp;My comrades will probably attack the rest in between their travels.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell and Kairen told Balseru about the Road of Emptiness. &nbsp;The Guardian Shadows were unreliable as messengers, but this wasn’t true for the Keepers of the Prophecy. &nbsp;Balseru contacted the Keepers of the Prophecy scattered all over the continent, and they confirmed if Laura’s information was true. &nbsp;Then they started their attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell wondered out loud.</span></p>
