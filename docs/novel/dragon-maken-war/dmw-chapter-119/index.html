 <p>Chapter 119 - Guide's Gift (5)</p>
 <p><span style>‘It is only a recording.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos’ manifestation of thought left behind in the ruins of the Balan Forest was similar to a ghost. &nbsp;It was able to think and converse by itself. &nbsp;On the other hand, this was just a recording. &nbsp;It delivered Carlos image and voice to Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he realized this fact, he felt disappointment wash over him. &nbsp;Even if it was a ghost-like manifestation, he had been excited about being able to converse with his friend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-That fact that you were able to acquire this…. &nbsp;&nbsp;You were able to complete two tasks, and my prediction is heading towards the most positive direction. &nbsp;You were able to find and acquire this item before others could find it. &nbsp;Moreover, you were able to obtain the map from your sleeping place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the ruins of the Balan Forest, Carlos had arranged many things for him within the sleeping place of Azell. &nbsp;However, Azell hadn’t been able to acquire anything except for his Dragon Maken. &nbsp;It would be useless to point out this fact to the manifestation, since it was only a recording.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I don’t know how many of them are left. &nbsp;Please try to acquire all of them. &nbsp;I thought about storing everything in one location, but the risk was too high. &nbsp;This was why I placed the items in various locations when I had the chance. &nbsp;In the past, I always wondered why Magicians kept creating facilities that would be found as ruins by the future generation…. &nbsp;I can now understand why they did it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos’ manifestation let out a bitter laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Ah. &nbsp;I should tell &nbsp;you what this is. &nbsp;I designed it exactly like your White Dragon armor. &nbsp;However, you probably realized at a glance that this isn’t your White Dragon armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a replica of the White Dragon armor. &nbsp;Carlos had made it with the help of his comrades. &nbsp;It was a replica, but it was better than the original.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I spent a good amount of money making this. &nbsp;If you sell this, you’ll be able to buy a castle easily. &nbsp;Ah. &nbsp;That doesn’t mean you should sell it. &nbsp;Only I could have made this armor. &nbsp;It is something you won’t be able to purchase with money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘…….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell couldn't help, but laugh. &nbsp;There were several decades difference between this Carlos and the Carlos he had known, yet Azell couldn’t believe how much he hadn’t changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Azell. &nbsp;I hope what I left behind for you will help you face your future tribulations. &nbsp;My body is old, and I regret that I cannot stand by you during your time of need.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After fulfilling its task, Carlos’ mental manifestation disappeared, and Azell’s consciousness returned to reality. &nbsp;Azell mumbled bitterly as the White Dragon armor easily accepted him with no resistance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>8</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell put on the White Dragon armor immediately. &nbsp;He took off his leather armor, and he recited the keyword….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chul-kuhng! &nbsp;Chul-kuh-kuhng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The White Dragon armor broke apart into pieces, and it reformed perfectly around Azell’s body. &nbsp;When Kairen saw this, his eyes turned round.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Azell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the first time I’ve been jealous of an item you possess.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoo hoo. &nbsp;Even if you say such words, I won’t be giving this to you. &nbsp;I’ve been a bit disappointed at the state of my own defense, but now…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I don’t care about that. &nbsp;It is an armor that can be put on and off automatically. &nbsp;What a revolutionary idea. &nbsp;Shit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A full body armor was always terribly difficult to put on and off &nbsp;Once knights put on their armor in battle, they kept it on even if they became filthy. &nbsp;When one’s bladder was about to burst, knights sometimes contemplated not taking off the armor before going to the restroom. &nbsp;The decision came down to whether the knight wanted to lose his dignity as a human rather than go through the difficult process of taking off the armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For reference, the original White Dragon armor didn’t have the automatic equip function. &nbsp;In the past, Azell had use his Spirit Order’s telekinesis skill to take off his armor. &nbsp;His laziness allowed him to grow in proficiency using that skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Laura spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It really looks the same…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You look like Azell Karzark.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike other people, Laura had actually seen the recorded image of Azell in the Dragon Demon war. &nbsp;Azell already looked eerily like the real Azell Karzark. &nbsp;Now he was wearing an armor of the same design, so it felt as if the figure in the record had appeared in reality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now that I see it, the cape is different.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This cape doesn’t seem special.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the Dragon Demon war, Azell had worn a red magic cape made out of Dragon leather. &nbsp;On the other hand, it seemed Carlos had made this cape using magic when he replicated the White Dragon armor. &nbsp;It wasn’t some amazing object.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Anyways, that guy…. &nbsp;Did his thought process change as he grew older? &nbsp;He made protections against water, heat and even dirt?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would be very hard to dirty this cape, since it had been treated with protection magic. &nbsp;Carlos had also put in an auto-equip function for the armor. &nbsp;Carlos had devised solutions that was strangely practical and convenient. </span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In the past, he usually put performance above all else….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This had been a common complaint from others when they obtained magical items made by Carlos. &nbsp;It felt as if one was complaining on a full stomach when one was able to acquire a valuable magical item made by Carlos. &nbsp;However, what would happen if a person, who showcases a precision style sword art, was given a heavy and thick blade for the sake of performance? &nbsp;Of course, people would have no choice but to complain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How dare a mere human try to raise objection to a rare artificer like me? &nbsp;&nbsp;You don't like my magical item? &nbsp;I bet my magical device hates you too. &nbsp;Just shut up, and you adjust to the magical item. &nbsp;If you don’t like it, I can give it to someone else. &nbsp;I chose to give it to you, and you are rejecting it. &nbsp;I’ll strike you off of my waiting list. &nbsp;Let’s see if your turn comes up before the damn war is over.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>…Carlos had been like that. &nbsp;It felt weird for Azell when he found out that Carlos took into consideration of the user’s comfort and convenience when making this item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell suddenly looked towards Yuren.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is he…….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wondered what the identity of the guide was &nbsp;and why did the guide know about a facility left behind by Carlos? &nbsp;Moreover, how was the guide able to tell Yuren about the methods needed to disable the magic spells protecting this place?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Maybe, this is Carlos’.... &nbsp;Did he arrange this too?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>That thought came to him. &nbsp;Of course, he didn’t have any evidence to support it…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, he looked at Yuren, who had stated that he was Carlos’ descendant. &nbsp;He looked so much like Carlos that Azell couldn’t help, but think about Carlos from his lifetime.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren had a big smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you thinking? &nbsp;Do you like it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had a complicated expression on his face as he looked at Yuren. &nbsp;He nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you. &nbsp;This is the best present ever.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the very least, he liked the present that had been prepared for him, so he was forced to admit it. &nbsp;There was the armor that reminded him of his past, and he had encountered the mental manifestation left behind by Carlos…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>9</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their business here was taken care of, so there was no reason to stay long in this place. &nbsp;The party immediately exited the cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You all came out much faster than I had expected. &nbsp;This looked like a well hidden ruin, so I worried maybe I would have to wait a couple days for you guys to come out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A stranger was sitting on top of a boulder with his chin propped up on his hands. &nbsp;Azell was startled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Who the hell is this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was most definitely a human. &nbsp;However, Azell hadn’t sensed his presence even though they were only 10 meters apart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man looked to be in his mid to late 30s. &nbsp;He had long brown hair and a beard. &nbsp;His entire body was encased in metal armor, so he looked to be a knight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The weird thing about him was his eyes. &nbsp;He had his face towards Azell, but his eyes were closed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Before I introduce myself… &nbsp;I’ll prove that I don’t have any ill intentions towards you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the sound of children whispering could be heard in the surrounding. &nbsp;Guardian Shadows appeared in various locations. &nbsp;They were wearing white robes, but there was a incomprehensible darkness within the robes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw them, Azell realized something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This bastard is similar to the Guardian Shadows.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was sure this man possessed a living body. &nbsp;However, he was able to thin his presence like the Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;He was able to avoid detection from Azell’s senses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, there was a condition. &nbsp;He had to be still. &nbsp;When the man stood up, his presence could be sensed by Azell. &nbsp;His presence was still weak, but it was detectable. &nbsp;Moreover...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He is one of the Keepers of the Prophecy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell could identify a Keeper of the Prophecy at a glance now. &nbsp;This man was also letting out the scent of Dragon Demon magic like Leone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He still had his eyes closed as he approached Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m a Keeper of the Prophecy for the Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;My name is Balseru. &nbsp;This is the first time we are meeting face to face. &nbsp;You are Azell Zestringer, who might be the long awaited figure from our prophecy”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke as he watched him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It doesn’t matter if it it is the Dragon Demon king worshippers or you guys. &nbsp;Everyone keeps attaching long and annoying disclaimers to my name, but I think I’m getting used to it now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you don’t like it, I’ll shorten it. &nbsp;Do you mind me calling you sir Azell?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So should I be calling you sir Balseru?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can call me whatever you want. &nbsp;It has been 50 years, since I’ve last worked as a knight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was taken aback by his words. &nbsp;Balseru looked to me in his mid-30s on the outside, yet he was that old?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…so you are the same as Leone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;Our time stopped when we became the Keepers of the Prophecy. &nbsp;It has been a long time, since we’ve faced our death as humans.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t look like an Undead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I do the work that can’t be done by corpses.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You already know my answer to your question.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Basically, you won’t tell me anything until you confirm that I’m the prophesied person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, all right. &nbsp;Why did you come looking for me? &nbsp;Are you here to complain about Laura?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell looked at the nearby Guardian Shadows as he spoke. &nbsp;They were showing open hostility towards Laura. &nbsp;It was as if they wanted to attack Laura at that moment, and it was clear they were holding back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are very dissatisfied, but we respect your decision. &nbsp;If you are revealed not to be the person in the prophecy, we’ll take care of her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ho-oh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“At the very least, you should withdraw your killing intent since we aren’t here to fight. &nbsp;I feel the same as all the Guardian Shadows here, and I’m trying very hard not to show it…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your tone of voice makes it sound as if you are trying to pick a fight with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it was harsh to your ears, I apologize. &nbsp;This is only an excuse, but all the Keepers of the Prophecy had lost everything to the Dragon Demon King worshippers. &nbsp;This is why it is difficult for us to act rationally in front of Dragon Demon king worshippers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He spoke such words, but his voice was as calm as ever. &nbsp;This dissonance was so stark that it made Azell more wary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…it seems I’m making you more agitated by speaking. &nbsp;Let’s get to the main reason I’m here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m here to deliver an important information. &nbsp;It isn’t a guarantee that you’ll be able to understand a Guardian Shadow, so I am here to deliver it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed the Keepers of the prophecy were well aware of the fact that Guardian Shadows were poor messengers. &nbsp;Azell and Kairen agreed with this sentiment a hundred fold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Plain of Darkness has revived the Dragon Demon General Reygus as an Undead. &nbsp;Moreover, he is powerful. &nbsp;He is on a different level compared to the other Undeads.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was taken aback. &nbsp;However, his shock couldn’t be compared to the one he felt after listening to Balseru’s next words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He asked us a question. &nbsp;He asked us where we are hiding Carlos.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…Carlos?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was as if he knew Carlos was still alive in some shape or form. &nbsp;Do you have any conjectures regarding this issue, sir Azell?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was dumbfounded, but Azell’s gaze unconsciously fell on a single person. &nbsp;His gaze headed towards Yuren, who had a surprised expression on his face.</span></p>
