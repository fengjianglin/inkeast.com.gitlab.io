 <p>Chapter 134 - Fallen Demon (4)</p>
 <p><span style>5</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell immediately opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The explosion had occurred from a very far distance. &nbsp;If he went up to the surface, the explosion would have occurred about 2 kilometers away. &nbsp;&nbsp;However, the explosion was powerful enough to deliver a shockwave to their location.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a Dragon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How do you know that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia asked him a question. &nbsp;Azell answered her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We were told an Earth Dragon lives nearby. &nbsp;I can feel the power of an Earth Dragon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had a wealth of experience at fighting against Dragons. &nbsp;Azell was underground, but he was able to use his Absolute Sense to identify the power being used on the surface. &nbsp;Soon, the intermittent rumble turned into a powerful tremor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-roo-roong……!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone had to admit Azell was right. &nbsp;The powerful magical wave assaulted the senses of the party members, who were still underneath the surface. &nbsp;It was undeniable that the source was a Dragon’s Roar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Dragon is fighting something. &nbsp;The opponent is strong enough where a Dragon had to use a Dragon’s Roar…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t feel the energy of another Dragon, so it wasn’t a fight between Dragons. &nbsp;Azell focused a bit more to expand his senses. &nbsp;Soon, he was able to zero in on a very fierce fluctuation of power that was weaker than the Dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems either a Dragon Majin or a Dragon Demon is fighting against the Dragon. &nbsp;It is a one on one fight. &nbsp;By the look of it, I don’t have a good feeling about this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is a high probability that it’s an officer from the Plain of Darkness attempting the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia spoke with a cold voice. &nbsp;She couldn't think of any other possibilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems Balseru was right. &nbsp;In the end, they caught scent of our tracks, and they’ve pursued us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We did show ourselves at the border, so it was inevitable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At Kairen’s words, Azell tilted his head in puzzlement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still, this is way too fast. &nbsp;No, wait a moment. &nbsp;They might not have pinpointed our location. &nbsp;&nbsp;They might have decided to conduct a Dragon Slayer’s Ritual, since they were nearby….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-roo-roo-roong!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a powerful tremor was felt by the party. &nbsp;It was like an earthquake. &nbsp;It shook so fiercely that it wouldn’t have been strange to see the ruin crumble. &nbsp;This fact made everyone’s hair stand on end. &nbsp;Since they were underground, the destruction of the ruin would bury them. &nbsp;They would be helpless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell grinded his teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koohk! &nbsp;It seems we’ve been found. &nbsp;They are being quite bold. &nbsp;&nbsp;Let us all head out immediately! &nbsp;If we stay here, we’ll be buried!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren was taken aback, so he turned to look at Balserk. &nbsp;They still hadn’t heard the knowledge that was tasked to be delivered to them by Balserk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-goo-goo-goong!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, they had run out of time. &nbsp;Another explosion went off on the surface as the aftershock rocked the ground. &nbsp;It was clear that their enemies were aiming for them, who were underneath the surface of the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone get out first. &nbsp;I’ll stay behind to listen to the message.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you crazy? &nbsp;Even if it is you, you will die here if this place craters.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instead of answering Yuren’s words, he raised his Dragon Demon magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Rise Dragon Weapon! &nbsp;Vitan’s Chalice!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The light dispersed as the Vitan’s Chalice appeared next to Azell. &nbsp;Azell spoke as he pointed at it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since I have this, I don’t have to worry about that occurring. &nbsp;Since our location was found, there is a high probability that they’ve also found the entrance. &nbsp;I’ll create a path where you’ll be able to come out through a roundabout manner. &nbsp;Get ready for battle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell immediately used the power of the Vitan’s Chalice to create the Path of Tears. &nbsp;The tear-like distortion gathered in a single location before it started to extend forward. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It created a hole in the ceiling. &nbsp;It was as if the physical wall was non-existent in front of dimensional distortion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let us go make a scene first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Leticia spoke those words, she kicked off the ground to jump upwards. &nbsp;Kairen immediately followed behind her. &nbsp;Yuren and Laura looked back at Balserk with regret before they flew into the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Azell was alone with Balserk, he asked it a question..</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since we don’t have much time, I’ll just listen only to the pertinent information. &nbsp;What do you have to tell me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I wanted my end to come… &nbsp;Now that I’m staring it in the face, I do feel a bit of regret. &nbsp;It’s a funny thing.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balserk laughed in its skeletal form. &nbsp;Then it spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;However, I can’t pass up this opportunity, so let’s end this.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop beating around the bush. &nbsp;I dont’ have the time to wait this out. &nbsp;Hurry up and speak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;All right. &nbsp;What I have to tell you is….&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balserk spoke with a bitter voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;The truth about the Demon race.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countless magicians over the ages had puzzled over this topic. &nbsp;One of the secrets of this world was about to be unraveled in front of Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>6</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen had followed the Path of Tears to arrive at the surface, and he took stock of his current location. &nbsp;He furrowed his brows when he realized there was a battle going on around 500 meters away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s the Guardian Shadows.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were several dozen Guardian Shadows fighting fiercely against the Dragon Demon king worshippers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru had continued to follow Azell’s party, and they had clashed against the Dragon Demon king worshippers, who had been assaulting the entrance of the ruin. &nbsp;Kairen couldn’t tell how many of Dragon Demon king worshippers were here, but it seemed the Guardian Shadows weren’t willing to turn a blind eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The party immediately rushed towards the battlefield. &nbsp;However, it happened at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A clear pillar of light rose up into the air in the middle of the battlefield. &nbsp;The clear light didn't hurt the eyes, but it weirdly drew one’s eyes towards it. &nbsp;Moreover….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ggwah-gwa-gwa-gwang!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A terrifying power exploded forth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it the Dragon’s Roar?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No. &nbsp;The presence of the Dragon was far away, and there was no sign of a Roar. &nbsp;However, the shockwave that was riding across the land was oppressive. &nbsp;It reminded one of a Dragon’s Roar. &nbsp;Kairen was 300 meters away, but the ground he was standing on was upended. &nbsp;An incredible amount of force rammed into his shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A big cloud of dust rose into the air as a violent gusts of wind blew. &nbsp;A being letting out an incredible amount of magical energy exited from within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You guys are quite good. &nbsp;I’m not sure what method you are using, but you’ve suppressed my power to this degree. I’m flabbergasted. &nbsp;I was only able to use half of my power.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a voice of an Undead. &nbsp;When he heard its words, Kairen was dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What nonsense is it spouting? This is only half of its power?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A conical shaped shock wave formed starting from where the power had originated. &nbsp;It upended an entire forest. &nbsp;It wasn’t just an high intensity earthquake. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the violent gust of wind revealed the figure within the cloud of dust, Kairen thought maybe it had been telling the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that perhap Reygus?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon Undead was enormous. &nbsp;It almost reached 3 meter in height, and it held a massive white battle hammer that was 2 meters long. &nbsp;The amount of ominous magical energy emitted from it clearly put it above Kairen’s level. &nbsp;From its appearance, the Undead was clearly the legendary Dragon Demon general Reygus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus’ gaze headed towards Kairen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;New customers have arrived. &nbsp;Were you all sent out to stall us? &nbsp;I don’t see the red-haired human amongst you.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus tilted his head in puzzlement. &nbsp;The Guardian Shadows nearby started to whisper noisily. They were blown away by the strike applied by the head of the hammer, but almost none of them were extinguished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;As expected, the Guardian Shadows are quite sturdy. &nbsp;Moreover, they have the ability to suppress my power.... &nbsp;I really am curious about what you guys are. &nbsp;If the little brat Carlos made you guys, he really created something marvelous.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus looked unsatisfied as it grumbled. &nbsp;It turned to look to the side, and one could see Balseru covered in dust.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen was surprised when he spotted Balseru. &nbsp;Until now, Balseru had kept his eyes shut. &nbsp;They were open now. &nbsp;His eyes were dark blue, and they were emitting a strange energy. &nbsp;The energy wasn’t directly affecting Kairen, but a shiver went up his spine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is that?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flame erupted from the air, and it swept over Reygus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus received the attack with the head of his hammer as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;That was lukewarm.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Then I’ll prepare something hot for you.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another Undead answered Reygus. &nbsp;Kairen saw a Fire type Undead magician wearing floating above Balseru. &nbsp;It wore a flowing black robe. &nbsp;For a moment, Kairen thought it was Theta, who had accompanied Leone. &nbsp;Soon, it was obvious that it was some other being. &nbsp;Moreover….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ggwah-gwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone had rushed forward like a gale, and an enormous double edged axe fell towards Reygus. &nbsp;The black double edged axe was infused with powerful magic, and it was so heavy that a normal person wouldn’t be able to raise it. The enormous warrior wearing armor swung it at high speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Reygus easily blocked the attack. After the weapons impacted on each other, the shockwave actually caused the attacker to be flung away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Koohk!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Quit it. &nbsp;It seems you’ve made yourself a name as someone that's pretty strong. &nbsp;It doesn’t matter if it is the past or the present. &nbsp;No one can boast their strength in front of me.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regyus derided his opponent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The one wielding the double edged axe was also an Undead. &nbsp;By the look of the magic infused weapon and armor it possessed, it was an Undead that accompanied the Keepers of Prophecy. &nbsp;It was almost 2 meters tall, and it possessed an enormous body frame. &nbsp;However, it looked like a dwarf in front of Reygus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Undead wielding the double edged axe spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Alpha! &nbsp;What happened? &nbsp;Why is this bastard unaffected?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sure it is being influenced by my eyes. &nbsp;However, I cannot completely suppress it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;…your eyes are suppressing its power, yet it is this strong? &nbsp;Impossible.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unfortunately, it is so. &nbsp;Phi and Rho. &nbsp;Please join force with the Dragon Sword Duk’s party.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Fire Magician Phi and the Double Edged Axe Undead Rho were sleepless guardians, who had taken on codenames.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if their words were amusing, flame burned brighter from within the eye sockets of its Skull.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Ho-oh. &nbsp;You are the Dragon Sword Duke? &nbsp;It is nice to meet you. &nbsp;I wanted to meet you once.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since the legendary Dragon Demon general is saying such sentiments….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Kairen rushed forward. &nbsp;In the middle of his speech, he had used Instantaneous Movement in an attempt to take his opponent unawares. &nbsp;His Dragon sword struck out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is an honor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time his words ended, his left sword was blocked by the head of the battle hammer, and an explosive sound rang out. &nbsp;It was a powerful strike that could have blown away a house, yet it was blocked so easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Kairen wasn’t flustered. &nbsp;In the first place, this strike had been a bait. &nbsp;He used exquisite timing to stab his right sword towards an opening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Hoo!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a flash, Reygus accelerated. &nbsp;It used its ability to react instantly to use a movement technique, and before Kairen’s right sword could accelerate fully, Reygus deflected the blade to the side using the shoulder region of its armor. &nbsp;Then it immediately stomped with a tree-trunk like leg.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ggwah-gwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>An explosion rang out, and the nearby surface was upended. &nbsp;From the top to the bottom, it had brought down its foot at an oblique angle. &nbsp;When it impacted the surface, a circular shockwave exploded forth with Reygus at the center. &nbsp;Leticia had been aiming for a delayed attack. &nbsp;She was sent flying alongside Kairen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Kairen righted himself, he felt terrified. &nbsp;Reygus had broken through the dust cloud, and it was charging towards him. &nbsp;It used Instantaneous Movement to close the distance in a flash, and it brought down its hammer. &nbsp;&nbsp;It was a heroic looking attack, but the movement was large. &nbsp;That is why there were a lot of openings to the attack. &nbsp;Kairen coldly let out an attack in response…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ggwah-gwa-gwa-gwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>An explosive sound rang out, and he was flung backwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-uhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon sword shook as if it was about to break, and he felt a shock hit his internal organs. When their attacks converged, he hadn’t been able to fully offset the shock. </span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This bastard is strangely subtle with his moves!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he attacked an opening, Reygus’ speed increased again by a beat, and it was able to turn away his attack. &nbsp;Then the path of the dynamic strike by the hammer started to change in subtle ways. &nbsp;It became an attack that couldn’t be avoided. &nbsp;Kairen had no choice, but to meet the attack with an attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Bone of Soul Seal! &nbsp;Run amok once again!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>A clear light once again extended into the sky. &nbsp;When the light returned, the battle hammer was burning white in a blinding fashion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Kairen knew this was the worst case scenario. &nbsp;By looking at the result of its previous attack, he would die if he put up a sloppy defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If so!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen gave up on defense, and he focused only on his attack. &nbsp;His dual swords let out a white glow, and he chanted out a command infused with Dragon Demon magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh Dragon swords. &nbsp;Burn away the evil fire!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His sword strike held his deadly will. &nbsp;It split through the air as it let forth a terrifying light. &nbsp;It happened at the same time as Reygus brought down its hammer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ggwah-gwa-gwa-gwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything that could be seen was burning white. &nbsp;The Dragon weapon had the power to split even a mountain, and it was comparable in power to a Dragon’s Roar. &nbsp;The enormous explosion flooded into the surrounding.</span></p>
