 <p>Chapter 125 - Specters from the Past (5)</p>
 <p><span style>5</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Plain of Darkness was large. &nbsp;It was a land of demons unsullied by the hands of humans. &nbsp;Within this vast piece of land, the Dragon Demon king worshippers had gathered around the Dragon Demon palace left behind by Atein. &nbsp;They used the castle as base as they expanded outwards. &nbsp;They had used humans slaves to build buildings, and now there was a small kingdom within these lands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This place was a frozen land. &nbsp;Unless there was a good reason to live here like them, no one would live in such an infertile land. &nbsp;No one would want to build a civilization here. &nbsp;Everything was frozen year round, and when there was a blizzard, even those with superhuman powers declined to travel far.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hoo-ooooooooh…….</span></p>
 <p><span style>The snow was coming down. &nbsp;If one looked out into the Plain of Darkness, an incredible amount of snow had fallen. &nbsp;It made one’s jaw fall wide open. &nbsp;If someone tried to walk through this, the person would become a snowman within dozen steps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there was someone walking through the snow right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an odd sight. &nbsp;The person buried under the one meter of snow wasn’t human. &nbsp;A being that looked like a pile of snow was plowing forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-You are cute, Reygus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a faint illusion-like figure floating around the large pile of snow. &nbsp;The silhouette of a person within the falling snow made the figure look like an ice fairy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus, who had become a pile of snow, gave a reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Cute? &nbsp;What about me is cute?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-The fact that you don’t know you are cute makes you more cute. &nbsp;I think you became cuter in death. &nbsp;If I wasn’t married to the king, I probably would have wanted to be in your embrace. &nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, it is a dream that can never be fulfilled. &nbsp;Too bad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Your thoughts has become more unfathomable after death, Queen Kayalia.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Mmm. &nbsp;I thought about it for a long time, but I want you to drop the formality. &nbsp;Don’t call me by my title as queen. &nbsp;I’ve been dead for a very long time, so I don’t want to be called by my title as queen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white silhouette chortled as she laughed. &nbsp;If one looked at the figure bobbing up and down in the snow, one would see a 14 or 15 year old girl in human standards. &nbsp;However, she had white blonde hair that looked to have been melted out from the snow, and one could see a boulder-gray colored horn protruding from between her hair. &nbsp;Her ears were long, and the back of her hand had a slate gray colored Dragon Demon stone. &nbsp;It was the same color as her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus brushed the snow away from his face as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Then what do you want me to call you by?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Just call me Kayalia. &nbsp;In exchange, I’ll call you oppa. &nbsp;What do you say?</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It is such an attractive offer that I won’t be able to say no to your request. &nbsp;All right, Kayalia.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Yes, Reygus oppa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Oh, that has a beautiful ring to it. &nbsp;Still, you really do speak a lot for a dead person. &nbsp;This is especially true compared to when you were alive.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Your guess is as good as mine as to why. &nbsp;Anyways, you are the only one that can see and hear me. &nbsp;The best way to drive away loneliness is to talk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Couldn’t you choose to speak to others even if it isn’t me?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I have to use those opportunities sparingly. &nbsp;If possible, I have to keep my existence a secret. &nbsp;That is why I have to think hard on who I can converse with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It is coming into sight.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Reygus spoke. &nbsp;He could see the majestic sight of the Dragon Demon castle across the hill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kayalia had been one of queens married to the Dragon Demon king Atein 220 years ago. &nbsp;She looked at the dim figure of &nbsp;the Dragon Demon castle as she asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Is that place similar to the towns we saw along the way?</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It is worse.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I see. &nbsp;Aincera unni was always a strict person. &nbsp;She has become much more rigid in her ways, so I can see why things are like this under her rule.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You are still calling her unni?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Of course. &nbsp;She hates it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You are still quite twisted. &nbsp;The fact that you haven’t changed even in your death is a good thing.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-The fact that oppa can say such words makes you sound more twisted than me. &nbsp;Anyways, we fought to create a really boring world. &nbsp;The king had wanted this, and I wonder if I automatically agreed to it just because he wanted it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Please don’t speak such words in places where others can hear you. &nbsp;Many people within the castle worship him as if he was a god.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-A god… &nbsp;I’m not thrilled about that either. &nbsp;Well, I always did hate all of them. &nbsp;Now that I have no responsibility I can be free to show my disdain towards them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kayalia laughed like a immature human girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a while, Reygus had left the Dragon Demon castle, and he had toured the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;He had wanted to see how much the world had changed, but his real goal was to find Kayalia, who was stuck to him now. &nbsp;Atein had prepared a contingency plan for her too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Plain of Darkness had been isolated from the world 220 years ago. &nbsp;It was a microcosm of the world they had wanted to create through the Dragon Demon war. &nbsp;The Dragon Demons ranked at the top, the Dragon Majin was placed at the middle, and the humans were placed at the bottom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The atmosphere around such a society wasn’t anything too special. &nbsp;The religious zealots had made a deep impression on the society, and the human societies were seen as replaceable spare parts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, in truth, everything had become worse. &nbsp;Atein had become deified, and the zealots had created an excessively static society. &nbsp;As time passed, an irrational madness was being added to the mix, and the members of the society didn’t resist against it. &nbsp;They silently conformed to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Everything was always the same. &nbsp;We all despaired at that fact.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-In truth, I thought it sounded like a pipe dream even in the past… &nbsp;First, the Dragon Demon race are in the wrong right now. &nbsp;They took only the parts they liked about the king’s ideals, and they made their own extreme interpretations. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kayalia knew the entirety of Atein’s plan, since she closely aided Atein. &nbsp;She understood him. &nbsp;This was why she knew that the system adopted by the current Plain of Darkness was far from what Atein’s plan intended. &nbsp;She sighed at this fact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘When one makes a group, it is the nature of life to divide the group based on their merits and demerits. &nbsp;The Dragon Demons are clearly superior to the humans as a specie. &nbsp;It is logical to put them in the ruling class. &nbsp;This would control the ambitions of the Dragon Demons, since they would have to carry out an increasing load of tasks to maintain the society. &nbsp;This in turn would develop respect for them from the members of the society. &nbsp;&nbsp;In this society, humans will all be considered to be equal. &nbsp;They won’t have to go through the pains of dealing with differences in station, wealth or physical stature. &nbsp;There would be no reason why humans would look down on other humans.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>…this was the basic outline of Atein’s plan. &nbsp;At a glance, the society built within the Plain of Darkness looked similar to his plan. &nbsp;However, it was completely different once one saw the details.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the current Plain of Darkness, the Dragon Demons held the same position as human nobles. &nbsp;They held most of the power, and they considered humans to be of low rank. &nbsp;Human were considered to be inferior to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;Even worse, the Dragon Demons further divided themselves based on bloodlines and origin…. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>In doing so, they were acting in the same way as the humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Atein hadn’t chosen the ‘ruling class’ for this purpose. &nbsp;The only part that coincided with the original plan was the fact that they were running the society. &nbsp;Still, now that she thought about it, the ‘ruling class consisting of the Dragon Demon race’ was an illusion that couldn’t exist in the real world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I’m curious about something, oppa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;What is it?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-During the war, didn’t we believe this was the answer that would eradicate sadness from this world?</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;We did.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Kayalia talked about the ‘boring world’, she was talking about societal structure of the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;It was devised as an answer to Atein’s plan for an ideal society. &nbsp;It was also the result of his followers interpreting his words as they pleased. &nbsp;Atein and the Dragon Demon Generals had thought this rank structure would eradicate all sadness and tragedy from this world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Had they been wrong?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kayalia sat on Reygus’ shoulder as she mimed putting her chin on her hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Do you think things would have been different if the king won and he had a direct hand in ruling them?</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I’m not sure. &nbsp;In the end, if the king was able realize his goal, I don’t think it would have turned out all too differently.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Do you think he would have acknowledged his failure?</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;’I thought I knew everything about the humans, yet I didn’t know anything about them. &nbsp;This is why I will try to learn about them from now on.’ &nbsp;The king spoke those words.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-He was so grand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Mmm?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Every work he undertook was incredibly large in scale. &nbsp;He achieved great achievements, yet his mistakes were big too. He also caused a lot of harm… &nbsp;This was why I thought he was a bit cute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;…I’m not sure how you can come to such a conclusion..&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-It’s all right. &nbsp;You can continue to not understand me. &nbsp;This is why oppa is a cute person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;……&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus brushed off the snow on his head as he asked the question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I have a question I want to ask you.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-What is it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;How did you die?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Mmm? &nbsp;I lost in a fight. &nbsp;Oppa died before me, so why are you speaking to me in such a tone?</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Queen Aincera told me about it. &nbsp;While they escaped from the Dragon Horn fortress, you went missing along the way. &nbsp;What happened?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Jeez. &nbsp;That unni is really...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kayalia pouted. &nbsp;She threw her body into the air as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I just hated everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You hated everything?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I wanted to quit everything. &nbsp;I was originally a human. &nbsp;At one time, I thought the human race was the worst, but it was true that there were some I liked amongst them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kayalia’s eyes unfocused as she looked towards her past. &nbsp;She was Atein’s consort, but she had also been one of his disciples. &nbsp;This was why she was a very special existence amongst the entirety of the Dragon Demon king’s army.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I continued to do work I hated, because of my station. &nbsp;We fought to erase the sadness from this world, but it looked as if we were causing more people to cry. &nbsp;Azell oppa told me that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Azell oppa? &nbsp;Are you perhaps talking about Azell Karzark?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus was surprised as he looked at Kayalia.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-That’s right. &nbsp;He didn’t want me to call him ahjussi, so I call him oppa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You called him that?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I wasn’t able to call him that in front of him, but that is what I called him inside my heart. &nbsp;Azell oppa. &nbsp;The fact that I had to fight a life and death battle with him made me very sad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Huh-uh. &nbsp;I didn’t know you two had such a relationship.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-No one knew about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Hmm. &nbsp;I never knew you had a hidden story such as this. &nbsp;It is quite interesting.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-A woman is supposed to have a lot of secrets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I would like to hear the long version of it later. &nbsp;All right. &nbsp;What did he say?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-He asked me how high I had stacked the mountain of corpses with my hands. &nbsp;He asked me if I knowingly did what I did.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It is something we commonly hear.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Isn’t it? &nbsp;If it was anyone else, I would have ignored it. &nbsp;However, when that oppa said those words, it stabbed right through my heart. &nbsp;He had the eyes of a real hero. &nbsp;He looked like someone, who had immediately ran forward to save the world that had been broken by us. &nbsp;At that moment, I realized I shouldn’t continue to do what I hate when I could see the result of my actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kayalia continued to float in the air as she gathered her knees to herself. &nbsp;She spun in the air as snowflakes blew around her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Did you lose on purpose?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I didn’t lose on purpose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Are you sure?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Jeez, oppa. &nbsp;You were defeated by him too, so why are you asking such a question?</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Mmm. &nbsp;Weren’t you supposed to be special?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-At the time, Azell oppa was ridiculously strong. &nbsp;Even the king lost in a bout with him. &nbsp;I didn’t lose on purpose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I’m a bit suspicious about that point.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-You didn’t see the true power of Azell oppa. &nbsp;After you died, he continued to grow at a frightening pace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I admit his growth speed was extraordinary. &nbsp;Well, all right. &nbsp;Let’s set that aside…. &nbsp;You didn’t have to go missing and die by yourself, right?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-You speak the truth. &nbsp;However, our defeated army were basically in a trance. &nbsp;It was as if everyone had gone half-mad according to the the words they spoke. &nbsp;I became annoyed when I heard them, so I got out of there. &nbsp;Then I died. &nbsp;If I look back on it, it was such a dumb way to die… &nbsp;I do regret it a little bit. &nbsp;I’ve thought about it, and I should have come to this place. &nbsp;I should have exited after I secured my safety. &nbsp;However, at the time, I didn’t have the presence of mind to…. &nbsp;It was only &nbsp;when I died that I came to my sense, and I heard the king’s will.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;So that is how you were able to jump 220 years like me. &nbsp;However, why have you taken on such a form?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I didn’t want to become an Undead. &nbsp;I told him I would hate to become a Skeleton. &nbsp;I threw a tantrum saying he should respect a girl’s wish.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;…that sounds absurd, but at the same time, it is so like you.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-He wanted to overwork me even after death. &nbsp;Shouldn’t I be able get my way in such matters?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of air exiting Reygus’ skull could be heard. &nbsp;It seemed he couldn’t break the habit of laughing as if he was still alive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Kayalia asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Do you really think Azell oppa is alive?</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Maybe.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-How could this be?</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I know. &nbsp;I have circumstantial evidences, but I am having a hard time confirming it.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-If you are planning on meeting him, please arrange it so I can talk to him. &nbsp;I’ll go meet him looking very beautiful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I hope you aren’t planning on telling me you won’t lending me your power when that time comes.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I’ll think about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;…uh-ee?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I’m already dead. &nbsp;I’m free from all obligations. &nbsp;I can choose to help or not. &nbsp;Even the king gave me leave to do what I want.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;That hopeless guy…….&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus grumbled. &nbsp;Kayalia put her face next to his as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-So when are you going to meet him to confirm it is him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Since he exited the reaches of the information network of the Plain of Darkness, I had to use my own method. &nbsp;I’ll be able to find his whereabouts soon.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I look forward to it. &nbsp;Ah, what face should I put on when I meet him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;…I don’t care if you don’t help me, but please don’t betray me. &nbsp;I’ll be wounded.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I’ll see how oppa acts. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kayalia stuck out her tongue, and she disappeared as if she melted into the thin air.</span></p>
