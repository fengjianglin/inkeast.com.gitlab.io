  <p><span style><span style><span style>Chapter 3 - Azell Zestringer (3)</span></span></span></p>
  <p></p>
  <hr>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>Currently, Azell looked a lot better than before after he was re-hydrated. However, he still looked like a monster.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The soldier, who was guiding Azell, spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Centurion Giles wants you to give him check up.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Check up?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell tilted his head to one side. He had no idea what this word was.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Previously, he trained his ears to listen to the words spoken around his surrounding, and it was a common occurrence for him to not understand the words. The diction and intonation were the almost identical to what he knew. In his perspective, it seemed like he was persistently hearing a segment of a dialect, and within that he heard words he didn’t know mixed in it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>An example was ‘army doctor’. In Azell’s time, this post of army doctor did not exist in the army. A priest, who had learned the healing arts from the temple, followed the army around.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was the same with the word ‘check up’. When a healer looked at a patient, there never was a specialized term for it. Therefore, whenever Azell heard their conversation, he had a strange delayed reaction as if he had a hard time understanding it. It was because he was trying to guess the meaning of the words he didn’t know.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘What’s happening? Is it because I’m somewhere I have never visited before? Or….’</span></p>
  <p><span style>While Azell was thinking on this, the army doctor spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmm. Who is this person and where did you bring him from?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That is….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The soldier sparked explaining the circumstances. The army doctor frowned.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Did he get experimented on with some kind of black magic?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After hearing this, Azell started thinking.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘That’s not bad?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>He could say he was kidnapped by a black magician. He was experimented on and it was something akin to torture. This caused him to be in this state, and he couldn’t remember who he was. He could remember his name, but everything else was fuzzy and fragmented….</span></p>
  <p><span style>It would be a good enough excuse. It should be way more effective than giving the straightforward account of the truth?</span></p>
  <p><span style>The army doctor, who was looking at Azell with a bit of a frightful expression, put his hand on Azell’s forehead. From the end of his hand, a warm light rose up and it was absorbed into Azell’s body.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘He is a healing expert.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Healing experts are an existence that is considered to be a variant of magicians. Normally, they would accumulate specially made medicine inside their body, and they were able to combine it with magical force to manifest it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I don’t think he is a priest…’</span></p>
  <p><span style>In Azell’s time, all the healing experts were the temple’s priests and there weren’t that many of them. However, the man in front of his eyes did not seem to have the occupation of a cleric.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Did a healing expert, who was not a priest, apply to the army and secure an appointment as the army doctor?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was interesting. Before Azell fell asleep, only the temple’s priests could use the healing arts, so they were respected even by people of high status. However right now, this man was not treated that way.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Soon, the army doctor clicked his tongue.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“How is he alive when he is in such a state?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The healing experts could tell the state of the other’s body by contact. Moreover, they could provide healing power to treat wounds and diseases.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The army doctor understood the state Azell was in and it was a miracle that he was even alive.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Also, he was able to maintain consciousness and walk on his own. He defied logic.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After being dumbfounded, he spoke to the soldier.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You. This person…. He doesn’t need anything except water and also feed him something.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“He is in a state of extreme starvation. It is cannot say as to how he is able to maintain his consciousness. After seeing his terrible state, didn’t you think about that?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That is… I was too scared to think about that.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I guess he does look more like a monster than a human.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was slightly wounded by the army doctor’s words. They were calling him a monster, but his body had received the adulation of women once.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Go to the kitchen and ask them to make something easily digestible. Something similar to a soup.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Understood.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Also, bring it here since this person would have a hard time moving.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes. However, he was able to walk here just fine…..”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“So he didn’t look like he was having a hard time?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The soldier had nothing to say to those words.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After the soldier left, the army doctor spoke to Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Do you want to drink some water?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell hurriedly nodded his head. Even though he had drunk a lot of water, it was still insufficient.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The army doctor spoke to him after seeing Azell carefully drink the water.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I don’t know who you are, but don’t over do it even if you have learned the Spirit Order.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It’s scary, so don’t look at me that way. I’m a healing expert. I, at the very least, know what my patient practices.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘No, I didn’t look at you like that to make you scared….’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell had only looked at the army doctor with an amused gazed. However, the army doctor mistook it for a defensive glare.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘How messed up am I…..’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Now he wanted to see himself at least once. Azell spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Large dish… Could you… give me some water….?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmmm? Why? No, never mind. I’ll give it to you.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The army doctor stopped Azell from arduously answering back and he filled the wash basin with water. Azell flinched at the reflection he saw of his face on the surface.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Waa, I’m like a real monster?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>He felt like it was fair that he was being treated like a monster. He wanted to give praise to Giles’ personality, because he had treated him like a person from the first time he saw him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Shit. Where did my body that was like a marble statue go to…’</span></p>
  <p><span style>He thought about how he looked like in the past, and compared it to his current appearance. He wanted to cry.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘At the very least, my hair didn’t fall out.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>The red hair, even Azell fancied, was grown out. It was very disheveled, so it was ungainly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The army doctor spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You didn’t know what you looked like?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell nodded his head.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The army doctor spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmmm. I don’t know what you went through, but it must have been abnormally hard.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Soon the soldier brought a hot soup. Azell took it and he started slowly eating it one spoon at a time. It was only soup, but every spoonful he ate brought changes to his body. It was a small amount of moisture and nutrition, but his vitality returned visibly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The army doctor spoke after carefully observing his figure.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m Rick Boran. What is your name?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>He was about to answer immediately, but he paused after a thought suddenly came to him. He put his hand on his forehead and frowned.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Name……”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes. Name.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Azell….. Zestringer…..?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Azell Zestringer?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Maybe…..”</span></p>
  <p><span style>He answered vaguely because he wanted to give the impression that he was unsure about his memories. Moreover, Zestringer was his original last name. Originally, he was a commoner. After he had toppled the Dragon Demon King Atein, he was give the title of Duke Karzark for his accomplishments. Afterwards, he was called Azell Karzark in public and private.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick questioned him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Maybe.. You aren’t sure about your memory?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell nodded his head. Rick frowned.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You must have been severely worked over.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Magician….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmm?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“A magician.. me… I don’t remember much… but…..”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ah.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick’s expression grew darker.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He said these words without thinking too much about it, so in reality he felt guilty. If Azell had really suffered what he said then it wouldn’t be something he would mention lightly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Of course, this was what Azell was aiming for. Azell looked at the other’s expression, and he inwardly gave an apology.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I’m sorry. However, this is easier for you to accept it.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick spoke with a sympathetic expression, without realizing Azell’s dark inner thoughts.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmm. Please rest easy in this barrack tonight. I’ll ask the soldier to bring the dinner here. At this time, I can’t really do anything else for you.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell nodded his head.</span></p>
  <p><span style>4</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell ate two servings of soup and water that day before he went to sleep. Truthfully, he wanted to eat more, but Rick decided he shouldn’t eat too much. Even though he was still hungry, it would give him a stomach ache.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘It’s a sensible decision so I can’t say anything.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was sure that he would be fine even if he ate way more food.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Although his energy had dried up, the body control he had earned through learning the Spirit Order was still there.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, he couldn’t explain his situation, so he could only follow directions without saying anything.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However after just one day, Azell’s appearance changed drastically. A little bit of life returned to the skin that was once dry and splitting. His body, which looked like leather over bones, filled out a little bit.</span></p>
  <p><span style>His body started recovering, and Azell monitored the exact situation of his body through meditation.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘This is so frustrating.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>All the power he had accumulated before his sleep was gone.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The muscle he had trained with tenacity was all gone, and the overflowing energy he had a hard time controlling was all dried up. The rings of life, which was considered the foundation of those who trained in the Spirit Order, was all extinct.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Even the rings of life had disappeared.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Even though his energy had dried up, he thought that his rings of life would still be there. However, in the process of maintaining the hibernation for a long period of time, the magical force that made up the rings of life was used.</span></p>
  <p><span style>How long has he been asleep? As time passed on, he became acutely curious about that fact.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Any ways, he had to start everything from the beginning. He had to fill his shrivelled up energy with magical force to give it life, and he had to construct the rings of life again. Only then would he recover his previous strength.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Still should I consider it fortunate that the curse is gone?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Carlos’ prediction was correct.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell had imitated the dragon’s hibernation, and he had slept for a long time. He succeeded in overcoming the curse. His body no longer had the Dragon Demon King’s curse, which ate away at his life.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Yes. This should be fine.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell didn’t expect anything more. He had already earned the benefit. He was curious about many things, but he decided to focus on one thing.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Immediately, Azell started retraining the Spirit Order.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Spirit Order training involved forming mental images and one had to lead the mind and body into a constant state. (TLN: Form mental image of what you want, and try to sync the mind/body.) In this state, one will resonate with mana in the atmosphere to produce energy. This energy is used to fill the energy pulse.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Mana.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was an energy source that was abundant in the atmosphere. The warrior’s Spirit Order, and the magician’s magic were magical force produced from resonating the mind with mana.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was revealed that the mana reacts to a strong will. This in turn allows the energy to be changed into any form.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was how a magician is able to cause various phenomenons.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Ooh ooh ooh ooh oong…… (TLN: buzzing sound – like high voltage electricity humming through line)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The meditating Azell started to resonate with the mana. Rick was surprised, so he looked inside. Since he was a healing expert, he was also sensitive to the mana’s movement.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Is he training his Spirit Order?”</span></p>

 <p><span style>It was the same with the word ‘check up’. When a healer looked at a patient, there never was a specialized term for it. Therefore, whenever Azell heard their conversation, he had a strange delayed reaction as if he had a hard time understanding it. It was because he was trying to guess the meaning of the words he didn’t know.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What’s happening? Is it because I’m somewhere I have never visited before? Or….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Azell was thinking on this, the army doctor spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm. Who is this person and where did you bring him from?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldier sparked explaining the circumstances. The army doctor frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did he get experimented on with some kind of black magic?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After hearing this, Azell started thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘That’s not bad?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could say he was kidnapped by a black magician. He was experimented on and it was something akin to torture. This caused him to be in this state, and he couldn’t remember who he was. He could remember his name, but everything else was fuzzy and fragmented….</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would be a good enough excuse. It should be way more effective than giving the straightforward account of the truth?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The army doctor, who was looking at Azell with a bit of a frightful expression, put his hand on Azell’s forehead. From the end of his hand, a warm light rose up and it was absorbed into Azell’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He is a healing expert.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Healing experts are an existence that is considered to be a variant of magicians. Normally, they would accumulate specially made medicine inside their body, and they were able to combine it with magical force to manifest it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I don’t think he is a priest…’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Azell’s time, all the healing experts were the temple’s priests and there weren’t that many of them. However, the man in front of his eyes did not seem to have the occupation of a cleric.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Did a healing expert, who was not a priest, apply to the army and secure an appointment as the army doctor?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was interesting. Before Azell fell asleep, only the temple’s priests could use the healing arts, so they were respected even by people of high status. However right now, this man was not treated that way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, the army doctor clicked his tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is he alive when he is in such a state?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The healing experts could tell the state of the other’s body by contact. Moreover, they could provide healing power to treat wounds and diseases.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The army doctor understood the state Azell was in and it was a miracle that he was even alive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Also, he was able to maintain consciousness and walk on his own. He defied logic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After being dumbfounded, he spoke to the soldier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You. This person…. He doesn’t need anything except water and also feed him something.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is in a state of extreme starvation. It is cannot say as to how he is able to maintain his consciousness. After seeing his terrible state, didn’t you think about that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is… I was too scared to think about that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess he does look more like a monster than a human.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was slightly wounded by the army doctor’s words. They were calling him a monster, but his body had received the adulation of women once.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go to the kitchen and ask them to make something easily digestible. Something similar to a soup.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Also, bring it here since this person would have a hard time moving.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. However, he was able to walk here just fine…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So he didn’t look like he was having a hard time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldier had nothing to say to those words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the soldier left, the army doctor spoke to Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you want to drink some water?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell hurriedly nodded his head. Even though he had drunk a lot of water, it was still insufficient.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The army doctor spoke to him after seeing Azell carefully drink the water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know who you are, but don’t over do it even if you have learned the Spirit Order.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s scary, so don’t look at me that way. I’m a healing expert. I, at the very least, know what my patient practices.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No, I didn’t look at you like that to make you scared….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had only looked at the army doctor with an amused gazed. However, the army doctor mistook it for a defensive glare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How messed up am I…..’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now he wanted to see himself at least once. Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Large dish… Could you… give me some water….?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm? Why? No, never mind. I’ll give it to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The army doctor stopped Azell from arduously answering back and he filled the wash basin with water. Azell flinched at the reflection he saw of his face on the surface.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Waa, I’m like a real monster?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt like it was fair that he was being treated like a monster. He wanted to give praise to Giles’ personality, because he had treated him like a person from the first time he saw him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Shit. Where did my body that was like a marble statue go to…’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought about how he looked like in the past, and compared it to his current appearance. He wanted to cry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘At the very least, my hair didn’t fall out.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The red hair, even Azell fancied, was grown out. It was very disheveled, so it was ungainly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The army doctor spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You didn’t know what you looked like?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The army doctor spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm. I don’t know what you went through, but it must have been abnormally hard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon the soldier brought a hot soup. Azell took it and he started slowly eating it one spoon at a time. It was only soup, but every spoonful he ate brought changes to his body. It was a small amount of moisture and nutrition, but his vitality returned visibly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The army doctor spoke after carefully observing his figure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m Rick Boran. What is your name?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was about to answer immediately, but he paused after a thought suddenly came to him. He put his hand on his forehead and frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Name……”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. Name.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Azell….. Zestringer…..?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Azell Zestringer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maybe…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He answered vaguely because he wanted to give the impression that he was unsure about his memories. Moreover, Zestringer was his original last name. Originally, he was a commoner. After he had toppled the Dragon Demon King Atein, he was give the title of Duke Karzark for his accomplishments. Afterwards, he was called Azell Karzark in public and private.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick questioned him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maybe.. You aren’t sure about your memory?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell nodded his head. Rick frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You must have been severely worked over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Magician….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A magician.. me… I don’t remember much… but…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick’s expression grew darker.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He said these words without thinking too much about it, so in reality he felt guilty. If Azell had really suffered what he said then it wouldn’t be something he would mention lightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, this was what Azell was aiming for. Azell looked at the other’s expression, and he inwardly gave an apology.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m sorry. However, this is easier for you to accept it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick spoke with a sympathetic expression, without realizing Azell’s dark inner thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm. Please rest easy in this barrack tonight. I’ll ask the soldier to bring the dinner here. At this time, I can’t really do anything else for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>4</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell ate two servings of soup and water that day before he went to sleep. Truthfully, he wanted to eat more, but Rick decided he shouldn’t eat too much. Even though he was still hungry, it would give him a stomach ache.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s a sensible decision so I can’t say anything.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was sure that he would be fine even if he ate way more food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although his energy had dried up, the body control he had earned through learning the Spirit Order was still there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he couldn’t explain his situation, so he could only follow directions without saying anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However after just one day, Azell’s appearance changed drastically. A little bit of life returned to the skin that was once dry and splitting. His body, which looked like leather over bones, filled out a little bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His body started recovering, and Azell monitored the exact situation of his body through meditation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is so frustrating.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the power he had accumulated before his sleep was gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The muscle he had trained with tenacity was all gone, and the overflowing energy he had a hard time controlling was all dried up. The rings of life, which was considered the foundation of those who trained in the Spirit Order, was all extinct.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Even the rings of life had disappeared.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though his energy had dried up, he thought that his rings of life would still be there. However, in the process of maintaining the hibernation for a long period of time, the magical force that made up the rings of life was used.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How long has he been asleep? As time passed on, he became acutely curious about that fact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Any ways, he had to start everything from the beginning. He had to fill his shrivelled up energy with magical force to give it life, and he had to construct the rings of life again. Only then would he recover his previous strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Still should I consider it fortunate that the curse is gone?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos’ prediction was correct.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had imitated the dragon’s hibernation, and he had slept for a long time. He succeeded in overcoming the curse. His body no longer had the Dragon Demon King’s curse, which ate away at his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Yes. This should be fine.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell didn’t expect anything more. He had already earned the benefit. He was curious about many things, but he decided to focus on one thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately, Azell started retraining the Spirit Order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Spirit Order training involved forming mental images and one had to lead the mind and body into a constant state. (TLN: Form mental image of what you want, and try to sync the mind/body.) In this state, one will resonate with mana in the atmosphere to produce energy. This energy is used to fill the energy pulse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an energy source that was abundant in the atmosphere. The warrior’s Spirit Order, and the magician’s magic were magical force produced from resonating the mind with mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was revealed that the mana reacts to a strong will. This in turn allows the energy to be changed into any form.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was how a magician is able to cause various phenomenons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ooh ooh ooh ooh oong…… (TLN: buzzing sound – like high voltage electricity humming through line)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The meditating Azell started to resonate with the mana. Rick was surprised, so he looked inside. Since he was a healing expert, he was also sensitive to the mana’s movement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is he training his Spirit Order?”</span></p>
