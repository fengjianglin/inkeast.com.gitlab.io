 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dragon Demon castle was louder than ever before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone within the castle was aware of it. &nbsp;There were battles occurring all over the castle. &nbsp;The sound of explosions continuously rang out, and the castle continued to shake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Koo-goo-goo-gooong……!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Powerful beings were clashing against each other. &nbsp;The floor was overturned, and a large hole was formed on the wall. &nbsp;A black hair Dragon Demon could be seen within the cloud of dust. &nbsp;Kairen groaned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ooh-ook……!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was holding onto his two swords, and a green Dragon soul was wrapped around his body A gale suddenly erupted indoors, and someone emerged from the other side of the cloud of dust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was Reshoo. &nbsp;He was the Dragon Demon youth possessing messy blue metallic hair. &nbsp;A red Dragon Soul was wrapped around his body. &nbsp;Kairen gritted his teeth as he charged. &nbsp;He swung his dual swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shwee-shwee-shwee-swheek!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reshoo retreated backwards as he dodged the sword strikes, which was as swift as the winds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Guardian Shadows ran at Reshoo from his back. &nbsp;These were Guardian Shadows capable of close quarters combat. &nbsp;They jumped towards Reshoo with their spears and swords in hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hwahhhhhhhhl!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Flame erupted from his entire body. &nbsp;The fire swept the Guardian Shadows away. &nbsp;At the same time, Reshoo was about to kick off the ground. &nbsp;He was about to accelerate, but….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shweek!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leticia had moved with exquisite timing. &nbsp;She stabbed Reshoo with her spear from the side. &nbsp;Reshoo had been about to move forward. &nbsp;It would force Reshoo to come to a halt since he had to respond to her attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It should have been like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Too-ah-ahng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A streak of red light moved forward in space. &nbsp;Leticia was shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘He escaped my attack?’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had attacked with perfect timing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Reshoo charged forward, he should have been skewered by the spear. &nbsp;Moreover, if he tried to stop his charge, it would have put immense pressure on his body. &nbsp;He would have to regain his balance, and at that moment, Kairen would have been able to launch a powerful attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was as if Reshoo didn’t care if the spear was coming towards him. &nbsp;He pushed off the ground, and his speed became several more times faster. &nbsp;It was much faster than what Leticia was expecting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kwah-kwah-kwah-kwah-kwah!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leticia didn’t even have the opportunity to unleash her cold energy. &nbsp;The shockwave hit her. &nbsp;Kairen was committed to his attack. &nbsp;He trusted Leticia would be able to execute her attack. &nbsp;Kairen’s eyes widened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was hit, and it felt as if his body would shatter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kuh-uhk!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kairen let out a scream as he was sent flying. &nbsp;His body bounced off the floor several times before his body was embedded in the wall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leticia wasn’t in any better shape. &nbsp;She was late as she tried to attack the backside of Reshoo. &nbsp;However, Reshoo kick came up from a blindspot as he struck Letica. &nbsp;Immediately, the Dragon Soul followed up with a powerful attack &nbsp;Leticia was sent flying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">-My god…….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kayalia was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kairen and Leticia got back on their feet. &nbsp;They were swaying on their feet. &nbsp;Kayalia had expected Reshoo to follow up with an attack, so she had prepared a spell. &nbsp;However, Reshoo didn’t move from his spot after attacking them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kairen gritted his teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Shit. &nbsp;He is fast. It is almost unreal…….’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reshoo possessed more Dragon Demon magic than Reygus in his transformed state. &nbsp;It was almost impossible for Kairen and Leticia to track Reshoo with their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many Spirit Order and Dragon Arts practitioners learned skills that could accelerate their body parts to extreme. &nbsp;Even Kairen and Leticia could move faster than the speed of sound if they wanted too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this type of acceleration was unnatural. &nbsp;One had to stop for a brief moment to recuperate or the acceleration would cause too much of a burden on one’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘He is able to use Pure Copper technique to create such ridiculous speed. &nbsp;I see. &nbsp;Is this the secret to his Dragon Soul?’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reshoo was using Pure Copper Technique on various parts of his body. &nbsp;This allowed him to accelerate each body part with impunity. He was able to generate transcendent speed that defied common sense. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Azell’s party had acquired information about Reshoo through Kayalia. &nbsp;She had witnessed the fight between Reshoo and Reygus. &nbsp;This was why they had been wary of his speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, when they were faced with it, it was beyond imaginable. It was overpowering. &nbsp;Even if &nbsp;they used quick, short attacks, they were having a hard time responding to the continuous attacks from Reshoo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reshoo spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I see. &nbsp;You fought someone that is faster than me. &nbsp;Reygus was like that too…..”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From Reshoo’s perspective, he should have taken them unawares. &nbsp;His speed was something Kairen and Leticia should have never experienced before. &nbsp;Their senses shouldn’t have been able to register his speed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If everything was as it seemed, he should have wiped them out in the first exchange. &nbsp;However, he saw it. &nbsp;They registered his movement, and they had tried to respond. &nbsp;Their bodies were unable to carry out what their mind had processed. &nbsp;Still, they were able to minimize the damage they took.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kairen didn’t answer him as he took on a fighting stance. &nbsp;Cold sweat was running down his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘If it wasn’t for Azell, we would have died from the start.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was as Reshoo predicted. &nbsp;The two of them had experienced movement that was faster than Reshoo. &nbsp;They had experienced it through Azell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reshoo was fast in a different way from Azell. &nbsp;As a clone user, Azell could exist in multiple places at the same time. &nbsp;He could carry out many actions at the same time. His clones could freely move between its energy form and its form of substance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could appear wherever he wanted at the moment he wanted to. &nbsp;He was able to pull off attacks in an instant. &nbsp;There was no delay in his control over his clones. &nbsp;In a battle, this could be called a form of extreme speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kairen and Leticia had fought against such an opponent. &nbsp;This was why they were able to react to Reshoo’s speed even if the end result was awufl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Reshoo spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It has started.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you talking about?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Azell and Atein.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mmmm…….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The expression on Kairen and Leticia’s face hardened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were late in realizing it, because Reshoo had been letting out too much power. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was true. &nbsp;They could feel two incredibly powerful beings clashing against each other on the other side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leticia glared at him. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are quite relaxed. &nbsp;Does this mean you are confident you can kill us at any time? &nbsp;Even if you are strong, you shouldn’t become arrogant when life and death is on the line. &nbsp;You taught me this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not that relaxed right now. &nbsp;You guys are formidable foes, and there is an extraordinary magician helping you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reshoo’s eyes were glued to Kayalia.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was dead, so she didn’t have a body. &nbsp;She didn’t possess any Dragon Demon magic, and her access to the Great Darkness was restricted. &nbsp;She no longer possessed the same amount of power she possessed when she was alive. &nbsp;Despite this fact, she was one of the top magicians &nbsp;during the Dragon Demon war, so he couldn’t take her lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Still, her attacks have been oddly lukewarm. &nbsp;I’m sure she is aiming for something.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he thought about the composition of their group, it made sense that Kayalia would support Leticia and Kairen instead of directly attacking Reshoo. &nbsp;Despite this fact, he was having a hard time believing that was all Kayalia was doing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She truly was an extraordinary magician. &nbsp;She used her magic at the right place at the right time. &nbsp;This was why he hadn’t been able to wipe out Kairen and Leticia in the first engagement. &nbsp;Her actions were restricting his movements to an annoying degree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had to think about her past reputation. &nbsp;This couldn’t be all she would do. &nbsp;He couldn’t erase that nagging thought inside his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leticia made a sarcastic remark.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is that the assessment you came up with after you thoroughly investigated us?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In truth, it wasn’t like that. &nbsp;Leticia, let me ask you one question. &nbsp;Why are you opposing Atein?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can understand why Kairen is opposing Atein. &nbsp;Kairen is a member of human society, and he is a lord in their lands. &nbsp;Why are you on their side? &nbsp; Is it because you despise the Dragon Demon king worshippers?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Unbelievable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leticia let out a feigned smile as she asked a question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why are you supporting Atein? &nbsp;Do you really think his crazy plan will bring about a paradise in this world? &nbsp;Do you really think everyone will be happy?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I support him because I believe we need preventive measures. &nbsp;If the gods truly did make this world, they missed some important things in designing this world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reshoo had experienced a lot as he wandered around the world for the past 220 years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had met a lot of people. &nbsp;He watched children turn into adults. &nbsp; He watched them turn old. &nbsp;He had given his love to others. &nbsp;Leticia was one of the people that had received his affections.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then he kept losing his loved ones. &nbsp;He experienced pain until he was sick of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reshoo raised a fist as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even if I am powerful, I cannot protect everyone in this world. &nbsp;In fact, I couldn’t even protect one person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if one cared very much for others, they had to live their own lives at the end of the day. &nbsp;It was impossible to shadow them every day of the year.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why a safety net was needed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone knew this to be true. &nbsp;When humans formed a society, law and institution was established. &nbsp;Each member of the society worked hard to procure safety within the society.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, that’s not enough.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The safety net made by humans throughout history had been woefully inadequate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If someone broke the law, the lawbreaker got a punishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were countless times when this simple rule wasn’t followed at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As a result, the blameless became hurt. &nbsp;Those that were loved by everyone died. &nbsp;The ones with the bright futures died.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reshoo couldn’t stand that fact. &nbsp;That was why he had joined forces with Atein.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were people that avoided detection as they committed crimes. &nbsp;People used loopholes in the law to act with impunity. &nbsp;They carried evil deed without fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the world created by Atein, such incidents would never occur. &nbsp;There would be a monitoring system. &nbsp;The freedom to carry out evil deeds would be taken away from humanity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ha-ah.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leticia sighed when she heard Reshoo’s reasoning. &nbsp;She looked baffled as she shook her head. &nbsp;Reshoo furrowed his brows at this sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you have something you want to say to me, you can.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“…Reshoo, you’ve definitely lived longer than me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leticia opened her mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since you’ve lived for a long time, you've seen more people than me. &nbsp;You’ve experienced more of life than me. &nbsp;I do not know about the life lived by normal humans. &nbsp;When I was with you, I tried to live amongst the humans. &nbsp;When I saw their lives, it was like watching a scene within a portrait.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For most of her life, she had lived within the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;She was ‘made’ to be one of the candidates that’ll become the heir to Almarick. &nbsp;When she was branded as a failure, she was thrown into hell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only peaceful memories she had was the time she spent with Reshoo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While she was his student, Leticia was able to live amongst normal people. &nbsp;She knew their names, and she had shared stories with them. &nbsp;She even did tasks that were mutually beneficial to her and others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she looked back on it, it really was her best memories. &nbsp;There were times when she wanted to continue living amongst them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, there was a flame of hate burning within her heart. &nbsp;Reshoo recognized this, so he had pushed her to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, she was thankful that he had done that. &nbsp;If he hadn’t ended it for her, she would have been lost. &nbsp;The hate would have ate away at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leticia continued to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I used to think you were capable of doing anything. &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;I was like a human child that looked up at an adult. &nbsp;I thought you knew everything, and I thought there was nothing you couldn’t do….. &nbsp;That’s what I thought.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had lived amongst the humans under a mask called Jisel. &nbsp;Reshoo was a skillful performer. &nbsp; &nbsp;He easily mingled with other people, and in a short amount of time, everyone became reliant on him, and they liked him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why she hadn’t had this realization until that moment. &nbsp;She had been like a child that didn’t know the worries of an adult. &nbsp;Leticia hadn’t known about the truth within Reshoo’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I understand it now. &nbsp;You aren’t superhuman. &nbsp;At the very least, there is something I know more than you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are talking about making the whole world into a greenhouse, and the humans will be your indoor flowers. &nbsp;You probably can’t even imagine what it would be like living such a life. &nbsp;However, I can. &nbsp;I grew up in such a sheltered environment and it was hell.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reshoo looked as if he couldn’t comprehend what she was saying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leticia let out a bitter laughter as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I was monitored and controlled by others. &nbsp;Others determined what was ‘evil’ for me. &nbsp;I couldn’t do what was considered to be evil by these people. &nbsp;That is the world you want. &nbsp;How do you know if the ones in control is good?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before Leticia escaped the research facility, she had been an experiment, and the ones in charge had made her life a living hell. The research facility was a closed world, and the ones in charge determined what was good and evil. &nbsp;They had violated the souls of the test subjects..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I found out the truth when I came out to the outside world. &nbsp;Good and evil isn’t something that is predetermined from the beginning. &nbsp;It was something people come to an agreement as they live in this world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leticia had escaped, because she wanted to be freed from the pain. &nbsp;She wanted to live without being abused. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the time, she hadn’t gone against them, because she didn’t think they were evil. &nbsp;She didn’t even think their actions were evil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There is no good and evil when carnivores eat herbivores. &nbsp;Good and evil is something made up by humans. &nbsp;I moved away from where I was born, and I found out that the good and evil in the outside world differed greatly from where I came from. &nbsp;You taught me that, Reshoo.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Leticia came out to the outside world she was introduced to a new standard. &nbsp;Her world view was shattered by what she learned from Reshoo. &nbsp;It had shocked her to her core. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“From the perspective of the outside world, I was born and raised in a place that’s perceived to be the hotbed of evil &nbsp;However, I’m not fighting them, because they are evil.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So why?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The simplest reason is I don’t want to see them do well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“…….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Jeez. &nbsp;Did you expect some profound answer?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leticia snickered when she saw Reshoo’s dumbfounded expression. &nbsp;She continued to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Those bastards worshipped Atein, so he was the source of my pain. &nbsp;He acts like an absolute being, and he acts as if I should be satisfied with what he is offering. &nbsp;He wants me to fuck off, because he plans on giving me a paradise in this world. &nbsp;My life had been too harsh and painful for me to accept that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In the end, you don’t trust Atein. &nbsp;Is that what it boils down to?”</span></p>
