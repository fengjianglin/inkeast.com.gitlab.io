 <p>Chapter 142 - Second Coming of a Legend (5)</p>
 <p><span style>6</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Azell was free of Reygus, the situation on the battlefield quickly changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he went to save Laura, Azell had already swept the battlefield near his allies. &nbsp;He had already caused massive damage to his enemies. &nbsp;Kairen, Leticia, Yuren and the Guardian Shadows had been fighting an even battle when Azell performed a surprise attack. &nbsp;The Dragon Demon King worshippers were mowed down like rotten sheaves of wheat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, their advantage lasted only a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Go-oh-oh-oh-oh……!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a flash, everyone’s attention was gathered at one location.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Something that surpassed common sense was occuring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru, who was covered in dirt, was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is changing magical energy into Dragon Demon magic…..!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as he said. &nbsp;Reygus’ magical energy was changing into Dragon Demon magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was supposed to be impossible. &nbsp;Dragon Demon magic was the power of the living. &nbsp;Despite Reygus being a 1st generation Dragon Demon, it was an Undead. &nbsp;Its lost Dragon Demon magic should have been unrecoverable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front of the shocked Balseru, Reygus’ armor started to change. &nbsp;The ominous black armor and the Soul Hammer was being bleached white. &nbsp;Its helmet had been open as its skull had been on display. &nbsp;However, a mask dropped down, and the helmet started changing into the shape of a Dragon’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Hoo-ooooooooh……!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of a long breath was heard coming from within Reygus’ helmet. 이It was already dead, so it was only making the noise. &nbsp;However, as if responding to the sound, a black current of air exited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;If you were able to defeat me before this, I would have praised you. &nbsp;However, you are out of your depth now. &nbsp;Well, what’s your move now?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The amassing of incredible amount of magical energy was in preparation for this change. &nbsp;It took some time to max out his magical energy. &nbsp;It had needed time to complete its transformation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus had faced some trouble, because it faced Balseru, who was the natural enemy of the Undead. &nbsp;However, that was no longer true now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru broke out in cold sweat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…what nonsense.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After its transformation, the power of Balseru’s eyes didn’t work against it. &nbsp;The suppressed power returned with a vengeance, and Balseru could feel a pressure that made it hard for him to breathe. &nbsp;Currently, the amount of Dragon Demon magic exceeded the amount Reygus had possessed in life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Well, it is time to wrap this up!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus activated its Dragon Demon magic as it charged forward. &nbsp;A gust arose behind its path.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rho tried to get in its way, but it was in vain. &nbsp;Reygus reacted much faster by ramming its body into Rho, and it brought down its Soul Hammer..</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Kah-ahhhhhhk……!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rho let out a scream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of the time Undead did not feel pain. &nbsp;However, Reygus’ Dragon weapon was called the Soul Hammer. &nbsp;As its name indicated, it had the power to break souls. &nbsp;There was physical damage from being hit by the Soul Hammer, but exquisite pain and shock was felt by Rho. &nbsp;It felt as if its soul was being ripped into pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Too-doo-doo-doong!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Undead magician Phi shot thunder towards Reygus. &nbsp;Reygus hadn’t retrieved its hammer yet, so it had to take the attack with its body. &nbsp;It was pushed backwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, a blue flame erupted around Reygus’ body. &nbsp;The blue flames didn’t emit physical heat, but it pushed back the thunder spell. &nbsp;Reygus originally had powerful defensive magic layered around it, but this flame had the power to cancel magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Accompanying the sound of an explosion, half of Phi’s body was destroyed. &nbsp;When Reygus ran in, Phi focused on its defensive magic as it retreated. &nbsp;However, Reygus’ blue flames canceled out the barrier before it rushed towards Phi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Koo-ahk……!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected, the Undead felt a pain it had never felt before after becoming an Undead. &nbsp;Still, Phi managed to point its unbroken arm towards Reygus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Puh-uhng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A thunderbolt exploded on Reygus’ head. &nbsp;It sent Reygus flying, but it immediately righted itself. &nbsp;Reygus laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Koo-hahaha! &nbsp;You are quite tenacious! &nbsp;I thought you would have forgotten about how pain felt as an Undead! &nbsp;I thought you would become distracted by even a small amount of pain!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You wild pig bastard……!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Phi grinded its teeth. &nbsp;If it was just physical damage, it could recover in an instant even with such heavy damage. &nbsp;However, the Soul Hammer possessed the power to damage souls, so the recovery of its body had slowed significantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus let out a cheerful laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I’ve heard that phrase quite often. &nbsp;Well, it is time for you brats to return to your graves.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;As an Undead, we are your elders. &nbsp;You are a reckless simpleton.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rho was barely able to stand up. &nbsp;It spoke sharp words towards Reygus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru, who was behind them, spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Phi. &nbsp;Rho.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Speak.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Undead magician Rho didn’t turn around as it gave a reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry. &nbsp;You guys will have to die for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I’m already dead, so what’s the point of asking me to die?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Whether I meet my end this way or some other way, it is all the same to me. &nbsp;You do what you have to do.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Phi also muttered his words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus looked on with interest. &nbsp;It didn’t ask Balseru about the meaning behind his words. &nbsp;Reygus really acted in a manner consistent with how he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he could squeeze out some kind of hidden card from his opponents, he would willingly wait for them even if it could endanger it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru’s eyes emitted light. &nbsp;This light transferred over to Phi and Rho.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Ooh-ahhhhhhhhhh!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Phi and Rho le out a scream. &nbsp;Their bodies were quickly restored as their magical energy exploded upwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus’ eyes shone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Ho-oh! &nbsp;Is this a hidden card that can only be used as a suicidial attack?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as Reygus had said. &nbsp;Phi and Rho’s magical energy had increased to twice its size, but that was the catch. &nbsp;They would be destroyed as cost for using this power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, they wouldn’t last long against Reygus even in this state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>7</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Are you running away by yourself while you leave your comrades to die?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru was running full tilt, and he let out a bitter laugh at Azell’s angry words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as his words implied. &nbsp;He had overclocked the power of Phi and Rho. &nbsp;They were used as sacrifices so he could escape. &nbsp;While he escaped the battlefield, Phi and Rho was about to be destroyed at any moment now..</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru answered him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll be following after them soon. &nbsp;However, I cannot die right now. &nbsp;For now... &nbsp;I’ll have to remove myself to rule out the probability of my death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>-What nonsense are you talking about?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You will find out soon, hero Azell Karzark.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After his words ended, Balseru’s presence vanished. &nbsp;Azell grinded his teeth when Balseru hid himself like a ghost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A heavy sound rang out in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koong!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ground shook. &nbsp;The rising cloud of dust dispersed as Reygus’ enormous white body approached him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Phi and Rho’s fallen forms were next to it. &nbsp;The two had met their end. &nbsp;Their consciousness could no longer be felt. &nbsp;When the magical energy within their body dispersed, their skeleton would break down and disperse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Hmm. &nbsp;I was very angry before, but I feel thankful now.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What nonsense are you talking?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;They were pretty good sparring partners. &nbsp;Thanks to them I can fight you once again at full strength.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you not realize that you are close to being alone now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as he said. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru and the two Undead hadn’t occupied Reygus for long. &nbsp;However, the outcome of the battle was determined during that brief time period. &nbsp;The Dragon Demon king worshippers were truly cornered thanks to Azell’s active role in battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus looked at his surrounding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Jeez. &nbsp;Whether it is the past or now, it’s the same.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the Dragon Demon war, Reygus ignored what was going on in his surrounding as he fought like a berserker. &nbsp;His battle style was basically like a hurricane sweeping through the battlefield. &nbsp;This was why his allies didn’t fight with him, and the commanders had to take his quirk into consideration when coming up with battle tactics.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Basically, Reygus did whatever it pleased, so it was familiar with the situation where its allies were on a brink of defeat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I’ll have to hold out until our reinforcements come.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll end this before that occurs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;That is what I hoped you would say.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>A delighted laughter flowed out from Reygus’ helmet. &nbsp;The two legendary figures once again clashed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>8</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Undead do not tire. &nbsp;They weren’t bound by a body’s structural limit like the range of motion of joints. &nbsp;On top of all of that, their ability increased as their magical energy increased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, the Undead form of Reygus was weaker than its previous living form, because it had a crucial weakness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Basically, Reygus had lost its Dragon Demon magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if the quantity of magical energy was about the same as before, Reygus was a Dragon Arts practitioner. &nbsp;The loss of the Dragon Demon magic was too big of a loss. &nbsp;Even if it was an expert, there was a limit as to how much of an adjustment it could make to its fighting style. There was a clear ceiling even if Reygus trained diligently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Reygus had used some unknowable method to regain its Dragon Demon magic, and it was stronger than when it was alive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell realized this fact from just a single exchange of blows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the beginning, Azell had overextended himself to produce a power that his vessel couldn’t contain. &nbsp;Even if he was adept at controlling the effects with his techniques, he couldn’t completely erase all the backlash. &nbsp;As time passed, the burden on his body increased, and his movements slowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Reygus didn’t suffer from such problems.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, it had become much stronger after its transformation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koohk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was busy expanding the number of his clones. &nbsp;Azell groaned as he backed off. &nbsp;However, Reygus used Instantaneous Movement to track him down, and it swung its hammer at terrifying speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Too-hahk!</span></p>
 <p><span style>His stance was half broken, so Azell couldn’t block the attack. &nbsp;However, the Dragon Majin immediately turned into light to hit the Soul Hammer from the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwahng! Kwah-kwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s clones hit Reygus with consecutive attacks when his defense faltered. &nbsp;Each clone used every magical energy they possessed to hit Reygus, but it barely took any damage. &nbsp;It only retreated haltingly, and its armor remained unbroken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This continued on like this for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If one was just counting the number of attacks one got in, Azell was winning in an overwhelming fashion. &nbsp;Azell hadn’t taken a hit yet. &nbsp;On the other hand, Reygus was being hit countless of times as it was sent flying. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t as if Reygus was inexperienced in terms of technique. &nbsp;It moved like a heavy tank, so its style looked unrefined. &nbsp;However, its techniques and perception was top notch. &nbsp;Above all else, this style was impossible to pull off if one didn’t have a sturdy body. &nbsp;This was true whether in life or death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s techniques shone against such an opponent. &nbsp;No matter what it did Azell could turn away its defense to create an opportunity. &nbsp;Azell repeatedly applied his attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, technique wasn’t the only factor that determined the victory or defeat of a battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;This is unfortunate. &nbsp;It is true that you are stronger in some aspect. &nbsp;However, you became weaker overall?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are getting beaten like a drum, yet you speak such bold words..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell glared at it as he bluffed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In comparison to Azell during the Dragon Demon war…</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be precise, his techniques and senses had increased significantly compared to the Azell before Reygus’ death. &nbsp;The Sky Splitter also had evolved to a much superior form of Dragon weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, his body was much stronger than his past self.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had increased his physical ability, and the vessel to hold his magical energy was much larger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he had to burden himself to raise his magical energy to a level comparable to his prior self. &nbsp;However, the clincher was the fact the his pool of Dragon Demon magic was too shallow, so his techniques were less effective.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus felt regret this point. &nbsp;After waking up in this era, he had met his favorite and most enjoyable opponent, yet Azell wasn’t at full strength yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Azell stopped as he put on a baffled expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was because Reygus had stopped attacking to speak.</span></p>
