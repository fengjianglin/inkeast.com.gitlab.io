 <p>Chapter 139 - Second Coming of a Legend (2)</p>
 <p><span style>“Well, Reygus! &nbsp;You are a mere ghost from the past! &nbsp;You should become the sacrificial offering to the technique I developed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Light exploded forth as Azell let out a shout. &nbsp;Reygus was sent flying. &nbsp;Azell had been in a strength contest when his clone appeared from the side of Reygus. &nbsp;Azell’s clone had gotten a blow in. &nbsp;The armor, which had been as sturdy as a castle, started to break apart. &nbsp;The darkness started to flow out from within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Koo-oohk! &nbsp;Maybe I should have read the information gathered by our guys? &nbsp;I guess I’m in this situation since I don’t like to make preparations!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You always acted arrogant as if you knew everything there is to know in the world. &nbsp;This is why terrible things always happen to you. &nbsp;You are the same now as in old times! &nbsp;&nbsp;Didn’t I tell you before that an old man with an aggressive attitude is unsightly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s voice rang out from all sides. &nbsp;The branches of thunder extended to all sides. &nbsp;In between them, several dozen Azells appeared, and they all felt like the real one. &nbsp;They were intended to confuse the senses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Shit! &nbsp;Cry! &nbsp;My soul hammer……!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think I’ll let &nbsp;you use such a big skill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before it could activate the power of it soul hammer, Azell’s clone followed along the erratic path taken by a branch of the thunder. &nbsp;He appeared in front of Reygus. &nbsp;It could happen only for an instant, but his clone could produce power comparable to his real body. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Reygus stopped its movement at a dime to block Azell’s attack. &nbsp;It had been bringing down its hammer to attack, but it stopped as if the attack had been a lie. &nbsp;It was an illogical move, and Azell was taken aback by it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Since I’m dead, I can do this now!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a trick that can’t be performed with a living body. &nbsp;If one tried to quickly hold back an attack with power behind it, one’s bones, muscles, nerves and blood vessels would suffer enormous damage. &nbsp;It didn’t matter how much magical energy one put into one’s body to strengthen it. &nbsp;It would all be damaged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, as an Undead, it was possible to move in such illogical ways. &nbsp;It was like the time when it ignored the restriction imposed by the joint's range of motion. &nbsp;If it could endure the strengthening magic, it was possible to move in a way where it could ignore inertia!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had jumped in thinking it was a great opportunity, but he had jumped into a trap. &nbsp;In a flash, Reygus was able to accelerate its movement, and there was no rhythm to its movement. &nbsp;The attack accelerated in an explosive manner as it struck Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Lament!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwahhhhhng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell blocked it with his Dragon Maken, but it had already calculated such a response was coming. &nbsp;It activated the power seated within the soul hammer as the shockwave upended the ground. &nbsp;All the clones running along the ground was swept away, and even Azell’s real form was sent flying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;This is it!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, he didn’t think this attack would finish Azell. &nbsp;However, the powerful shockwave would seal the movement of Azell, and it would allow Reygus to inflict a decisive blow! &nbsp;&nbsp;Reygus followed behind the shockwave, and it let out an attack that would be able to destroy a mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However…….</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Uh?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It expected Azell to be sent flying by the shockwave, but Azell remained in place. &nbsp;The shock wave and the enormous amount of earth was sweeping over him at high speed, yet he looked unperturbed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the name of the phenomena it was witnessing came unbidden into its mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Endless Plain!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a defensive skill that Aunsaurus liked to use with the Vitan’s Chalice. &nbsp;It was a variation on Vitan’s Maze where the nearby space was isolated. &nbsp;It was an unusual technique that prevented attacks for reaching the user.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the hammer swung by Reygus was about to be brought down, something unbelievable happened. &nbsp;Suddenly, the distance between the two became vast, and it lost sight of Azell. &nbsp;Reygus had ran into a Dimensional Distortion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then a white bolt bolt of thunder came towards it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Kahhhhhhhhnk!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Maken was morphed into light, and the speed of the attack exceeded even the speed of thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a trap prepared by Azell. &nbsp;The Dimensional Distortion allowed him to divert his opponent. &nbsp;The distance created allowed him time to use the Heaven Splitter to gain control over light. &nbsp;This was the power of the Dragon Maken. In the past, Laura had used the same move to divert her trackers. &nbsp;He had lured Reygus into the location where he set the trap!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus’ armor crumbled as the darkness contained within started to burn white. &nbsp;At some point, the thunderbolt had changed into a Flame of Purification, which was the bane of the Undead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Heaven Splitter had domain over all light, so it was able use any energy that emitted light. &nbsp;This was why it was possible to make this change. &nbsp;Reygus’ body, which had been like an unassailable fortress, received a critical hit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve already ended this ill-fated relationship once! &nbsp;I’ll do so again! &nbsp;Let’s not drag this out, Reygus!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The unlimited plain that had been between them disappeared as if it had been a lie. &nbsp;The two combatants were back to normal distance. &nbsp;Reygus, who was in bad shape, glared at Azell. &nbsp;However, Azell couldn’t unleash his killing blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ba-dump!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Something hazy appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A transparent false image in the shape of a young girl appeared in Azell’s vision before it disappeared. &nbsp;Then a ball of fire exploded around him. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hwahhhhhhhnk!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell immediately defended himself by surrounding his body with the magical energy of the flame. &nbsp;Reygus took time to right itself as it landed on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Ughh. &nbsp;If you were going to help, you should have done so from the outstart. &nbsp;Women, am I right?.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus grumbled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell became more vigilant as he looked as his surrounding. &nbsp;He couldn’t sense anything amiss. &nbsp;It had been a powerful enough magician to interfere with the battle between Reygus and him, yet there was no scent of magic left behind…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What was it?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus spoke in front of the wary Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Well, she said she won’t interfere again, so you don’t have to worry about it. &nbsp;Anyways, I almost didn't get my money’s worth. &nbsp;I might disappeared before I fought for real.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you going to give me some lame reason like you still haven’t show your real strength yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Correct!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus spoke with a cheerful voice as its appearance went through a rapid change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>2</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Keepers of the Prophecy could be called the nucleus of the Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;It could also be said that they were beings that had severe wear and tear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were alive, yet they weren’t alive. &nbsp;They had lost the memories of their previous lives, and they didn’t age. &nbsp;Their motivation for living was their hatred and desire to wipe out the Dragon Demon King worshippers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even as several dozens of years passed, their hatred showed no signs of abating. &nbsp;However, they were tired. &nbsp;As they continued to fight, they realized that this was a fight with no end. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had no idea how they’ll able to end this vendetta…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Guardian Shadows were strong, but they couldn’t overwhelm them while they were centralized within the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;The only thing they could do was to make the Dragon Demon king worshippers more wary as they moved within the human society. &nbsp;They acted as powerful monitors and defenders, but they possessed no methods that would allow them to cut off the evil from the source.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In such a situation, the only hope they had was the prophecy. &nbsp;It was basically like gospel to them. &nbsp;They were similar to believers that endured hardship, while they waited to be saved by god. &nbsp;They fought in an endless fight for dozens of years with the belief that the person from the prophecy would appear some day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was funny, but the Dragon Demon king worshippers and the Guardian Shadows were quite similar in that aspect. &nbsp;They were two sides of the same coin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One side held believed that a prophesied being would eventually appear on day to save them. &nbsp;On the other side, they believed that the dead Dragon Demon king would one day come back to life, and he would make the world into a paradise. &nbsp;They believed the changed world would be gifted to them. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both sides held to those faith as if it was a religious belief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the same for Balseru.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he inherited the codename Alpha as a Keeper of Prophecy, he gave up any pursuit any normal human would want to pursue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His sight was a symbol of what he gave up. &nbsp;The power contained with his eyes required him to close his eyes at all times. &nbsp;He had given up seeing on what the world looked like. &nbsp;He could function as if he had his eyes open using his unique power, but it wasn’t the same as seeing the world with his own eyes. &nbsp;For a long while, he was no longer moved by the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His eyes only opened when he fought the Dragon Demon king worshippers, and when he did, the world looked foreign to him. &nbsp;He was unfamiliar with the shapes and color of the world, and the beings that lived within the world was strange to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, he was currently seeing a being that was the strangest being in this world..</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Azell Karzark.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was the legendary hero from 220 years ago. &nbsp;He ended the Dragon Demon war by defeating the Dragon Demon king Atein.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After two years into the post-Dragon Demon war, he went missing. &nbsp;No one knew if he was alive or not. &nbsp;Even his best friend, Archmage Carlos, didn’t know about his whereabouts. &nbsp;As time passed, many conjectures regarding Azell had cropped up, and now only his legend remained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When a young man name named Azell Zestringer appeared, they Keepers of the Prophecy thought there was a possibility that he was the one from the prophecy. &nbsp;This was why they had kept a close eye on him. &nbsp;At times, they tested him, and they also offered help to him. &nbsp;They tried hard to confirm that he was the one they were waiting for. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had thought Azel Zestringer looked very similar to Azell Karzark inside the portrait. &nbsp;This was why some had theorized that the descendant of Azell Karzark might be the one to end the Dragon Demon king worhsippers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>They never imagined that he was THE Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha ha ha…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru became surprised. &nbsp;A very unfamiliar sound was coming out from his mouth. &nbsp;Even as he realized this, he kept making the sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha ha ha ha ha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru immediately realized that he was laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When was the last time he laughed? &nbsp;He couldn't’ remember it. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why it sounded so unfamiliar and strange even as his vocal cords made the sound..</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Balseru?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sleepless Guardians were puzzled as they looked towards Balseru. &nbsp;They were with Balseru for several dozens of years, yet they had never seen him laugh. &nbsp;At that moment, they wondered if Balserus had lost his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Balseru was sane. &nbsp;He was thing clearer than any point in time…. &nbsp;When he lost his memories, there was a truth that he couldn’t approach in his mind. &nbsp;It was concealed within a thick fog, yet this hidden truth came to his consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if it had been prepared to be revealed for this exact moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru, who had been laughing like a mad man, cut off his laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…I see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A voice full of delight flowed out of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So that’s how it is……!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru finally realized the true meaning behind the existence of the Keepers of the Prophecy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His memories had come forth like a flood, and when the tide ebbed, he spoke towards Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>3</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ooooooooooooh……!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus’ hammer let out an explosive energy that was like a black fog. &nbsp;At the same time, Reygus’ magical energy rose, and it seemed to go on for ages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He might have more magical energy now than when he was alive.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From what Azell remembered, Reygus was clearly weaker now than before. &nbsp;His physical ability and magical energy was about the same. &nbsp;However, he didn’t possess any Dragon Demon magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a Dragon Arts practitioner, there were many things that they could do, because of the Dragon Demon magic. &nbsp;Even if all other deficiencies can be covered with a Dragon weapon, the loss of Dragon Demon magic was supposed to be a too big of a gulf to bridge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, Reygus’ magical energy was quickly swelling. &nbsp;He already possessed an incredible amount of magical energy, but now it had doubled in quantity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An Undead’s ability was based solely on magical energy, so it meant that his battle capability had increased as well. &nbsp;Azell was tense as he attacked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Nothing good will come from dragging this out!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, Azell possessed magical energy that was on par with his prime, but he couldn’t maintain it for long. &nbsp;His vessel for his magical energy was incomplete, so his magical energy was overflowing. &nbsp;He was working hard to control the magical energy, and it was taxing for him. &nbsp;He had to end this quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He turned his Dragon Maken into light as he ran across the air. &nbsp;He hit Reygus with a strike that transcended one’s senses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You bastard! &nbsp;I’m trying to transform to show you my true power. &nbsp;Don’t you know the etiquette where you have to wait for me?&gt; </span></p>
