 <p>Chapter 118 - Guide's Gift (4)</p>
 <p><span style>6</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think it should be around here somewhere…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the next morning, Yuren led the party to a cave located halfway up a mountain. The road up was winding, and numerous boulders were piled upon other. &nbsp;It was difficult to locate the entrance to the cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm. &nbsp;It’s here. &nbsp;I’m sure of it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s supposed to be here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone looked at Yuren as if they wanted to hit him. &nbsp;Kairen sighed as he spoke to Leticia.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t believe you trusted this guy enough to make him your companion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…sometimes I do regret my decision. &nbsp;I’m happy that there are more people, who feel the same way as me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia grumbled. &nbsp;After she started traveling with Yuren, she had become frequently annoyed by his attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, well. &nbsp;I just know that something good is here…. &nbsp;I don’t know how else I should explain this. &nbsp;How unfortunate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I sometimes wish you were a poor speaker. &nbsp;Just shut up, and lead us from the front.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Leticia growled her words, Yuren shrugged his shoulders. &nbsp;He was the at the forefront of the group as he led the party into the cave. &nbsp;He put up a ball of light that would precede him, then he used his Flight magic to float through the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The guide said there are magical traps here. &nbsp;It’ll activate if you step on it, so please avoid doing so. &nbsp;I’m also using a Detection magic, but there might be some traps that I might not be able to find. &nbsp;So everyone should be careful…. &nbsp;Do you mind if I place the Flight spell on all of you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren hesitated before he asked the question. &nbsp;The act of placing the Flight spell on others could be seen as a precursor for him to double cross the party. &nbsp;While in mid-air, the Magician had complete control over their subject, so they had no idea what he’ll do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Azell didn’t worry over it. &nbsp;He nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you sure?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My sword is faster than whatever you can do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…wow. &nbsp;That hurts as little bit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t say I trust you, because you haven’t earned enough of my trust for me to so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still, couldn’t you have said it in a more roundabout way?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren grumbled as he placed the Flight spell on the whole party except Laura. &nbsp;The party entered the cave, while they floated 30 cm up in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cave entrance was very steep. &nbsp;However, after a certain point, the steep slope leveled out, and the cave gradually expanded in size. Azell was astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We would have been in deep trouble if we just charged in here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is unquestionably a lot of magical spells placed in here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Kairen was astonished. &nbsp;The magical traps were perfectly hidden. &nbsp;Still, Yuren’s Detection magic revealed their existence. &nbsp;The spell shouldn’t have revealed every one of them, but an incredible amount of traps were detected, while they traveled for 200 meters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was one thing Azell could do nothing about. &nbsp;If he focused, he could tell that there were magic spells around him, and he could sense that the spells were dangerous. &nbsp;However, he couldn’t give any detailed information about the magic spells. &nbsp;He couldn’t disable them either. &nbsp;This was the territory of the Magicians.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m pretty sure there are magic spells that aren't reacting to the Detection spell. &nbsp;How are you evading those?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have the Key spell. &nbsp;&nbsp;We just have to avoid the magic spells that will activate when we step on it. &nbsp;We just have to avoid the area of detection. &nbsp;The rest….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t think it is easy as you make it out to seem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The guide gave me a sketch of the set up, and he told me the Key spell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell looked at Yuren as if to say he found Yuren’s words to be dubious. &nbsp;If one thought logically, Yuren or his acquaintances had probably made this place. &nbsp;There was a possibility that their party was being lured into a trap….</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘On the other hand, he doesn’t look like the type to be good at acting.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this point, he really was curious about Yuren’s identity. &nbsp;Actually, he wanted to know the identity of the guide….. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The party continued forward. &nbsp;There were so many traps that the progress was slow. &nbsp;Still, the tension went down a notch, because they didn’t encounter any danger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it around 300 meters? &nbsp;This place is pretty deep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was hard to estimate the distance they had travelled, but Azell knew the exact distance to the entrance. &nbsp;However, his wariness kept increasing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Woo-oohng…….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Azell felt a magical energy rise up from within him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Vitan’s Chalice?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vitan’s Chalice was reacting to something in his surrounding.&nbsp; It was as if it was trying to tell him something. &nbsp;When Azell focused on the sensation, he became aware of a fact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…I see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen asked a question &nbsp;Azell clicked his tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s very clever. &nbsp;We haven’t even descended 30 meters yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone looked at Azell in surprised. &nbsp;Azell looked at Yuren as he asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You knew about this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was curious as to when you were going to realize it. &nbsp;It took me awhile to realize it too… &nbsp;I’ve been trying to access the magic directly to open the lock… &nbsp;How did you find out?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Vitan’s Chalice alerted me to it. If not, I might have either found out about it at a much later time or I might have not known about it at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you guys talking about? &nbsp;Please explain it to us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen was frustrated, so he spoke up.&nbsp; Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ve entered into a distorted space. &nbsp;This cave is only 30 meters long, yet the space was distorted to make us go around in circles…. &nbsp;It is made in a very clever way. &nbsp;I didn’t even feel the trace of this magic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell shivered. &nbsp;This place was made by someone with incredible skills. &nbsp;This person was a high rank magician, who was able to manipulate space. &nbsp;It was very rare to see a magician skilled enough to distort a fixed space, and mess with the sense of space. &nbsp;&nbsp;He was skillful enough to make Azell feel as if he had traveled 10 times the original distance….</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He is dangerous.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Vitan’s Chalice was probably frustrated that its owner hadn’t known what was going on, so it gave him the answer. &nbsp;At the same time, this put Azell on alert. &nbsp;He hadn’t known he was inside a magic spell until he was actually in it. &nbsp;This meant a trap could be sprung without him knowing about it. &nbsp;They might already be in a trap. &nbsp;Azell was about to bring out the Vitan’s Chalice when Yuren spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t have to bring out your Dragon weapon. &nbsp;The lock has been released. &nbsp;I just have to open the door, and we’ll be able to exit this place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How long has it been since you unlocked it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s been about 10 minutes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…you were watching us roam around?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was curious as to when you’ll realize it. &nbsp;I was going to watch you all for five more minutes then I would have released the spell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be angry. &nbsp;I thought it was a great opportunity to check out the abilities of my comrades.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell flinched at those words. &nbsp;Yuren looked at Azell quizzically, and Azell saw an image superimposed on Yuren.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…you just reminded me of someone I knew.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had wanted to smack Yuren, and his actions reminded Azell of Carlos. &nbsp;Before they became best friends, Carlos always used to test Azell using various methods. &nbsp;Even in difficult situations he could stop at any time, Carlos just observed the situation. &nbsp;He watched to see how far Azell could be pushed, and he spoke in a patronizing manner when everything was wrapped up. &nbsp;At such times, Azell had wanted to beat up Carlos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Yuren looked like Carlos. &nbsp;The fact that their faces looked similar added to the similarity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is he really Carlos’ descendant?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell thought about the past, and it happened when he was in a state of confusion. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Something suddenly stimulated Azell’s senses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…mmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Yuren dispelled the magic that was distorting the space. A haze formed, and the landscape curved to form an entirely different surrounding..</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone looked at their surrounding in surprise. &nbsp;They were at the end of the cave before they knew it. &nbsp;It wasn’t that large of a space, and in the middle, there was a pillar letting out a low blue light. &nbsp;Within it….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that a magical armor?</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a set of white armor arranged inside. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s expression turned peculiar when he saw it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This… &nbsp;Is this...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Yuren stepped in front of the armor, and he spun on his heels. &nbsp;Then he opened his arms wide as if he was an actor from a theater troupe. &nbsp;He spoke dramatically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the gift that the guide wanted me to give you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know what it is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, I have no idea!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, by the look of it, isn’t it a really good magical armor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell looked at the armor with a complicated expression on his face. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Laura spoke up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“White Dragon armor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone turned to look at her. &nbsp;Laura stared at the armor as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This looks similar to the White Dragon armor worn by Azell Karzark.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the reason why Azell had a complicated expression on his face. &nbsp;This armor looked like the one he had worn during the Dragon Demon war.</span></p>
 <p><span style>7</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the time of the Dragon Demon war, Azell had pretty much worn magic battle-gear all over his body. &nbsp;The White Dragon armor used Dragon’s bones as framework. &nbsp;The Dragon’s scales were melted and it was combined with magic metal. &nbsp;This armor and helmet was made using these ingredients.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“White Dragon armor….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell approached the armor. &nbsp;Then he looked at his surrounding before he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm. &nbsp;Is it ok if I touch it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All the magic spells were disabled. &nbsp;The armor might be able to determine if a person is worthy to be its owner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is a magic gear that has self-awareness?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maybe. &nbsp;It’s probably not smart. &nbsp;It probably has a faint instinct it can act on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aside from the Dragon weapons, there were magical gears out there that possessed self-awareness. &nbsp;They were able to choose worthy owners. &nbsp;It seemed this armor was such an item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This isn’t the White Dragon armor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? &nbsp;But… &nbsp;It looks the same.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura titled her head in puzzlement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve actually seen the White Dragon armor before?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve only seen it in the records. &nbsp;It is the same as the one in the recorded image.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen butted into the conversation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve also seen the portrait of Azell Karzark, and the design looks similar… &nbsp;Why are you so sure that it isn’t the real thing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The White Dragon armor isn’t an item that possess self-awareness. &nbsp;I’m sure about that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The White Dragon armor had not been made for Azell in the first place. &nbsp;It was an equipment he stole from his enemy. &nbsp;When he obtained it, he had given it to the smith to resize it. &nbsp;However, there were no other requirements in using that particular equipment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, it seems someone really made an exact replica of the White Dragon armor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell carefully picked up the helmet placed on top of the armor. &nbsp;At the same time, something swept over his senses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Mmmm?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azsell reflexively tried to shield his senses, but he gave up on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;He realized a magical thought contained within the helmet was flowing into his senses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Hmm. &nbsp;Can you hear my voice?</span></p>
 <p><span style>From within Azell, someone’s voice rang out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had heard this voice once before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘…Carlos?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was similar to the thought manifestation of the old Carlos he met inside the ruin of the Balan Forest. &nbsp;When Azell saw him, he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You are the one, who left this behind for me. &nbsp;Even after you lost all your hair, you are reliable….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>-If you can hear my voice, the person to acquire this item must be Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The thought manifestation of Carlos ignored Azell’s words as it spoke what it had to say. &nbsp;</span></p>
