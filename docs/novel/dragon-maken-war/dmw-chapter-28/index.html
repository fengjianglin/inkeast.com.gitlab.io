  <p></p>
  <hr>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>“Azell performed a great meritorious deed by safely bringing the the princess here. Are you going to ignore what the princess said?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“How could her words be true? Sir Giles, you don’t know about this, but the princess is excessively lenient towards her underlings. Moreover, if she had faced an enemy that could threaten her, how could a man with an unknown background be able to perform such meritorious deed? Would that make any sense?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Also, doesn’t he look weak? How could he help the princess with such a frail body?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell’s body didn’t have much muscles yet. Of course, his body was frail compared to a thoroughly trained knight.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Even if that was true, Boar’s every word had the power of being able to provoke a person. Azell suddenly poured too much strength into his fist, and it almost creaked aloud. However, he was barely able to hold himself back.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘This bastard’s personality is really in the sewers. Ah, should I really just beat him up? Should I wait until the princess comes, and ask her to knight me then beat him up?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Currently, Azell controlled the energy he emitted outward, so he evoked an atmosphere of familiarity without any pressure. However, it didn’t matter what kind of impression Azell had possessed, the other had dismissed him at first glance. Azell’s effort was all for naught since his opponent didn’t bother to see what kind of person he was. He(TLN: Boar) was armed with a firm prejudice. (TLN: basically Azell used his skill to project a friendly/neutral attitude, but the other guy is too much of an ass to notice it)</span></p>
  <p><span style>Boar mocked him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Well, Sir Giles, you probably don’t know much about the princess since you are in such a remote region. However, you are also going on a long journey back to the royal palace, so you better engrave my words in your heart.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>He was blatantly looking down on Sir Giles. He must have a high enough position in the royal palace to guard the princess, so Giles must have looked like a backwater country bumpkin to him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles glared at him. Boar’s expression looked down on him as if he was daring Giles to say something. The tension between the two was high.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The volatile atmosphere was broken due to Arrieta arriving.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Everyone has gathered.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta and Enora appeared together. Unlike her usual self, she wore a voluminous hat, and it covered the upper portion of her head and her horns. It also covered her pointy ears. She wore a thick travelling cloak to hid her figure.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles and Boars retracted the hostility they were aiming at each other, and they paid their respects to her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell queried in confusion.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What do mean by everyone?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I meant what I said. All the party members have assembled.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta answered him. Azell was surprised at those word.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What? Five people is everyone?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No, how is that…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta had asked him to be part of her escort, and Azell had thought there would be additional several dozens of troops that would also follow. Originally, didn’t she come here with about twenty soldiers following her?</span></p>
  <p><span style>“My escort party members, the magicians and the scholars will return at a later date.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Three from her 30 member party was killed during the ambush by the Dragon’s Shadow. Moreover, there were 11 wounded. Arrieta ignored the objection from all the others, and she decided to take at most only two members. She decided to return to the royal palace in haste.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Actually, I thought about putting on a disguise, but unfortunately it is impossible.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“A disguise?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“My appearance is too eye-catching, so I considered disguising myself with magic. However, after I consulted with the magicians, they did not have any magic that could do that. They said it was impossible for them to cast such magic. It is unfortunate.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta was a Dragon Demon, and the Dragon Demon magic resisted outside magic being used on her. Therefore, it was impossible for a middling magician to make changes to her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arritea asked a question.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I tried to dress up so I wouldn’t be too noticeable… How do I look?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You look very noticeable.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Is that so?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta was a little bit depressed when Azell spoke truthfully.</span></p>
  <p><span style>She had insisted on wearing a large fluffy hat, and a cape. In her own way, she tried hard to hide her eye-catching appearance. However, the outfit itself was so ridiculous that it stood out. Even if she hid her horns, ears and the Dragon Demon stone on the back of her hands, her appearance was enough to draw everyone’s eyes to her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta let out a sigh.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Enora was also opposed to it.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Well, it’s better than outright revealing oneself.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Even if it is a platitude, I’ll thankfully listen to it.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Still, isn’t it dangerous to go with such little manpower?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta seriously answered Azell’s question.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmm. If I’m being honest… I think it is more dangerous to have middling number of people.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I guess that makes sense.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The statement could be seen as overly dismissive of the escort’s military prowess. However, he had fought against the Dragon’s Shadow, so he agreed with her. If they had an overwhelming advantage in numbers then he would have no problem with it. However, the 20-30 party members would just make them a bigger target.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell queried.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Is Ms Enora leaving with us?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…is it wise to do so?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“My thoughts exactly, so I tried to prevent her….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta looked at Enora, while sighing. Enora was making a stubborn expression. Arrieta had told Enora in the night that she should stay here, and she should come with the other party……</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I can never do that! If I did, then I’ll be hit with a bolt of lightning from the head maid! Does princess want to make my body ineligible for marriage?’ (TLN:Enora basically a lady-in-waiting with a decent family background.)</span></p>
  <p><span style>…she had no idea why staying here would affect her marriage prospects. Enora cried and clung to her, so Arrieta had given in.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I had no idea this child was so fearless.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Until now, her other personal maids hadn’t been that courageous. Once she left the palace to go to the battlefield, every personal maid turned pale, and they wanted to quit.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘It really is as the head maid said. There aren’t anyone else as competent as this child.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arietta had been taken aback when the head maid tagged Enora as her personal maid. She was still very young, and it had only been half a year since she had joined the palace maids.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Amongst the palace maids, there were young girls. However, most of them were in charge of doing minor tasks, while they learned the duties of a palace maid. It was normal for a highly trained maid to be assigned to the members of the royal family, who held high stations.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The head maid went against those customs, and she had assigned Enora to Arrieta as a personal maid. She was not only tasked to serve her in the palace, but she was tasked to act as an aid when Arrieta traveled outside.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Her choice was correct. Enora had gone through hardship that couldn’t even be compared to what the previous personal maid had gone through yet she didn’t show any signs of wanting to quit. She wondered how the poet Bairay(TLN:author/poet, but it might be a typo by author) raised his daughter.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Enora queried.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“There is no one here to take care of princess, and I can’t send you off with males only. Also…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>She spoke strongly, while looking at the men.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Don’t tell me you don’t have any confidence in being able to protect me?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hmm. Does that even need to be said? Relax and follow me. I’ll solve any danger we face.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>For a knight following the rules of chivalry, it isn’t an exaggeration to say a knight without his pride is basically a corpse. Boar had succeeded in entering the royal knights at a young age, so he was of this mold. After Enora’s spoken words had bristled his pride, he immediately pounded his chest, and he boasted.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell smiled bitterly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What you say has some merit… Mmm. Well, it can’t be helped since everything has been decided.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>No matter how one saw it, Enora was a really tough girl. If she had grown up sheltered then she wouldn’t be this way. Maybe she had experienced many dangerous situation in her childhood.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“We are traveling as a small group, so we’ll ride the horses instead of the carriage. Enora.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m not sure if you can ride a horse….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I know how to.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m not proficient at it, but I learned it alongside my brother.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That is surprising. Impressive.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta was surprised. She hadn’t expected a 12 year old noble girl, who had come to the palace to work, had learned horsemanship.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Great. Enora, Azell and I will go pick some horses.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The three of them immediately went to the fortress’ stable. When they were far from Giles and Boar, Arrieta started to speak.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m sorry you had to go through that unpleasantness.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You know about it?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“My ears are unnecessarily sensitive, so I heard it even from a distance.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta laughed bitterly. Then she turned to look at Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Sir Boar was a knight recommended to me by the head of my escort party, who had traveled with me here. I told them I wanted to travel with small party. However, both the commander of this place and the head of the escort begged me to take at least one of their numbers….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta wasn’t in a situation where she could turn down the request. When she said yes, the commander of Western Border guard picked Giles and the head of escort party chose Boar.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I don’t know much about Sir Giles, but I’ve heard Sir Boar is quite skilled.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If he wasn’t, he would’t have been chosen in a situation where only one person can be sent. He is a Cord Rope master.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…how were you able to tell?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arietta asked in surprise. Azell smirked.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“He didn’t make much effort to hide it. Well, he’ll be of some help in a battle.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell didn’t like Boar, but he decided to make an assessment in a detached manner. Azell had read him instantly, and by looking at how he controlled his energy, he knew Boar’s skill was up to a decent level.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta asked a question, while she put on a playful smile.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“How doe he compare to you?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmm. Do you want a serious answer?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If I fight him in my current condition, I could cut off his head with three strikes.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell spoke in a calm voice, and his brutal words made Arrieta hold her breath. Azell saw Enora flinch besides Arietta, and Azell smiled bitterly at his mistake.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…my language was a bit too excessive. Any ways, I think Sir Boar is completely overlooking me.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I understand. Sir Boar has no idea about you, but he was able to get on your nerves?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Will he not try hard to get on my nerves from here on out? This was why I thought of something.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ll bear it with my eyes closed. After princess knights me, I’ll challenge him to a duel…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You’ll shut your eyes and bear being knighted by me… I can’t believe you said it that way. There are many men who dream about that exact situation happening to them.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m sorry. However, I’m not in a situation where I want to be tied down, so I don’t want to do this. I’ll have to either be patient with him or….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Or?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I guess I’ll rely on princess’ authority.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That doesn’t sound very manly.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“He seems to come from a decent family. He is acting this way because he trust his background. What can I do? My origin is not known, so I can only fight back using my background as princess’ bodyguard.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You spoke truthfully…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta was dumbfounded so she laughed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ve never heard such pathetic word since I’ve been born.(TLN: she is jokingly saying this) I can’t believe you are this bold and shameless.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You don’t like it?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m ok with it. It’s really mystifying.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta shook her head and asked a question.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“So should this be your reward for all you have done for me?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You don’t have to be tied down by me. I’m saying I’ll knight you.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>At those words, Azell stared blankly at her for a moment.</span></p>
  <p><span style>If someone from the royal family with the qualification of being a liege appointed a knight than it was par for the course for the person to require the knight to serve only him or her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, there were other irregular ways to structure the oath of loyalty made between a liege and his vassal when the knight is appointed. Instead of receiving a fief, it was possible for the knight to receive his rank without taking the oath of loyalty.</span></p>
  <p><span style>These unconventional appointments didn’t exist before the Dragon Demon war. In the past, the knights rode out into battle on a horse so they were invaluable to the cavalry. This was why all the knights had to swear an oath of fealty, and they became nobles after receiving land.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, during the Dragon Demon war, the young Emperor Haben of the Nadick empire succeeded the old and frail late emperor. He had put forth a radical idea.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He changed how the title of ‘knight’ was interpreted.</span></p>
  <p><span style>One need not be a cavalryman. It didn’t matter if one was a magician or even a Dragon Demon. If one had enough ability, then they could receive the title of knight, and they would be able to raise their social status. The appointing liege and the appointed knight didn’t even need to agree to a oath of fealty.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was a time where they needed to find additional talents to fight the Dragon Demon race. It was a plan to stop the talented people from being unable to shine because of their backgrounds. They also had in mind of the magicians, who weren’t of noble birth, that had left the empire, because of the problem arising from their caste.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This change was quite effective. It especially succeeded in making the magicians, who were wandering around the world, join the battlefield. (TLN: basically you can become a knight if you have the ability. Before you needed a horse + good family background)</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘If only Emperor Haben had lived a bit longer, the empire wouldn’t have fallen.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell reminisced about the past. The admired young emperor Haben was killed by the Dragon Demon King Atein during the time when Azell started to earn his fame.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, the act that was meant to change the world was still in place. He thought the world was very mysterious.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After a brief thought, Azell asked a question.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…aren’t you getting the short end of the stick in this deal?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Well, it is a power left over(TLN: I think she is implying she can appoint finite number of people-she hasn’t appointed anyone before so she still has the power to do so) since I haven’t used it too much. If anything, don’t you think the price is cheap since you’ve saved my life? This is the time for me to show my vast generosity, and I’m going to invest in you for the future.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What if I cut off all my ties from you?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Then… Mmm. I’ll be sad.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta really tried to make a sad expression. Her speech and attitude was very formal, but her outer appearance was that of a pretty girl. She looked extremely cute.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Well, well.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell raised both his hands as if he had lost. Was it because she was a young woman, who grew up, being fated to step on to a battlefield? Unlike her outer appearance, she</span></p>
  <p><span style>was formidable.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Eventually, Azell bowed his head.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ll receive it with thanks.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I need witnesses for the appointment. Let us head back. I’ll have Sir Giles and Sir Boar participate in it.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That sounds perfectly appropriate.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>While he was nodding his head, he looked at Enora as if he thought of something.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ah, Ms Enora.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m not a civilian now, but a knight…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Is that so? You aren’t one yet.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Well, I will be one soon so don’t be so inflexible. So can I call you little miss now?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Enora furrowed her brows and she asked a question to Arrieta.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Princess, may I hit this person?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“In the name of the Dragon Demon Princess, I allow the punishment of the man, who insulted my maid.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Then I won’t refuse.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Whoa. How scary.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell trembled in an exaggerated manner then he ran away from Enora, who was raising her fist.</span></p>

 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Azell performed a great meritorious deed by safely bringing the the princess here. Are you going to ignore what the princess said?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could her words be true? Sir Giles, you don’t know about this, but the princess is excessively lenient towards her underlings. Moreover, if she had faced an enemy that could threaten her, how could a man with an unknown background be able to perform such meritorious deed? Would that make any sense?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Also, doesn’t he look weak? How could he help the princess with such a frail body?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s body didn’t have much muscles yet. Of course, his body was frail compared to a thoroughly trained knight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if that was true, Boar’s every word had the power of being able to provoke a person. Azell suddenly poured too much strength into his fist, and it almost creaked aloud. However, he was barely able to hold himself back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This bastard’s personality is really in the sewers. Ah, should I really just beat him up? Should I wait until the princess comes, and ask her to knight me then beat him up?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, Azell controlled the energy he emitted outward, so he evoked an atmosphere of familiarity without any pressure. However, it didn’t matter what kind of impression Azell had possessed, the other had dismissed him at first glance. Azell’s effort was all for naught since his opponent didn’t bother to see what kind of person he was. He(TLN: Boar) was armed with a firm prejudice. (TLN: basically Azell used his skill to project a friendly/neutral attitude, but the other guy is too much of an ass to notice it)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boar mocked him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, Sir Giles, you probably don’t know much about the princess since you are in such a remote region. However, you are also going on a long journey back to the royal palace, so you better engrave my words in your heart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was blatantly looking down on Sir Giles. He must have a high enough position in the royal palace to guard the princess, so Giles must have looked like a backwater country bumpkin to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles glared at him. Boar’s expression looked down on him as if he was daring Giles to say something. The tension between the two was high.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The volatile atmosphere was broken due to Arrieta arriving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone has gathered.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta and Enora appeared together. Unlike her usual self, she wore a voluminous hat, and it covered the upper portion of her head and her horns. It also covered her pointy ears. She wore a thick travelling cloak to hid her figure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles and Boars retracted the hostility they were aiming at each other, and they paid their respects to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell queried in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do mean by everyone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I meant what I said. All the party members have assembled.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta answered him. Azell was surprised at those word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Five people is everyone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, how is that…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta had asked him to be part of her escort, and Azell had thought there would be additional several dozens of troops that would also follow. Originally, didn’t she come here with about twenty soldiers following her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My escort party members, the magicians and the scholars will return at a later date.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three from her 30 member party was killed during the ambush by the Dragon’s Shadow. Moreover, there were 11 wounded. Arrieta ignored the objection from all the others, and she decided to take at most only two members. She decided to return to the royal palace in haste.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, I thought about putting on a disguise, but unfortunately it is impossible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A disguise?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My appearance is too eye-catching, so I considered disguising myself with magic. However, after I consulted with the magicians, they did not have any magic that could do that. They said it was impossible for them to cast such magic. It is unfortunate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta was a Dragon Demon, and the Dragon Demon magic resisted outside magic being used on her. Therefore, it was impossible for a middling magician to make changes to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arritea asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I tried to dress up so I wouldn’t be too noticeable… How do I look?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You look very noticeable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta was a little bit depressed when Azell spoke truthfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had insisted on wearing a large fluffy hat, and a cape. In her own way, she tried hard to hide her eye-catching appearance. However, the outfit itself was so ridiculous that it stood out. Even if she hid her horns, ears and the Dragon Demon stone on the back of her hands, her appearance was enough to draw everyone’s eyes to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta let out a sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enora was also opposed to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, it’s better than outright revealing oneself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if it is a platitude, I’ll thankfully listen to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still, isn’t it dangerous to go with such little manpower?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta seriously answered Azell’s question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm. If I’m being honest… I think it is more dangerous to have middling number of people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess that makes sense.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The statement could be seen as overly dismissive of the escort’s military prowess. However, he had fought against the Dragon’s Shadow, so he agreed with her. If they had an overwhelming advantage in numbers then he would have no problem with it. However, the 20-30 party members would just make them a bigger target.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell queried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is Ms Enora leaving with us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…is it wise to do so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My thoughts exactly, so I tried to prevent her….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta looked at Enora, while sighing. Enora was making a stubborn expression. Arrieta had told Enora in the night that she should stay here, and she should come with the other party……</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can never do that! If I did, then I’ll be hit with a bolt of lightning from the head maid! Does princess want to make my body ineligible for marriage?’ (TLN:Enora basically a lady-in-waiting with a decent family background.)</span></p>
 <p><span style>…she had no idea why staying here would affect her marriage prospects. Enora cried and clung to her, so Arrieta had given in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I had no idea this child was so fearless.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Until now, her other personal maids hadn’t been that courageous. Once she left the palace to go to the battlefield, every personal maid turned pale, and they wanted to quit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It really is as the head maid said. There aren’t anyone else as competent as this child.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arietta had been taken aback when the head maid tagged Enora as her personal maid. She was still very young, and it had only been half a year since she had joined the palace maids.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amongst the palace maids, there were young girls. However, most of them were in charge of doing minor tasks, while they learned the duties of a palace maid. It was normal for a highly trained maid to be assigned to the members of the royal family, who held high stations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The head maid went against those customs, and she had assigned Enora to Arrieta as a personal maid. She was not only tasked to serve her in the palace, but she was tasked to act as an aid when Arrieta traveled outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her choice was correct. Enora had gone through hardship that couldn’t even be compared to what the previous personal maid had gone through yet she didn’t show any signs of wanting to quit. She wondered how the poet Bairay(TLN:author/poet, but it might be a typo by author) raised his daughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enora queried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is no one here to take care of princess, and I can’t send you off with males only. Also…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She spoke strongly, while looking at the men.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t tell me you don’t have any confidence in being able to protect me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm. Does that even need to be said? Relax and follow me. I’ll solve any danger we face.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a knight following the rules of chivalry, it isn’t an exaggeration to say a knight without his pride is basically a corpse. Boar had succeeded in entering the royal knights at a young age, so he was of this mold. After Enora’s spoken words had bristled his pride, he immediately pounded his chest, and he boasted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell smiled bitterly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What you say has some merit… Mmm. Well, it can’t be helped since everything has been decided.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how one saw it, Enora was a really tough girl. If she had grown up sheltered then she wouldn’t be this way. Maybe she had experienced many dangerous situation in her childhood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are traveling as a small group, so we’ll ride the horses instead of the carriage. Enora.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not sure if you can ride a horse….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know how to.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not proficient at it, but I learned it alongside my brother.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is surprising. Impressive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta was surprised. She hadn’t expected a 12 year old noble girl, who had come to the palace to work, had learned horsemanship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great. Enora, Azell and I will go pick some horses.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three of them immediately went to the fortress’ stable. When they were far from Giles and Boar, Arrieta started to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry you had to go through that unpleasantness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know about it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My ears are unnecessarily sensitive, so I heard it even from a distance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta laughed bitterly. Then she turned to look at Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir Boar was a knight recommended to me by the head of my escort party, who had traveled with me here. I told them I wanted to travel with small party. However, both the commander of this place and the head of the escort begged me to take at least one of their numbers….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta wasn’t in a situation where she could turn down the request. When she said yes, the commander of Western Border guard picked Giles and the head of escort party chose Boar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know much about Sir Giles, but I’ve heard Sir Boar is quite skilled.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If he wasn’t, he would’t have been chosen in a situation where only one person can be sent. He is a Cord Rope master.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…how were you able to tell?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arietta asked in surprise. Azell smirked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He didn’t make much effort to hide it. Well, he’ll be of some help in a battle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell didn’t like Boar, but he decided to make an assessment in a detached manner. Azell had read him instantly, and by looking at how he controlled his energy, he knew Boar’s skill was up to a decent level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta asked a question, while she put on a playful smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How doe he compare to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm. Do you want a serious answer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I fight him in my current condition, I could cut off his head with three strikes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke in a calm voice, and his brutal words made Arrieta hold her breath. Azell saw Enora flinch besides Arietta, and Azell smiled bitterly at his mistake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…my language was a bit too excessive. Any ways, I think Sir Boar is completely overlooking me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand. Sir Boar has no idea about you, but he was able to get on your nerves?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Will he not try hard to get on my nerves from here on out? This was why I thought of something.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll bear it with my eyes closed. After princess knights me, I’ll challenge him to a duel…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ll shut your eyes and bear being knighted by me… I can’t believe you said it that way. There are many men who dream about that exact situation happening to them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry. However, I’m not in a situation where I want to be tied down, so I don’t want to do this. I’ll have to either be patient with him or….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Or?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess I’ll rely on princess’ authority.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That doesn’t sound very manly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He seems to come from a decent family. He is acting this way because he trust his background. What can I do? My origin is not known, so I can only fight back using my background as princess’ bodyguard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You spoke truthfully…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta was dumbfounded so she laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve never heard such pathetic word since I’ve been born.(TLN: she is jokingly saying this) I can’t believe you are this bold and shameless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t like it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m ok with it. It’s really mystifying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta shook her head and asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So should this be your reward for all you have done for me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t have to be tied down by me. I’m saying I’ll knight you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At those words, Azell stared blankly at her for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If someone from the royal family with the qualification of being a liege appointed a knight than it was par for the course for the person to require the knight to serve only him or her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there were other irregular ways to structure the oath of loyalty made between a liege and his vassal when the knight is appointed. Instead of receiving a fief, it was possible for the knight to receive his rank without taking the oath of loyalty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These unconventional appointments didn’t exist before the Dragon Demon war. In the past, the knights rode out into battle on a horse so they were invaluable to the cavalry. This was why all the knights had to swear an oath of fealty, and they became nobles after receiving land.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, during the Dragon Demon war, the young Emperor Haben of the Nadick empire succeeded the old and frail late emperor. He had put forth a radical idea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He changed how the title of ‘knight’ was interpreted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One need not be a cavalryman. It didn’t matter if one was a magician or even a Dragon Demon. If one had enough ability, then they could receive the title of knight, and they would be able to raise their social status. The appointing liege and the appointed knight didn’t even need to agree to a oath of fealty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a time where they needed to find additional talents to fight the Dragon Demon race. It was a plan to stop the talented people from being unable to shine because of their backgrounds. They also had in mind of the magicians, who weren’t of noble birth, that had left the empire, because of the problem arising from their caste.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This change was quite effective. It especially succeeded in making the magicians, who were wandering around the world, join the battlefield. (TLN: basically you can become a knight if you have the ability. Before you needed a horse + good family background)</span></p>

 <p><span style>“I’ll receive it with thanks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I need witnesses for the appointment. Let us head back. I’ll have Sir Giles and Sir Boar participate in it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That sounds perfectly appropriate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While he was nodding his head, he looked at Enora as if he thought of something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, Ms Enora.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes?”</span></p>
