  <p><span style>Episode 22 - Dragon Maken (1)</span></p>
  <p></p>
  <hr>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>At that moment, every existence in the continent with the presence of dragon blood shuddered.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“A new Dragon Demon Qi is born…..?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was mumbled by a woman lost in mediation inside the darkness. She had strong magical energy wrapped around her body, and she could dimly sense the event happening in a far away place.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Dragon Demon Qi.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was a refined form of a dragon’s power, and it was created using a soul as an ingredient. It was the very definition of a true magical weapon.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Another voice was heard from the darkness.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Did you say Dragon Demon Qi?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“How can that be?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“There is no way the Dragon Demon Qi was born in this era.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“This era has even forgotten about the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>With that as a start, many voices started flying around.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The woman spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“This sensation…. I’m sure of it. A new Dragon Demon Qi was born outside of our territory.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ll agree it feels the same. This sensation… I could never forget it.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“However, there is no way a new Dragon Demon Qi would be born.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“There is no coincidence in the birth of the Dragon Demon Qi.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Everyone should end the transmission, and let us aid in damaging the Spirit Order’s vision.” (TLN: I’m guessing they can interfere from long distance)</span></p>
  <p><span style>They were talking about doing something horrible. One couldn’t tell what they were talking about, but by observing their nuanced talk, it was revealed that they were in the process of performing an act of historic proportions.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“However, the latter explanation is possible. There might be an owner of Dragon Demon Qi we failed to kill. Someone might have woken up from sleep and there is a possibility that he recovered his Dragon Demon Qi…..”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“According to our records, the last owner of the Dragon Demon Qi, who didn’t belong to us, died 60 years ago. There is no way one could sleep that long.” (TLN: I’m guessing Carlos)</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It might be a real possibility that a new Dragon Demon Qi was born. Could we guarantee that the work we have carried out was perfect? This world is large and isn’t there a lot of humans?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmmm….!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>A brief silence ensued inside the darkness.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Soon, the woman spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Currently, I guess he have no choice but to observe. Let us wait until the new master of Dragon Demon Qi reveals himself to the world….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>2</span></p>
  <p><span style>In between the dispersing light fragments, his red hair was fluttering.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Once he grasped the Dragon Maken, which was flowing with blue light, Azell felt power surge into his entire body. The feeling of helplessness, which had weighed him down since his awakening, disappeared. His old self, who had swept through the battle fields like a storm in the Dragon Demon war, was revived. The energy was making him excited and Azell tried hard to coldly assess the situation.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Its condition is better than the time I woke up.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Dragon Maken wasn’t in a good condition even if it was emitting a strong power. It was analogous to a person having a hard time getting up when one is sick.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was inevitable. While the Dragon Maken was hibernating through the winters, it was basically like a wild animal losing all its accumulated energy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It had even forgotten the name it was given the moment it was born. Azell couldn’t pull out its true ability which he had honed with it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It had reunited with Azell after jumping over a long period of time, and the only thing it could do was burn its existence. (TLN: basically cannibalize its own energy)</span></p>
  <p><span style>Koo-roo-roo-rooo…. (TLN: growling sfx)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Earth Dragon shuddered. The quality of power coming from the human, who had challenged it, was very different from before. He was emitting enough pressure for even a dragon to be afraid.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Koong! (TLN: boom!)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The small human took one step and the earth shook.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Koong! (TLN: boom!)</span></p>
  <p><span style>After another step, the atmosphere vibrated and a gust of wind raged.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Now. Come at me.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell baited the dragon, while smiling.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The human had a presence that was on equal footing with a dragon. Even though the Earth Dragon ran across a situation it didn’t understand, it continued to move.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Dragon Slayer’s Ritual had already started. The ritual doesn’t end until one side is dead.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Koo-roo-roo-roo…… (TLN: growl)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Earth Dragon emitted a mighty magical wave. Soon, the Earth Dragon looked to the sky and roared.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Koo-ah-a-ah-ah-ah! (TLN: rawr)</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was the ultimate destructive method emitted by a dragon, Dragon’s Roar!</span></p>
  <p><span style>The attack that had turned over the earth for a radius of several hundred meter was initiated. The forest that had been ruined was about to go through another catastrophe.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Azell’s figure disappeared the moment the roar rang out.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kwa-haha-hat! (TLN: sfx of sword slicing)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Earth Dragon, who was about to roar, swallowed its breath and it stumbled. A long wound appeared on its neck before the Dragon’s Roar could be used, and its red blood splattered.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Koo-uh-uh-ung! (TLN: dragon in pain sfx)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Earth Dragon screamed in pain. It was the first time in its life it had experienced pain. After hatching from its egg about hundred and couple score years ago, it had gained independence from its parents. After it had settled down in the corner of the Balan Forest, there had been no existence that was able to wound it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Earth Dragon heard Azell’s voice.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It turns out it is a young dragon.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was observing the Earth Dragon from atop a half broken tree.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Earth Dragon had a body larger than a house, so it was strange to hear the expression of it being ‘young’. Dragons had a lifespan of several thousand years, but it matured for 30 years.(TLN: main growth happens in the first 30 years of its life) Afterwards, it becomes the ultimate tyrant with no natural enemies.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Earth Dragon in front of him had finished its growth and it had an adult body. After its growth period ends, it continues to grow minutely, but it was hard to see the change even if couple hundred years had passed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Still, Azell decided the Earth Dragon was young. He could tell after one battle that it didn’t have much experience and it was immature.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Humans have forgotten the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual, but the Dragons haven’t forgotten it. While it knows about the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual, I guess it doesn’t know anything about fighting a life-and-death battle?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Dragon Slayer’s Ritual was a immemorial tradition. It was a pact made between an unknown strong magician and the dragons.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The dragons may be dumb, but the knowledge of the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual was etched into their blood and passed on. Similar to every being able breathe without knowing how to breathe, every dragon knew what the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual was.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, even if they knew about it, it doesn’t mean they had carried it out before.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Basically, the dragons do not know how to fight very well. The weapons they were born with were too strong and it let them easily achieve victory just by swinging their weapons.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Therefore, there was a big difference between a dragon who is experienced in fighting, and an inexperienced dragon. Moreover, a dragon, who had experienced the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual before, is much more dangerous.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This Earth Dragon fell into neither of those options. This is its first time going through the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual and it had never fought against another dragon. Azell was sure of this fact.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘If it was experienced then it wouldn’t have used the Dragon’s Roar in that fashion.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Using the Dragon’s Roar was an overkill when trying to kill one mere human. It was analogous to using a siege weapon to kill a single ant. While it allows one to pour out its maximum power at once, its defense becomes vulnerable. The power protecting its body becomes weak, and an attack that wouldn’t usually scratch it could wound the dragon.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Previously, Azell’s strike was able to leave a deep wound because of this logic.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Koo-roo-roong! Ka-roong! (TLN: more dragon noises)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Earth Dragon let out a intimidating howl.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was the first strong opponent the dragon has faced. Until now, it had easily killed all of its preys. His threat level was similar to its own race!</span></p>
  <p><span style>During this time, the wound on its neck was rapidly healing. If a human had the same wound then the person would be half dead. However, it had healed as if it was never there.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It had a phenomenal regenerative ability.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘It’s probably going to get real now?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was as Azell predicted. The earth beneath his feet exploded, and stones shot toward him like arrows.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Puh-puh-puh-puh-pung! (TLN: sound of stone hitting trees)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The force of the stone being shot was so strong that it made holes in the beautiful trees.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Azell was already gone from that spot. In a flash, he used the Instantaneous Movement method to change location, and he ran towards the Earth Dragon.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Of course, the Earth Dragon didn’t stay in the same place. It hid itself by burrowing into the earth.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Alright! That’s more like it.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell realized he was getting excited.</span></p>
  <p><span style>If one thought about it, it was very unlike Azell to wait for the Earth Dragon to heal after the initial attack. Moreover, he should have taken advantage of the Earth Dragon being flustered. He should have settled it in a single bout. If he had done that, then he would have easily succeeded in killing the dragon.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, during the couple days he had been awake, he had received a lot of stress from his own powerlessness. Now that he had the Dragon Maken in his hand, the desire to experience its power was amplified.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was why he was committing a illogical act of taking a break even when facing a dragon.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I showed a weakness by being drunk on power. I guess it was unavoidable even for me.’ (TLN: he gave the dragon time to heal. he wasn’t thinking straight.)</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell corrected his complacency, and he refocused his mind. He didn’t have enough information about the current world. While he was ignorant, he could easily lose his life if he was careless.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Koo-goo-goo-goo-goo-goo……. (TLN: sfx of dragon moving through the ground)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Earth Dragon was moving at high speeds beneath the earth, and the after effect caused the ground to vibrate.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell estimated the location of the Earth Dragon. While Azell had his feet on the ground, the Earth Dragon knew his exact location like the back of its hand.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Azell also knew the Earth Dragon’s location. Now that his power had been recovered by grasping the Dragon Maken, his senses could detect what his eyes couldn’t see.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Right now!’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Soon, Azell moved at lightning speed and he surrounded his body with Protection Magic.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Pa-hak! (TLN: slashing sound)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Earth Dragon leapt, and its body cut through the blue light.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘It was too shallow!’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Blood poured out from the long wound on the Earth Dragon’s body.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, it was too shallow. It had split open the thick hide, but only blood came out. It was comparable to a human getting a slight cut on the skin.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rather, Azell was the one who had suffered. He rebounded high into the air and his muscle hurt like it had been ripped.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Shit! As expected, in my current condition, I can’t just use brute strength.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Spirit Order allows one to use strength beyond human limits, but in the end, the power is used by a human body. The magical energy is used to painstakingly reinforce the body, and the stronger the body is, the more reinforcement could be used.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Azell’s current body was pathetic. After being awaken, he had regained his human-like looks, but that was it. He didn’t have a good enough foundation to correctly use the power he had received from the Dragon maken.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Cheap tricks won’t work.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>He was able to achieve tactical victories over all the enemies up until now, but he had to adapt now. He usually secured an advantageous position by deceiving the senses. He used misdirection to catch people off guard.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The problem was these methods wouldn’t work against a dragon.</span></p>
  <p><span style>One couldn’t mislead a dragon’s senses.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was impossible to artificially distort a dragon’s mind or senses using the Spirit Order’s mind techniques or magic. This limited most of the tactics Azell could use.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kyah-ah-ah-ah-ah! (TLN: another dragon sfx)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Earth Dragon, who was swimming beneath the ground, jumped out. It started to roar and the ground shook. The strong vibrations made it nearly impossible for one to stand upright. Moreover, the already messily upturned ground of the forest to move like a wave.</span></p>
  <p><span style>For a human to display one’s strength, it was imperative for the human to have stable footing. If he was a magician then he would have flown through the air like a bird. However he used martial arts and he couldn’t use his strength properly when the surface was unstable. This was why it was important to train the lower body, and strengthen one’s balance. If it was the old days, Azell would have been able to stand on top of a sword swung by his enemy since he had trained his balance to the extreme.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, even that degree of balance would be useless in this situation.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The ground continued to crumble, and it was like a antlion’s pit.(TLN: you’ll have to google it) What else could he do when the ground eroded and shook?</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘It is smarter than I thought.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell regretted the fact that he gave the Earth Dragon a chance to utilize its strength, and he tried to come up with a countermeasure.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He couldn’t fall down. Spirit Order didn’t have any flight techniques. There existed techniques which allowed one to change direction in mid-air or jump again.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Unfortunately, there weren’t any stable surfaces he could step on so he couldn’t properly use the Instantaneous Movement method. First, he got on a tree, which was some distance from the ground. This afforded him some freedom of movement.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, the Earth Dragon would not sit idly by, while Azell escaped.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The ground moved in a wave, and it gathered in one place. The earth started to form the shape of a large hand. Several earth hands formed and flew towards him. It had targeted Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘It’s a construct!’</span></p>
  <p><span style>The dragon used the power of the element it had dominion over. It was able to make multiple entities, which it could control freely. This was called the Dragon’s Construct.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Oooooooooooh! (TLN: sfx construct makes)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Dragon’s Constructs moved toward him, while emitting a strange sound.</span></p>
  <p><span style>3</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was able to move by stepping on empty air, but there was a limit to it. The moment his mobility decreased, the Dragon’s Constructs swept towards Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hmmm!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The blue sword light danced wildly. Every time he swung his sword a sharp flash of light followed in its trajectory. The Constructs that were struck were cut very easily.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He was able to cut the Dragon’s Construct, but he couldn’t hold them back. Would an existence formed from earth receive damage from being cut?</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Azell’s sword energy was like a storm.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Every time the sword was swung the atmosphere shook. Moreover, everything within its reach of influence were broken into pieces and dispersed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Hooooooooooong! (TLN: sfx of tail moving through air)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Earth Dragon’s tail, which was thicker than a whole tree, flew in like a whip. Azell was defending against the rocks, so he was caught off-guard. It was timed in a way where he didn’t have a chance to avoid it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell yelled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Shit! Let’s do this!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>GGwaaaaaaaaang! (TLN: boom!)</span></p>
  <p><span style>Explosive sound rang out.</span></p>
  <p><span style>A crater formed from the impact, and it shook the earth. In the middle, Azell and the Earth Dragon were flung apart in opposite direction. Azell turned several cycle in the air before he landed on the ground and he slid back an extra several dozen meters.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ooh-ook. I almost died.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>He had offset some of the damage by jumping over the terrain. Azell’s hand reached toward his nose. There was blood flowing out of his nose. Then the hand gripping the Dragon Maken burst open.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, it was a low cost for going head-to-head with an attack that could destroy an entire castle. Also, his opponent didn’t escape unscathed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Koo-roo-roo-roo-roo….. (TLN: another dragon sfx)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Earth Dragon let out a painful sound. Surprisingly, the Earth Dragon also rolled a couple times on the ground after being thrown from the collision with Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Moreover, the tail that had hit against the Dragon Maken was in a sorry state. The bone had been cut. The tail was hanging on by a thread, and great amount of blood fountained forth.</span></p>
  <p><span style>While in this state, the Earth Dragon’s eyes met Azell’s, and it was spooked. It roared, while it was gripped with fear.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kaaaaaaaaaaah! (TLN: dragon sfx)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Dragon’s Roar exploded forth and the earth flipped over.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“So you still want to continue with the trial of strength?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was still reeling from the impact. It was too late to dodge with the Instantaneous Movement method.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Then….. This is my chance!’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell held up his Dragon Maken with determination. Magical energy circulated in high speed between his body and his blade. Then light emanated forth.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Haaaaaaaaaaaah!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The ground he was on exploded, but Azell kept his position without moving. The light that was surrounding his body blocked the vibration and the exploding earth out. However, numerous scratches started to form on his body.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell focused enough that he forgot about all of his pain. At this moment, he would die if the flow of his power was disturbed even by a small amount!</span></p>
  <p><span style>His Ring of Life vibrated vigorously, and it seemed like it was about to break. The magical energy accelerated inside his energy pulse as if it was about to burn. This brought back the memories from the Dragon Demon War. The moment he faced a strong enemy with his life on the line, he recalled the ultimate skill he used through his sword!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Here it comes!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After the shout, his bloody body started to move.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Ggwaroo-rong! Ggwa-roong! (TLN: Thunder sfx)</span></p>
  <p><span style>Beneath the blue sky, thunder rained down and the thunderclap rang out.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Blue thunderbolts appeared around the Dragon Maken at its center. It flared up while it cut through the tidal wave of earth. From inside, Azell’s blue eyes lit up.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Thunder Dragon’s Horn!’</span></p>
  <p><span style>The body, which had survived the vibrations of the earth being flipped over, accelerated and broke the speed of sound. This was the secret technique he had used in the Dragon Demon War, which allowed him to cut down a Dragon Demon protected by powerful magic in a single strike!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Ggwa-gwa-gwa-gwa-gwang! (TLN: explosion sfx)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The sound of the explosion rang out after the blue streak of lightning had parted the Earth Dragon. (TLN: he broke the sound barrier, so sound was delayed)</span></p>
  <p><span style>It rang out a second late. Similarly, the wave of earth was also parted by Azell, and there was a vacuum between Azell and the dragon.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Koo-rook, ggooo-goo-gook….! (TLN: more dragon sfx )</span></p>
  <p><span style>A big groan came out from the Earth Dragon’s mouth, and the impact caused a large cloud of dust to rise up. Inside the cloud of dust, the Earth Dragon’s body was cut diagonally, and it sank while red blood fountained forth.</span></p>
  <p><span style>From beyond the dust, Azell was able to clearly see the shadow of the Earth Dragon fall.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kooooooong…..! (TLN: sfx of body hitting ground, boom….!)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The large body of the dragon fell, and the sound of the crash reverberated.</span></p>
  <p><span style>4</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was long after the ground stopped lurching. Azell, who had dirt all over his body, started walking shakily.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Cole-rok, Cole-rok.(TLN: sound of a wet cough) This is driving me nuts.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>He had defeated the Earth dragon with comparative ease, but Azell wasn’t in a good condition. The blood loss from his superficial wound made him dizzy, and he also had a lot of internal damage.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Moreover……</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Ah Ah.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>The power that had charged his entire body was slowly leaking out.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The power he had received from the Dragon Maken was temporary.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Dragon Maken used his soul as an ingredient, and it was refined using magical energy and the dragon’s power. It was a one-of-a-kind ultimate weapon that exists solely for him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>For it to exist, Azell had to be there. It had to resonate with Azell’s soul, swallow his thoughts, and be injected with magical energy for it to maintain its existence.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This meant that during Azell’s long sleep, the Dragon Maken was destined to slowly lose its sense of self, and it would cease to exist. Carlos deserved to be called an Arch Mage just from the fact that he was able to preserve the Dragon Maken for 220 years. Even though it had jumped through time to return to Azell’s hands, it wasn’t able recharge itself from Azell. Instead, it was about to fall apart after giving him the power that formed it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m sorry.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell apologized to the Dragon Maken.</span></p>
  <p><span style>In Azell’s way of thinking, weapons were mere tools and he didn’t confer any more meaning to it. He had no reasons to cling to it. However, the Dragon Maken was made from his soul and it was made to be his other self. It couldn’t talk, but it had a will of its own. There was an internal sympathetic link between Azell and the sword.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was why Azell apologized to the Dragon Maken as if it was alive.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Ssssssssssss……</span></p>
  <p><span style>After losing its sense of self, the Dragon Maken disintegrated like dust. Azell looked at the dissipating blue foam, and he made a promise to the Dragon Maken.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Sooner or later… We’ll meet again.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>He’ll revive the Dragon Maken the day he recovers his former strength.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Once the Dragon Maken disappeared, Azell staggered toward the Earth Dragon’s corpse.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Dragon Slayer’s Ritual had ended. As the victor, it was time for him to claim his prize.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell’s strike had blown half of its body away. Its heart was half gone, but it was still palpitating while blood spurted out.</span></p>
  <p><span style>As the victor of the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual, he had to drink the dragon’s blood to obtain part of its strength.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, he didn’t have to drink the enormous quantity of the dragon’s blood. The drinking of blood was a symbolic gesture, which completed the ritual.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell cupped his hand near the torn heart, and he collected the falling blood. Then he slowly raised it up to his mouth and drank it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Doo-goon! (TLN: ba-dump)</span></p>
  <p><span style>His heart pulsed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The life force within his injured body circulated and his wound started to heal quickly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Doo-goon! Doo-goon! Doo-goon! (TLN: heart beating sfx)</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell’s hearted started beating out of control, and this caused him to sit down.</span></p>
  <p><span style>In front of him, the corpse of the Earth Dragon, even all of the blown away parts, started to emit a light.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The lights floated into the air and it gathered towards Azell. The ritual had been passed down since the ancient times, and the loser had to donate everything to the victor.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Oooooooooooh! (TLN: energy sfx)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The whirlwind of light wrapped around Azell’s figure and amidst these light Azell’s consciousness turned white.</span></p>

 <p><span style>Episode 22 - Dragon Maken (1)</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, every existence in the continent with the presence of dragon blood shuddered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A new Dragon Demon Qi is born…..?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was mumbled by a woman lost in mediation inside the darkness. She had strong magical energy wrapped around her body, and she could dimly sense the event happening in a far away place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dragon Demon Qi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a refined form of a dragon’s power, and it was created using a soul as an ingredient. It was the very definition of a true magical weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another voice was heard from the darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you say Dragon Demon Qi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can that be?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is no way the Dragon Demon Qi was born in this era.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This era has even forgotten about the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that as a start, many voices started flying around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This sensation…. I’m sure of it. A new Dragon Demon Qi was born outside of our territory.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll agree it feels the same. This sensation… I could never forget it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, there is no way a new Dragon Demon Qi would be born.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is no coincidence in the birth of the Dragon Demon Qi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone should end the transmission, and let us aid in damaging the Spirit Order’s vision.” (TLN: I’m guessing they can interfere from long distance)</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were talking about doing something horrible. One couldn’t tell what they were talking about, but by observing their nuanced talk, it was revealed that they were in the process of performing an act of historic proportions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, the latter explanation is possible. There might be an owner of Dragon Demon Qi we failed to kill. Someone might have woken up from sleep and there is a possibility that he recovered his Dragon Demon Qi…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“According to our records, the last owner of the Dragon Demon Qi, who didn’t belong to us, died 60 years ago. There is no way one could sleep that long.” (TLN: I’m guessing Carlos)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It might be a real possibility that a new Dragon Demon Qi was born. Could we guarantee that the work we have carried out was perfect? This world is large and isn’t there a lot of humans?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm….!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A brief silence ensued inside the darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, the woman spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Currently, I guess he have no choice but to observe. Let us wait until the new master of Dragon Demon Qi reveals himself to the world….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>2</span></p>
 <p><span style>In between the dispersing light fragments, his red hair was fluttering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once he grasped the Dragon Maken, which was flowing with blue light, Azell felt power surge into his entire body. The feeling of helplessness, which had weighed him down since his awakening, disappeared. His old self, who had swept through the battle fields like a storm in the Dragon Demon war, was revived. The energy was making him excited and Azell tried hard to coldly assess the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Its condition is better than the time I woke up.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Maken wasn’t in a good condition even if it was emitting a strong power. It was analogous to a person having a hard time getting up when one is sick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was inevitable. While the Dragon Maken was hibernating through the winters, it was basically like a wild animal losing all its accumulated energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had even forgotten the name it was given the moment it was born. Azell couldn’t pull out its true ability which he had honed with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had reunited with Azell after jumping over a long period of time, and the only thing it could do was burn its existence. (TLN: basically cannibalize its own energy)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-roo-roo-rooo…. (TLN: growling sfx)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Earth Dragon shuddered. The quality of power coming from the human, who had challenged it, was very different from before. He was emitting enough pressure for even a dragon to be afraid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koong! (TLN: boom!)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The small human took one step and the earth shook.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koong! (TLN: boom!)</span></p>
 <p><span style>After another step, the atmosphere vibrated and a gust of wind raged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now. Come at me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell baited the dragon, while smiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The human had a presence that was on equal footing with a dragon. Even though the Earth Dragon ran across a situation it didn’t understand, it continued to move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Slayer’s Ritual had already started. The ritual doesn’t end until one side is dead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-roo-roo-roo…… (TLN: growl)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Earth Dragon emitted a mighty magical wave. Soon, the Earth Dragon looked to the sky and roared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-ah-a-ah-ah-ah! (TLN: rawr)</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the ultimate destructive method emitted by a dragon, Dragon’s Roar!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The attack that had turned over the earth for a radius of several hundred meter was initiated. The forest that had been ruined was about to go through another catastrophe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Azell’s figure disappeared the moment the roar rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwa-haha-hat! (TLN: sfx of sword slicing)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Earth Dragon, who was about to roar, swallowed its breath and it stumbled. A long wound appeared on its neck before the Dragon’s Roar could be used, and its red blood splattered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-uh-uh-ung! (TLN: dragon in pain sfx)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Earth Dragon screamed in pain. It was the first time in its life it had experienced pain. After hatching from its egg about hundred and couple score years ago, it had gained independence from its parents. After it had settled down in the corner of the Balan Forest, there had been no existence that was able to wound it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Earth Dragon heard Azell’s voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It turns out it is a young dragon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was observing the Earth Dragon from atop a half broken tree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Earth Dragon had a body larger than a house, so it was strange to hear the expression of it being ‘young’. Dragons had a lifespan of several thousand years, but it matured for 30 years.(TLN: main growth happens in the first 30 years of its life) Afterwards, it becomes the ultimate tyrant with no natural enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Earth Dragon in front of him had finished its growth and it had an adult body. After its growth period ends, it continues to grow minutely, but it was hard to see the change even if couple hundred years had passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, Azell decided the Earth Dragon was young. He could tell after one battle that it didn’t have much experience and it was immature.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Humans have forgotten the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual, but the Dragons haven’t forgotten it. While it knows about the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual, I guess it doesn’t know anything about fighting a life-and-death battle?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Slayer’s Ritual was a immemorial tradition. It was a pact made between an unknown strong magician and the dragons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dragons may be dumb, but the knowledge of the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual was etched into their blood and passed on. Similar to every being able breathe without knowing how to breathe, every dragon knew what the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, even if they knew about it, it doesn’t mean they had carried it out before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Basically, the dragons do not know how to fight very well. The weapons they were born with were too strong and it let them easily achieve victory just by swinging their weapons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, there was a big difference between a dragon who is experienced in fighting, and an inexperienced dragon. Moreover, a dragon, who had experienced the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual before, is much more dangerous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This Earth Dragon fell into neither of those options. This is its first time going through the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual and it had never fought against another dragon. Azell was sure of this fact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If it was experienced then it wouldn’t have used the Dragon’s Roar in that fashion.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Using the Dragon’s Roar was an overkill when trying to kill one mere human. It was analogous to using a siege weapon to kill a single ant. While it allows one to pour out its maximum power at once, its defense becomes vulnerable. The power protecting its body becomes weak, and an attack that wouldn’t usually scratch it could wound the dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Previously, Azell’s strike was able to leave a deep wound because of this logic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-roo-roong! Ka-roong! (TLN: more dragon noises)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Earth Dragon let out a intimidating howl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was the first strong opponent the dragon has faced. Until now, it had easily killed all of its preys. His threat level was similar to its own race!</span></p>
 <p><span style>During this time, the wound on its neck was rapidly healing. If a human had the same wound then the person would be half dead. However, it had healed as if it was never there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had a phenomenal regenerative ability.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s probably going to get real now?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as Azell predicted. The earth beneath his feet exploded, and stones shot toward him like arrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Puh-puh-puh-puh-pung! (TLN: sound of stone hitting trees)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The force of the stone being shot was so strong that it made holes in the beautiful trees.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Azell was already gone from that spot. In a flash, he used the Instantaneous Movement method to change location, and he ran towards the Earth Dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the Earth Dragon didn’t stay in the same place. It hid itself by burrowing into the earth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Alright! That’s more like it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell realized he was getting excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If one thought about it, it was very unlike Azell to wait for the Earth Dragon to heal after the initial attack. Moreover, he should have taken advantage of the Earth Dragon being flustered. He should have settled it in a single bout. If he had done that, then he would have easily succeeded in killing the dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, during the couple days he had been awake, he had received a lot of stress from his own powerlessness. Now that he had the Dragon Maken in his hand, the desire to experience its power was amplified.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why he was committing a illogical act of taking a break even when facing a dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I showed a weakness by being drunk on power. I guess it was unavoidable even for me.’ (TLN: he gave the dragon time to heal. he wasn’t thinking straight.)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell corrected his complacency, and he refocused his mind. He didn’t have enough information about the current world. While he was ignorant, he could easily lose his life if he was careless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-goo-goo-goo-goo-goo……. (TLN: sfx of dragon moving through the ground)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Earth Dragon was moving at high speeds beneath the earth, and the after effect caused the ground to vibrate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell estimated the location of the Earth Dragon. While Azell had his feet on the ground, the Earth Dragon knew his exact location like the back of its hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Azell also knew the Earth Dragon’s location. Now that his power had been recovered by grasping the Dragon Maken, his senses could detect what his eyes couldn’t see.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Right now!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, Azell moved at lightning speed and he surrounded his body with Protection Magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pa-hak! (TLN: slashing sound)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Earth Dragon leapt, and its body cut through the blue light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It was too shallow!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood poured out from the long wound on the Earth Dragon’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was too shallow. It had split open the thick hide, but only blood came out. It was comparable to a human getting a slight cut on the skin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rather, Azell was the one who had suffered. He rebounded high into the air and his muscle hurt like it had been ripped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Shit! As expected, in my current condition, I can’t just use brute strength.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Spirit Order allows one to use strength beyond human limits, but in the end, the power is used by a human body. The magical energy is used to painstakingly reinforce the body, and the stronger the body is, the more reinforcement could be used.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Azell’s current body was pathetic. After being awaken, he had regained his human-like looks, but that was it. He didn’t have a good enough foundation to correctly use the power he had received from the Dragon maken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Cheap tricks won’t work.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was able to achieve tactical victories over all the enemies up until now, but he had to adapt now. He usually secured an advantageous position by deceiving the senses. He used misdirection to catch people off guard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The problem was these methods wouldn’t work against a dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One couldn’t mislead a dragon’s senses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was impossible to artificially distort a dragon’s mind or senses using the Spirit Order’s mind techniques or magic. This limited most of the tactics Azell could use.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kyah-ah-ah-ah-ah! (TLN: another dragon sfx)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Earth Dragon, who was swimming beneath the ground, jumped out. It started to roar and the ground shook. The strong vibrations made it nearly impossible for one to stand upright. Moreover, the already messily upturned ground of the forest to move like a wave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a human to display one’s strength, it was imperative for the human to have stable footing. If he was a magician then he would have flown through the air like a bird. However he used martial arts and he couldn’t use his strength properly when the surface was unstable. This was why it was important to train the lower body, and strengthen one’s balance. If it was the old days, Azell would have been able to stand on top of a sword swung by his enemy since he had trained his balance to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, even that degree of balance would be useless in this situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ground continued to crumble, and it was like a antlion’s pit.(TLN: you’ll have to google it) What else could he do when the ground eroded and shook?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is smarter than I thought.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell regretted the fact that he gave the Earth Dragon a chance to utilize its strength, and he tried to come up with a countermeasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t fall down. Spirit Order didn’t have any flight techniques. There existed techniques which allowed one to change direction in mid-air or jump again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, there weren’t any stable surfaces he could step on so he couldn’t properly use the Instantaneous Movement method. First, he got on a tree, which was some distance from the ground. This afforded him some freedom of movement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the Earth Dragon would not sit idly by, while Azell escaped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ground moved in a wave, and it gathered in one place. The earth started to form the shape of a large hand. Several earth hands formed and flew towards him. It had targeted Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s a construct!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dragon used the power of the element it had dominion over. It was able to make multiple entities, which it could control freely. This was called the Dragon’s Construct.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oooooooooooh! (TLN: sfx construct makes)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon’s Constructs moved toward him, while emitting a strange sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>3</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was able to move by stepping on empty air, but there was a limit to it. The moment his mobility decreased, the Dragon’s Constructs swept towards Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blue sword light danced wildly. Every time he swung his sword a sharp flash of light followed in its trajectory. The Constructs that were struck were cut very easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was able to cut the Dragon’s Construct, but he couldn’t hold them back. Would an existence formed from earth receive damage from being cut?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Azell’s sword energy was like a storm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every time the sword was swung the atmosphere shook. Moreover, everything within its reach of influence were broken into pieces and dispersed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hooooooooooong! (TLN: sfx of tail moving through air)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Earth Dragon’s tail, which was thicker than a whole tree, flew in like a whip. Azell was defending against the rocks, so he was caught off-guard. It was timed in a way where he didn’t have a chance to avoid it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell yelled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit! Let’s do this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>GGwaaaaaaaaang! (TLN: boom!)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Explosive sound rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A crater formed from the impact, and it shook the earth. In the middle, Azell and the Earth Dragon were flung apart in opposite direction. Azell turned several cycle in the air before he landed on the ground and he slid back an extra several dozen meters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-ook. I almost died.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had offset some of the damage by jumping over the terrain. Azell’s hand reached toward his nose. There was blood flowing out of his nose. Then the hand gripping the Dragon Maken burst open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was a low cost for going head-to-head with an attack that could destroy an entire castle. Also, his opponent didn’t escape unscathed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-roo-roo-roo-roo….. (TLN: another dragon sfx)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Earth Dragon let out a painful sound. Surprisingly, the Earth Dragon also rolled a couple times on the ground after being thrown from the collision with Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, the tail that had hit against the Dragon Maken was in a sorry state. The bone had been cut. The tail was hanging on by a thread, and great amount of blood fountained forth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While in this state, the Earth Dragon’s eyes met Azell’s, and it was spooked. It roared, while it was gripped with fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kaaaaaaaaaaah! (TLN: dragon sfx)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon’s Roar exploded forth and the earth flipped over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you still want to continue with the trial of strength?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was still reeling from the impact. It was too late to dodge with the Instantaneous Movement method.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Then….. This is my chance!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell held up his Dragon Maken with determination. Magical energy circulated in high speed between his body and his blade. Then light emanated forth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haaaaaaaaaaaah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ground he was on exploded, but Azell kept his position without moving. The light that was surrounding his body blocked the vibration and the exploding earth out. However, numerous scratches started to form on his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell focused enough that he forgot about all of his pain. At this moment, he would die if the flow of his power was disturbed even by a small amount!</span></p>
 <p><span style>His Ring of Life vibrated vigorously, and it seemed like it was about to break. The magical energy accelerated inside his energy pulse as if it was about to burn. This brought back the memories from the Dragon Demon War. The moment he faced a strong enemy with his life on the line, he recalled the ultimate skill he used through his sword!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here it comes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the shout, his bloody body started to move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ggwaroo-rong! Ggwa-roong! (TLN: Thunder sfx)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beneath the blue sky, thunder rained down and the thunderclap rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blue thunderbolts appeared around the Dragon Maken at its center. It flared up while it cut through the tidal wave of earth. From inside, Azell’s blue eyes lit up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Thunder Dragon’s Horn!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The body, which had survived the vibrations of the earth being flipped over, accelerated and broke the speed of sound. This was the secret technique he had used in the Dragon Demon War, which allowed him to cut down a Dragon Demon protected by powerful magic in a single strike!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ggwa-gwa-gwa-gwa-gwang! (TLN: explosion sfx)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of the explosion rang out after the blue streak of lightning had parted the Earth Dragon. (TLN: he broke the sound barrier, so sound was delayed)</span></p>
 <p><span style>It rang out a second late. Similarly, the wave of earth was also parted by Azell, and there was a vacuum between Azell and the dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-rook, ggooo-goo-gook….! (TLN: more dragon sfx )</span></p>
 <p><span style>A big groan came out from the Earth Dragon’s mouth, and the impact caused a large cloud of dust to rise up. Inside the cloud of dust, the Earth Dragon’s body was cut diagonally, and it sank while red blood fountained forth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From beyond the dust, Azell was able to clearly see the shadow of the Earth Dragon fall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kooooooong…..! (TLN: sfx of body hitting ground, boom….!)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The large body of the dragon fell, and the sound of the crash reverberated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>4</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was long after the ground stopped lurching. Azell, who had dirt all over his body, started walking shakily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cole-rok, Cole-rok.(TLN: sound of a wet cough) This is driving me nuts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had defeated the Earth dragon with comparative ease, but Azell wasn’t in a good condition. The blood loss from his superficial wound made him dizzy, and he also had a lot of internal damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover……</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Ah Ah.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The power that had charged his entire body was slowly leaking out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The power he had received from the Dragon Maken was temporary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Maken used his soul as an ingredient, and it was refined using magical energy and the dragon’s power. It was a one-of-a-kind ultimate weapon that exists solely for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For it to exist, Azell had to be there. It had to resonate with Azell’s soul, swallow his thoughts, and be injected with magical energy for it to maintain its existence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This meant that during Azell’s long sleep, the Dragon Maken was destined to slowly lose its sense of self, and it would cease to exist. Carlos deserved to be called an Arch Mage just from the fact that he was able to preserve the Dragon Maken for 220 years. Even though it had jumped through time to return to Azell’s hands, it wasn’t able recharge itself from Azell. Instead, it was about to fall apart after giving him the power that formed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell apologized to the Dragon Maken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Azell’s way of thinking, weapons were mere tools and he didn’t confer any more meaning to it. He had no reasons to cling to it. However, the Dragon Maken was made from his soul and it was made to be his other self. It couldn’t talk, but it had a will of its own. There was an internal sympathetic link between Azell and the sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why Azell apologized to the Dragon Maken as if it was alive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ssssssssssss……</span></p>
 <p><span style>After losing its sense of self, the Dragon Maken disintegrated like dust. Azell looked at the dissipating blue foam, and he made a promise to the Dragon Maken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sooner or later… We’ll meet again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’ll revive the Dragon Maken the day he recovers his former strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once the Dragon Maken disappeared, Azell staggered toward the Earth Dragon’s corpse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Slayer’s Ritual had ended. As the victor, it was time for him to claim his prize.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s strike had blown half of its body away. Its heart was half gone, but it was still palpitating while blood spurted out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the victor of the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual, he had to drink the dragon’s blood to obtain part of its strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he didn’t have to drink the enormous quantity of the dragon’s blood. The drinking of blood was a symbolic gesture, which completed the ritual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell cupped his hand near the torn heart, and he collected the falling blood. Then he slowly raised it up to his mouth and drank it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Doo-goon! (TLN: ba-dump)</span></p>
 <p><span style>His heart pulsed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The life force within his injured body circulated and his wound started to heal quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Doo-goon! Doo-goon! Doo-goon! (TLN: heart beating sfx)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s hearted started beating out of control, and this caused him to sit down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front of him, the corpse of the Earth Dragon, even all of the blown away parts, started to emit a light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lights floated into the air and it gathered towards Azell. The ritual had been passed down since the ancient times, and the loser had to donate everything to the victor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oooooooooooh! (TLN: energy sfx)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The whirlwind of light wrapped around Azell’s figure and amidst these light Azell’s consciousness turned white.</span></p>
