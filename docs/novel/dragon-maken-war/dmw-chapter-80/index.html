 <p><span style>9</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this the trace left behind by the Tear?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke as he looked at the location pointed out by Azell. It was located in mid-air. &nbsp;It looked as if a small shimmer had appeared. One could see a distorted space beyond the shimmer. It was as if water droplets was slowly descending a wall before it disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are correct.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm. It seems I wouldn’t have noticed it unless I had my eyes fixed on it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a trace that was merely as big as a finger length. These traces were spaced apart at a distance of several dozen meters, and it was located in random locations. &nbsp;If one had no idea what to look for beforehand, it would be almost impossible to find it. &nbsp;This was more true since it was night, and they were in a mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems the User is very inexperienced.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why do you say that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She left behind a trace that can be detected by the eyes. &nbsp;Originally, it is suppose to leave behind a much smaller trace. &nbsp;It should be the size of a rain drop... &nbsp;Also, it’s supposed to disappear after a short amount of time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You speak as if you have seen this before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I've seen it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell put on a mysterious smile, then he looked at the Guardian Shadow. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It happened at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You aren't suppose to go that way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A teen with light red hair appeared between two Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;He had on a haughty expression that made him look like he was from the nobility. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don't know who you are, but by how protective you are of yourself, it seems you did something that deserves a beating from me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have no idea what you are talking about.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don't try to trick me with such a shoddy illusion, idiot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell's 'Eyes of Truth' could see through all illusions. The teen had put an illusion over one the Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;It looked like the real thing, but Azell immediately saw through it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The teen let out a whistle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow. That's impressive. Well, it did transform in front of you, so...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don't have time to listen to you rattle on. &nbsp;If you have business with me, speak quickly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm. &nbsp;You have a very high-handed personality. &nbsp;My name is Jares. &nbsp;Or you can call me Omicron. &nbsp;I don't really care. &nbsp;I am one of the Keepers of the Prophecy that is testing you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A test. &nbsp;Does this mean you are in league with Leone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unlike me, Leone has a different opinion about you. &nbsp;Anyways, we are in the process of testing you. Shouldn't you be working hard to impress us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don't give a damn about your test. I know where you are right now. &nbsp;If you waste any more of my time, I'll track you down, and I'll beat you up. &nbsp;You must think the Concealment skill of the Guardian Shadows use is infallible, but I'll give you a chance to test it out. &nbsp;Let us see if you can run away from me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha ha. Your bluff is outrageo....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You moved two steps to the side. &nbsp;From your perspective, you moved to the left.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jares' expression hardened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you now believe that my words aren't a bluff? &nbsp;Don't ask me how I did it. &nbsp;This will be your last warning. &nbsp;Erase everything frivolous you wanted to say to me from your head. &nbsp;If you don't, I won't care what your organization want or intends to do.... &nbsp;You'll be the first one I will chase down and kill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see you are gathering the Guardian Shadows to your side. &nbsp;Are you sure they'll be able to save you if you gather enough of them? &nbsp;They might be able to. &nbsp;If you want to face hostility from me, you should continue to waste my time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell cold expression was like a sheet of ice. &nbsp;He glared at the illusion created by the teen as he spoke. &nbsp;There was no emotion reflected in his voice, and this made it that much more terrifying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Azell was using a mystic technique of the Spirit Order. &nbsp;He was using the 'Eyes of Truth' to see through the illusion, and he was looking at the real body that was projecting the illusion. Then he subtly put magical energy into his voice to upset the other's mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jares raised both his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. All right. &nbsp;I'll do as you ask. &nbsp;I need you to do the Dragon Slayer's Ritual.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;Amongst the two fighting Dragons, the Thunder Dragon was called here by the Dragon Demon King worshippers. &nbsp;The Frost Dragon was called in by us. &nbsp;Originally, it was a Dragon prepared for you, but there was a hitch in the plan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You wanted it to fight me? &nbsp;You were going to use the Dragon Slayer's Ritual as a test?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You almost guessed it correctly. &nbsp;It is slightly different from that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jares made an invidious remark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell furrowed his eyebrows as he asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did you get the Dragon to move?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Dragon Slayer's Ritual was used as bait.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jares was puzzled by Azell's knowing attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you suspect it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is no other way to do it. &nbsp;In truth, it is a deal without much benefit, yet there are those who try to use that method.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This tactic was also used in the Dragon Demon war. &nbsp;It wasn't just used by the the Dragon Demon King's army. &nbsp;It had also been used by Azell's allies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it wasn't a smart solution, so it had rarely been used in real life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two problems arose from using this method.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First, one must deal with the Dragon Slayer's Ritual afterwards. &nbsp;A one on one fight with a Dragon wasn't recommended. &nbsp;In the midst of a war, it was very important to have strong personnel at one’s disposal. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Secondly, one could block the Dragon Slayer's Ritual even if a Dragon was mobilized. &nbsp;If a qualified individual asks for the Dragon Slayer's Ritual, the Dragon always agreed to it. &nbsp;If this other being was able to defeat the Dragon, it would just benefit the enemy in the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, all right. &nbsp;I don't care about a trash test that was planned by an idiot like you. &nbsp;So the essential point is you want me to use the Dragon Slayer's Ritual to kill the Thunder Dragon, and you will change the target of the Frost Dragon to the Aunsarus' heir?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. I like the simplicity of the plan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying this, Azell lifted his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I refuse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is no reason why I should follow your instructions. &nbsp;If you plan on doing this next time, at the very least, you’ll have to catch a hostage to coerce me. &nbsp;Of course, the vengeance I’ll unleash on you guys will be that much more painful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm. &nbsp;If you continue to act this way, do you realize you might turn the Keepers of the Prophecy and the Guardian Shadows into enemies?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you really think that is an effective threat against me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell let out a snort. Then he glared at Jares with contempt in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll give you a warning, idiot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Jares' expression crumpled from pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koohk. &nbsp;This is…. &nbsp;What the hell…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Any method that allows you to ‘converse’ with others is never truly a one way street.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the mystic techniques of Spirit Order used the senses of humans as a medium. &nbsp;Whether it was magic sense, sight, hearing, smell and taste, it &nbsp;was all subject to attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell saw through the illusion from the beginning. &nbsp;As he kept up the conversation, he found where the magic was being emitted. &nbsp;Then he put magical energy in his gaze and voice to cause Jares pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It felt as if his heart was being ripped out, so Jares fell over without even being able to scream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell turned around as he spoke to Kairen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let's go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm. I really like you. &nbsp;As expected of someone I acknowledge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As I see more of the Guardian Shadows, I’m of the opinion that it is a broken organization.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I agree.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell and Kairen ignored Jares’ illusion, which was doubled over in pain, and they started walking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It happened at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… You resemble him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A young woman's voice was heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, a girl that was so out of place in this rough mountain appeared by herself. &nbsp;She appeared above the Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;It was the Aunsaurus' heir, who had suppressed Seigar. &nbsp;It was Laura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>10</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura had just exited the Vitan’s Maze, and she wasn’t holding the Vitan’s Chalice that generated the Dragon Demon Qi. &nbsp;However, Azell spoke as soon as he saw her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It's another woman from the Dragon Demon race. &nbsp;Are you Aunsaurus' heir?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do I look a Dragon Demon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura had an expressionless face as she tilted her head in confusion. &nbsp;Her outer appearance was that of a human. It was perfect. &nbsp;In fact, the resonance she emitted was of magic instead of Dragon Demon magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No matter how I look at her, she looks like a human.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She isn't.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if we put aside her appearance, I don't feel any Dragon Demon magic coming from her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the statement, Azell spoke as he looked at Laura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Her horns, Dragon Demon Stone and pupil are of the same color. &nbsp;Since you might assume I guessed based on your eye color, I’ll give you a more detailed description. &nbsp;Your horns look like feathers. &nbsp;The horns are curved upwards.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…how did you recognize me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura was fascinated. However, there was no change in her expression. One couldn't feel any humanity from her. &nbsp;Her countenance was that of a beautiful doll.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She let go of her disguise. &nbsp;The intricate illusion disappeared, and a Dragon Demon appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as Azell had said. &nbsp;She had blonde hair, eyes like amethysts, porcelain-like skin, and horns that flared upwards as it looked to be a crafted item made out of amethysts. &nbsp;A &nbsp;Dragon Demon Stone was embedded on the back of her hand, and it was letting out a brilliant light of the same color.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, a powerful wave of Dragon Demon magic started to spread.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She was able to perfectly disguise such power perfectly as human magic?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Surprisingly, Laura’s Dragon Demon magic exceeded Kairen in terms of quantity. &nbsp;This wasn’t the first time Kairen had met a Dragon Demon that possessed a stronger Dragon Demon magic than him. &nbsp;However, he couldn’t help, but be surprised by the fact that she was able to completely disguise her power as magic. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All the Dragon Demon King worshippers are uncanny at hiting the smell of Dragon Demon magic. &nbsp;Did you guys develop some unique magic?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The members of the Dragon’s Shadow and Niberis were all the same. &nbsp;Just their ability to hide their Dragon Demon magic was really peerless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura asked him a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Azell Zestringer. &nbsp;Am I right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Correct. &nbsp;At least, you don't call me that long and annoying title.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The man with the name seeped in sin?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My blood relatives have very different view from…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not all of us call Azell the man with the name seeped in sin….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-jee-jee-jee-jeek!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A blue spark suddenly erupted in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had just tried an ambush attack. &nbsp;She had been sure Azell was in front of her yet another Azell had appeared to attack her. &nbsp;Laura was surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? A clone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had been facing him, yet he had switched places with his clone. &nbsp;How did she miss it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>While she was &nbsp;wondering this point, the Azell that had attacked went missing. &nbsp;It had been a clone made using the Shadow Dance. &nbsp;At the same time, Azell used Instantaneous Movement to jump in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Thunder Dragon's Claw!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sword let out a thunder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gwah-roo-roong! Gwah-gwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A single strike was able to rip apart Laura's shield as if it was a piece of paper. The power couldn’t be compared to the one used &nbsp;in the fight against Niberis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, a white light appeared across the lightning that was burning up the space.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-ah-ah-ah-ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell quickly turned his body to evade. When he landed on the ground, Azell let out a grumble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Insulation. You are very fast.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Azell came in for an attack, her real body was moved to a location where his sword couldn’t be reached. &nbsp;Then she used the Insulation magic to drain away the lightning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if one considered a Dragon Demon to have a quick reaction time, it had been impossible for anyone in the pas to dodge this attack unless one knew it was coming. &nbsp;However, Laura had seen the flow of his magic. &nbsp;Her actions was evidence that she had read his technique’s attribute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, a light erupted in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>An oppressive resonance of Dragon Demon magic was spreading outwards. Kairen was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dragon Demon magic that exceeded most Dragon Demon erupted from the light instead of Laura. Azell narrowed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Vitan's Chalice… It really was left behind to his heir. &nbsp;I’m not sure how that’s possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aunsaurus had been one of the four Dragon Demon Generals, and Dragon Magic weapon Vitan’s Chalice was his pride. </span></p>
 <p><span style>During the Dragon Demon war, it had been one of the most powerful Dragon Magic weapon in existence even amongst the other powerful Dragon Magic weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Its appearance was as Azell had remembered, and it was grasped in Laura’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a brief moment, Laura stared at Azell before she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really do look like him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you talking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your face is really similar to him. &nbsp;It is similar to the Azell Kazark in the records.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you his descendant? I heard he didn’t have any descendants, yet humans procreate so easily… &nbsp;Or that’s what I’ve heard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maybe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell gave a flippant answer as he looked for Laura’s weak point. However, she was holding up the Vitan’s Chalice, and unlike before, he couldn’t find any hole in her defense. &nbsp;Her Dragon Demon Magic and the Dragon Demon magic of the Vitan’s Chalice resonated with each other, and an incredible pressure poured out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura briefly looked at Azell before she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t fight you right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you really think you can do as you like? &nbsp;Even if you have the Vitan’s Chalice….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell stopped speaking, and he jerked his head up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A heavy sound rang out, and the ground shook. &nbsp;A large shadow on top of the mountain opened its wings, and it rose up into the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the Thunder Dragon. &nbsp;The Thunder Dragon had been in a fierce fight with the Frost Dragon, yet it was descending towards them with thunder wrapped around it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is easy to attract a Dragon. &nbsp;It is easy if there is an opponent that is willing to fight with one’s life on the line.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it the Dragon Slayer's Ritual?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura acknowledge the point without much fuss. &nbsp;Another Dragon Demon King worshipper had initiated the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual with the Frost Dragon, and the act had freed the Thunder Dragon. &nbsp;Laura hadn’t lost her composure, since she had been waiting for this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It'll be impossible for me to face you, the Dragon Sword Duke and the Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;I'll leave that to the Dragon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koohk……!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had on an expression of dismay as Laura started distorting her surrounding space as if it was a wave. &nbsp;Laura disappeared without a trace in the midst of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, lightning erupted from the three horns of the Thunder Dragon’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gwah-roo-roo-roong! Gwah-gwah-gwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The thunder strike struck the ground as it swept over everything nearby. &nbsp;Large dust clouds rose into the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the surrounding, a cry that was like several hundred children whispering rang out. &nbsp;The Guardian Shadows let out a moan as they were swept up in the lightning attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell queried in the midst of the attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you ok, Duke?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Somewhat. &nbsp;Could you teach me that technique later? &nbsp;You are able so comfortable in defending against it that I feel spiteful towards you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen had used his defensive shield to block the Dragon’s thunder strike. &nbsp;Azell barely used any power as he allowed the Insulation magic to redirect the thunder strike. &nbsp;Azell smirked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will. &nbsp;Also, I regret to tell you this news.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is annoying, but I guess I'll have to follow that idiot's plan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Somehow, it turned out that way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll have to leave the prince's rescue to the Duke. I…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell glared at the Thunder Dragon that was descending the mountain using broad wing strokes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have to do the Dragon Slayer's Ritual.”</span></p>
