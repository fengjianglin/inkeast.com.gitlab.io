 <p>Chapter 126 - Suspicious Movements (1)</p>
 <p><span style>1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their destination, which was the Avantan forest, was a long distance off, so the party wasn’t in a hurry. &nbsp;It wasn’t a destination they could reach in a short amount of time no matter how fast they traveled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The guide accurately told us about the other locations.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“At this point int time, what seemed impossible seems possible now….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s expression indicated that he was aware that he was talking about something far-fetched. &nbsp;Yuren grinned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you talking about the possibility of the guide being Carlos?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m having the same exact thought right now. &nbsp;The Dragon Demon General Reygus presumed that Carlos is still alive. &nbsp;Maybe, Carlos tricked the world to avoid public attention. &nbsp;What if he is hiding somewhere? &nbsp;On top of that, he might be sending his will to his descendant using magic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s expression turned complicated. &nbsp;Carlos was his closest and dearest friend. &nbsp;He had prepared all kinds of contingency plans for Azell’s eventual awakening, which would have happened after well after his death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The possibility of him being alive evoked complicated thoughts in Azell’s mind. &nbsp;If he thought about it rationally, there was no way he was alive. &nbsp;However, what if he was alive?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It isn’t impossible. &nbsp;That is the scary part.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was Carlos, it might be possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a general concept, he thought about the possibility of Carlos becoming an Undead. &nbsp;He might have predicted the revival of Atein. &nbsp;He could have turned himself into an Undead to wait for Azell eventual awakening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there was another possibility that could have been pursued. &nbsp;It was something that only Azell knew about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If he went in hibernation like me…..’</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the latter stage of his life, what if Carlos put himself into a sleep induced by magic? &nbsp;What if he passed the time by imitating the slumber of a Dragon?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He already experimented the method through Azell. &nbsp;Would it really have been impossible to think that Carlos used the same procedure on himself?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He might be using Yuren to lead me to him. &nbsp;If it’s him, it is possible.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he was still alive… No, it didn’t matter what method he used. &nbsp;He could be a dead corpse living on as an Undead… &nbsp;Azell wanted to meet him at all costs. &nbsp;He had a mountainous amount of topics he wanted discuss with Carlos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he thought about this possibility, he thought about the blame he had place on Carlos in the beginning. &nbsp;Why wasn’t he awoken at an earlier date? &nbsp;Why was the County of Karzark allowed to be destroyed? &nbsp;&nbsp;He had many questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he soon erased such thoughts. &nbsp;He knew Carlos had his reasons for making those decisions. Carlos was touted as being the greatest magician in history, but in the end, he was only a man. &nbsp;Even if he hadn’t passed away, the historical events that occurred afterwards were inevitable. &nbsp;He wouldn’t have been able to stop the fall of the Nadick Empire, and he wouldn’t have been able to stop the Plain of Darkness from using the Great Darkness, which had plunged the world into despair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell knew Carlos would have have done his best. &nbsp;Azell trusted him, so there was no resentment in his heart. &nbsp;Azell just wanted to meet and converse with him again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The so called guide should just tell us all the locations at once. &nbsp;It is messing up our schedule.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are in the enviable position of receiving presents, so it is a bit unreasonable to require such…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wanna say it anyways.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After traveling for a week, they were getting close to the location described by Yuren.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The problem they were facing was the fact that this place was located at the border region of Bijes kingdom and the Iellos kingdom. &nbsp;Of course, even if the the border was tightly guarded, it would cause no trouble to Azell’s party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are they moving their troops? &nbsp;Did a war start?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The army of the Bijes kingdom was moving towards the border. &nbsp;There were a lot of soldiers gathered. &nbsp;It was as if they were about to go to war. &nbsp;There was a foreboding feeling in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The party was out of sight. &nbsp;They stood on standby as Kairen went out to scout on his own. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half the day passed, he returned to report.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First, our destination is close to the habitat of Dragons, so there won’t be too much problem in us getting there. &nbsp;The monsters might annoy us, but I don’t think we have to worry about us being confronted by the army of Bijes kingdom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is fortunate. &nbsp;However, by the look on your face, I’m guessing the situation is bad?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought this was just a political conflict between the two kingdoms, so I assumed this was a large-scale drill conducted as a show of force. &nbsp;However, from what I heard, the Iellos kingdom had already clashed with the Bijes kingdom several time. &nbsp;The situation seems to be getting worse…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you recently say that the two countries were on pretty good terms?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That was my understanding…. &nbsp;Still, this was all I could gather by piecing together the conversations between the soldiers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen displayed the irritation he was feeling. &nbsp;He had to stealthily approach soldiers, and he had to stay hidden as he gathered the information. &nbsp;Then he had to pieced together the fragmented information. &nbsp;It was a method that required a lot of patience. &nbsp;This was also why there was a limit on the amount of information that could be gathered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We made a mistake. &nbsp;We should have gathered some information as we travelled here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Normally, travelers were very sensitive to the affairs of the world. &nbsp;They were careful in vetting a region before their travels. &nbsp;In the past, Kairen had traveled around the world, and he had been very cautious in choosing his route.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the current party was moving so fast that they hadn’t paid attention to what was occuring in the world. &nbsp;Unlike normal travelers, they were travelling at a speed where they brushed past kingdoms, so they had been neglectful in finding out the lay of the land.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell furrowed his brows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm. &nbsp;Even if they are starting a war, we probably shouldn’t interfere… &nbsp;&nbsp;We have to prioritize getting to our destination first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That might be our best option.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The party decided on what they would do. &nbsp;They avoided the army of the Bijes kingdom as they headed towards their destination. &nbsp;However, an unexpected situation was waiting for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…kyahhhhk!</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had already left behind the army of the Bijes kingdom, and they were about to cross the border when they heard a woman’s scream. &nbsp;Then the scream of many people rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The members of Azell’s party looked at each other. &nbsp;Then they immediately changed direction as they sped forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>2</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortresses weren’t the only settlements placed near the border between the Iellos kingdom and the Bijes kingdom. &nbsp;There were several towns scattered along the border. &nbsp;Even if border disputes occurred along the border, people refused to give up on settling on liveable lands. &nbsp;This was why towns had formed along the border.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The town named Patel was a good distance away from the border fortress, and it was a relative new town. &nbsp;The land was near the territory of Dragons, so there was a lot of monsters nearby. &nbsp;However, it was discovered that these lands were fertile. &nbsp;This was why this town was established even as blood was shed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From time to time, they were still threatened by the monsters, so the people of the town were hardy. &nbsp;Their lord hadn’t given them much of a fighting force, but the overall quality of the men in the watch was quite good. &nbsp;This was because retired knights or soldiers took up the role of being instructors to the men of the watch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, they only thought of the monsters as their enemies. &nbsp;This was why they were unexpectedly unprepared for an attack from human-led forces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kyahhhhhhhhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A piercing scream ripped through the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was dark within the town. &nbsp;The armed figures had ambushed the town without any warning. &nbsp;They were putting out any fire they ran across.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the beginning, the enemies had conducted a quiet raid. &nbsp;The young men on guard duty had been careless. &nbsp;This didn’t mean they were shirking their duties. &nbsp;However, monsters and demonic beasts didn’t sneak up on their opponents. &nbsp;This was why they could relax a little bit on their guard duty. &nbsp;They would be able to see the threat coming from across the darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, if their enemies were humans, it was an entirely different story. &nbsp;The enemy forces hid their presence, and in a flash, they dispatched the guards. &nbsp;They opened the door to the stockade, and they shot arrows at the townspeople. &nbsp;It didn't matter, who was shot. &nbsp;They were indiscriminately shooting in all directions, and this was why there weren’t that many casualties. &nbsp;They were causing a panic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When everyone realized something was wrong, the enemies had already infiltrated into the town. &nbsp;&nbsp;The human troops were at the head, and roaring orcs followed behind them. &nbsp;They cut down all the townspeople in sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You bastards! &nbsp;&nbsp;What’s your purpose of doing this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The retired old knight named Neals was an instructor for the watch. &nbsp;He had been drinking alcohol with his friends in the pub, so he was late in coming out with his sword. &nbsp;He was retired, but he was a knight trained in the Spirit Order. &nbsp;He cut into the Orcs and the humans slaughtering the townspeople.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The enemies didn’t respond to Neals. They kept attacking within the chaos. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Neals almost lost his life twice. Even if he was trained in the Spirit Order, it was difficult to fight in this degree of darkness. &nbsp;On the other hand, his enemies were attacking Neals with pinpoint accuracy. &nbsp;They were all more skilled than Neals. &nbsp;His palms felt as if it was about to rip open when their swords clashed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This won’t……!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, a fatal opening was revealed when five of the enemies attacked him. &nbsp;Neals didn’t simply die on the spot, because his comrade came to his defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Neals!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dillon, who was an instructor alongside Neals, stabbed with his spear to deter the attack of the enemies. &nbsp;Neals quickly retreated backwards as he caught his breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit. &nbsp;Who are these bastards?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This isn’t good. &nbsp;I have no idea where these Orcs came from….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they fought, screams emanated from various locations. &nbsp;The guards and the men of the watch were caught with their pants down, so they were in disarray. &nbsp;Moreover, the enemy forces were killing every civilian they came across. &nbsp;As time passed, the amount of loss was snowballing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened to the signal flare?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We haven’t seen it. &nbsp;I think they were overtaken first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The garrison possessed a flare made by an alchemist. &nbsp;It was supposed to be shot up into the air when they were facing an opponent they couldn’t handle. &nbsp;It was an item that would have called for help. &nbsp;A significant amount of time had passed, but the flare hadn’t been launched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Neals’ blood was curdling. &nbsp;Why weren’t they using fire arrows if they wanted to kill all the townspeople? &nbsp;Were they trying to avoid detection?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘We have to notify someone….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They would all die if things kept going like this. &nbsp;No matter how he viewed this situation there was no hope in sight. &nbsp;Suddenly, he could only see darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Magic……!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had known something was wrong. &nbsp;Even if he was working together with Dillon, they should have been cut down already. &nbsp;Their enemies were much more skilled than them. &nbsp;So he hadn’t understood why they weren’t pressing forward. &nbsp;Now he knew they had been waiting for the support of a magician.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘We don’t stand a chance. &nbsp;If a magician is here, we….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t able to end the thread of his thought. He felt something split open his body, and he felt pain wash over him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Neaaaaaaaals!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dillon’s desperate yell could be heard. &nbsp;Neals wanted to tell Dillon to run, but words failed to come out. &nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover…..!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Their tactics are getting dirtier with each passing day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could hear an icy voice. &nbsp;As he died, Neals could hear the shocked voice of Dillon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W...who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a relief. &nbsp;Dillon wasn’t dead. &nbsp;As he felt relief, Neals’ consciousness fell into the darkness.</span></p>
