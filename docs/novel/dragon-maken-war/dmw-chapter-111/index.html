 <p>Chapter 111 - To the Land of the Demons (2)</p>
 <p><span style>“We just hoped they could be used as ingredients in forming the vessel of the king.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…what do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The king's body is being slowly formed within the abyss. &nbsp;If what Aincera-nim says is true, the king's body will recover to the one he had when he was alive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He's going to restore an already destroyed body?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His body will return to its previous form. &nbsp;When the restoration of the body ends, an incomprehensible method will be used to put the preserved soul into the body. &nbsp;It'll be a complete revival.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura had checked, and a significant portion of Atein's body had already been restored. &nbsp;It was a bizarre sight where the body was floating in the darkness, and there were gaps in the body. &nbsp;However, as time passed, the gaps were being filled in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We studied and analyzed his magic for a long time. &nbsp;However, no one was able discern the true nature of the spell. &nbsp;There were several hypothesis formed, and one of them was about using those with blood ties to the Dragon Demon King as a form of fertilizer. &nbsp;It was hypothesized that sacrificing those with certain strong characteristics would accelerate the recovery process.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Basically, the Dragon Demon Princess and the Dragon Demon Prince would be carved up for the parts needed for Atein to recover his body..... </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a ghoulish plan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell and Kairen was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You've all lost your minds.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I knew your organization was never sound of mind, but I'm speechless. You guys were going to grind up Arrieta and Seigar. &nbsp;They would have been used as nutrients, so the Dragon Demon King could make his body... &nbsp;&nbsp;You all deserve death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen grinded his teeth. His anger was renewed when he learned what they were going to do with his students.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll ask again. Since this trash of a plan failed...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It didn't fail. &nbsp;However, it did fail in its outcome.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you trying to play a trick with words?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We failed in kidnapping the Dragon Demon Princess and Dragon Demon Prince of the Rulain Kingdom. &nbsp;However, the candidates that could be used for this plan wasn't limited to the two of them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Basically, other chosen candidates, who checked off the same characteristics as Arrieta and Seigar, was kidnapped from other places. &nbsp;They were sacrificed to accelerate the revival of Atein. &nbsp;Laura spoke in a dispassionate manner towards the angry people around her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, it was a failure. &nbsp;We couldn't comprehend the king's magic, and it was proven that we couldn’t interrupt the process.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…that is a stroke of good luck in the midst of misfortune. &nbsp;So how long do we have until Atein revives?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don't know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is something every follower of the king wants to know. &nbsp;The only thing we can be sure of is the fact that the day is close at hand. &nbsp;The recovery has advanced far enough to assure this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see. &nbsp;So we have to do something before that happens.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell's expression darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If that bastard really revives to his former self... &nbsp;There is no way I'll be able to stop him right now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the end of the Dragon Demon War, Azell had to hold out until the outcome of the war was determined. &nbsp;However, he had exceeded expectation by defeating Atein. &nbsp;However, there was no way he would be able to win against Atein right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that his overall power level had dropped wasn’t the only problem. &nbsp;If he put in time and effort, he was sure he could exceed the power he had in his prime.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he could do nothing about the Dragon Demon weapons. &nbsp;Azell could recover his ‘Sword that Splits the Heaven, but the other 12 Dragon Demon weapons given to him by his comrades was gone forever. &nbsp;Moreover, he had been able to gather so many in the first place, because it had been the Dragon Demon war. &nbsp;Everything he was able to achieve was through blood and tears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After thinking it over, Azell shook his head from side to side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He asked Laura a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I probably should have asked this in the beginning… &nbsp;Why did you surrender to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That was the only way I would have survived the situation, and I wanted to observe you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Weren’t you someone important in the Plain of Darkness? &nbsp;Your action was so foolhardy that I can’t comprehend it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My position is worthless to me. &nbsp;I’m just a tool that’s being used to further their ambitions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura spoke with a much colder voice. &nbsp;One could clearly make the distinction with her words from before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The king’s revival is approaching, and the people, who were close to the king in the past, is impatient.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why the Aunsaurus tribe unleashed such madness to acquire the perfect successor. &nbsp;They wanted to bask in glory next Atein after his revival. &nbsp;This goal drove them nuts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wasn’t born into this world through a normal process. &nbsp;They had wanted the perfect successor, so they created me through magic. &nbsp;I’m a doll they created. &nbsp;Countless siblings of mine were created for this purpose. &nbsp;All of them were killed through this experiment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was at a loss for words. &nbsp;The Dragon Demon worshippers were like human nobles. &nbsp;They put a lot of meaning behind bloodline and race. &nbsp;However, they went so far as to commit those acts?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura spoke about her past in a calm manner to her audience, who were unable to speak. &nbsp;She told them about how she was born, and what she had to go through to become the heir of Aunsaurus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her life story was long. &nbsp;There was no way her life could be described as being humane. &nbsp;Unlike the despairing nature of her situation, she spoke in such a serene manner. &nbsp;Laura gave her confession, and it captivated her audience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…I became the heir of Aunsaurus, because I was the last one standing. &nbsp;I was created for this role, yet I never wanted it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a truth that Laura had never been able to tell others. &nbsp;Her family and close acquaintances didn’t know about how she felt… &nbsp;She would have never imagined in a million years that a time would come when she would be telling her secrets to her enemies. &nbsp;However, she felt unusually relieved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura looked straight at Azell,</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was born to be the heir of Aunsaurus, and I’ve lived to fulfill that role. I never thought about anything else. &nbsp;I never even thought about being anything else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After losing all her siblings, she had become the heir of Aunsaurus, and she no longer had any aspirations. &nbsp;She had just followed orders to &nbsp;achieve the wishes of her creators. &nbsp;She had merely been a doll following instructions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, a strong desire was kindled when she saw Azell. &nbsp;This was a first for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wanted to observe him. &nbsp;She wanted to know more about him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These desires made Laura throw away all the shackles that had restrained her. &nbsp;&nbsp;She had lived up until now to bring other’s wishes to reality. &nbsp;This was the first time she acted from her own desire. &nbsp;This was why she was willing to risk death to see this through.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura looked at Azell with determined eyes as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to be by your side to see who you are, and what you will be able to accomplish. &nbsp;To achieve this goal, I’m willing to give you Aunsaurus’ Dragon Weapon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>3</span></p>
 <p><span style>One didn’t need an elaborate ritual to pass on one’s Dragon Demon weapon. &nbsp;It was the same when Liglan gave Azell one of his twin swords. &nbsp;When Liglan transferred the weapon, he had to suffer through losing a part of his soul forever.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The process of giving the Vitan’s Chalice to Azell was simple and short. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell asked her a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you ok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…I’m a bit dizzy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura furrowed her brows. &nbsp;It felt as if there was a hole inside her chest. &nbsp;It felt empty. &nbsp;She had lost a presence that had been within her, and the sense of loss was bigger than expected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A magical vacuum occurred where the Dragon Weapon used to occupy. &nbsp;It’ll become better as time passes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t surprised at all as he received the Vitan’s Chalice. &nbsp;Laura asked him a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you received a Dragon Weapon from someone else before?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s a secret. &nbsp;However, I am well informed about the process.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You never give me a straight answer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You only ask me questions without a straight answer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At his words, Laura’s expression slightly changed. &nbsp;It was a very small change, so it was hard to detect. &nbsp;However, if one was observant, one could see she was sulking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll ask you another question. &nbsp;Is your Dragon Weapon perhaps the ‘Sword that Splits the Heaven’ used by Azell Karzark?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you even need to ask that question? &nbsp;Dragon Weapons are born with an innate name. &nbsp;The name can’t be changed even in an attempt to hide its presence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She received the answer to her question, yet it didn’t settle the confusion inside her head. &nbsp;Her confusion deepened. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was the identity of this man?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Could a human really live this long?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The problem was the fact that Azell was human. &nbsp;It didn’t matter what method one used. &nbsp;It was impossible for a human to live this long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m pretty sure I heard the descendants of Karzark was completely wiped out….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If one looked at this realistically, Azell Karzark probably went underground to prepare for the eventual return of the routed forces of the Dragon Demon King. &nbsp;She guessed Azell Karzark passed down his Dragon Weapon through his descendants. &nbsp;However, her heart didn’t allow her to believe in those conjectures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Maybe his plans weren’t disseminated to us. &nbsp;Did it fail?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s words were causing confusion within her. &nbsp;It was true that the upper classes of the Plain of Darkness didn’t tell the young generation everything. &nbsp;They left out a lot of information. &nbsp;She wondered if the truths she knew were actually lies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell asked her a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So how were you able to inherit the Vitan’s Chalice?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aunsaurus died at the hands of Carlos. &nbsp;However, he didn’t die immediately on the battlefield. &nbsp;It was assumed he was able to retreat before he died, and he was able to pass it on his Dragon Weapon to his successor. &nbsp;However… &nbsp;Baldazark was killed, and his body was destroyed. &nbsp;So how was weapon passed on to his successor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had killed Baldazark with his own hands. In the battle, Baldazark had used his Dragon Weapon called ‘Bleeding Star’. &nbsp;There had been no chance for Baldazark to transfer his weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘However, I’m pretty sure his descendant had used the Bleeding Star.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even in Laura’s case, it was weird. &nbsp;Even if Aunsaurus was able to transfer his Dragon Weapon before death, wasn’t the heir before Laura killed by the Guardian Shadows? &nbsp;How did she receive her Dragon Weapon?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Dragon Weapons of the four Dragon Demon Generals was preserved by the king’s magic. &nbsp;While the magic set up inside the Dragon Demon castle is active, those Dragon Weapons will never be lost even if the owners died.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmm…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell wasn’t surprised. &nbsp;He had an inkling that this would be the answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Carlos was successful in preserving my Dragon Maken, so of course, Atein could do it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos was well qualified to be called an Arch Mage, but in the case of Atein, it was hard to stick that title on him. &nbsp;Atein was a transcendent being, and Arch Mage was a insufficient descriptor. &nbsp;If Carlos could do it, Atein could probably do it also.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this restricted to only the Dragon Weapons of the four Dragon Demon Generals?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;No one has been able to replicate the effect of this magic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Therefore, if I die, the Vitan’s Chalice would be returned to the Plain of Darkness?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What if I transfer it to someone else?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It won’t return until the wielder dies.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see. &nbsp;When it becomes ownerless, the item is sent to a set location, and it is stored.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell furrowed his brows. &nbsp;He tried to approach the Vitan’s Chalice, which resided inside him now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the Dragon Demon war, he remembered the nightmares caused by the Vitan’s Chalice. &nbsp;Aunsaurus was a mage, and his power even without the Dragon Weapon made him a walking disaster. &nbsp;However, in terms of using the Dragon Weapon, he was superior to Atein.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He never imagined that someday he’ll be able use Aunsaurus’ Dragon Weapon. &nbsp;This was why they said anything could happen over time. &nbsp;He couldn’t even see an inch further into his future, and it was marvelous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I don’t see any problem with it…….’</span></p>
