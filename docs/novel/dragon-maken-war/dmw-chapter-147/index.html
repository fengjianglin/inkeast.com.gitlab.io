 <p>Chapter 147 - Heaven and Hell (3)</p>
 <p><span style>The Albatan forest was a demonic land located at the eastern end of the continent. &nbsp;The members of the Plain of Darkness didn’t dare intrude on this location thanks to the beings that ruled over the forest. &nbsp;When high caliber troops like Niberis and Duran was sent out to find the whereabouts of Saibein, they avoided all confrontations within the forest. &nbsp;Instead, they had run away at first sign of danger. &nbsp;They had to be very cautious in their search. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>This had been the case during and before the Dragon Demon war. &nbsp;It was a demonic land that was left over from the olden days…….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you guarantee that the wise Dragon Albatan won’t be hostile towards us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I can’t.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment. &nbsp;You can’t?</span></p>
 <p><span style>-However, I can’t think of another place to go to. &nbsp;Especially now...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Especially now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>-The Demon King Balserk spoke about it. &nbsp;He said the answer is with Albatan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren became surprised. &nbsp;Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-My curiosity is mounting as to who the guide really is. &nbsp;He is reading my moves as if he had seen my future. &nbsp;How could he arrange all of this without it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>-If there were other options available to me, I might have rejected what he had arranged for me. &nbsp;These subtle arrangements fit too well with my situation. &nbsp;It makes me wonder if I’m drinking from a poisoned well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are saying we have no other options?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>-The cards we hold is limited. &nbsp;If we had been successful in completely escaping the clutches of our enemies then maybe…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s fine. &nbsp;If we are going to die anyways, I’d rather not to be killed by the Dragon Demon king worshippers. &nbsp;When we have time, I’ll take a nap. &nbsp;Maybe, the guide will give us a decent plan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell and Kairen was taken aback by his words, so they stared at Yuren. &nbsp;Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know you trust the guide, but…. &nbsp;Is it ok to put all your eggs in one basket by blindly trusting the guide?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve always lived liked this. &nbsp;Maybe, I’m the one that should be called a fanatic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell and Kairen was at a loss for words. &nbsp;The more they saw this side of Yuren it became harder for them to understand him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren queried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What was the truth that Balserk wanted to impart on us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>-He wanted to tell us about the identity of the Demon race.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell told the two puzzled men about the last conversation he shared with Balserk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>3</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balserk spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;When hearing a long story, don’t humans like to hear a summary that is three lines or less beforehand? &nbsp;Since I like buying the goodwill of my audience, I’ll tell you the summary first.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are kind. &nbsp;So is it three lines?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Unfortunately, I’m not talented enough to put the summary into the form of a three line stanza….. &nbsp;I’ll resolve it with a single line. &nbsp;Demons are humans.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell became surprised at Balserk’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Demons had deep ill will towards humans, and they led humans to destruction by baiting them with knowledge. &nbsp;How could beings that are so engrossed in destroying humans be humans themselves?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balserk cackled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Are you surprised?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…honestly, I am surprised. &nbsp;However, it isn’t as if it is unbelievable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Ho-oh. &nbsp;Why?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You said they were humans.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Mmm?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The beings that hate humans the most are humans. &nbsp;If you frame it like that, it seems obvious.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ones that had the deepest understanding of humans were other humans. &nbsp;The ones that were capable of hating humans the most was also humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell didn’t know any existence that hated humans more than other humans. &nbsp;Hatred and ill will towards other humans seemed like a natural phenomena.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balserk spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Ah ah. &nbsp;It is quite unfortunate.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you referring to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I regret the fact that I don’t have much time left to share my story with you. &nbsp;The act of sharing a story with someone is a very sweet thing. &nbsp;It is an opportunity where we can get to know about each other. &nbsp;If it was up to me, I want to extend this conversation for a thousand or ten thousand years to fill this emptiness….. &nbsp;&nbsp;My wish is to enjoy my life in that fashion.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had been in absolute isolation, and he had been pining for his own destruction. The Demon King spoke with a sad voice..</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell didn’t give a reply. &nbsp;Balserk looked at him for a brief moment before he continued to speak..</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Yes, it is as you’ve said. Humans hate humans the most. &nbsp;&nbsp;In this world, the ones to kill the most humans isn’t wild beasts, natural disasters or even plagues…. &nbsp;&nbsp;If one thought about humans as a possibility, it is a logical conclusion.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon race yearned for human, yet they hated humans at the same time. &nbsp;If the Demon race were once humans, it really was an obvious conclusion. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;There are several myths that points to this truth. &nbsp;For example, the birth of the Dragon Demon race...&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were the product between Dragons and the Demon race. &nbsp;Dragon Demons were a high rank species that was the last amongst the races to walk on the surface of this world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were a a completely different species, yet they held resemblance to humans. &nbsp;On top of that fact, they were able to procreate with humans. &nbsp;The Dragon Majins were the product of such unions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Dragon Slayer’s Ritual.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>In nature, the Dragons were tyrants that were born with massive amounts of energy. &nbsp;Humans were the weakest if one took away their wisdom and weapons. &nbsp;It was an odd match.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Legend of Babel.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The way one thinks differed depending on where one lived. &nbsp;Every humans are the same at a fundamental level, yet humans from different regions had different languages. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>This led to magicians wanting to stop all tragedies that stemmed from a breakdown in communications. &nbsp;They consolidated the language of the human race into one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;There are several other myths….. &nbsp;However, these are the classic examples.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you trying to say the existence of the Demon race should be included as one of them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;That’s right.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balserk gave an affirmation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I don’t know how or when humans came to walk on the surface of this world. &nbsp;However, I do know that Demon race originated from the human race.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is something I am curious about…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where do the Demon race get their knowledge? &nbsp;How can you be so sure that you are right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Again, it all originates from humans.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;The Demon race cannot exist in this world. &nbsp;I don’t know who started calling us Demons, but it was an apt nickname. &nbsp;We live outside of the human world…. &nbsp;&nbsp;It is a place filled with emptiness. &nbsp;In other words, it is hell.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you mean hell really exists?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;The place I am talking about is a little bit different from the hell discussed within the temples of this world. &nbsp;Let me put aside the explanation about hell for now. There are two qualities that are lacking from Demons that humans possess. &nbsp;&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It is sleep and forgetfulness.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;We do not fall asleep, and we never forget. &nbsp;We are always observing the world. &nbsp;When I say the Demons ‘observe’, you should think of it as….. &nbsp;Yes, it is a bit different than looking at someone from afar.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean by that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;When the Demon race observes a human, it is a similar experience as reading a novel. &nbsp;Basically, half of it is from an omniscient viewpoint.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Basically, you are saying it includes the thoughts within a humans head?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It isn’t just thoughts. &nbsp;We are even able to see the causal relationship. &nbsp;It isn’t as if we can pick and choose everything we want to see. &nbsp;However, this means we are able to gain a variety of knowledge.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>If a human discovers something, does the knowledge get transferred to everyone?</span></p>
 <p><span style>No.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Does an achievement attained by someone benefit all humans?</span></p>
 <p><span style>No.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Many information gets lost, but if one is lucky, the knowledge may get passed on to another &nbsp;&nbsp;human. &nbsp;The knowledge of the Demon race is based on personal observation. &nbsp;Moreover....&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balserk raised a finger, and he focused Azell’s gaze on it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;The only condition needed for a human to become a Demon is hate.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Humans that possess hate becomes a Demon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;If we are to summarize it, your statement is correct.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…I’m just trying to confirm something. &nbsp;Death is part of the process in becoming a Demon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Of course. &nbsp;You are correct.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So everyone that dies with hate in their heart becomes a Demon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;That isn’t the case. &nbsp;If one wants to become a demon, one has to fulfill two prerequisites..&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It didn’t matter how, but one had to hate humanity after being murdered by a stranger. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, the hate had to be so enormous that the hate doesn’t become limited to a single person. &nbsp;The person has to hate everything that was made by humans in this world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;The first Demon was the very first human to be murdered by another human. &nbsp;I’ve met him before.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve met him? &nbsp;How?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;The magician that put me in this state made me confront him. &nbsp;It was an interesting experience.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The very first human to be murdered by another…. &nbsp;It really does sound like a myth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Everything has a first. &nbsp;The being that imprisoned me was trying to find the origin of humans through this Demon. &nbsp;&nbsp;I’m not sure if he gained the answer he wanted.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmm…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I’m not sure if there are more conditions, but that is all I’ve discovered. &nbsp;The one to imprison me here found out the reason behind the birth of the Demon race. &nbsp;At the same time, he surmised that something went went awry when humans appeared on this world.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Something went awry? &nbsp;Do you mean this world? &nbsp;Or are you talking about humans?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Both. &nbsp;I’m not entirely sure what the problem was. &nbsp;However. &nbsp;From the perspective of a demon, humans were changed into Demons, and they were thrown into hell. &nbsp;It is a consensus amongst us that this is proof that something is wrong with this world. &nbsp;As a human, you probably see the Demons as evil existence. &nbsp;However, I told you about the prerequisite needed to become a Demon. &nbsp;Can’t you see that process is unfair?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The ones that have hate in their heart after being murdered is thrown into hell. &nbsp;The temple tells us that we reap what we sow. It seems that is far from the truth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It means morality has nothing to do with hell, Demons and humans. &nbsp;One doesn’t become a demon, because one was evil or one had committed a wrong. &nbsp;It is akin to a human contracting a incurable disease. &nbsp;We were just unlucky in becoming Demons and being sent to hell….. &nbsp;This world is horrifying cruel, and there is something wrong with it.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you want sympathy from me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It would be great if you could give me some.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;If you look at me like that, I’ll be wounded. &nbsp;All right. &nbsp;I’ll talk more about hell.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balserk let out a self-deprecating smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;The Demon race can watch the world strictly as outsiders. &nbsp;We are similar to humans…. &nbsp;To be precise, we used to be humans, and our minds had been corrupted. &nbsp;We couldn’t contact anyone in the outside world, so we could share our plight with anyone. &nbsp;Do you realize how horrifying that is?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is hell?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;That’s right. &nbsp;The only reason why we know know we are separate beings inside that place is the fact that we still have self-awareness. &nbsp;However….&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>They knew where the world was, yet they couldn’t approach it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even as they brushed by it, they couldn’t reach the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;There is no conflict in that place. &nbsp;There is no discrimination. &nbsp;No one suffers from hunger or sickness. &nbsp;Since we’ve escaped the circle of life, we do not grow old. &nbsp;Do you know what some call such a world?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is... paradise.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;That is correct. &nbsp;It is a world everyone yearned for. &nbsp;It was an ideal world that everyone had dreamed about.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were able to perceive the existence of other beings, yet they were thrown into a world where they couldn’t vent their feelings. &nbsp;Moreover, it didn’t matter if one wanted to or not. &nbsp;One was able to observe the world that they had once existed in. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>This world had happiness within it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was sadness. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;We could see it.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>They could only see it.</span></p>
