  <p></p>
  <hr>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>When he thought about it, there were three possibilities.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘First, it might be, because we might not be far enough from the city.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>If they attacked, it wouldn’t take too long for the party to return to the city if they decided to do so. At the very least, Arrieta could. If she decided to move at a high speed by herself, she could move much faster than riding a galloping horse.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘They might be here to only track us. The main force might not be here yet.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell thought this possibility was very likely.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Dragon’s Shadow had already failed in their attempt to kidnap Arrieta, even though they brought a powerful force. Even if it was an immense secret organization, it would be hard for them to mobilize a superior force to the one before. They were probably keeping tabs on their location in real times until enough forces could be gathered.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Lastly…they might be setting up a trap on the road we are taking.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>When the party chose their route, they didn’t worry about confusing the enemies, who might be tracking them. They just picked the roads that will allow them to reach the capital the fastest.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This in turn made it easier for the enemies to predict their actions. It wouldn’t be strange if they focused all of their best forces on the route they were taking to face off against the party.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘This is the worst case scenario.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>He couldn’t guess the number of forces the Dragon’s Shadow would mobilize. If it was like last time, then from Azell’s perspective, it wouldn’t pose him much of a threat. However, what if they were hiding forces that exceeded the last one?</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Since I don’t know about the size of the organization or their structure, it can’t be helped.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>The worshipers of the Dragon Demon king were a type of heretics. They were strongly ostracized by society, so they secretly moved in the shadow. Of course, there wouldn’t be much known about them.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Currently, the only thing we know is that their place of origin is in the north, and the location is called the Field of Darkness. We don’t have any other helpful information.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>The north of the continent was a frozen land. It was the devil’s territory named Field of Darkness. It is a place where the Dragon Demon Race, who were against the humans, were assembled. It was also the place where the worship of the Dragon Demon King originated from. The Dragon Demon Race hid themselves where human couldn’t tread. They gathered worshipers from the shadow, and they manage the organization from there.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Huh?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>He suddenly heard a rustling sound. Azell glanced up to see Arrieta get up, and approach him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell spoke as he lowered his voice.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Princess?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hmm. Somehow, I can’t sleep. It’s strange.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It might be because you slept until noon, while missing breakfast?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You are pointing out a woman’s sleep pattern. Is it something an elegant knight should say?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta sat down next to Azell with a coy expression.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was something he had found out after the travel started, but Arrieta slept a lot. If they were able to find a decent accommodations, she always slept in late. This caused their party to slow down a little bit. As this happened twice in a row, they decided to modify the schedule to allow her to sleep until midday.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell spoke calmly as he looked at the camp-fire.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“There is an enemy present.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What did you say?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta was taken aback. Azell didn’t look at her as he spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“They aren’t showing any signs of attacking any time soon. They aren’t even coming close to us. I can feel them using far-seeing magic to observe us.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmm….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta frowned, and she asked a question as she looked around her surrounding.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You also knew about it last time. How are you able to do so?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>In Arrieta’s life, she had never been told by anyone that her sense were dull. Even she wasn’t able to notice them yet Azell had easily figured them out.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It is a technique.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“A technique?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m able to check if someone’s gaze is on me. It is a technique possessed by Spirit Order Practitioner.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What is the theory behind this ‘technique’? I would understand it if you were a magician…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“In the end, Spirit Order is another form of magic. It is possible to master the mind with a Spirit Order technique.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That’s surprising. I’ve never heard of anyone using such techniques except for you. Similar to me, I’ve seen people detect others when they detect signs of life within a certain range…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell smiled bitterly when he heard Arrieta’s word. It was necessary for him to know these techniques in the Dragon Demon war. He was able to detect gazes, animosity and even murderous intent through the technique. It was strange to see these techniques not used in battle any more.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He wasn’t sure when he faced off against Giles, but he was sure now after facing off against Boar. Both of them had the same weakness. The part of Spirit Order that could be considered the foundation was missing, and they had only developed the outer parts. From Azell’s perspective, this seemed like a bad joke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Suddenly, Arrieta asked a question.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What kind of technique did you utilize on Sir Boar? May you teach it to me?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It’s simple. I slightly twisted his senses.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You twisted his senses?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Since Sir Boar is a Quadruple Master, he knows several defensive techniques. He can counteract attacks that can deliver damage by piercing through his defense. When facing an opponent like him, there are several technique that could overcome the threshold of his defense. Amongst them, I used the most basic method.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Spirit Order is a technique that interacts with the mind. Boar was like Giles. He was weak to techniques that dealt with the Mind. The only thing they could do was to put up a barrier around their mind.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The erected mental wall was sturdy, but it wasn’t a problem for Azell. He used a clever method of finding a doghole. He took a roundabout way akin to climbing over a castle wall, and he was able to disturb Boar’s mind.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This resulted in Boar’s mind making a very slight error every time he blocked Azell’s attacks. Therefore, Boar was either subtly early or late on his blocks.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘A good amount of techniques had survived. However, it was as if the energy pulse had been blocked. The true meaning of the skills, and the more advanced techniques seemed to have been lost….’</span></p>
  <p><span style>It wasn’t as if Boar didn’t try to counteract his methods. He realized there was errors within his perception, so he strengthened his mental barrier. He also utilized differed defensive skills.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Azell had countless skills he could use to deal with each situation. From the outside, it looked like Boar was falling for the same trick, but the inside circumstances was different.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Are all the Spirit Order practitioners like this?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was most curious about this part.</span></p>
  <p><span style>During the Dragon Demon War, the sharing and learning of techniques happened actively. However, this generation had no incentive to do so.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The knowledge of Spirit Order and Magic not known to others itself became a form of power. During the Dragon Demon War, the united race had battled fiercely against the enemy, but it wasn’t so any more. If one taught the secret techniques to others, it basically amounted to throwing away one’s fortune. Still, it would be too rash to judge the entire population’s standard after seeing only Boar and Giles.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta was impressed by his explanation.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“So that’s how it is. I’ve often seen Spirit Order practitioners affect the opponent’s mind, yet I was unaware of this possibility.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Boar and Giles had techniques that dealt with the mind to a certain extent. They could let out an oppressive energy, or they could paralyze the opponent by letting out a shout, which imitated a predator’s roar. These kinds of technique was a great boon on the battle field. Azell’s technique was far more intricate and refined compared to theirs. Like magic, he was able to produce a variety of effect, and he was able come up with new methods.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Suddenly Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Your teachers must be amazing people.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Why do you think so?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“They were able to help grow someone like you. Well, I don’t know about your personality, but at the very least, I’m very sure on your ability to teach.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmmm….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Her words rekindled a memory in Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta spoke with a sincere expression.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Until now, I thought I had enough real battle experiences.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After having her coming of age ceremony at 15 years old, she had experienced a lot of battles.</span></p>
  <p><span style>At times she would have to show her strength in border disputes. She sometimes fought monsters, and other times evil black magicians.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was a brutal work for a young girl. However, Arrieta carried out her mission without saying a word of complaint.</span></p>
  <p><span style>As she did all of this, she started gaining confidence as a martial artist. She wouldn’t be shaken up like her first battle experience, and she wouldn’t have to see her allies be sacrificed….</span></p>
  <p><span style>“However, I found out I was in error in the recent events.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta’s battle experience was akin to a child picking out her favorite food.</span></p>
  <p><span style>She had never fought against a strong opponent, who was on even grounds with her. Even if she was tactically at a disadvantage, her martial arts had always been better than the others. When she was threatened by a small group with enough power to threaten her, she had been baffled. She couldn’t properly use her skills, and she had been led by the nose by the enemy’s design.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Sir Azell. If you weren’t there, then I’m sure I would have been captured by those wicked people. If my teacher saw it, he would sigh at my pathetic state.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I thought you held firm, and you coped well considering the situation.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You don’t have to try to make me feel better.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No, I’m telling the truth. Well, from my perspective, you were only out of your depth when the Earth Dragon showed up. For the rest, it wasn’t too bad even if I wouldn’t rate it a perfect score.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Two years had passed since she had experienced her first battle. She was still 17 years old, so he had no reason to give a harsh evaluation when he considered her age. Arrieta smiled bitterly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I thought you were going to flatter me, but you didn’t forget to pinch me in a sore spot.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Well I’m a bit of an honest man.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You are an ill-tempered man.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta pouted, and unlike her words, she looked like any girl her age.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After a moment, Arrieta asked a question.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Sir Azell.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Do you have a lot of experience facing against strong foes?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmmm. I’ve done it a lot.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>He had overcome countless near-death experiences in the Dragon Demon war. Every single member of the Dragon Demon race possessed huge amounts of power. Amongst them, the ones with their names known to others were like moving disasters.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Could you tell me some stories about your teachers?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“My teachers…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>At those words, Azell started thinking about his past. For him, it had been only a couple years ago, but it had become a distant past for humanity….</span></p>
  <p><span style>5</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell’s first teacher was an old man, who was part of the civil militia. He had taught Azell martial arts in his childhood when he lived near the town next to the mountains. He used to be a mercenary when he was young. He taught Azell a sword art that required a strict structure.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“He was a very strict old man.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell didn’t tell her, but the old man’s name was Rogan.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He had taught the young members of the civil militia. Rogan took on the role of a drill sergeant. He had a high assessment of Azell’s potential, who hadn’t learned any martial arts, yet he was someone who had assassinated the thieves without an adult’s help.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Unlike the youths of the civil militia, he had taken in Azell as his disciple.</span></p>
  <p><span style>If he thought of those times, Azell had learned under him for 3 years until his death, and he was the one who laid down his foundation. The old man thoroughly taught him the basics, and the system of his sword art. He also used his extensive experience as a retired mercenary to foster a flexible maneuverability in Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“My second teacher…. Mmmm. He was a weirdo. From his head to the end of his toes, he was weird in every way.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After Rogan’s death, Azell left the town, and he wondered the world for 2 years as a mercenary.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He was young, so it was common for people to be ignore him. However, every man capable of fighting was needed at that time. In the presence of an arrow storm, Azell had returned alive after distinguishing himself, and he slowly started to make a name for himself.</span></p>
  <p><span style>During all of this, he had met an one-armed swordsman.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“An one-armed swordsman?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta asked in surprise, and Azell answered.</span></p>

Even if it was an immense secret organization, it would be hard for them to mobilize a superior force to the one before. They were probably keeping tabs on their location in real times until enough forces could be gathered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Lastly…they might be setting up a trap on the road we are taking.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the party chose their route, they didn’t worry about confusing the enemies, who might be tracking them. They just picked the roads that will allow them to reach the capital the fastest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This in turn made it easier for the enemies to predict their actions. It wouldn’t be strange if they focused all of their best forces on the route they were taking to face off against the party.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is the worst case scenario.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t guess the number of forces the Dragon’s Shadow would mobilize. If it was like last time, then from Azell’s perspective, it wouldn’t pose him much of a threat. However, what if they were hiding forces that exceeded the last one?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Since I don’t know about the size of the organization or their structure, it can’t be helped.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The worshipers of the Dragon Demon king were a type of heretics. They were strongly ostracized by society, so they secretly moved in the shadow. Of course, there wouldn’t be much known about them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Currently, the only thing we know is that their place of origin is in the north, and the location is called the Field of Darkness. We don’t have any other helpful information.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The north of the continent was a frozen land. It was the devil’s territory named Field of Darkness. It is a place where the Dragon Demon Race, who were against the humans, were assembled. It was also the place where the worship of the Dragon Demon King originated from. The Dragon Demon Race hid themselves where human couldn’t tread. They gathered worshipers from the shadow, and they manage the organization from there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Huh?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He suddenly heard a rustling sound. Azell glanced up to see Arrieta get up, and approach him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke as he lowered his voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Princess?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm. Somehow, I can’t sleep. It’s strange.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It might be because you slept until noon, while missing breakfast?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are pointing out a woman’s sleep pattern. Is it something an elegant knight should say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta sat down next to Azell with a coy expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was something he had found out after the travel started, but Arrieta slept a lot. If they were able to find a decent accommodations, she always slept in late. This caused their party to slow down a little bit. As this happened twice in a row, they decided to modify the schedule to allow her to sleep until midday.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke calmly as he looked at the camp-fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is an enemy present.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta was taken aback. Azell didn’t look at her as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They aren’t showing any signs of attacking any time soon. They aren’t even coming close to us. I can feel them using far-seeing magic to observe us.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta frowned, and she asked a question as she looked around her surrounding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You also knew about it last time. How are you able to do so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Arrieta’s life, she had never been told by anyone that her sense were dull. Even she wasn’t able to notice them yet Azell had easily figured them out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is a technique.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A technique?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m able to check if someone’s gaze is on me. It is a technique possessed by Spirit Order Practitioner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is the theory behind this ‘technique’? I would understand it if you were a magician…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the end, Spirit Order is another form of magic. It is possible to master the mind with a Spirit Order technique.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s surprising. I’ve never heard of anyone using such techniques except for you. Similar to me, I’ve seen people detect others when they detect signs of life within a certain range…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell smiled bitterly when he heard Arrieta’s word. It was necessary for him to know these techniques in the Dragon Demon war. He was able to detect gazes, animosity and even murderous intent through the technique. It was strange to see these techniques not used in battle any more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t sure when he faced off against Giles, but he was sure now after facing off against Boar. Both of them had the same weakness. The part of Spirit Order that could be considered the foundation was missing, and they had only developed the outer parts. From Azell’s perspective, this seemed like a bad joke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Arrieta asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of technique did you utilize on Sir Boar? May you teach it to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s simple. I slightly twisted his senses.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You twisted his senses?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since Sir Boar is a Quadruple Master, he knows several defensive techniques. He can counteract attacks that can deliver damage by piercing through his defense. When facing an opponent like him, there are several technique that could overcome the threshold of his defense. Amongst them, I used the most basic method.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Spirit Order is a technique that interacts with the mind. Boar was like Giles. He was weak to techniques that dealt with the Mind. The only thing they could do was to put up a barrier around their mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The erected mental wall was sturdy, but it wasn’t a problem for Azell. He used a clever method of finding a doghole. He took a roundabout way akin to climbing over a castle wall, and he was able to disturb Boar’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This resulted in Boar’s mind making a very slight error every time he blocked Azell’s attacks. Therefore, Boar was either subtly early or late on his blocks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A good amount of techniques had survived. However, it was as if the energy pulse had been blocked. The true meaning of the skills, and the more advanced techniques seemed to have been lost….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t as if Boar didn’t try to counteract his methods. He realized there was errors within his perception, so he strengthened his mental barrier. He also utilized differed defensive skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Azell had countless skills he could use to deal with each situation. From the outside, it looked like Boar was falling for the same trick, but the inside circumstances was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Are all the Spirit Order practitioners like this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was most curious about this part.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the Dragon Demon War, the sharing and learning of techniques happened actively. However, this generation had no incentive to do so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The knowledge of Spirit Order and Magic not known to others itself became a form of power. During the Dragon Demon War, the united race had battled fiercely against the enemy, but it wasn’t so any more. If one taught the secret techniques to others, it basically amounted to throwing away one’s fortune. Still, it would be too rash to judge the entire population’s standard after seeing only Boar and Giles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta was impressed by his explanation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So that’s how it is. I’ve often seen Spirit Order practitioners affect the opponent’s mind, yet I was unaware of this possibility.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boar and Giles had techniques that dealt with the mind to a certain extent. They could let out an oppressive energy, or they could paralyze the opponent by letting out a shout, which imitated a predator’s roar. These kinds of technique was a great boon on the battle field. Azell’s technique was far more intricate and refined compared to theirs. Like magic, he was able to produce a variety of effect, and he was able come up with new methods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your teachers must be amazing people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why do you think so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They were able to help grow someone like you. Well, I don’t know about your personality, but at the very least, I’m very sure on your ability to teach.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her words rekindled a memory in Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta spoke with a sincere expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Until now, I thought I had enough real battle experiences.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After having her coming of age ceremony at 15 years old, she had experienced a lot of battles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At times she would have to show her strength in border disputes. She sometimes fought monsters, and other times evil black magicians.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a brutal work for a young girl. However, Arrieta carried out her mission without saying a word of complaint.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she did all of this, she started gaining confidence as a martial artist. She wouldn’t be shaken up like her first battle experience, and she wouldn’t have to see her allies be sacrificed….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, I found out I was in error in the recent events.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta’s battle experience was akin to a child picking out her favorite food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had never fought against a strong opponent, who was on even grounds with her. Even if she was tactically at a disadvantage, her martial arts had always been better than the others. When she was threatened by a small group with enough power to threaten her, she had been baffled. She couldn’t properly use her skills, and she had been led by the nose by the enemy’s design.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir Azell. If you weren’t there, then I’m sure I would have been captured by those wicked people. If my teacher saw it, he would sigh at my pathetic state.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought you held firm, and you coped well considering the situation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t have to try to make me feel better.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I’m telling the truth. Well, from my perspective, you were only out of your depth when the Earth Dragon showed up. For the rest, it wasn’t too bad even if I wouldn’t rate it a perfect score.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two years had passed since she had experienced her first battle. She was still 17 years old, so he had no reason to give a harsh evaluation when he considered her age. Arrieta smiled bitterly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought you were going to flatter me, but you didn’t forget to pinch me in a sore spot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well I’m a bit of an honest man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are an ill-tempered man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta pouted, and unlike her words, she looked like any girl her age.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a moment, Arrieta asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir Azell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have a lot of experience facing against strong foes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm. I’ve done it a lot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had overcome countless near-death experiences in the Dragon Demon war. Every single member of the Dragon Demon race possessed huge amounts of power. Amongst them, the ones with their names known to others were like moving disasters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could you tell me some stories about your teachers?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My teachers…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At those words, Azell started thinking about his past. For him, it had been only a couple years ago, but it had become a distant past for humanity….</span></p>
 <p><span style>5</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s first teacher was an old man, who was part of the civil militia. He had taught Azell martial arts in his childhood when he lived near the town next to the mountains. He used to be a mercenary when he was young. He taught Azell a sword art that required a strict structure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He was a very strict old man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell didn’t tell her, but the old man’s name was Rogan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had taught the young members of the civil militia. Rogan took on the role of a drill sergeant. He had a high assessment of Azell’s potential, who hadn’t learned any martial arts, yet he was someone who had assassinated the thieves without an adult’s help.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike the youths of the civil militia, he had taken in Azell as his disciple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he thought of those times, Azell had learned under him for 3 years until his death, and he was the one who laid down his foundation. The old man thoroughly taught him the basics, and the system of his sword art. He also used his extensive experience as a retired mercenary to foster a flexible maneuverability in Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My second teacher…. Mmmm. He was a weirdo. From his head to the end of his toes, he was weird in every way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Rogan’s death, Azell left the town, and he wondered the world for 2 years as a mercenary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was young, so it was common for people to be ignore him. However, every man capable of fighting was needed at that time. In the presence of an arrow storm, Azell had returned alive after distinguishing himself, and he slowly started to make a name for himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During all of this, he had met an one-armed swordsman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“An one-armed swordsman?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta asked in surprise, and Azell answered.</span></p>
