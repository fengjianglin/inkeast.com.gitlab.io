 <p>Chapter 132 - Fallen Demon (2)</p>
 <p><span style>2</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next morning arrived, and the party departed when the sun started to come out. &nbsp;Moreover, they were able to arrive at their destination when the sun was high up in the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren, who had been walking from the front, spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the party members had a queer expression on their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a marsh made out of mud in front of their eyes. &nbsp;It was a bit too in-your-face to be a naturally formed marsh. &nbsp;It was as if corpses were gathered and turned into mulch in this location throughout the years. &nbsp;There was a dense noxious fume emanating from it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell asked him a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s within this marsh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“According to the words of the guide, it’s here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm. &nbsp;How do we open the door?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The door is within there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…are you perhaps trying to say we have to dive into the marsh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry. &nbsp;I might have a way. &nbsp;The marsh isn’t that deep, so I’ll use my barrier as we head below….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s all right. &nbsp;I’ll do it..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell let out a sigh as he stepped forward. &nbsp;Yuren asked him a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you going to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Rise Dragon Weapon, Vitan’s Chalice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instead of answering his question, Azell brought out the Vitan’s Chalice. &nbsp;It was as if a lightning had planted itself in front of him. &nbsp;A transparent staff made out of glass was held within his hand. &nbsp;Dragon Demon magic poured out of of Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Path of Tears.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh…….</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surrounding space looked distorted as if one was looking through a drop of water. &nbsp;This distortion gathered in front of Azell, and it turned into a large pocket of air. &nbsp;It extended forward from him as it entered into the marsh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. Is it around 10 meters deep?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a brief amount of time, there was a path leading down into the marsh. &nbsp;The distortion of air had created a path within the marsh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke as he walked in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone follow me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…what is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura asked in surprise. &nbsp;She had been the original owner of the Vitan’s Chalice, yet she hadn’t known how to use it properly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell answered her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Dimensional distortion field can be focused into a limited space to create a shape one desires. &nbsp;Even if it was a volcano overflowing with magma, I could go in. &nbsp;The heat won’t affect me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In truth, these were feats performed by Aunsaurus in front of Azell during the Dragon Demon war. &nbsp;Azell had used the time on this journey to go over his memories, and he worked on replicating the feats performed by Aunsaurus using the Vitan’s Chalice. &nbsp;The Path of Tears was one of the results of his efforts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren spoke as if he was dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is a complete cheat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The performance of the Dragon Weapon called the Vitan’s Chalice can be described as a cheat. &nbsp;The Dimensional Distortion can be controlled by constructing an image in one’s mind. &nbsp;This is why its usefulness can’t be measured through common sense.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They followed the Path of Tears to arrive at the bottom of the marsh, and there found a stone gate. &nbsp;It was clearly a man-made stone door. &nbsp;As soon as the party arrived at the bottom, the door opened, and a very dark hallway was revealed. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-roo-roo-roong!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When all the party members entered, the door closed. &nbsp;Yuren spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are no traps here, so we can just head in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm? Why is it so lax in security?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The marsh was a troublesome barrier, but a high level magician would be able to break through it easily. &nbsp;Yuren spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think the defense differs depending on who’s the intruder. &nbsp;I think it won’t be a problem since you are here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There aren’t any signs that we are being probed by magic….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I concur. &nbsp;Since the guide said so, shouldn’t we just assume it to be true?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…it isn’t good to trust blindly. &nbsp;Just look around a little bit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I agree with that sentiment. &nbsp;Still, it feels as if we are doing unnecessary work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren grumbled, but he diligently searched for magic traps. It happened at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;…you are the customer I have been waiting for.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>A bleak voice rang out from down the hallway. &nbsp;It was a voice that sent a chill running up one’s spine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the hallway brightened. &nbsp;There were magic lights placed along the hallway, and the desolate sight of the hallway was revealed. &nbsp;It had been neglected over the long years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell mumbled to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it an Undead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Since you’ve entered this path without much difficulty, I assumed right. &nbsp;You guys are the customers I’ve been waiting for.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is only one path.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;If you guys weren’t the ones I’ve been waiting for, you would have been bombarded by a prodigious amount of magic. &nbsp;You would have only been able to hear my voice after you escaped from the throes of death. &nbsp;Then you would have arrived at this structure, which was created to be a maze.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A maze...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You don’t have to be worried. Since you are already on this path, you’ll be able to meet me soon.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your credibility is plummeting really fast….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-roo-roo-roong……!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was becoming wary when he felt a faint rumbling. &nbsp;Everyone flinched as they looked at their surrounding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell assessed the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The hallway itself is moving.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;That’s right. &nbsp;This place moves endlessly to restructure itself.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if to prove his words, a wall cut through the hallway. &nbsp;No, it was more accurate to say that the wall slid by. &nbsp;The wall moved at high speed as the hallway was revealed again. &nbsp;Then several wall started to move, and he thought he glimpsed the sight of several gears and other mechanisms… &nbsp;The configuration kept changing in front of them, and they finally arrived at a room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-goo-goong…….</span></p>
 <p><span style>The vibration ceased. &nbsp;A large and desolate room greeted them. &nbsp;There really was nothing here except for an Undead wearing a hood. &nbsp;It was sitting on a stone platform in the middle of the room. &nbsp;It was sitting in the lotus position. &nbsp;Its flesh had already rotted away, so only its skeleton remained. &nbsp;There was a ghostly fire burning within its eye sockets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw this, Azell felt a chill. &nbsp;There was soft magical energy emanating from it, and it had a familiar ominous stench to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Demon?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It felt similar to the magical energy gained by Yuren when he had connected to a Demon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly,Yuren spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are sealed here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Yes, I can’t exit this small space.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the Undead spoke, it raised its hand into the air. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hand reached a certain point, and…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-jee-jee-jee-jeek!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A fierce spark erupted to repel the hand. &nbsp;The finger bones became charred as smoke emanated from it. &nbsp;Fragments of bone fell off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this lasted only for a moment. &nbsp;It was as if time had run in reverse. &nbsp;The damaged hand was restored. &nbsp;The charred bone fragments turned white, and it started to attach themselves back to whence they came from.</span></p>
 <p><span style>THe Undead shrugged its shoulders as it spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I cannot die either.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a black blood magic circle on the floor. &nbsp;It had complicated geometric shapes, and it was filled with magic characters. &nbsp;It created a powerful magical barrier that was confining the Undead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It also has the power of protecting my mind, so I cannot go mad either. &nbsp;It is the worst prison with no avenue of exit. &nbsp;All i can do is think as I struggle through the loneliness. &nbsp;That is why it is really great to see you guys. &nbsp;Could you perhaps tell me how long of a time has passed outside?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How would we know such an answer when you ask it totally out of the blue?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Ah. &nbsp;It seems you need a frame of reference. &nbsp;I was locked around 100 years before what the humans called the Dragon Demon war occurred.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If we are using that as reference, it has been 223 years since the Dragon Demon war had ended.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It has been a long time. I cannot believe it has been 300 years since I’ve gained this withered body.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;When I was sealed here, I wasn’t an Undead yet. &nbsp;I was alive, since I inhabited the body of a human. &nbsp;I couldn’t exit this place, and I couldn’t acquire any food. &nbsp;My body became weak, and in the end, I died. &nbsp;I had to watch the process of myself rot away. &nbsp;I would have preferred to have gone mad, but that choice wasn’t made available to me. &nbsp;Oh. &nbsp;I feel a chill run up my body when I think about it again. &nbsp;Even this is a pale imitation of what I used to be. &nbsp;The pain and the fear is now etched into my soul. &nbsp;It really was nasty….&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Undead shuddered as it spoke. &nbsp;The party members, who listening to it, gulped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a brief summary, but it sounded like a cruel punishment. &nbsp;Who was this Undead? &nbsp;Who did it piss off to be pushed into the pits of hell alive?</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I hope you understand why I’m so chatty right now. &nbsp;As I’ve said before, I’ve been here for over 200 years. &nbsp;I watched myself die and rot away. &nbsp;This is why you don’t make a deal with a Demon. &nbsp;Of course, the problem is I’m the Demon.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Do you perhaps know about the name Balserk? &nbsp;It has been a long time, so I might have been forgotten…..&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>At its words, the party members looked at each other. &nbsp;However, they didn’t know the name. &nbsp;Kairen, who had lived a long time, didn’t know it. &nbsp;Laura, who had lived inside the Plain of Darkness, also didn’t know the name.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was one exception. &nbsp;Azell looked at the Undead with a surprised expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you talking about the Demon King Balserk?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Oh, yes. &nbsp;I guess I wasn’t completely forgotten in history. &nbsp;Young people these days must not be studying up on their history. &nbsp;Since there were magicians amongst you, I had high hopes. &nbsp;Instead a youth who’s not a magician….&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, people don’t know that name. &nbsp;After the Dragon Demon war, Dragon Demon king Atein’s name overshadowed all the dark figures in history. &nbsp;They were deemed inconsequential compared to Atein. &nbsp;The name recognition of Balserk is probably lower than the lowest ranked general of the Dragon Demon army. &nbsp;You’ve been obsolete for a very long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;…after my body became like this, I thought I would never have the occasion to be wounded again. &nbsp;I was wrong.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Undead grumbled to itself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell asked it a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m just telling you the objective truth….. &nbsp;Does this mean you are Balserk?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You are correct. &nbsp;Back in my days….&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are the Demon King, who caused a million deaths in the Yudusk kingdom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yudusk was one of the seven kingdoms fighting for supremacy over the continent right now. &nbsp;The kingdom was located north, and it bordered the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;Even during the Nadick empire, this kingdom had possessed the most land. &nbsp;This remained true even 220 years after the Dragon Demon war had ended. &nbsp;Their royal bloodline also remained unbroken, so they had the deepest history. &nbsp;This was also why their social structure was antiquated. &nbsp;There were only two amongst the seven kingdoms that still allowed slavery. &nbsp;Yudusk was one of the two.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Moreover… &nbsp;You are the one that deepened our knowledge of the Demon race.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell thought about the story he heard from Carlos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>3</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before the Dragon Demon war, humans didn’t know much about the Demon race. &nbsp;In truth, it wasn’t as if people had a better understanding of them now. &nbsp;However, in the past, it was pretty much a blank slate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the time, Carlos insisted on making contact with the Demon race. &nbsp;He thought it was a solution to their hopeless situation. &nbsp;This was why he continued to scrap together more knowledge about the Demon race. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The awareness of the Demon race can be divided into before and after the appearance of the Demon King Balserk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why? &nbsp;Actually, I don’t think I’ve even heard of the Demon King Balserk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The world is large. He was famous in the north. &nbsp;It is understandable that people, who aren’t from that region, don’t know about him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone knows who Atein is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“On top of that, everyone knows the four Dragon Demon Generals. &nbsp;This is why they are considered to be incredible. &nbsp;It isn’t an exaggeration to call them the strongest beings in history.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos snorted as he continued to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you were from Yudusk, the name of Balserk would have struck fear in you. &nbsp;When one mentions the Demon King, everyone thinks about Atein first. &nbsp;However, the people of Yudusk would think about Balserk first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon race didn’t exert their evil onto society before Balserk’s appearance. &nbsp;Demons were seen as beings from legends, and the civilians didn’t believe that they were real. &nbsp;The only ones that knew about them were Black Magicians, who voluntarily entered into the Swamp of Destruction to seek knowledge and power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone that was called Demon King in history all possessed a real body. &nbsp;Most of them had an intimate relations with Black magic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were some that thought they would be able to acquire great power by approaching the Demon race. &nbsp;However, there hadn’t been any cases where a Demon went out of its way to harm humans. &nbsp;None had tried to achieve notoriety until Balserk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balserk was an outlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To the best of my knowledge, Demons do not have names.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos had already met a lot of Demons. &nbsp;He called them up, and he walked the tightrope to gain power. &nbsp;This resulted in Carlos becoming a caliber of magician that even surprised the Dragon Demon Generals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, a Demon that wanted to be called Balserk made its appearance. &nbsp;Creatures, who possessed great power in darkness, started to appear within the borders of Yudusk. &nbsp;A great calamity arrived in the region, and the name of Balserk gained notoriety…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balserk was like black curtain covering the region. &nbsp;All the people, who were called heroes at the time, were systematically killing the beings that were causing trouble. &nbsp;However, they couldn’t locate Balserk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As time passed, someone figured out the truth. &nbsp;Balserk was a Demon, who didn’t have a real body.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The process was very long and complex. &nbsp;The story of Balserk’s rise and end is known more to the people of Yudusk compared to any other heroic tales. &nbsp;It would take him forever to explain everything, so Carlos gave a summarized version.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the end, Balserk was caught and he was deposed. &nbsp;The hub of the chaos was gone, but peace didn’t return immediately… &nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, there was a period of 10 years where chaos reigned. &nbsp;A lot of blood flowed during this time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That summary is quite lackluster.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to listen to the whole story?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course not. &nbsp;I’m past the age where my eyes would shine from hearing an old story.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then shut up and listen. There’s a problem in this story. &nbsp;How did they depose Balserk?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Demons don’t have bodies. &nbsp;This is why it is impossible to kill them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so? &nbsp;However, aren’t there cases where the Demon and a Black magician merges?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It has been done before, but it just amounts to the Black magician receiving a several dozen seconds of uncontrolled boost before the host goes crazy. &nbsp;Moreover, it doesn’t mean the Demon is killed when the Black Magician is killed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black magicians usually didn’t think about the aftermath of their actions, so there were cases where they made a deal with a Demon to merge with them. &nbsp;The benefit lasted only for couple seconds. &nbsp;At most, the Black magician would have this surprising power for several dozen seconds before being destroyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unbeknownst to the two of them at the time, an exception would show up later. &nbsp;Yuren was surprisingly able to control the power he gained after connecting with a Demon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Basically, magicians need an address.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Address?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are countless number of Demons, and they all have no name. &nbsp;If one performed the Demon summoning ritual, a different Demon would show up each time. &nbsp;The summoner has to have a method to bring out a Demon, who has the specific knowledge that one needs….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was unknown as to how the Demon race had acquired their knowledge, but they weren’t all knowing. &nbsp;Each Demon possessed different knowledge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First, you have to find a suitable Demon to deal with. &nbsp;Then you need a way to summon them, and a contract is formed. &nbsp;Then the methodology needed for the Demon to find the magician is established. &nbsp;The magician also needs a way that would allow them to call out a specific Demon. &nbsp;Black magicians puts a lot of value on the Demon Codex.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A trial and error was needed to summon the right Demon. &nbsp;This process was very dangerous, so the Demon Codex containing knowledge about different Demons were coveted by Black magicians.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When the Black magician connected to the Demon is killed, the Demon cannot cut through the line to come to this world. &nbsp;The knowledge of summoning this specific Demon would fade from the world. &nbsp;That’s it. &nbsp;Demons do not have a real body, so they cannot die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If that is so, I’m assuming Balserk had formed contracts with numerous beings. &nbsp;Since he is gone, are you saying all the people, who knows how to call out Balserk is dead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maybe. &nbsp;However, that explanation doesn’t feel right. &nbsp;The situation surrounding Balserk was an oddity. &nbsp;Even if there were countless tales about heroes taking down the dark beings, the existence of Demons became known to the public. &nbsp;The reason why Demons were dangerous became known. &nbsp;That part is a bit strange.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The knowledge of magicians aren’t usually shared with the masses like this. &nbsp;The truth about the Demon race was spread through the story of Demon King Balserk. &nbsp;This knowledge was something that was guarded zealously by the Black magicians. &nbsp;Even if a knowledge was revealed to the public, there are parts that should have been redacted.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Above all, an unprecedented number of people found out about the Demon race through this story. &nbsp;Basically...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It means there would be more people, who would covet the power and knowledge. &nbsp;They would try to contact the Demon race.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why Balserk was the true Demon King. &nbsp;It purposefully spread the knowledge of the Demon race to entice more people down the path of destruction….</span></p>
