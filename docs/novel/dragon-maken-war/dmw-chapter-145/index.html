 <p>Chapter 145 - Heaven and Hell (1)</p>
 <p><span style>1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clouds of war were gathering at various locations on the continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The seven kingdoms had originated when an empire broke up, so they weren’t on best of terms. &nbsp;There was always tension along the border.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, no large war had been waged after the initial period of confusion. &nbsp;There had only been small border skirmishes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the Bijes kingdom and the Iellos kingdom had gathered their armies along the border, and it felt as if a single twitch could set off each side…. &nbsp;Similar situations were occurring &nbsp;in various locations around the continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Yudusk kingdom and the Garan kingdom were descended from the ancient royal line, so there was bad blood between them regarding the legitimacy of their lines. &nbsp;In the early period of chaos, those two kingdoms fought the fiercest battles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why the border between the two were very heated. &nbsp;However, the members of the Guardian Shadows worked in the political scene for three years to negotiate a cease-fire. &nbsp;However, the prince who was sent as an emissary was assassinated, so the fire of war was stoked..</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dailan kingdom’s king was poisoned with his successor not named. &nbsp;There were signs of civil war erupting in that kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Rulain kingdom and the Ralos kingdom had several recent incidents where the tension along the border between the two countries were at an all time high.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In such an atmosphere, Dragon Demon Princess Arrieta was dispatched when the Western Border Guards requested reinforcement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The Grand Alliance of Darkness is being revived.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>…it was an urgent news that had arrived from the Western Border Guards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A mutated Orc named Dakan had formed the Grand Alliance of Darkness around 30 years ago. &nbsp;It was a similar situation right now where a massive number of demonic creatures were attacking the Western Border Guards. &nbsp;They were somehow able to hold them off inside the fortress, but it said in the missive that they would fall if reinforcements weren’t provided soon. &nbsp;The Western Border Guards resided in a fortress outfitted specifically able to hold off a force that was of same size as the Grand Alliance of Darkness. &nbsp;However, a variable they had never accounted for had appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a Dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, the Water Dragon who lived in a lake deep with the forest had attacked them. &nbsp;After a fierce battle, they were able to repel the Dragon. &nbsp;However, the damage to the fortress had been heavy, and the Western Border Guards had taken heavy casualties.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was when a large horde of demonic beasts had attacked them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that the bastard?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arietta was on top of the fortress’ wall as she observed the enemy force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The throne had quickly dispatched 200 troops with her leading them. &nbsp;She was also given command of reinforcements sent from other regions. &nbsp;She had arrived at the Western Border Fortress with over 1,000 men.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, this was only the vanguard. &nbsp;The throne was gathering more troops even at that moment. &nbsp;However, when the reinforcement had arrived, the castle wall was in horrible shape. &nbsp;It would be a tall task to be able to ward off 10,000 demonic beasts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is big enough to make me doubt if it really is an orc.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles was next to Arrieta. He had already risen in rank, and he was firmly entrenched in his position as her lieutenant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is as Azell had said before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They have a way to mobilize a dragon, and all these schemes are being hatched by the Dragon Demon King worshippers…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta was dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cloud of war hanging over the continent was all manufactured by the Plain of Darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta and Giles was aware of this truth. &nbsp;As they were taught techniques under the tutelage of Azell and Kairen, they had learned a lot about the Dragon Demon king worshippers from them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They have superb bodies, and their intelligence is on par with humans. &nbsp;They have the charisma to make other demonic beasts obey them. &nbsp;Then there are the ones with enough magical energy to be on par with Dragon Majins. &nbsp;These types of Orcs were used quite often in the Dragon Demon war. &nbsp;&nbsp;It was surmised that the secret to making them was with Aunsaurus….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had told Laura about the mutated Orcs. &nbsp;One had been used to lure Seigar into the County of Baldan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when she arrived at this location, she found that Falkan possessed more power than the previous mutated orc named Dakan</span></p>
 <p><span style>It showed martial skills that could easily break through the knights of the Western Border patrol, and it didn’t end there…... &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shwee… &nbsp;Kwah-kwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A sound of an explosion rang out from below as the walls shook.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was enough force to be mistaken for a high rank magician’s spell. &nbsp;However, the impact had surprisingly come from a single arrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A mere Orc is a magical archer? &nbsp;I’m so surprised that I don’t know what to say.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta expressed her amazement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Surprisingly, Faikan was shooting magic arrows. &nbsp;It was infused with magical energy that was on par with that of a Dragon Majin. &nbsp;It was using an enormous long bow that couldn’t be used by humans, and it had great accuracy with the weapon. &nbsp;It also had destructive capability on par with a high rank magician.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had already killed double digits in troops with its sniping. &nbsp;The Orc was a nightmare-like existence to the Western Border Guards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shweee… &nbsp;Puh-uhng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another arrow flew towards them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it wasn't able to reach the fortress wall this time around. &nbsp;It exploded in midair. &nbsp;Arrieta had used her technique to shoot down the incoming arrow from afar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The light in Faikan’s eyes changed. &nbsp;Instead of aiming for Arrieta, it continuously shot towards various locations along the wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Puh-uhng! Pah-pahng! Pah-ah-ahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was useless. &nbsp;All of the attacks except the first arrow was intercepted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if Arietta was reading Faikan’s mind. &nbsp;When it found a new target to shoot, she used Instantaneous Movement to appear at the target. &nbsp;She used her Dragon Arts to intercept them. Moreover…….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh Evil Darkness, Rend Apart!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She shouted the words of power as a white light erupted from the sword she had stabbed into the empty air. &nbsp;Faikan threw away its bow in shock as it raised its sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwahhhhhh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Surprisingly, her attacked had reached a target that was 100 meters away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was something Arietta hadn’t been able to do before. &nbsp;However, when she learned the forgotten techniques from Azell, her inner reservoir of qi had drastically increased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected, I didn’t expect it to stay still.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta mumbled to herself as she let out a cold laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-uh! &nbsp;You dare defy me, little bitch!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faikan got on the body of an Ogre that was stationed below the fortress wall. &nbsp;When given the command by the orc, the Ogre grabbed and threw the Orc towards the top of the fortress wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a tactic that was feasible, because the Ogre possessed great size and strength. &nbsp;However, Arrieta wasn’t taken unawares by the move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cha-ahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faikan’s enormous sword clashed against Arrieta’s pure white sword. &nbsp;Faikan was shocked. &nbsp;It had used the momentum of its flight to unleash a powerful sword strike, but Arrieta easily deflected it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t because Arrieta was strong. &nbsp;When their swords touched, an explosive and repulsive force was created using Dragon Demon magic, and Faikan was flung away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are better than expected.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faikan smoothly neutralized the repulsive force to land on top of the castle wall. &nbsp;Arrieta broke out in cold sweat when she saw this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I cannot believe how much skill this Orc has. &nbsp;My previous self would have a hard time facing it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was able to extrapolate that fact from just a single exchange. &nbsp;Faikan possessed martial prowess that exceeded her previous self.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Orc, you will hate yourself for overestimating your own ability. &nbsp;I’ll end the 2nd Grand Alliance of Darkness here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph! &nbsp;A weak bitch like you should know your place before you speak such words! &nbsp;I’ll sever your head right now, and I’ll open the gates to this fortress!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faikan spoke eloquently in the human tongue as it once again attacked Arrieta.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was how she confronted the 2nd Grand Alliance of Darkness, and the battle at the Western Border Fortress intensified.</span></p>
 <p><span style>2</span></p>
 <p><span style>After running away from Reygus, Azell’s party headed eastward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had lost to Reygus, but the enemy force had been decimated. &nbsp;However, the problem was the fact that the enemy’s reinforcement was coming. &nbsp;When Reygus joined with the reinforcement, it was obvious that they would start tracking down Azell’s party. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the party couldn’t move as quickly as they would have liked even in such a desperate situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had fought a fierce battle, so the party was tired and wounded. &nbsp;Moreover, Azell was hovering between life and death right now. &nbsp;It restricted their mobility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, the party had moved for an hour before they decided to rest and apply first aid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren had used magic to move Azell in an attempt to reduce any turbulence. &nbsp;He carefully placed Azell on the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, now…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren turned to look at Laura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll go first. &nbsp;You should mediate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura nodded her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were quite fortunate in the fact that there were two high rank black magicians within their party. &nbsp;Since there were no healers inside the party, no one could heal wounds aside from Yuren and Laura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should use this potion. I only have two bottles left.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen took out healing potions from within his armor, and he hand them over to Yuren. Originally, he had several more bottles, but they broke during battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren asked him a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone is injured. &nbsp;Shouldn’t you be using it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is best to use it on the person with the most serious wounds.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s true, but….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Use it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen was firm with his words, then he approached Leticia.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll take turns resting. &nbsp;You should meditate first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll do so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia acquiesced to his words. &nbsp;It was because her injuries were more serious than his.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren scratched his head as he unstoppered the potion bottle. &nbsp;He started pouring the liquid into Azell’s wounds. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-ook…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell groaned in his unconscious state. &nbsp;The healing potion disinfected his wounds, so it hurt when it was applied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he wasn’t showing any signs of waking up. &nbsp;Yuren took a deep breaths as he looked carefully over Azell’s wounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s see…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren put one hand against a large tree, and he place his other hand on top of Azell’s chest. &nbsp;Soon, an ominous energy arose from Yuren as rapid change occurred to the tree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pa-sah-sahk….</span></p>
 <p><span style>The tree, which was as twice as thick and thrice as tall as Yuren, was rapidly drying up. &nbsp;The thick leaves dried up as it fell away, and the branches became emaciated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren’s black magic was stealing life energy from the tree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren used some of the energy on his body, then he poured the rest into Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was a black magician, so he didn’t have subtle techniques like the healers. &nbsp;However, he could steal life energy to increase the survivability of one’s body, and it could imbue unnaturally fast regenerative ability. &nbsp;That was all he could do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this kind of healing skill needed extreme caution. &nbsp;It was less effective to use it on someone else, and the risk also increased. &nbsp;If Yuren transferred too much power, Azell’s body might break down instead of healing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected… &nbsp;The the healing effect using the life energy of a tree is quite meager.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Should I go catch something?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you leave your post, it’ll be hard for us to fight off an ambush from our enemies. &nbsp;Let’s ask them to do it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren swept his hand towards the surrounding as he pointed out the hazy shapes.</span></p>
