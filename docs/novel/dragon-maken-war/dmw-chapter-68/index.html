 <p><span style>Chapter 68 - Dragon Weapon Producers (2)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm having a hard time remembering the content of the book I read... &nbsp;Do you perhaps know what happened to Rogan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He passed away. &nbsp;It happened before I was born.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even for the Dragon Demon race, 220 years was a long time. &nbsp;They lived much longer than a human, but their lifespan was between 300 to 500 years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell put on a bitter smile at the answer. His foolish anticipation had made his heart pound, and he found it to be ridiculous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Havanz spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are late, Duke. We were worried about you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I ran into an accident in the middle of the trip.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It would have been great if you could have sent word ahead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wasn’t in the right frame of mind. &nbsp;Moreover, I'm late, because my friend here is weaker than I had anticipated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are using a guest as an excuse. &nbsp;That is beyond lame. It is very rare for you to bring a guest. &nbsp;I am the one in charge of managing the household of Duke Tarantos. &nbsp;I am the butler, Havanz. &nbsp;I welcome you the the Tarantos castle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My name is Azell Zestringer. &nbsp;I'm a knight. &nbsp;It is a pleasure to meet you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell's voice shook slightly. &nbsp;Havanz's voice also reminded him of Rogan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Havanz spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You possess the same name as the legendary hero. &nbsp;It seems your parents were very well versed in history. &nbsp;They named you as a Zestringer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know about that name?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know it quite well. &nbsp;My grandfather had fought alongside the hero Azell Karzark.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Havanz put on a smile. Azell looked at Havanz with a complicated expression when Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let's head in first. &nbsp;Please ready a room for our friend, Havanz. &nbsp;Please show him that the Dukedom of Tarantos isn't lacking compared to the capital.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I infer from your words, it seems he was a guest of the throne. &nbsp;Understood. &nbsp;Also, we've stocked your office. &nbsp;We readied it for your return.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm. Did you put a lot of effort into it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can probably look forward to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don't know why my steward is so insolent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is thanks to the Duke relaxing the family customs. &nbsp;Now, now. Many people are waiting for the Duke.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Those are unwelcoming news.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell couldn't suppress his laughter when he caught sight of Kairen's expression. &nbsp;He looked like a child, who didn't want to do his homework.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, his expression changed at Havanz's next words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Count Michael is here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That old fart is already here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are of the same age as him. &nbsp;He'll feel very disappointed if you spoke that way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm still young, so it's ok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>3</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was able to meet Kairen once again at dinner time. &nbsp;A servant appeared to deliver the dinner invitation, and Azell followed the servant to the dining room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen wasn't waiting alone in the dining room. &nbsp;After waking up in this era, this magician was the oldest Dragon Majin he had encountered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sit. Today's dinner is something the chef wanted to boast for a fortnight, so you can look forward to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I look forward to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is Count Beorein Michael. He is a foul-tempered old man. &nbsp;He also likes to be called Rulain Kingdom's Eastern Guardian. &nbsp;However, you don't have to remember the latter part, since it is all empty reputation. It'll become tiresome if you humor him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I admit my temper isn't that great, but there is no way my temper is bad as yours, Kairen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beorein let out a snort. &nbsp;He looked at Azell as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young friend. &nbsp;This is the first time I've met you, but I can already tell we will get along very well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My name is Azell Zestringer. &nbsp;I am a knight. &nbsp;It is an honor for a high ranked magician to speak to me like this. &nbsp;If you don't mind me asking, what basis do you have that we will get along?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard you gave the inner old geezer a good fight? &nbsp;I'm glad you punched that old geezer, who is always on his high horse. &nbsp;That's the only reason I need to like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The inner old geezer is…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was able to suppress his laughter through great effort when he heard the expression. &nbsp;Kairen countered with his words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn't it better than looking old on the outside? &nbsp;If you aged gracefully, you won't hear such words from me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is why I like this friend, who got one over you. &nbsp;I’m like this, because you speak like that. &nbsp;Also, the fact that he gave a bitter taste to Niberis of the Dragon Demon race is a bonus in his favor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm also part of the Guardian Shadow. &nbsp;Do I need to explain more?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beorein Michael was a powerful magician, and he was a person of interest to those in the Field of Darkness. &nbsp;He was known as the best magician in the Rulain Kingdom, and he had the title of Archmage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beorein spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I chased after them before they exited our country. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I lost them. I was able to kill two underlings... &nbsp;Their runaway skill were exquisite.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maybe your skills were lacking?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke in a sarcastic manner. Beorein furrowed his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why do you always have to talk like that? &nbsp;Also, didn’t you fail to catch them, when you had them in your sight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My aim was to save Arrieta. &nbsp;My goal wasn't to catch them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, the excuse is no surprise, coming from you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beorein clicked his tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This conversation is making me lose my appetite. &nbsp;Let's talk after the dinner. How's our hospitality?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is on par with what I experienced at the royal palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell's compliment was the truth. &nbsp;The Tarantos castle had treated him incredibly well. The guest room that was given to him was nice, and the servants were incredibly meticulous in their work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen was satisfied with the answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You'll soon find out about our chef's skill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His words were true. &nbsp;The Tarantos Castle's chef brought out his secret new item for the main course. &nbsp;Azell felt very happy as he ate his meal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>4</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the dinner, the three of them retired to Kairen's office.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beorein asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you really going to make a Dragon Weapon for that young friend?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I meant what I said.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, the ingredients are all prepared, so we can do it... This is the first time I've seen you show favoritism to someone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn't as if I want to show favoritism to him. &nbsp;He isn't one of my people, but I lost a bet with him. &nbsp;I have no choice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are making him a Dragon Weapon just from losing some sparring matches. &nbsp;If this fact was spread, swordsmen from all over the country would come here to find you with their torches lit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beorein was talking about the Dragon Sword Kairen used when he spoke about the Dragon Weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was one of figures, who had come up with the method of producing the Dragon Sword with Kairen. &nbsp;Moreover, he also had a Dragon Weapon of his own.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had asked for a favor that was equivalent to all the matches he had won against Kairen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell wanted Kairen to make him a Dragon Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was related to the request he had given to Arrieta. &nbsp;Azell had asked Arrieta to gather all the ingredients need to make a Dragon Weapon from the Dragon's corpse located at the Balan forest. &nbsp;Arrieta gladly granted his request, and the ingredients listed by Kairen had arrived at the Tarantos Castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, I think it is worth investing in him. &nbsp;I want to verify if what he says is true.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you talking about the Dragon Slayer's Ritual?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmm…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, if you don't like this idea, you can always test it out yourself. A Dragon Majin can also be the beneficiary of the Ritual. &nbsp;If it is you, you'll be able to come out victorious against a one-on-one battle with a Dragon. &nbsp;It isn't as if it is impossible. &nbsp;If you are successful, you'll earn the power of a Dragon. &nbsp;Isn't that a gamble worth doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll decline. &nbsp;I can't believe you are suggesting me to do such a crazy thing. &nbsp;It seems you are itching to push me into my grave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beorein was called the strongest magician of this kingdom, yet he wouldn't fight one-on-one against a dragon based on an unreliable information. He grumbled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I like this guy, but why does he want to do such a crazy thing? &nbsp;Of course, a Spirit Order practitioner probably has a better chance of winning than a magician. &nbsp;This is assuming the magician and the Spirit Order practitioner are of similar quality.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dragons were a very bad opponent for a magician. A Dragon's magic was something that couldn't even be compared to what the Dragon Demon race used. &nbsp;A Dragon had a direct control over nature. &nbsp;This was why their resistance to magic was incredibly high. &nbsp;Even a magician like Beorein wouldn’t be able to use elemental magics like flame, cold air or thunder. &nbsp;It wasn't effective at all against a Dragon. &nbsp;Moreover……</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dragons can steal spells, and it can be used against a magician.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmm. &nbsp;You are very knowledgeable about Dragons.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beorein was surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dragons showed an extraordinary amount of intelligence when they faced humans. The Dragons understood the language of humans. &nbsp;They even comprehended the techniques used against them, and they adapted to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The problem was the huge disadvantage a magician possessed when fighting a Dragon. &nbsp;When the magician used an element controlled by the Dragon, the Dragon could mimic the magician’s magic. &nbsp;The Dragon would send back the mage’s spell. &nbsp;This was why there was a prevalent theory amongst the magicians that Dragons had the ability to read a human's visual cue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn't too different for a Spirit Order practitioner when facing a Dragon. &nbsp;If one uses a technique that can be mimicked by a Dragon, Spirit Order practitioners can suffer the same fate as Magicians. &nbsp;This is why one has to make preparations from the beginning.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Preparations? &nbsp;What kind?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If we consider the theory spoken by the Duke to be true, one would have to guard one's visual cue from being read.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Azell fought the Earth Dragon, he had a set of rules he followed strictly. Even during the Dragon Demon war, the ecology of the Dragon had a lot of holes. However, the hypothesis of a Dragon reading a human's visual cue existed back then too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Carlos had confirmed this theory. &nbsp;This was why when he went through the Dragon Slayer's ritual, he used several techniques that allowed him a measure of defense against the Dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beorein asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then one will will be able to win against a Dragon if one uses such methods?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn't a guarantee. &nbsp;However, it is the minimum criteria one has to follow to win.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm. &nbsp;I asked the wrong question. I’m talking about you... &nbsp;If you gain a Dragon Weapon, will you be able to win against a Dragon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can't win against a Dragon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell gave a firm answer. &nbsp;Beorein was taken aback, and he looked towards Kairen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn't this incongruous with what you told me earlier?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He isn't done talking. &nbsp;Why don't you just listen to what he has to say until the end? &nbsp;This is the problem with old farts like him. &nbsp;He’s impatient.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen made fun of Beorein, and Beorein’s face crumpled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell let out a bitter laugh as he asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you heard from the Duke about our travels?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The person called the Keeper of the prophecy, and the Undeads showed up in the guise of carrying out a test.... &nbsp;That's what I heard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have any knowledge about them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don't have much information about them. &nbsp;However, I've seen the Undead named Delta before. &nbsp;He's the one, who fought with Kairen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you mean the Dragon Demon Undead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. Mmmm…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beorein searched through his memories.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It happened around 20 years ago. &nbsp;I was trying to catch a Dragon Demon, who had stepped out of the Field of Darkness. The Dragon Demon was very strong, and to tell you the truth, I was barely handling him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The fact that you are speaking about it in such a manner means he was that strong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen asked in surprise. &nbsp;Beorein nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First, shall I tell you about the woman named Niberis? I was in the position of advantage when I was chasing her. &nbsp;However, the result of a one-on-one battle with her would be a coin flip. If one considered only the Dragon Demon magic, she was almost on par with you. &nbsp;She performed advanced magic, but she was still very inexperienced in how she used...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm. &nbsp;I've already heard you tell that story. &nbsp;I thought that woman had nothing to do with the incident 20 years ago?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This will be easier if you have a reference point to compare. &nbsp;The Dragon Demon I was chasing was much stronger than Niberis. &nbsp;She couldn't hold a candle to him. &nbsp;If one considered his Dragon Demon Magic, he was almost on par with a Dragon. &nbsp;Can you comprehend what I'm trying to say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? You are surely over-exaggerating it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn't an exaggeration. It was as I said. &nbsp;He fought me, my disciples and 30 other Guardian Shadow Members. &nbsp;He was actually prevailing over us. &nbsp;At that moment, a being appeared, and it was Delta. &nbsp;To be precise, the Keeper of Prophecy contacted the Undeads from afar. &nbsp;After being contacted, three Undeads appeared. &nbsp;It was Beta, Gamma and Delta.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three Undeads had left an indelible impression on Beorein. However, even they couldn't gain an upperhand against the Dragon Demon, who was surrounded by ominous Dragon Demon magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the battle, Beta and Gamma was exterminated. &nbsp;Delta was the only one that survived, and he returned to the Keeper of the Prophecy. &nbsp;That is all I know regarding them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Basically, I crushed the skull of your benefactor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To make up for it, Duke's eye was...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop right there. &nbsp;Shut your mouth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ho-oh. &nbsp;It seems you left out something in your story. &nbsp;It sounds very interesting....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don't try to find out more about it. &nbsp;Azell. &nbsp;If you say anything, then I’ll talk about the time you were sleeping... &nbsp;You get what I'm saying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blackmailed Azell clicked his tongue as if it was unfortunate that he wouldn't be able to tell the story.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beorein snickered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, I don't know the whole story, but it seems my friend here suffered some kind of indignity. &nbsp;Well, all right. &nbsp;Even as someone inside the Guardian Shadows, I knew that the Keeper of the Prophecy and his associates were a bit on the weird side. &nbsp;Moreover, you are one of the candidates that they consider to be important.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don't know why. &nbsp;They kept referring me as the person in the prophecy, but I don't know the content of the prophecy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I do not know the content either. &nbsp;That is a problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I had my way, I would shake them by their neck to get them to talk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel the same way regarding that point. Their curtain of secrecy is a bit too strange. &nbsp;It's been several dozen years for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beorein grumbled. &nbsp;Kairen was also unsatisfied as a member of the Guardian Shadows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems our conversation got sidetracked. &nbsp;Mmm. &nbsp;The reason I spoke about that... In the end, the reason I lost at the time is the same reason why I won't be able to win against a Dragon. If one wants to win against a Dragon, one needs more than techniques. &nbsp;One needs strength.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a Spirit Order practitioner, one had to go through the Dragon Slayer's Ritual to truly break past one's limit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, one had to have the power to win against a Dragon without the benefit of the Dragon Slayer's ritual. &nbsp;If one was at that level, one was already at a stage where one would be able to win against a Dragon Demon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the dilemma faced by the high rank Spirit Order Practitioners of Azell's era. &nbsp;To earn the absolute power, one already had to possess what was considered to be absolute power by human standard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“With my current strength, there is no way I can go through the Dragon Slayer's Ritual. &nbsp;I'll most definitely die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmm. So this won't be solved by you gaining a Dragon Weapon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what are your plans?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have to focus on my training for a short amount of time. I'll continue until I reach an acceptable level.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…that's all you need to do? It isn’t that easy to gain the power you lack.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beorein started to give council to Azell. &nbsp;He was a magician, but he had a lot of knowledge about the Spirit Order. &nbsp;He knew that the quantity of magical energy for a Spirit Order Practitioner couldn't be increased dramatically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Azell was full of confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll prove it to you through the result. &nbsp;Currently, that is all I can say to assure you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For reference, Azell had done a lot of things after we woke up, but it had only been two months.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In such a short amount of time, Azell had made three Rings of Life. &nbsp;Moreover, with his own secret technique, he was able to add the Dual Banding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, this had been possible, because he went through the Dragon Slayer's Ritual. &nbsp;Moreover, he had absorbed the Dragon Demon Qi left behind by Carlos. &nbsp;Still, he hadn't had the time to really train, and build up his body. &nbsp;His progress had been amazing considering the amount of abuse his body had suffered in battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was inevitable, but anyone who had fought Azell had wondered why he had so little magic. &nbsp;As a Spirit Order practitioner, one’s magic was proportional to one's skill. &nbsp;It increased in a rising curve.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When one moved up the stages of Spirit Order, it meant one's ability to control magic had gone up. &nbsp;It allowed one to be able to control more magic in marvelous ways. &nbsp;This allowed one to strengthen one's Energy Pulse, strengthen the bowl holding one’s magic and increase the number of Ring of LIfe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, Azell had eight Rings of LIfe. &nbsp;He had been an Octuple Master. &nbsp;If given enough time, he was confident he would be able to exceed his former self even without the Dragon Slayer's ritual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beorein spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm. &nbsp;All right. I'll put my trust in your for now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was how they decided to manufacture the Dragon Sword for Azell.</span></p>
