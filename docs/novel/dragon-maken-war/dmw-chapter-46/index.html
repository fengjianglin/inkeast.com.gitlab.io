  <p><span style>Chapter 46 - Dragon Demon Duke (3)</span></p>
  <p></p>
  <hr>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>Azell asked a question.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Didn't you already hear about me from the princess??”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I did. This is the first time I've seen the child be so chatty. This must mean you’ve left a big impression on her.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta, in Kairen's memory, was a girl of few words. Moreover, she hadn't shown much interest in anyone except her family.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta, being such a girl, showed a surprising amount of interest towards Azell. She excitedly spoke about Azell like a regular girl at her age. From Kairen's perspective, it was a really weird experience.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Arrieta makes very good judgement of character. I've taught her how to assess others while excluding her feelings. However, when I hear about you from her, she is telling me some stories that are hard to believe.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What do you mean?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“For example… The part where you have partial amnesia?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Suddenly, he felt a strong overpowering feeling coming from Kairen. If he was a normal person, he probably would have stopped breathing. It wouldn't be strange if a normal person passed out from the pressure.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The scary thing was the overpowering feeling was only focused on Azell. When he realized Kairen wasn't affect anything else in his surrounding, Azell admired him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘He's good.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell had been very disappointed after he woke up in this age. He hadn't met anyone, who properly cultivated one's ability through actual battles.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The exceptions were his enemies, Niberis and Duran. Niberis had the skill to back up her claim as a high rank magician, and Duran was a properly trained Spirit Order Practitioner.</span></p>
  <p><span style>To Azell, Kairen also seemed to be on par with Niberis and Duran. He possessed strong Dragon Demon magic but he also used high level techniques as if they were nothing.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kairen was surprised more than Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘What kind of a person is this bastard?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>He had poured out enough pressure to kill a human, yet Azell hadn't responded at all.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It wasn't as if Azell was countering his pressure. It was as if the pressure didn't exist at all and Azell was letting it all flow past him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kairen was over 100 years old, but he had never seen someone respond to his pressure this way.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Still, this one move revealed that Azell possessed enough skill, and it made Kairen interested in him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell replied.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Didn't you hear an ample amount of explanation from Arrieta?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I heard it.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“So why are you being so suspicious of me?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No matter how I see it, you are hiding too many things.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kairen had spoken to Arrieta. He had also listened to Giles, Boar, and Enora talk about Azell. He heard all that had happened since Azell had been discovered inside the Balan forest.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The more Kairen listened to the story, the more he realized that he knew nothing about him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He wasn't suspicious as to whether Azell was an enemy. Azell's attitude up until now gave him a clear-cut answer. Kairen was worried since he couldn't understand Azell's true character.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell asked a question.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What do you think I'm trying to hide?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“A lot of things. First, it's your Dragon Demon magic.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>When Arrieta first saw Azell, she had wondered why a human had the scent of Dragon Demon magic. Moreover, the scent of the Dragon Demon magic given off by Azell was much stronger than before. Kairen was able to detect it since he was sensitive to the smell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Moreover… I heard about the story detailing the Dragon Slayer's Ritual.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I'll just ask you a point-blank question. Did you kill the Dragon?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell didn't immediately answer the question and kept his silence.</span></p>
  <p><span style>4</span></p>
  <p><span style>After glaring at Azell for a moment, Kairen continued speaking.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I've fought with Dragons before. I've fought three of them.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was very rare for a Dragon to show up in human territories. When they did show up, it mostly led to catastrophes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>When Dragons and humans fought, humans had always come out victorious. However, humans had to insert a massive amount of troops. It was a hollow victory that required massive sacrifice and damage to the troops.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kairen had the ability to contain such a situation. When the calamity called a Dragon had appeared, Kairen gladly stepped forward to minimize the damage.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If I see through the prism of my experience... I find it hard to believe you killed a Dragon.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>He acknowledged Azell possessed superb techniques as a Spirit Order Practitioner.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, one cannot kill a Dragon with just techniques.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Even if an old man could master a technique to defeat a healthy young man, could he destroy a castle wall with it?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell queried.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Did you hear my explanation regarding that incident?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You said another Dragon appeared to kill the Dragon. Isn't that what you said?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Since the Dragon is dead, that must be the most compelling answer. It's impossible for you to have killed the Dragon. Therefore, you drew the attention of the Dragon then you desperately ran away. Then you entered into a different Dragon's territory, and the Dragons started to fight...”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell thought along the same line, so he had given such an excuse. The story was a bit too fantastic, so it was a dubious explanation. However, who could argue with the result of what had happened? It wasn't as if Azell was making up a story to distinguish himself. What can someone say when the story entailed a Dragon killing another Dragon?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I've heard about the Dragon Slayer's Ritual from somewhere before.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Is that so?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I just didn't know what it was. No one in my acquaintances know what it truly means. There aren't any decent records left. Whenever I saw it mentioned, it was 'Someone had initiated the Dragon Slayer's Ritual.' That was the extent of what was recorded in the records. I can only guess the ritual entails killing a dragon because it says so in the name.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell listened carefully to Kairen's words. He was giving out precious information.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘He had killed dragons before yet he doesn't know about the Dragon Slayer's Ritual? He isn't even human. He is a Dragon Demon with over a hundred years under his belt yet... Hmm, from which point in time did the chain of knowledge break?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Now Azell could surmise that the severance of knowledge couldn't simply be explained by a historical event. From the conversation he had with Niberis, he could surmise the Dragon Demon King's worshippers had intentionally engineered such a result.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kairen continued to speak.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yet you knew all about it.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Moreover… The Dragon's Shadow's female magician, Niberis, made a big deal about you knowing this fact.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“She did.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“This is why I'm suspicious of a possibility.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What possibility?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The possibility that you might have a hidden backer.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“A backer?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was a bit taken aback, since he hadn't thought Kairen would come up with such an explanation.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What if there is a hidden backer powerful enough to slay the Dragon? What if this was all planned out by him, and he sent you to Arrieta?"</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…Do you like conspiracy theories?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I don't like them. However, akin to the Dragon Demon King's worshippers, there are hidden evil forces who try to influence the world from the darkness..”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kairen hadn’t suspected that Azell was a pawn of the Dragon's Shadow, the main reasoning being because Kairen had already suspected the goal behind the Dragon's Shadow attempted kidnapping of Arrieta.</span></p>
  <p><span style>If he was right about the reason behind the abduction, Azell had no reason to protect her. He would have struck from behind early on.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Still, it doesn't guarantee you aren't part of some dangerous plot. You might be affiliated with another organization of Dragon Demon King worshippers, who is competing against the Dragon's Shadow.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmmm. How should I say this…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell scratched his head.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If you think about everyone in those terms, then you should be suspicious of every person in the world.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Do you think you are in the same category as everyone else?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If you insist there are hidden hands that work without the notice of the entire world, I agree it does make me look a little bit more suspicious. However, no matter how I try I won't be able to shed your suspicions. Even if I die in the process of protecting the princess, I wouldn't be able to shed the suspicion on me. I might be treated as someone who died by mistake while trying to hatch a plot.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It's been awhile since someone had the guts to make sarcastic remarks in front of me.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I guess you prefer men who empty their head and agree with everything the Duke says. Men who would agree with you even if you said the sun rises from the west.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Both of them were laughing, but the atmosphere worsened. The pressure emitted by Kairen was kicked up a notch. However, Azell took it nonchalantly, and he started baiting Kairen. It was as if Azell was telling Kairen to try hitting him once if Kairen's temper got the better of him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kairen was the first one to back off. He withdrew his pressure, then he relaxed his expression.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…Well, all right. My words were a little harsh. I'll acknowledge that.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That was unexpected.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmmm?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I thought you would at least hit me once as a test.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Then you would send a counter, while saying 'I got you, you bastard'? You purposefully showed a hole in your defense. You also have a very twisted personality.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It isn't something I want to hear from you. I've heard from princess that you are famous for having a twisted personality.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You are arrogant. You are a pup that doesn't know how scary the world is.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kairen snorted. He had a youthful appearance, but Kairen naturally acted like an old man. It wasn't just because he was over a hundred years old. He held a position that was respected by everyone.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Suddenly, Kairen put on a serious expression.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Just know this. I'm currently in a position where I have to consider every absurd conspiracy theories, as if they might happen in reality. The actions of the Dragon Demon King's followers can't be understood by conventional means, since they are lunatics.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell now knew why Kairen insisted on hiding their conversation from Arrieta. He didn't want to force his suspicions on her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After a brief silence, Kairen spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I hope you can share one thing with me. Tell me about the Dragon Slayer's Ritual.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Didn't you already hear about it from the princess?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“A human and a Dragon fights one-on-one to the death. Then, the winner takes something from the defeated side. The human gets the Dragon's strength, and the Dragon gets the human's wisdom.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Correct.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“How does that make any sense?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kairen couldn't accept it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Each region had rituals with some spiritual meaning behind it. They were a product of the region's environment and history.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Such cultural rituals gained significance between the gap in knowledge within society.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was quite absurd to Kairen that there existed a ritual between the humans and Dragons. It would have made sense if a magician and a specific Dragon performed the ritual after making a contract. However, this was a shared ritual where an unknown number of humans and Dragons could participate in it unconditionally. How could such a pact exist?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell stroked his chin.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hmmm. If I give you an explanation regarding the topic, then what will you give me in return?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You dare ask for something back when you are just answering my question?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I trust you are a fair person, since you are princess' teacher. There is worth to knowledge. Isn't that so?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kairen furrowed his brows as he let out a sound of frustration at Azell's words.</span></p>

 <p><span style>The scary thing was the overpowering feeling was only focused on Azell. When he realized Kairen wasn't affect anything else in his surrounding, Azell admired him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He's good.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had been very disappointed after he woke up in this age. He hadn't met anyone, who properly cultivated one's ability through actual battles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The exceptions were his enemies, Niberis and Duran. Niberis had the skill to back up her claim as a high rank magician, and Duran was a properly trained Spirit Order Practitioner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To Azell, Kairen also seemed to be on par with Niberis and Duran. He possessed strong Dragon Demon magic but he also used high level techniques as if they were nothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen was surprised more than Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What kind of a person is this bastard?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had poured out enough pressure to kill a human, yet Azell hadn't responded at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn't as if Azell was countering his pressure. It was as if the pressure didn't exist at all and Azell was letting it all flow past him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen was over 100 years old, but he had never seen someone respond to his pressure this way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, this one move revealed that Azell possessed enough skill, and it made Kairen interested in him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn't you hear an ample amount of explanation from Arrieta?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So why are you being so suspicious of me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No matter how I see it, you are hiding too many things.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen had spoken to Arrieta. He had also listened to Giles, Boar, and Enora talk about Azell. He heard all that had happened since Azell had been discovered inside the Balan forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more Kairen listened to the story, the more he realized that he knew nothing about him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn't suspicious as to whether Azell was an enemy. Azell's attitude up until now gave him a clear-cut answer. Kairen was worried since he couldn't understand Azell's true character.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think I'm trying to hide?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A lot of things. First, it's your Dragon Demon magic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Arrieta first saw Azell, she had wondered why a human had the scent of Dragon Demon magic. Moreover, the scent of the Dragon Demon magic given off by Azell was much stronger than before. Kairen was able to detect it since he was sensitive to the smell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Moreover… I heard about the story detailing the Dragon Slayer's Ritual.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll just ask you a point-blank question. Did you kill the Dragon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell didn't immediately answer the question and kept his silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>4</span></p>
 <p><span style>After glaring at Azell for a moment, Kairen continued speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I've fought with Dragons before. I've fought three of them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was very rare for a Dragon to show up in human territories. When they did show up, it mostly led to catastrophes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Dragons and humans fought, humans had always come out victorious. However, humans had to insert a massive amount of troops. It was a hollow victory that required massive sacrifice and damage to the troops.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen had the ability to contain such a situation. When the calamity called a Dragon had appeared, Kairen gladly stepped forward to minimize the damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I see through the prism of my experience... I find it hard to believe you killed a Dragon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He acknowledged Azell possessed superb techniques as a Spirit Order Practitioner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, one cannot kill a Dragon with just techniques.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if an old man could master a technique to defeat a healthy young man, could he destroy a castle wall with it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell queried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you hear my explanation regarding that incident?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You said another Dragon appeared to kill the Dragon. Isn't that what you said?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since the Dragon is dead, that must be the most compelling answer. It's impossible for you to have killed the Dragon. Therefore, you drew the attention of the Dragon then you desperately ran away. Then you entered into a different Dragon's territory, and the Dragons started to fight...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell thought along the same line, so he had given such an excuse. The story was a bit too fantastic, so it was a dubious explanation. However, who could argue with the result of what had happened? It wasn't as if Azell was making up a story to distinguish himself. What can someone say when the story entailed a Dragon killing another Dragon?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I've heard about the Dragon Slayer's Ritual from somewhere before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just didn't know what it was. No one in my acquaintances know what it truly means. There aren't any decent records left. Whenever I saw it mentioned, it was 'Someone had initiated the Dragon Slayer's Ritual.' That was the extent of what was recorded in the records. I can only guess the ritual entails killing a dragon because it says so in the name.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell listened carefully to Kairen's words. He was giving out precious information.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He had killed dragons before yet he doesn't know about the Dragon Slayer's Ritual? He isn't even human. He is a Dragon Demon with over a hundred years under his belt yet... Hmm, from which point in time did the chain of knowledge break?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now Azell could surmise that the severance of knowledge couldn't simply be explained by a historical event. From the conversation he had with Niberis, he could surmise the Dragon Demon King's worshippers had intentionally engineered such a result.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen continued to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yet you knew all about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Moreover… The Dragon's Shadow's female magician, Niberis, made a big deal about you knowing this fact.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She did.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is why I'm suspicious of a possibility.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What possibility?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The possibility that you might have a hidden backer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A backer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was a bit taken aback, since he hadn't thought Kairen would come up with such an explanation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What if there is a hidden backer powerful enough to slay the Dragon? What if this was all planned out by him, and he sent you to Arrieta?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…Do you like conspiracy theories?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don't like them. However, akin to the Dragon Demon King's worshippers, there are hidden evil forces who try to influence the world from the darkness..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen hadn’t suspected that Azell was a pawn of the Dragon's Shadow, the main reasoning being because Kairen had already suspected the goal behind the Dragon's Shadow attempted kidnapping of Arrieta.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he was right about the reason behind the abduction, Azell had no reason to protect her. He would have struck from behind early on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still, it doesn't guarantee you aren't part of some dangerous plot. You might be affiliated with another organization of Dragon Demon King worshippers, who is competing against the Dragon's Shadow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm. How should I say this…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell scratched his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you think about everyone in those terms, then you should be suspicious of every person in the world.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think you are in the same category as everyone else?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you insist there are hidden hands that work without the notice of the entire world, I agree it does make me look a little bit more suspicious. However, no matter how I try I won't be able to shed your suspicions. Even if I die in the process of protecting the princess, I wouldn't be able to shed the suspicion on me. I might be treated as someone who died by mistake while trying to hatch a plot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It's been awhile since someone had the guts to make sarcastic remarks in front of me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess you prefer men who empty their head and agree with everything the Duke says. Men who would agree with you even if you said the sun rises from the west.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both of them were laughing, but the atmosphere worsened. The pressure emitted by Kairen was kicked up a notch. However, Azell took it nonchalantly, and he started baiting Kairen. It was as if Azell was telling Kairen to try hitting him once if Kairen's temper got the better of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen was the first one to back off. He withdrew his pressure, then he relaxed his expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…Well, all right. My words were a little harsh. I'll acknowledge that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That was unexpected.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought you would at least hit me once as a test.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you would send a counter, while saying 'I got you, you bastard'? You purposefully showed a hole in your defense. You also have a very twisted personality.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn't something I want to hear from you. I've heard from princess that you are famous for having a twisted personality.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are arrogant. You are a pup that doesn't know how scary the world is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen snorted. He had a youthful appearance, but Kairen naturally acted like an old man. It wasn't just because he was over a hundred years old. He held a position that was respected by everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Kairen put on a serious expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just know this. I'm currently in a position where I have to consider every absurd conspiracy theories, as if they might happen in reality. The actions of the Dragon Demon King's followers can't be understood by conventional means, since they are lunatics.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell now knew why Kairen insisted on hiding their conversation from Arrieta. He didn't want to force his suspicions on her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a brief silence, Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I hope you can share one thing with me. Tell me about the Dragon Slayer's Ritual.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn't you already hear about it from the princess?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A human and a Dragon fights one-on-one to the death. Then, the winner takes something from the defeated side. The human gets the Dragon's strength, and the Dragon gets the human's wisdom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Correct.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How does that make any sense?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen couldn't accept it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Each region had rituals with some spiritual meaning behind it. They were a product of the region's environment and history.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Such cultural rituals gained significance between the gap in knowledge within society.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was quite absurd to Kairen that there existed a ritual between the humans and Dragons. It would have made sense if a magician and a specific Dragon performed the ritual after making a contract. However, this was a shared ritual where an unknown number of humans and Dragons could participate in it unconditionally. How could such a pact exist?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell stroked his chin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmm. If I give you an explanation regarding the topic, then what will you give me in return?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You dare ask for something back when you are just answering my question?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I trust you are a fair person, since you are princess' teacher. There is worth to knowledge. Isn't that so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen furrowed his brows as he let out a sound of frustration at Azell's words.</span></p>
