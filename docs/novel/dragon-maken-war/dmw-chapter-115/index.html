 <p>Chapter 115 - Guide's Gift (1)</p>
 <p><span style>1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every night Yuren Rizester went to sleep he always had a dream. &nbsp;The guide in his dream had approached him one day, and now he always had a dream every night. &nbsp;Now he couldn’t remember a time when he didn’t have a dream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-In the end, you met your destiny, Yuren.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At a glance, Yuren could tell he wasn’t in reality. &nbsp;He could see numerous fragments of memories connected to each other, and the guide’s words came to Yuren in this chaotic space. &nbsp;&nbsp;The guide’s voice allowed Yuren to be able to think clearly, and a sense of calmness was promoted from within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dream of the guide was different from a lucid dream. &nbsp;However, his consciousness wasn’t fully awake. &nbsp;He couldn’t remember all that went on within his dreams.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was similar to a half-asleep state. &nbsp;He was asleep, but he was conscious of what was happening around him in reality. &nbsp;It felt as if someone was whispering into his ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Ah. &nbsp;It was as you said… &nbsp;&nbsp;The man makes me think of Azell Karzark from the legends.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The heir of Aunsaurus suspects that Azell Karzark is the original Azell…. &nbsp;Well, that isn’t possible, but he does make one think it is a possibility.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had only been several day since Yuren had met Azell. &nbsp;However, Azell became more remarkable as Yuren continued to look at him. &nbsp;It was as the guide had said. &nbsp;Yuren thought Azell really might be able to open up a path that will allow them to bring down the Dragon Demon king worshippers...</span></p>
 <p><span style>-He will show you the answer. &nbsp;I only tell you what you have to do, but he will the one to lead your destiny.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If he is the descendant of Azell Karzark… &nbsp;Our meeting seems very fateful.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>After 220 years, the descendants of the hero Azell Karzark and Archmage Carlos Rizester had met. &nbsp;If the two of them allied with each other to eradicate the evil left behind by the Dragon Demon King Atein, &nbsp;how poetic would it be?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guide spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-It is destiny. &nbsp;Your relationship with him has to proceed forward, so you have to be on his good side. &nbsp;The road will open when you gain his trust.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’ll work on it. &nbsp;This is why I am here.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren was having a nightmare even though he wasn’t asleep. &nbsp;If he spaced out for a brief moment, nightmare-like thoughts plagued him. &nbsp;There were people out there, who were deprived of their lives like Yuren. &nbsp;The Dragon Demon king worshippers turned people into tools, and the fact that they were suffering even now was horrifying to Yuren. &nbsp;Then there were the children he had tried to rescue. &nbsp;In the end, they had all died, and he could still hear their screams. &nbsp;&nbsp;He had driven them towards their deaths.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-You did your best.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘However, the result was the worst.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Yuren.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I know. &nbsp;It is useless to blame myself. &nbsp;Leticia already nags me about it so much that I’m fed up with the topic.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren shook his head from side to side. He had a sad smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to help him to end all of this. &nbsp;Even if I die, it is my duty.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had walked through the long darkness to find a person, who might become the light of hope. &nbsp;Yuren had to earn Azell’s trust at all cost. &nbsp;He had to become Azell’s companion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guide’s voice remained silent for a brief moment before it spoke again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-All right. &nbsp;I’ll give you knowledge that’ll allow you to gain his trust.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is there anything else I can do except fight by his side?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Of course. &nbsp;Time is precious right now. &nbsp;At this moment, the world is going through a sudden change. &nbsp;There is too little time left to build trust and camaraderie through human interactions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is happening?</span></p>
 <p><span style>-You already have the answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is it the Dragon Demon King Atein’s revival?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Yuren asked the question, he felt a peculiar reverberation. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dragon Demon King Atein.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He said this name countless times before, but he now suddenly felt a weird sensation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he became preoccupied with this point, the guide continued to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-That isn’t the problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Then what is it?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>-This will cause the Plain of Darkness to move in earnest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m not sure what you are trying to say.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Think this through Yuren. &nbsp;You have to come up with the answer for yourself. &nbsp;You can’t just expect me to feed you all the information. &nbsp;If not, you’ll just become my puppet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is why I’m conflicted. &nbsp;If you were a Demon trying to destroy me, you wouldn’t say stuff like this to me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Maybe, this is all part of my design.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Ah, all right. &nbsp;Good. ’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren compiled the information available to him, and he came up with several possibilities. &nbsp;The Plain of Darkness had countless schemes ongoing on the continent. &nbsp;In the past 200 years,there had been several changes of generations. &nbsp;Each change of generation provided an opportunity for the Dragon Demon king worshippers to worm their way into the human society.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They haven’t revealed themselves. &nbsp;They might after Atein’s revival, but they don’t have the power to pick a fight with the world..’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Plain of Darkness hid in the shadow of the world as they schemed. &nbsp;They did this, because they didn’t possess the power they once possessed in the Dragon Demon war. &nbsp;In the past, they had enough forces to take over the world. &nbsp;Of course, if they concentrated their forces now, they would be able to fight and win against a single country. &nbsp;However, their existence would be revealed to the seven kingdoms in the process. &nbsp;No, the whole world would become their enemy, and only ruination awaited the Dragon Demon king worshippers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If that is true… &nbsp;The only thing I can think of is the fact that they want to sow chaos from the shadows.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>-That is what they've been doing up until now. &nbsp;What has changed?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Hmm. I’m not sure. &nbsp;Their goal was to make human society diseased… &nbsp;Will they instigate a war between humans?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>-That is one of the right answers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Really? Well, I guess that is within their capability.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would be crazy for the Plain of Darkness to reveal themselves and go to war with the humans. &nbsp;However, they had infiltrated all the ranks and classes of society, so it was possible to engineer a war.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘However, that isn’t all there is to the plan?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>-No. &nbsp;The fact that a war will start soon is correct. &nbsp;War is the most violent way to exhaust the power of humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It isn’t just about a fight between humans. &nbsp;There are other beings aside from humans…. &nbsp;So they’ll try to bring beings from other races, who aren’t affiliated with the Dragon Demon king worshippers, into a fight with the humans?</span></p>
 <p><span style>-That is also another correct answer. &nbsp;They’ve been conducting numerous experiments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘For example, are you talking about the Grand Alliance of Darkness that popped up in the Rulain Kingdom?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Yes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Grand Alliance of Darkness had threatened the Rulain Kingdom around 30 years ago, and they had been created by the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;The strong and wise mutant Orc named Dakan had been made with evil magic. &nbsp;It had been surprisingly easy to gather monsters by propping Dakan up as a leader.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-The winds of change will blow over the world. &nbsp;Be prepared for the ensuing chaos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guide had told Yuren a surprising amount of information. &nbsp;If the guide’s words were correct, he could buy Azell’s trust with it. &nbsp;The guide’s words had never been wrong before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Yuren asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I never expected such an arrangement to exist. &nbsp;It is amazing. &nbsp;Anyways… &nbsp;Isn’t it time for you to tell me who you are?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>-It would be meaningless to tell you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>-You’ll forget it once this dream ends. &nbsp;The answer will come to you at the right time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘But…….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dream ended there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>2</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s party was moving at a much slower pace than they had originally planned. &nbsp;A week had passed, since they had left the County of Karzark. &nbsp;Currently, they had decided to rest at an inn. Kairen grumbled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We should have already covered twice the distance by now. &nbsp;That magician move like a snail….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…are you trying to kill me? &nbsp;If so, you should just tell it to me straight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren grumbled. &nbsp;If one was looking at a map, they were traveling in a straight line at 60 km/h. &nbsp;They were traveling at an incredibly high speed. &nbsp;It defied common sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If a layman saw Yuren fly, one wouldn’t understand how difficult it was to fly through the air. &nbsp;Flight over a long period of time required the extreme consumption of magical energy, stamina and willpower. &nbsp;It was very remarkable that a young man like Yuren was able to keep up with the pace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In terms of innate magical energy, Laura was more outstanding than Yuren, yet even she was exhausted. &nbsp;Leticia, who trained in the Dragon Arts, was keeping up, but it hadn’t been easy for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘However, I can’t deny this is good training for me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Normally, regular magicians never thought about using Flight magic to travel a long distance at high speeds. &nbsp;The reasons were as previously stated. &nbsp;Those reason also applied to Laura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was demanded to do tasks that she had never been required to do before. &nbsp;She could feel herself improve. &nbsp;On the first day, she had been completely gassed. She needed to be carried by Azell to the next town. &nbsp;However, she was now reach their next destination under her own power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This will be most effective when I have to run away.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia had to expend quite a lot of energy when she had to run away from Dragon Demon king worshippers in the past. &nbsp;However, she never overdid it, because she had to preserve her battle capability. &nbsp;However, if she was put in a similar situation, she would now have an easier time evading her trackers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia made a remark to Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I never knew the human body could move so well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if he was a Spirit Order Practitioner, the way he moved was absurd. &nbsp;Azell was equipped lightly, but he carried all the baggages needed for the trip. &nbsp;He ran across mountain and forests, while carrying such a burden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen smirked at her words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If my friend wanted to, he could travel much faster than me. &nbsp;In truth, I'm slowing him down. &nbsp;If I’m grabbing at his ankles, you guys are like balls and chain on his feet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm? What are you saying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ll have a chance to see it later. &nbsp;Even I don’t dare to imitate what he does.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was able to teach Kairen a lot of techniques. &nbsp;However, Kairen wasn’t able to learn ‘Incarnation’, which allowed one to create a clone of substance. &nbsp;In the first place, it was a skill incompatible with him. &nbsp;Kairen had rarely used the cloning technique before. &nbsp;This was why Kairen couldn’t learn the long range flight technique devised by Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are doing pretty well in keeping up with us, Leticia.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve always preferred to run on my own to feet. &nbsp;However, I’ve never experience traveling long distances day after day like this. &nbsp;It is hard for me to see you guys as being sane.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia shook her head from side to side. &nbsp;Kairen looked at her with interest. &nbsp;He didn’t know what the Dragon Demon King worshippers did to her,. &nbsp;However, she possessed more Dragon Demon magic as a Dragon Majin compared to most Dragon Demons. &nbsp;She was the most talented female practitioner of the Dragon Arts he had seen in his lifetime.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you are overflowing with energy, why don’t we spar? &nbsp;Azell doesn’t play with me anymore, so I’m a little bit bored.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are old, yet…. &nbsp;You are overflowing with energy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even as she said those words, Leticia looked interested. &nbsp;It would be a lie to say she hadn’t wanted to fight him during the week long travel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuren spoke as he saw the two of them exit towards the backyard of the inn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, youth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are the youngest amongst us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura, who was lounging around, spoke.</span></p>
