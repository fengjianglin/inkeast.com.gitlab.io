  <hr>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>Azell pulled back from asking his question then he spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Well, I guess this will be the end of our warm-up.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Sir Azell, you are a very kind man.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I would rather be called a fair man.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell knew Giles figured out his intent, so he laughed. After the first exchange, Giles threw away any thoughts of looking down on Azell. At the very least, he accepted the truth that Azell was much better in terms of skill.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles strengthened his mental barrier. The magical energy he could use in an attack was noticeable less, but he had no choice. Normally, he would erect an adequately sturdy wall, but wouldn’t Azell pierce through it easily?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Then Giles started attacking recklessly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Che-ch-e-che-che-che-cheng!</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was a frighteningly fast attack. Every time the swords hit each other, sparks flew, and a brilliant silver light traced through the air.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles, who was pouring on a dizzying attack, suddenly felt that Azell’s movement was strange. Azell vigorously moved as he matched his rhythm, but now his movement had slowed enough to be different. Then he flowed smoothly to the side.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Huk!’</span></p>
  <p><span style>As if he was toying with Giles’ doggedness, the blade that broke through burst forth in an oblique angle.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles retreated in fright. As if he was waiting for him to do so, the point of the sword tracked him like a dancing snake.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Chang!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles barely blocked the blow, and he distanced himself from Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles asked a question, while perspiring cold sweat.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What are these sword technique?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>He realized a step too late. Azell was using several types of sword techniques.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He had thought he had come to grasp Azell’s sword techniques after couple sparring session. However, he didn’t realized Azell had learned a highly heterogeneous sword art.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell replied.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I don’t remember what it is called. However, I learned a lot of sword arts in a hodgepodge manner.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>His words were true. Azell had learned several dozens of sword arts during his lifetime. He comprehended all of it to make his own sword style. After the Dragon Demon war ended, the Emperor decreed that his sword style would become the official sword style of the Nadick Empire’s Royal Knights.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I wonder if it survived?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>After 220 years, he wondered if the sword style he created was still in existence. If it was, it would have been his greatest honor.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ll accept my loss.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmm? Already?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It’s a shame, but I don’t think I can be your opponent with my current level of skill. Even though I launched my attack at you, I couldn’t even force you to take one step backwards.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>As his word indicated, the flashy attack Giles performed wasn’t able make Azell move a single step. He had stood in place like an embedded nail. Moreover, he had kept Giles in front of him, and he had deceived Giles’ sense to create an opening.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles had more magical energy than Azell, and he was also stronger and faster. However, Azell’s technique was overwhelmingly superior that it was enough to overturn all the physical advantages he held.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“This was a great lesson. May I ask you to keep being my opponent in the future?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Of course.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After Azell nodded his head, Giles bowed towards Arrieta.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m sorry for showing my shortcomings.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No, it was an entertaining show. Sir Azell, you are a very mischievous man.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Is that so?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If you decide to teach someone, I’m sure the pupil will have many complaints about you as a teacher.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“This opinion seems to be coming from personal experience. Am I mistaken?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No. Unfortunately, you are right. You have some similarities to my teacher.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ho oh. Then you’ve been taught by a good person.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You have an unusual talent of painting your face in gold.(TLN: painting oneself in a good light) If my teacher, Duke Tarantos, heard you then he would most definitely… Mmmm. He would have laughed.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The person who taught princess was the Dragon Demon Duke?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles was surprised, so he butted in. This caused Arrieta’s eyes to move towards him. He lowered his head in surprise.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I apologize.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No, it’s fine. We aren’t in a grandiose location, so you don’t have to worry about it. To tell you the truth, it’s annoying.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After she complained, Arrieta continued speaking.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Dragon Demon Duke. Yes, it is him.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“My god. That person rarely shows himself even on a formal occasion….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Well, he is someone with a lot of ties to the crown. If the crown requests it then he’ll comply without complaining.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>At those words, Azell tilted his head.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Isn’t Dragon Maken Duke a fairly high sounding nickname?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Well, Azell’s own nickname was also grandiose. It couldn’t be helped since he was the one who held the most accomplishment in the Dragon Demon War, and he had also beaten the Dragon Demon King Atein.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell asked.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What kind of person is this Dragon Demon Duke?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“….you don’t know who Dragon Demon Duke is?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles stared at Azell with a dumbfounded expression as if to say he couldn’t believe such a thing was possible.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell felt a sense of deja vu since he had received the same kind of stare from someone.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Ah, it’s the same expression as Rick when I mentioned I didn’t know who the Dragon Princess was.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Dragon Demon Duke was a figure as famous as the Dragon Demon Princess, so if one didn’t know them, one would be treated as a spy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta laughed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Sir Azell has lost his memory, so it is understandable.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Truthfully, I didn’t even know about you, princess. When I asked if the Dragon Demon Princess was the princess of a country founded by the Dragon Demon race, army doctor Rick looked at me with the same expression Sir Giles made.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“This has been a very refreshing experience.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Is that so?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“From the time I was born to now, no one has failed to recognize me. They might not know me personally, but they know about the existence called ‘Dragon Demon Princess.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Indeed.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell nodded his head. For the past several days, he had studied about this era, and her existence was common knowledge.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell asked.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Is Dragon Demon Duke a title inherited like the Dragon Demon Princess?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No, it isn’t like that. The Dragon Demon Duke compared to the Dragon Demon princess… Mmmm. Yes. It is appropriate to think of it as the difference between legend and common knowledge.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“So you are saying Dragon Demon Princess is common knowledge, and Dragon Demon Duke is a legend? ”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ah……”</span></p>
  <p><span style>He had already heard about the Dragon Demon race joining the human society. However, it was refreshing to hear about a concrete example. The Duke was from the Dragon Demon race, and he was a great noble in a kingdom built by humans. He was also the princess’ teacher.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘This is quite fun.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell wanted to meet him at least once.</span></p>
  <p><span style>6</span></p>
  <p><span style>The worshipers of the Dragon Demon race was everywhere.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Currently, the world was misguided as it was ruled by humans. There were many people who believed in the fulfillment of the ideals set forth by the Dragon Demon King. Those believers had infiltrated all ranks and classes. Even if it isn’t someone from the Dragon Demon race, who grew up discriminated, there were other numerous people cooperating with them, while hiding their identity.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was one form of religion. These were people who couldn’t boldly step into the sun. They were waiting in the darkness for the savior, Dragon Demon King, to return someday…</span></p>
  <p><span style>“So that’s how it is. The situation has become complicated.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The secret society was called the Dragon’s Shadow. Regina received a report from her underling, and she mumbled in a hoarse voice. Amongst the countless organizations worshiping the Dragon Demon King, the Dragon’s Shadow was a high ranking organization with many lesser organization beneath it. The fact that she was in this group signified she was a big fish. She could go anywhere in this world and request cooperation from the lesser organization connected to the main branch. The information network was especially frightening.</span></p>
  <p><span style>When she was about to speak to her underling, who had his head down, she heard a woman’s voice from inside.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What is so complicated?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Then time came to a halt.</span></p>
  <p><span style>No, in reality, time hadn’t stopped. However, it felt like it had for Regina.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The underlings in front of her had stopped moving. They hadn’t just stopped moving. They didn’t blink nor did they breathe. They just stopped in place.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Regina turned to looked at the person causing this bizarre phenomenon.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Niberis-nim. If you leave the humans in this state, then they’ll die soon.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Don’t worry about it. Even I know that much.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis was a woman in her mid-20s with black hair, and brown eyes. From her outer appearance, she looked like a cold beauty, but she wasn’t human inside. She was a high ranking executive, who held a much higher position than Regina.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis glanced once at the frozen underlings, and their status changed. They were still frozen in place, but they started breathing slowly. She didn’t want to reveal herself to the worshipers, and this was a way to minimize information from getting out.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Answer my previous question.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Including the Dragon Demon princess, they are a small party with only 5 people.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Five people?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“There are only that many people accompanying the Dragon Demon Princess?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What is she thinking? Maybe this is a imposter in disguise? Is this a diversion?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“We have confirmed that isn’t the case.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hmmm. Isn’t that more convenient? Why are saying it has become more complicated?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis tilted her head in question. She didn’t understand why Arrieta chose to do this. Moreover, she didn’t understand why Regina thought this mission had become more complicated.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Regina mused inside as she looked at her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘She grew up sheltered.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis was the offspring of a high ranking executive within the organization. She possessed powerful strength, but she hadn’t really gone out into the world. She was a high ranking magician, but that didn’t mean she was smart in the ways of the world.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Regina explained.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Even if the Dragon Demon Princess could bring as many troops to bodyguard her, there is a limit to how many she can bring. Even on the high side, it would be around 70 to 80 people. Even if it was the Western Border guards, it would be impossible to deploy any more troops.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Wouldn’t that be more troublesome than 5 people?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“From our perspective, it would have been better if she came with a somewhat large retinue. Even if there were a lot of them, most of them are ordinary soldiers. The large number means their traveling speed would be slow, and it would be easier to find their location.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hmmm. The small number means most of them are elite troops, and they will have an easier time running away? Is that what you mean?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Regina clearly saw through Arrieta’s intention. Moreover, she knew this was all done to make it more difficult for her pursuers.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“This region has almost none of our agents in place. It would be impossible for us to mobilize too many of our men.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“They are small in number, so why would we need a lot of people?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“We need it.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If I go, do you think it will be lacking?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis’ eyes started to fill with displeasure. Regina spoke haltingly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Of course, if it is Niberis-nim, the Dragon Demon princess and anyone next to her would be sufficiently overwhelmed.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>First, she spoke those words to quell Niberis’ mood. However, this wasn’t just a flattery, it was the truth. Niberis had grown up sheltered within the upper echelon of the secret society, so her sense of reality was a bit lacking. However, Niberis possessed enormous strength, which Regina couldn’t even compare to.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“However, our goal isn’t to fight and defeat them. We have to capture them. If a person of the Dragon Demon princess’ caliber starts to go on the run then it won’t be easy to catch her. Moreover, there is a restriction on how we can act in a highly populated location.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I see.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis understood what Regina was trying to say.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, she refused to accepted it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Still, Regina, you only think of this situation based on your level.” (TLN: calling her a small fish/thinking too small)</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If I go forth, then you don’t have to worry about such things. First of all, I’m going out to capture a mere Dragon Demon Princess. This is like a king using his best sword to butcher a chicken.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis laughed coldly. Regina’s pride was rustled, but she spoke, while keeping her outer appearance blank.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“This is the only time I will go out.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I understand.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Regina replied back. In the current world, the existence of a Dragon Demon King worshiper was not tolerated. If it was a land ruled by humans, this was the case everywhere. There existed secret societies that also tracked down Dragon Demo King worshipers</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ll leave the preparation to you. Since you are so worried about it, I want you to make me a stage with utmost caution.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Regina bowed her head.</span></p>

 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Azell pulled back from asking his question then he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, I guess this will be the end of our warm-up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir Azell, you are a very kind man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I would rather be called a fair man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell knew Giles figured out his intent, so he laughed. After the first exchange, Giles threw away any thoughts of looking down on Azell. At the very least, he accepted the truth that Azell was much better in terms of skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles strengthened his mental barrier. The magical energy he could use in an attack was noticeable less, but he had no choice. Normally, he would erect an adequately sturdy wall, but wouldn’t Azell pierce through it easily?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Giles started attacking recklessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Che-ch-e-che-che-che-cheng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a frighteningly fast attack. Every time the swords hit each other, sparks flew, and a brilliant silver light traced through the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles, who was pouring on a dizzying attack, suddenly felt that Azell’s movement was strange. Azell vigorously moved as he matched his rhythm, but now his movement had slowed enough to be different. Then he flowed smoothly to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Huk!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if he was toying with Giles’ doggedness, the blade that broke through burst forth in an oblique angle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles retreated in fright. As if he was waiting for him to do so, the point of the sword tracked him like a dancing snake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles barely blocked the blow, and he distanced himself from Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles asked a question, while perspiring cold sweat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are these sword technique?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He realized a step too late. Azell was using several types of sword techniques.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had thought he had come to grasp Azell’s sword techniques after couple sparring session. However, he didn’t realized Azell had learned a highly heterogeneous sword art.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t remember what it is called. However, I learned a lot of sword arts in a hodgepodge manner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His words were true. Azell had learned several dozens of sword arts during his lifetime. He comprehended all of it to make his own sword style. After the Dragon Demon war ended, the Emperor decreed that his sword style would become the official sword style of the Nadick Empire’s Royal Knights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I wonder if it survived?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>After 220 years, he wondered if the sword style he created was still in existence. If it was, it would have been his greatest honor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll accept my loss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm? Already?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a shame, but I don’t think I can be your opponent with my current level of skill. Even though I launched my attack at you, I couldn’t even force you to take one step backwards.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As his word indicated, the flashy attack Giles performed wasn’t able make Azell move a single step. He had stood in place like an embedded nail. Moreover, he had kept Giles in front of him, and he had deceived Giles’ sense to create an opening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles had more magical energy than Azell, and he was also stronger and faster. However, Azell’s technique was overwhelmingly superior that it was enough to overturn all the physical advantages he held.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This was a great lesson. May I ask you to keep being my opponent in the future?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Azell nodded his head, Giles bowed towards Arrieta.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry for showing my shortcomings.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, it was an entertaining show. Sir Azell, you are a very mischievous man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you decide to teach someone, I’m sure the pupil will have many complaints about you as a teacher.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This opinion seems to be coming from personal experience. Am I mistaken?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. Unfortunately, you are right. You have some similarities to my teacher.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ho oh. Then you’ve been taught by a good person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have an unusual talent of painting your face in gold.(TLN: painting oneself in a good light) If my teacher, Duke Tarantos, heard you then he would most definitely… Mmmm. He would have laughed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The person who taught princess was the Dragon Demon Duke?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles was surprised, so he butted in. This caused Arrieta’s eyes to move towards him. He lowered his head in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I apologize.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, it’s fine. We aren’t in a grandiose location, so you don’t have to worry about it. To tell you the truth, it’s annoying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she complained, Arrieta continued speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dragon Demon Duke. Yes, it is him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My god. That person rarely shows himself even on a formal occasion….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, he is someone with a lot of ties to the crown. If the crown requests it then he’ll comply without complaining.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At those words, Azell tilted his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Isn’t Dragon Maken Duke a fairly high sounding nickname?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Well, Azell’s own nickname was also grandiose. It couldn’t be helped since he was the one who held the most accomplishment in the Dragon Demon War, and he had also beaten the Dragon Demon King Atein.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of person is this Dragon Demon Duke?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“….you don’t know who Dragon Demon Duke is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles stared at Azell with a dumbfounded expression as if to say he couldn’t believe such a thing was possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell felt a sense of deja vu since he had received the same kind of stare from someone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Ah, it’s the same expression as Rick when I mentioned I didn’t know who the Dragon Princess was.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon Duke was a figure as famous as the Dragon Demon Princess, so if one didn’t know them, one would be treated as a spy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir Azell has lost his memory, so it is understandable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Truthfully, I didn’t even know about you, princess. When I asked if the Dragon Demon Princess was the princess of a country founded by the Dragon Demon race, army doctor Rick looked at me with the same expression Sir Giles made.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This has been a very refreshing experience.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“From the time I was born to now, no one has failed to recognize me. They might not know me personally, but they know about the existence called ‘Dragon Demon Princess.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Indeed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell nodded his head. For the past several days, he had studied about this era, and her existence was common knowledge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is Dragon Demon Duke a title inherited like the Dragon Demon Princess?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, it isn’t like that. The Dragon Demon Duke compared to the Dragon Demon princess… Mmmm. Yes. It is appropriate to think of it as the difference between legend and common knowledge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you are saying Dragon Demon Princess is common knowledge, and Dragon Demon Duke is a legend? ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah……”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had already heard about the Dragon Demon race joining the human society. However, it was refreshing to hear about a concrete example. The Duke was from the Dragon Demon race, and he was a great noble in a kingdom built by humans. He was also the princess’ teacher.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is quite fun.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell wanted to meet him at least once.</span></p>
 <p><span style>6</span></p>
 <p><span style>The worshipers of the Dragon Demon race was everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, the world was misguided as it was ruled by humans. There were many people who believed in the fulfillment of the ideals set forth by the Dragon Demon King. Those believers had infiltrated all ranks and classes. Even if it isn’t someone from the Dragon Demon race, who grew up discriminated, there were other numerous people cooperating with them, while hiding their identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was one form of religion. These were people who couldn’t boldly step into the sun. They were waiting in the darkness for the savior, Dragon Demon King, to return someday…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So that’s how it is. The situation has become complicated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The secret society was called the Dragon’s Shadow. Regina received a report from her underling, and she mumbled in a hoarse voice. Amongst the countless organizations worshiping the Dragon Demon King, the Dragon’s Shadow was a high ranking organization with many lesser organization beneath it. The fact that she was in this group signified she was a big fish. She could go anywhere in this world and request cooperation from the lesser organization connected to the main branch. The information network was especially frightening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she was about to speak to her underling, who had his head down, she heard a woman’s voice from inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is so complicated?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then time came to a halt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, in reality, time hadn’t stopped. However, it felt like it had for Regina.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The underlings in front of her had stopped moving. They hadn’t just stopped moving. They didn’t blink nor did they breathe. They just stopped in place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regina turned to looked at the person causing this bizarre phenomenon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Niberis-nim. If you leave the humans in this state, then they’ll die soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry about it. Even I know that much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis was a woman in her mid-20s with black hair, and brown eyes. From her outer appearance, she looked like a cold beauty, but she wasn’t human inside. She was a high ranking executive, who held a much higher position than Regina.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis glanced once at the frozen underlings, and their status changed. They were still frozen in place, but they started breathing slowly. She didn’t want to reveal herself to the worshipers, and this was a way to minimize information from getting out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Answer my previous question.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Including the Dragon Demon princess, they are a small party with only 5 people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Five people?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are only that many people accompanying the Dragon Demon Princess?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is she thinking? Maybe this is a imposter in disguise? Is this a diversion?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We have confirmed that isn’t the case.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmm. Isn’t that more convenient? Why are saying it has become more complicated?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis tilted her head in question. She didn’t understand why Arrieta chose to do this. Moreover, she didn’t understand why Regina thought this mission had become more complicated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regina mused inside as she looked at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘She grew up sheltered.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis was the offspring of a high ranking executive within the organization. She possessed powerful strength, but she hadn’t really gone out into the world. She was a high ranking magician, but that didn’t mean she was smart in the ways of the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regina explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if the Dragon Demon Princess could bring as many troops to bodyguard her, there is a limit to how many she can bring. Even on the high side, it would be around 70 to 80 people. Even if it was the Western Border guards, it would be impossible to deploy any more troops.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wouldn’t that be more troublesome than 5 people?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“From our perspective, it would have been better if she came with a somewhat large retinue. Even if there were a lot of them, most of them are ordinary soldiers. The large number means their traveling speed would be slow, and it would be easier to find their location.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmm. The small number means most of them are elite troops, and they will have an easier time running away? Is that what you mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regina clearly saw through Arrieta’s intention. Moreover, she knew this was all done to make it more difficult for her pursuers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This region has almost none of our agents in place. It would be impossible for us to mobilize too many of our men.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They are small in number, so why would we need a lot of people?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We need it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I go, do you think it will be lacking?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis’ eyes started to fill with displeasure. Regina spoke haltingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, if it is Niberis-nim, the Dragon Demon princess and anyone next to her would be sufficiently overwhelmed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>First, she spoke those words to quell Niberis’ mood. However, this wasn’t just a flattery, it was the truth. Niberis had grown up sheltered within the upper echelon of the secret society, so her sense of reality was a bit lacking. However, Niberis possessed enormous strength, which Regina couldn’t even compare to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, our goal isn’t to fight and defeat them. We have to capture them. If a person of the Dragon Demon princess’ caliber starts to go on the run then it won’t be easy to catch her. Moreover, there is a restriction on how we can act in a highly populated location.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis understood what Regina was trying to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she refused to accepted it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still, Regina, you only think of this situation based on your level.” (TLN: calling her a small fish/thinking too small)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I go forth, then you don’t have to worry about such things. First of all, I’m going out to capture a mere Dragon Demon Princess. This is like a king using his best sword to butcher a chicken.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis laughed coldly. Regina’s pride was rustled, but she spoke, while keeping her outer appearance blank.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the only time I will go out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regina replied back. In the current world, the existence of a Dragon Demon King worshiper was not tolerated. If it was a land ruled by humans, this was the case everywhere. There existed secret societies that also tracked down Dragon Demo King worshipers</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll leave the preparation to you. Since you are so worried about it, I want you to make me a stage with utmost caution.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regina bowed her head.</span></p>
