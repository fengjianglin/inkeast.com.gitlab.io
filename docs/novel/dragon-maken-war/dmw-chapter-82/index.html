 <p><span style>Chapter 82 - The Scar Left on the World (2)</span></p>
 <p><span style>4</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lightning drew silhouettes in the air, and these silhouettes were dancing in the air . It was so bright and beautiful that one might become bewitched by the sight at first glance. &nbsp;However, these were very dangerous beings that could burn any living being that approached them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Constructs!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>These were Constructs created by the Dragon. The Earth Dragon's Constructs were made from the soil. &nbsp;The Thunder Dragon's Constructs were monsters made out of lightning itself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So the real fight starts now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>These particular Constructs were very troublesome to face. &nbsp;The Constructs were akin to the Thunder Dragon's attack, which was the fastest amongst the Dragons. &nbsp;The Thunder Dragon's Constructs attacked so fast that its speed couldn't even be compared to the other Constructs! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ggwah-gwahng! Ggwah-gwah-gwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were the essence of lightning. &nbsp;When they flew into the air, they traveled along the thread of lightning that formed when the Lightning Barrier were set up by the Thunder Dragon. &nbsp;They flickered in and out, but when they decided to hit a target, they coalesced to travel along the same thread of lightning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how fast Azell was, it was impossible for him to dodge a lightning through visual cues especially when the lightning was already on its way. &nbsp;If he had an instant, Azell could move faster than the speed of sound, but the speed of lightning was much faster than that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell desperately sensed the flow of magical energy and the energy of the lightning. &nbsp;In a flash, he was able to pick up on it. &nbsp;The Constructs of the Thunder Dragon could move unrestricted around the surrounding as it attacked. &nbsp;If Azell wanted to block them, he would have to read the attacks beforehand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-jee-jeek! Ggwah-gwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lightning flowers bloomed. The lighting let out by the Dragon came at Azell in vertical and diagonal lines. &nbsp;Constructs were born in the backwash of these attacks, and they aimed for Azell from all directions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-oohk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was using dazzling movements to dodge the torrent of attacks, but he had his limits. &nbsp;If he couldn't dodge it, he used the Insulation technique, but even that technique wasn't infallible. &nbsp;After avoiding the attacks using Insulation, he had to block the lightning strikes that immediately followed afterwards using his Barrier. &nbsp;The lightning was hitting him more frequently by the minute. &nbsp;Every time the lightning hit his barrier, it felt as if the shock would eviscerate his internal organs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was too much of a difference between their haves and have nots. &nbsp;The Dragon could control the lightning as easy as breathing. The Dragon's raw power were indescribably larger than any other living organisms on this world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On top of it all, the Dragon just needed to get a decent shot in from a distance, and the fight would be over. &nbsp;On the other hand, Azell had to get close to damage the Dragon, and even this task was difficult.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Humans were more advanced than Dragons in one aspect. &nbsp;It was techniques.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were countless species living in this world, and humans weren't that powerful of an existence. &nbsp;If a human fought unarmed, the human might not even win against a trained dog. &nbsp;Even if a human was to fight against herbivores, the human would lose in a landslide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the humans hadn’t become the losers of this world. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was the reason behind it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Humans possessed wisdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They made tools to supplement their shortcomings, and they devised ways to use these tools more effectively. Then they shared these know hows to slowly come up with exceptional techniques.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A new skill called Martial arts developed as this process was refined. &nbsp;This was all done so the weak could stack the deck and win against the strong. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>This concept bordered on madness for the Dragons. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragons had been born as the strongest beings in this world yet they were born without wisdom. &nbsp;They were dull-witted, so the only answer as to how a human could win against a Dragon could be only known by gaining this wisdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha-aht!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell let out a shout. &nbsp;He couldn't get out of the way of the lightning strike, so he absorbed it into his sword. &nbsp;Then he discharged the energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that he was using such a method meant Azell had been driven into a corner. &nbsp;It looked as if he had reached his limit. &nbsp;He was barely avoiding and blocking the attacks. &nbsp;In the end, the Lightning Barrier spread out by the Thunder Dragon, and the Constructs had completely surrounded Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ggwah-gwah-gwahng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell couldn't dodge the attacks, so he engaged his Barrier. &nbsp;The attacks hit his Barrier, and Azell was sent flying. &nbsp;It seemed he hadn't been able to neutralize all the shock, so he was seen flying through the air as blood was spilled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a flash, the Thunder Dragon glared as it opened its mouth. &nbsp;It was sure its prey had been weakened. &nbsp;It didn't hesitate to use its strongest weapon in its arsenal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, a light shone in Azell's eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Dragon's Roar! I anticipated as much!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Thunder Dragon was a violent and impatient being. &nbsp;In the first place, it had the power of lightning to instantly incinerate its enemies. &nbsp;So how would a word like patience be associated with such a being?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though it was fighting against a foe it couldn't comprehend, the Thunder Dragon didn't hesitate in its attack. It had to hit hard! &nbsp;It was getting more agressive as it continued to attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if it developed numerous techniques through its experience in live battles, it couldn't change its base nature. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell reaffirmed this truth as he fought the Dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kyahhhhhhhhhhhhh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon's Roar exploded forth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lightning Barrier being used by the Thunder Dragon coalesced into a single point. &nbsp;It gathered around the roaring Dragon's mouth as an incredible pillar of lightning was emitted. &nbsp;In a flash, several hundred meter of the surrounding land burned white. &nbsp;After a second, an enormous cloud of dust rose into the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This Dragon was on a different level in terms of technique compared to the Earth Dragon Azell had fought in the Balan Forest. &nbsp;This Thunder Dragon was very adept at knowing how to use its power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was also the reason why it was doing as Azell had intended.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I was waiting for this!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the appearance of him being cornered was part of his battle tactic. &nbsp;His life would end in a flash if he made a momentary mistake, but he used this fact to his advantage! &nbsp;He had to do this if he wanted to win against the Dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even as the explosion started to scatter the pillar of lightning, Azell circulated a powerful &nbsp;current within his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a lightning strike he couldn't block with just the Insulation technique. &nbsp;Even though Azell had become stronger through his training, Azell would have died without being able to do anything by the pillar of lightning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would have happened if Kairen hadn't lent him the Dragon Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thunder Dragon's……!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A powerful wave of Dragon Demon Magic was being emitted by the Dragon Sword. &nbsp;It was a power that bent reality through one's will. &nbsp;The Dragon Demon Magic imbued Azell with a power that allowed him to exceed his own limits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A blinding electric light gathered and burned around the Dragon Sword that was held by Azell. &nbsp;By the look of it, it was clear that a part of the powerful lightning that had been generated by the Thunder Dragon was imbued into the sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…Horn!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ggwah-gwah-gwah-gwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of an explosion rang out, but the lightning had already cut through the Thunder Dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pillar of lightning exploded as the world burned white. &nbsp;Azell's magical energy was lower than what he had possessed at the Balan Forest when he defeated the Earth Dragon. &nbsp;&nbsp;However, he had just took in the Thunder Dragon's lightning attack, and he had sent it back after amplifying it. &nbsp;This strike exceeded the strike he had used against the Earth Dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Azell didn't stop there. &nbsp;He immediately jumped into the lightning that had just exploded forth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-hak!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of flesh being ripped apart was heard as blood fountained into the air. &nbsp;The Dragon let out a cry of pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kyahhhhhh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Surprisingly, the Thunder Dragon was still alive. &nbsp;This was the strike that had ended the life of the Earth Dragon, yet it looked almost unharmed from the previous attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was to be expected. &nbsp;The Thunder Dragon treated lightning that fell in a storm as nourishment. &nbsp;Even if a strike could part a mountain, it wouldn’t receive any damage if the attack was lightning based.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was well aware of this fact. However, he had used the Thunder Dragon’s own technique to put into a state of panic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This gamble… I am the winner!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After letting out the Dragon's Roar, the Thunder Dragon received a strike that it could have never predicted. &nbsp;The power that protected its power diminished as its mind was in a defenseless state. &nbsp;It suffered an attack to a vulnerable spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha-ah-ah-ah-ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon was swept up by exquisite pain, and Azell pulled up all his strength to attack before the Dragon’s mind returned to its normal state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwah-kwah-kwah-kwah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After consecutive sounds of explosion rang out, blood sprayed out from the Dragon's body. Something was wrong. &nbsp;It couldn't do something that it should be able to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It couldn't stop itself from bleeding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn't as if Azell had attacked the same location. &nbsp;Its initial wound should have stopped bleeding through regeneration. &nbsp;However, the wound continued to widen as blood continued to pour out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blame the Duke. &nbsp;If it wasn't for this sword, it would have been my loss!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had used a </span><span style>Hemorrhagic Curse that worked even on a Dragon. &nbsp;Azell was being backed up by plenty of Dragon Demon Magic, so he was able to use this technique. &nbsp;Moreover, Kairen’s Dragon Sword made this attack possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, its bleeding wasn’t the only strange occurrence that created confusion within the Thunder Dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-hahk! Pah-hah-hak!</span></p>
 <p><span style>There wasn't only one sword hitting its body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Numerous sword strikes were parting its body at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It felt as if several dozen humans were attacking it. &nbsp;However, it knew that wasn't possible. &nbsp;It was performing the Dragon Slayer's Ritual with the single human, who was in front of it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Dance of the Shadows!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that moment, Azell created several dozen clones that had the substance of his real body, and they all charged towards the Thunder Dargon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><span style>Hemorrhagic Curse could only be used by Azell’s real body. &nbsp;However, the sword strikes all over its body could still cause damage. &nbsp;The Thunder Dragon didn’t know what to do as pain washed over it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kah-ah-ah-ah-ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Thunder Dragon let out lightning in a frantic attempt. &nbsp;However, it was useless. &nbsp;Azell possessed a devilish timing. &nbsp;He attacked right when the lightning was emitted. &nbsp;The pain caused the conentration of the Thunder Dragon to falter, and the weakened lightning strike was badly aimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had made a mistake in using the Dragon’s Roar through its impatience. &nbsp;It didn’t have time to recharge its power, and death was approaching it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ba-dum! Ba-dum! Ba-dum!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s heart was beating crazily, and a frightening amount of magical energy was generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Azell charged towards the Thunder Dragon as if his soul was behind his attack. &nbsp;This was the decisive moment that would determine the outcome of this battle. &nbsp;He had to kill the Thunder Dragon before the power used up by the Dragon’s Roar returned. &nbsp;If he was able to do it, it was Azell’s victory. &nbsp;If he couldn't do it, Azell would be dead!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Flame Dragon's……!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon's mind was clouded from the massive blood loss, and Azell suddenly burst into view in front of the Thunder Dragon's eyes. &nbsp;The terrifying blue eyes looked down at the Dragon, and flame erupted from his body like an active volcation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…Horn!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he brought down his burning sword down on the crown of the Dragon's head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>5</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…my god. How can &nbsp;he dispatch a Dragon so easily?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Keepers of the Prophecy was taken aback as they watched Azell and the Thunder Dragon conduct the Dragon Slayer's Ritual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were well aware of how frightening of an existence a Dragon was. &nbsp;This was quite apparent since the surrounding landscape was being rearranged by the fight between the Thunder Dragon and Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Azell had defeated the Dragon very handily. &nbsp;If one knew the inside story, one would have found out that Azell had stolen the victory through a gamble. &nbsp;It had been a gamble with his life as a collateral. &nbsp;However, these beings didn't know the inside circumstances, so his victory looked unbelievably simple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was he really the same person that impotently lost to Zeta only 4 months ago?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maybe he really is the figure mentioned in the Prophecy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the Keeper of Prophecy spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leone was also surprised. &nbsp;This fight hadn't been planned. &nbsp;Of course, the Frost Dragon hadn't been mobilized to be used at this point in time. Still, it was a card they had prepared, so the Frost Dragon could be mobilized any point in time. &nbsp;However, they had to use prematurely use the Frost Dragon, because of machination of the Dragon Demon King worshippers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leone asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What would happen if you fight him now, Zeta?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I don't know. &nbsp;I can't guarantee anything.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you able to win against a Dragon, Zeta?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It is possible. However…….&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zeta wasn't confident he could do it like Azell. &nbsp;When he was alive, he had been known as a genius and an expert as a Spirit Order Practitioner. &nbsp;However, when he face Azell before, he had been outclassed by Azell in terms of techniques. &nbsp;Yet this man now had matured in power up to a point where he could defeat a Dragon in a one on one battle. &nbsp;Will he really be able to defeat him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leone spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jares. Sometimes your harebrained schemes are useful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jares was struggling like a bug beside Leone's feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-oohk. &nbsp;Shit. &nbsp;If you are going to give me a compliment, you should.... &nbsp;Why don't you speak in a more agreeable tone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jares was letting out cold sweat as he laughed. &nbsp;The pain given to him by Azell was quite terrible. &nbsp;His body was still struggling from the pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leone furrowed his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should pick one reaction. &nbsp;Either you can be in pain or you can put on a smile of victory. You look creepy right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kook-kook-kook, The man called Azell.... &nbsp;His actions have more bite than expected, but in the end... &nbsp;He is a virtuous man. &nbsp;If he is such a man, he can’t help, but choose this course of action.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You just dropped a line that would be spoken by a real villain. &nbsp;Well, I guess you are a trash that is worse than a villain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are all the same.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is annoying, but I have no basis to refute your words. &nbsp;Anyways, I'm really starting to think he is the one being pointed out by the Prophecy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kook-kook-kook…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jares was still crumpled on the floor as he he let out a dark laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leone spoke. &nbsp;He looked at Jares as if he was an idiot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems Theta and Delta is doing well.”</span></p>
