  <p><span style>Chapter 27 - Raised Social Status (1)</span></p>
  <p></p>
  <hr>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>1</span></p>
  <p><span style>He had a dream.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was a dream about the distant past.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, his dream was vivid as if it had happened not too long ago. It was that kind of dream.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘This must be a dream.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell dumbly thought to himself.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He was familiar with having a lucid dream. A normal person would question how this was possible. However, Spirit Order practitioners learn how to control the mind, so he had experienced a lot of lucid dreams until he was sick of it. If he wanted to, it was possible for him to induce a lucid dream.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, this dream had nothing to do with his intent.</span></p>
  <p><span style>In the dream, Azell was with someone within the ruins of a castle. At one time, the castle had boasted to be the most majestic in the world.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was the castle where the Dragon Demon King Atein had presided.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“There aren’t any useful things left here.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>He heard an apologetic voice. When he looked to his side, Carlos was there.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was accustomed to his looks. He was a youthful magician with tidy brown hair, and cold gray eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Those hairs will disappear in a couple decades, and his head will be smooth.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Those thoughts were the first thing that came into his mind. However, he couldn’t help it since the aged Carlos’ look was too shocking.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Carlos had no idea what Azell was thinking, and he started to sigh.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That damn bastard Atein didn’t leave anything behind in his research lab even though he is a magician.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Carlos had used every means imaginable to find a way to dispel the curse put on Azell by Atein. They had searched this castle a couple dozen times to find even a minor clue.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, it was fruitless. Atein’s extensive collection of magical tomes didn’t have any clues on how to release Azell from the curse. The lab had a surprising amount of magical products, but it didn’t have anything of interest.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell consoled his friend.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Atein may be the very first magician. It is to be expected that he would be different from other magicians.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Dragon Demon race created the skill called magic.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Moreover, Atein was the first of the Dragon Demon race to be born into this world, and he reigned over them as king. This was why some magicians hypothesized that Atein was the progenitor of magic.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Carlos became angry.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Don’t talk about it as if is someone else’s business! It is a problem with your life on the line!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I know that.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If you know that then why are you so calm?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I can’t be mad at someone who I know is trying the hardest in this world to solve my problem. ”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Kook….” (TLN: just a sound he made)</span></p>
  <p><span style>Carlos’ face reddened. He was embarrassed. Azell was dignified when facing the threat of death, yet he was the one who had lost it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I’m scared too, Carlos.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>The current Azell smiled bitterly when he saw the scene inside his dream.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Yes. Azell was also afraid. He had saved the world, but his future couldn’t be saved. Death was approaching closer by the hour, and he might succumb to it. Truthfully, he had been afraid and he wanted to cry.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He preferred the idea of dying in battle, where he would die when he lost. He would be able to stay indifferent until that single moment would come. It was harder to bear the suffocating fear of a death that was slowly approaching him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, he felt a fire burn in the corner of his heart when he thought this.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Atein. The only thing you could take away from me was my life.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was determined to not let him have his(TLN:Atein) own way.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Above all, he didn’t want to disappoint his friend who was desperately working for him. Even if his efforts were a failure, he never wanted his friend to see him in a dishevelled state. He wanted to show a confident and proud figure until the end.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was all for show and it was a childish behavior. However, as a man who had charged into battle while grasping his sword, what would be left if one took away his bravado?</span></p>
  <p><span style>He kept up this facade with his life on the line, so no one would disparage him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>If he thought back on it, he thought the bravado definitely helped Carlos.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Azell, I really… It feels like we have switched places.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I feel the same. I would have never imagined this day would come.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was the opposite in the Dragon Demon war. Azell was still inexperienced, and whenever he couldn’t hold back his emotions, Carlos’s cool attitude acted as the cold water that doused him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Whenever the group was tired or desperate, he was the one person who didn’t falter. In the moment when everyone faltered, he withstood everything like a steel beam. He was their support.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Carlos was a man who had taken on this role. However, after Azell was cursed, their roles had been reversed. Azell should be the one in greatest agony, but he put up a front. He acted as if he wasn’t shaken. He had to become the supporting pillar for Carlos, who at times, was about to fall apart from despair.</span></p>
  <p><span style>As the two passed through the ruins, they finally reached Atein’s office. There were words carved into the half broken wall with magic.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘The one who treats the world with hate must be prepared to be hated by the world.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>The moment Azell read those words he could guess who had written it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Dragon Demon King Atein.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He had tried to conquer the world yet did he understand the significance of his action?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Carlos asked a question.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What was the Dragon Demon King’s thinking when he tried to conquer the world?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Dragon Demon race was born far back in the past. The very first of the Dragon Demon race, Atein, was a special existence. He had a much longer life span compared to the others of the Dragon Demon race. He had lived for more than a thousand years.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He was the seed that started the Dragon Demon race. He might also be the progenitor of the mysteries called magic. Why did he join up with the others of his race to conquer the world? Countless number of people had put their life on the line to fight Atein, but no one knew Atein’s real intention, which he held within his heart.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was the one exception.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Inside Azell’s mind, Atein’s words brushed by.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Unfortunately, this experiment was a failure. I’m still ignorant. I have no choice but to accept this truth.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>These words made Azell shiver.</span></p>
  <p><span style>If Atein had revealed his ambitions, then he(TLN: Azell) would have snorted.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He would have laughed it off if Atein like a typical magician gave a long-winded speech regarding his delusions of grandeur. However, when he was about to face his death, Atein boldly accepted his failure. Moreover, he said that the chaotic events that turned the world upside was merely an experiment</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Azell. If you are the sword the world had aimed at me then I’ll break you using my life as the price. You and I will die together.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>…after he said those words, the curse came down on Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell spoke after he briefly thought about the past.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Carlos.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You, your head will lose all its hair.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…what?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The past had already happened, but he never had this conversation. That difference destroyed the dream world.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell continued to speak as the world inside his dream crumbled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“However, Carlos, you are one hell of a man. You deserve to be called an Archmage.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was the praise Azell wanted to give wholeheartedly to his friend, who was long gone.</span></p>
  <p><span style>2</span></p>
  <p><span style>While the Dragon Demon Princess Arrieta stayed in the Western Border Fortress, Azell trained his body and Spirit Order. He also spent the time peacefullyreading the sparse number of books in the library.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Your magical energy has increased considerably within the past few days?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“First, I’m not trying to train my magical pulse by expanding my magical energy. My progress is faster since I am trying to recover what I have lost.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell’s words were half truths.</span></p>
  <p><span style>In just 4 days of training, he had absorbed a considerable amount of power from the Dragon Slayer’s ritual, and he was able to finish making his 2nd Ring of Life. His magical energy had increased several magnitudes since he had left the ruin site.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Since his magical energy had increased, it meant Azell could use his technique more easily now. The power he could release and the amount of magical energy accumulated inside his body was much larger. He could overwhelm Giles now if they sparred.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Azell didn’t reveal his cultivation, so he let Giles win. He decided he would be careful. He didn’t want his action to be too preposterous.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After he spent the four days this way, Arrieta decided to leave the Western Border Fortress to head towards the palace.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell woke up early on the morning they would depart towards the palace. He mediated once and he lightly stretched his body. Then he put on the equipment he was given the previous day. Azell told the Dragon Princess that he only need one sword, but since he was guarding her, she insisted on giving him a leather armor.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hmm. It has been awhile.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Before he fell asleep, Azell was a prestigious knight so he used to wear a full-body armor enchanted with magic.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Prior to one becoming a knight and earning a title of nobility, most soldiers lived with having poor equipments. The leather armor was new and of good quality since it was from the military supply, but it made him think of those time.(TLN: remind him of when he was a low ranked soldier)</span></p>
  <p><span style>After he finished arming himself, Azell headed toward the infirmary before he went to the designated location.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yo.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>He gave a greeting. Rick had woken up early to get ready for his daily work.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You are leaving today?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes. I owe you a lot, Rick.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I think you have already paid back enough of what was owed me.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick put out his hand, and Azell clasped it. Then they shared a fierce handshake.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If you earn a promotion while serving the princess then don’t forget about me.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Then I don’t think I’ll ever return?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I would do the same.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rick smirked, while he spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I hope you recover your memories. I’m sure you, Azell, aren’t of common birth.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Thank you.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell shared goodbyes with Rick and he headed toward the designated location. No one was there yet, but Giles and another person soon showed up.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The other man looked to be a young knight, and he was of similar age as Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell gave his greetings.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Good morning, Sir Giles.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You are early.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell had come 20 minutes before the appointed time. He decided it wouldn’t do him any good to show up later than the others. However, no one was there when he arrived. Giles had arrived afterwards, but he was an exception.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles introduced the young knight he had arrived with.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“This is Sir Boar. He is a member of the escort group, who had traveled here with the princess. Sir Boar, this is….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ve heard of him. He was lucky enough to escape with his life thanks to the princess.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…what?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles stared back at him, while being taken aback.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The young knight named Boar had tidy brown hair, and he possessed blue eyes. He gave off an impression of being an arrogant young noble. He had a condescending expression on his face, which reinforced this impression.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The princess can’t be helped. I have know idea what her intention are. I don’t get why she would bring a man of unknown origin into the escort party, when she already has competent knights. Any ways, you better not get in our way. Just stay quiet.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>At that moment, Azell was flabbergasted. He blanked out for a moment, but he suddenly had a thought.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Should I beat up this bastard?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Before he fell asleep, after he became the Duke Karzark, there weren’t that many people that had big enough balls to be this rude towards him. (TLN: the original translation is big liver=&gt; big balls, I changed it b/c it sounded better :P)</span></p>
  <p><span style>Before the Dragon Demon war ended, there were some who were like that, but they all came to regret it in the end.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was trying to suppress his rising violent impulses when Boar spoke as if he had remembered something. He looked towards Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Well, now that I think about it, we don’t have that many members. I guess we need a guy to be an errand boy.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Sir Boar, your words are too harsh.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmm? What about my words?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>When Giles butted in, Boar acted as if there was something wrong with him. His expression indicated that he genuinely didn’t see what the problem was with his words. Giles was momentarily speechless when he saw the other’s attitude. However, soon he put on a determined expression then he spoke.</span></p>

 <p><span style>However, his dream was vivid as if it had happened not too long ago. It was that kind of dream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This must be a dream.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell dumbly thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was familiar with having a lucid dream. A normal person would question how this was possible. However, Spirit Order practitioners learn how to control the mind, so he had experienced a lot of lucid dreams until he was sick of it. If he wanted to, it was possible for him to induce a lucid dream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this dream had nothing to do with his intent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the dream, Azell was with someone within the ruins of a castle. At one time, the castle had boasted to be the most majestic in the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the castle where the Dragon Demon King Atein had presided.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There aren’t any useful things left here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He heard an apologetic voice. When he looked to his side, Carlos was there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was accustomed to his looks. He was a youthful magician with tidy brown hair, and cold gray eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Those hairs will disappear in a couple decades, and his head will be smooth.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those thoughts were the first thing that came into his mind. However, he couldn’t help it since the aged Carlos’ look was too shocking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos had no idea what Azell was thinking, and he started to sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That damn bastard Atein didn’t leave anything behind in his research lab even though he is a magician.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos had used every means imaginable to find a way to dispel the curse put on Azell by Atein. They had searched this castle a couple dozen times to find even a minor clue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was fruitless. Atein’s extensive collection of magical tomes didn’t have any clues on how to release Azell from the curse. The lab had a surprising amount of magical products, but it didn’t have anything of interest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell consoled his friend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Atein may be the very first magician. It is to be expected that he would be different from other magicians.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon race created the skill called magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, Atein was the first of the Dragon Demon race to be born into this world, and he reigned over them as king. This was why some magicians hypothesized that Atein was the progenitor of magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos became angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t talk about it as if is someone else’s business! It is a problem with your life on the line!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you know that then why are you so calm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t be mad at someone who I know is trying the hardest in this world to solve my problem. ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kook….” (TLN: just a sound he made)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos’ face reddened. He was embarrassed. Azell was dignified when facing the threat of death, yet he was the one who had lost it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m scared too, Carlos.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The current Azell smiled bitterly when he saw the scene inside his dream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes. Azell was also afraid. He had saved the world, but his future couldn’t be saved. Death was approaching closer by the hour, and he might succumb to it. Truthfully, he had been afraid and he wanted to cry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He preferred the idea of dying in battle, where he would die when he lost. He would be able to stay indifferent until that single moment would come. It was harder to bear the suffocating fear of a death that was slowly approaching him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he felt a fire burn in the corner of his heart when he thought this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Atein. The only thing you could take away from me was my life.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was determined to not let him have his(TLN:Atein) own way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Above all, he didn’t want to disappoint his friend who was desperately working for him. Even if his efforts were a failure, he never wanted his friend to see him in a dishevelled state. He wanted to show a confident and proud figure until the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was all for show and it was a childish behavior. However, as a man who had charged into battle while grasping his sword, what would be left if one took away his bravado?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He kept up this facade with his life on the line, so no one would disparage him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he thought back on it, he thought the bravado definitely helped Carlos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Azell, I really… It feels like we have switched places.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel the same. I would have never imagined this day would come.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the opposite in the Dragon Demon war. Azell was still inexperienced, and whenever he couldn’t hold back his emotions, Carlos’s cool attitude acted as the cold water that doused him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whenever the group was tired or desperate, he was the one person who didn’t falter. In the moment when everyone faltered, he withstood everything like a steel beam. He was their support.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos was a man who had taken on this role. However, after Azell was cursed, their roles had been reversed. Azell should be the one in greatest agony, but he put up a front. He acted as if he wasn’t shaken. He had to become the supporting pillar for Carlos, who at times, was about to fall apart from despair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the two passed through the ruins, they finally reached Atein’s office. There were words carved into the half broken wall with magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The one who treats the world with hate must be prepared to be hated by the world.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Azell read those words he could guess who had written it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dragon Demon King Atein.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had tried to conquer the world yet did he understand the significance of his action?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What was the Dragon Demon King’s thinking when he tried to conquer the world?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon race was born far back in the past. The very first of the Dragon Demon race, Atein, was a special existence. He had a much longer life span compared to the others of the Dragon Demon race. He had lived for more than a thousand years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was the seed that started the Dragon Demon race. He might also be the progenitor of the mysteries called magic. Why did he join up with the others of his race to conquer the world? Countless number of people had put their life on the line to fight Atein, but no one knew Atein’s real intention, which he held within his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was the one exception.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside Azell’s mind, Atein’s words brushed by.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Unfortunately, this experiment was a failure. I’m still ignorant. I have no choice but to accept this truth.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>These words made Azell shiver.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Atein had revealed his ambitions, then he(TLN: Azell) would have snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would have laughed it off if Atein like a typical magician gave a long-winded speech regarding his delusions of grandeur. However, when he was about to face his death, Atein boldly accepted his failure. Moreover, he said that the chaotic events that turned the world upside was merely an experiment</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Azell. If you are the sword the world had aimed at me then I’ll break you using my life as the price. You and I will die together.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>…after he said those words, the curse came down on Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke after he briefly thought about the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Carlos.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You, your head will lose all its hair.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The past had already happened, but he never had this conversation. That difference destroyed the dream world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell continued to speak as the world inside his dream crumbled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, Carlos, you are one hell of a man. You deserve to be called an Archmage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the praise Azell wanted to give wholeheartedly to his friend, who was long gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>2</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the Dragon Demon Princess Arrieta stayed in the Western Border Fortress, Azell trained his body and Spirit Order. He also spent the time peacefullyreading the sparse number of books in the library.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your magical energy has increased considerably within the past few days?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First, I’m not trying to train my magical pulse by expanding my magical energy. My progress is faster since I am trying to recover what I have lost.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s words were half truths.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In just 4 days of training, he had absorbed a considerable amount of power from the Dragon Slayer’s ritual, and he was able to finish making his 2nd Ring of Life. His magical energy had increased several magnitudes since he had left the ruin site.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since his magical energy had increased, it meant Azell could use his technique more easily now. The power he could release and the amount of magical energy accumulated inside his body was much larger. He could overwhelm Giles now if they sparred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Azell didn’t reveal his cultivation, so he let Giles win. He decided he would be careful. He didn’t want his action to be too preposterous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he spent the four days this way, Arrieta decided to leave the Western Border Fortress to head towards the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell woke up early on the morning they would depart towards the palace. He mediated once and he lightly stretched his body. Then he put on the equipment he was given the previous day. Azell told the Dragon Princess that he only need one sword, but since he was guarding her, she insisted on giving him a leather armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm. It has been awhile.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he fell asleep, Azell was a prestigious knight so he used to wear a full-body armor enchanted with magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prior to one becoming a knight and earning a title of nobility, most soldiers lived with having poor equipments. The leather armor was new and of good quality since it was from the military supply, but it made him think of those time.(TLN: remind him of when he was a low ranked soldier)</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he finished arming himself, Azell headed toward the infirmary before he went to the designated location.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yo.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He gave a greeting. Rick had woken up early to get ready for his daily work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are leaving today?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. I owe you a lot, Rick.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think you have already paid back enough of what was owed me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick put out his hand, and Azell clasped it. Then they shared a fierce handshake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you earn a promotion while serving the princess then don’t forget about me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I don’t think I’ll ever return?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I would do the same.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick smirked, while he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I hope you recover your memories. I’m sure you, Azell, aren’t of common birth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell shared goodbyes with Rick and he headed toward the designated location. No one was there yet, but Giles and another person soon showed up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other man looked to be a young knight, and he was of similar age as Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell gave his greetings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good morning, Sir Giles.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are early.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had come 20 minutes before the appointed time. He decided it wouldn’t do him any good to show up later than the others. However, no one was there when he arrived. Giles had arrived afterwards, but he was an exception.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles introduced the young knight he had arrived with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is Sir Boar. He is a member of the escort group, who had traveled here with the princess. Sir Boar, this is….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve heard of him. He was lucky enough to escape with his life thanks to the princess.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles stared back at him, while being taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young knight named Boar had tidy brown hair, and he possessed blue eyes. He gave off an impression of being an arrogant young noble. He had a condescending expression on his face, which reinforced this impression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The princess can’t be helped. I have know idea what her intention are. I don’t get why she would bring a man of unknown origin into the escort party, when she already has competent knights. Any ways, you better not get in our way. Just stay quiet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Azell was flabbergasted. He blanked out for a moment, but he suddenly had a thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Should I beat up this bastard?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he fell asleep, after he became the Duke Karzark, there weren’t that many people that had big enough balls to be this rude towards him. (TLN: the original translation is big liver=&gt; big balls, I changed it b/c it sounded better :P)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before the Dragon Demon war ended, there were some who were like that, but they all came to regret it in the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was trying to suppress his rising violent impulses when Boar spoke as if he had remembered something. He looked towards Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, now that I think about it, we don’t have that many members. I guess we need a guy to be an errand boy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir Boar, your words are too harsh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm? What about my words?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Giles butted in, Boar acted as if there was something wrong with him. His expression indicated that he genuinely didn’t see what the problem was with his words. Giles was momentarily speechless when he saw the other’s attitude. However, soon he put on a determined expression then he spoke.</span></p>
