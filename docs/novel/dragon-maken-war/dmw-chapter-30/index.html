  <p>Chapter 30 - Raised Social Status (4)</p>
  <p></p>
  <hr>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>4</span></p>
  <p><span style>The first day of travel passed without anything happening.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It wasn’t known whether the people called the Dragon’s Shadow had entirely given up on kidnapping Arrieta or they were avoiding operating within the influence of the Southern Border guard after failing once.</span></p>
  <p><span style>During lunchtime, they camped on the side of the road, and they reached the vicinity of a small town at night. Arrieta didn’t need to reveal her identity. At a glance, one could tell their party was of high station, so they were able to pass through the gate without any problems.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Are you not going to notify the lord of this town?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I think so. If I notify him, then our schedule would be unconditionally delayed.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>If she revealed her identity as the Dragon Demon princess, they had to hold a reception for her. The reception wouldn’t end after she stayed for a night, and she would be put in a troublesome position.</span></p>
  <p><span style>She had to maintain her relationships amongst the noble society, so she probably couldn’t excuse herself unless she had an urgent matter. This was why Arrieta refused to reveal her identity, and she decided to press on her way.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arreita spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ll go wash and rest.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I guess I’ll go play with Sir Giles for a brief time.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What do you mean by play?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta was unsure, so she asked a question. She couldn’t understand what he meant by the expression.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell replied back.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“We decided to spar against each other.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ho oh.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta showed interest. As a Dragon Demon, her inborn magical energy stood out, but she had trained in swordsmanship since her childhood. She was also a martial artist, who had learned various martial arts.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Do you mind if I look on?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I don’t mind. Sir Giles might find it a bit uncomfortable.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“He is also a knight, so he’ll consider me taking interest as an honor. Of course, wouldn’t he consider this an opportunity?”(TLN: to impress the princess)</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmm? I guess that’s how it’s going to be.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>If one could show one’s talent in front of the Dragon Demon princess Arrieta, it might lead to a promotion. Arrieta fully understood what her station signified.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Moreover, he is a talent recommended to me by the commander, so I want to see his skills. He is still very young….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Why are you looking at me like that?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Well, princess called Sir Giles ‘young’, and I thought it was really out of place.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta was a 16 year old girl, and Sir Giles was a knight. No matter how young a soldier was, one would at least be 19 years old. When one heard such words, it was no wonder it felt out of place.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arreita laughed bitterly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I can see how it could sound like that. However when I take issue with a person’s age, more often than not I don’t compare their age to mine.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I can see you doing that.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Sir Azell, what do you think about him?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Do you mean Sir Giles’ skills?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I don’t think he falls short when compared to Sir Boar. I can’t predict how he’ll do in a real battle. I’m just looking at his ability as a Spirit Order practitioner.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I also thought he possessed a good amount of magical energy. His achievement is surprising considering his age.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“When princess says those words, it’s…..”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You are making commentary on every word I say. If this was the palace, I would have hit you hard based on your insolence. No wonder she is staring daggers at you from the side.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta said this as she laughed. This caused Azell to sneak a peek to his side.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Enora was fuming, and she glared at him. It looked like she was holding herself back from saying a word to him. If Arrieta hadn’t shown an indifferent attitude, she would have stepped forward, and said something.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m not a Spirit Order practitioner, but…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>As a Dragon Demon, she couldn’t become a Spirit Order practitioner. In the first place, Spirit Order was a technique made by humans for humans.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Dragon Demon magic didn’t use magic as its foundation. The Dragon Demon race and the Dragon Demons used something that was more sensitive than magic. The technique could be considered the parent of Spirit order, and the technique called ‘Dragon Spirit Skill’ was passed down amongst them.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta was a Dragon Spirit practitioner. During a battle, this was the reason why she often used words of power as a medium for the Dragon Demon magic.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ve seen a lot of Spirit Order practitioners around, so I have the ability to discern their abilities to a certain extent. It’s hard to find someone like Sir Giles in my memories, who have this much achievement at that age. I’ve never heard of a family headed by Viscount Vince, but his offspring was well educated.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I guess Sir Giles’ family isn’t that famous.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“At the very least, it is a family I have never heard of. There are as many noble families as grains of sand. Unless there is a relationship with the other family, one wouldn’t know their names.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I can see that….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta probably had numerous names she had to memorize. As the Dragon Demon princess, she would only remember the renowned families or those who held special significance to the crown.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Also, after hearing her story, he understood why Sir Giles, who was born to a noble family and promoted to knighthood, was working as a soldier in the Western Border guard. His family wasn’t that high in status, and they didn’t have any connections. It was hard to earn a proper rank with only his skills.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Then let us go. Where are you going to do it?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I saw a garden behind the inn.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta, Azell and Enora went towards the garden. Giles, who had arrived earlier, was surprised.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Princess?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I heard you two will spar.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That, that is so, but….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I want to see your skills, which the commander was so complimentary of. Can you show me?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles, who was taken aback by Arrieta’s question, hardened his face. Then the light in his eyes changed as he answered back.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It will be my honor.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was a bit surprised by his attitude.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Unexpectedly, he might have ambitions for success?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>From Azell’s point of view, Giles wasn’t a person that was too attached to promotion or power. When they were in the Western Border guard, he never imposed his authority over Azell, who was of unknown origin. Even today, he didn’t react to every instances of Sir Boar trying to seize the leadership role. A person like that was overflowing with enthusiasm when Arrieta expressed her desire to see his skills. It was odd.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Maybe he always wanted to in his heart, but his personality didn’t allow it?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>That might be possible. He probably wanted to show his aggressiveness on the battlefield. He probably wanted to be accepted for his skills, and receive a promotion through his accomplishments . However, there were those like him who were clumsy at creating various opportunities for promotions.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles spoke in front of him as Azell showed interest.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Azell, no… Sir Azell. Could we change the arrangement?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“How?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After Azell was promoted to knighthood, he spoke to Giles as an equal. Before he had done so out of respect for his rank, but he didn’t have any reason to do so now.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He also told Giles to treat him with ease, and he should drop the respectful form of speech. Unexpectedly, Giles smoothly accepted Azell’s change in attitude.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Let us spar, so we can show everything we got.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“We’ll do that. However, let us restrain ourselves from using big technique with physical after-effects, so we won’t destroy the surrounding.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Understood.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The two of them raised their swords and they faced each other.</span></p>
  <p><span style>5</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell worried about what to do when he saw Giles, who was more serious then ever before.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘What should I do?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles still didn’t know about Azell’s skill level. It was because Azell had faced him, while he somewhat adjusted to Giles’ level.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Arrieta already knew about Azell’s skill level. She was probably the only person in this current era, who possessed the most information about him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I guess I can’t half ass it.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell thought about it for a moment, and he eventually came to a decision. However, it would be unfair for him to immediately show his skill against Giles. He decided to arouse his attention.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Sir Giles. I’ll be attacking first.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“This is unusual.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles found it odd. Azell always waited and counter-attacked during their sparring sessions, and he had rarely taken the initiative. Azell had done this to sell the perception of ‘I’m short on magical energy’ to Giles.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Of course, Azell was still short on magical energy. The strength he had absorbed from the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual was rapidly processed, and it was used to complete his second Ring of Life plus its dual banding. He had started making his 3rd Ring of Life, but it couldn’t be compare to his glory days.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, if he compared himself from couple days ago, the difference was far apart as earth from the heavens. Not only did the amount of magical energy inside his body changed, but the quality had also changed. When one used the first level of magical energy, there is a big difference between amplifying it through one Ring of Life and two Rings of Life. After the Dual Banding is complete, the difference was again much larger.</span></p>
  <p><span style>If the person controlling the power was as skilled as Azell, then it goes without saying he’ll be outstanding.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles shivered as he looked into Azell’s eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘What is it?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Until now, he felt a sensation he had never felt when facing Azell. He had already accepted that Azell was a Spirit Order practitioner with outstanding techniques. However, when he faced him right now, it was the first time he felt an imposing feeling emitted from him. It felt sharp enough to cut.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Choo-paht!</span></p>
  <p><span style>In the next moment, a blade cut Giles, and it passed on by.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I’ve been had…..?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>In an instant, Giles felt the sensation of being cut. The blade flew out without showing any signs, and it accurately cut at his body.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, even as this was going on, Giles swung his sword as he retreated.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Clang!</span></p>
  <p><span style>The swords clashed, and a sharp sound rang out.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This sound woke Giles from his stupor. Giles panted as he breathed rapidly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…what happened?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“As expected, Sir Giles has a keen sense. I don’t know who his teacher is, but he trained him well. Very thoroughly.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was laughing in front of him. As Giles saw him smile leisurely, cold sweat started dripping down his face. When fighting someone, he would watch his opponent, and he would predict the next move. Gaze, expression, breathing, movement of the shoulders, etc…. One had to process all the information from the five senses, and it became an ingredient for an insight.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Therefore, if one faced someone who was skilled then the opponent would, of course, try to disrupt the other’s insight. The movement would blend substance and weakness to trick the opponent. It drastically cut down on the time needed to react.</span></p>
  <p><span style>But, the previous attack by Azell…. There were no warnings about when, where or how it would happen.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘He didn’t even move. No, he moved after he thrusted.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Gile’s mind replayed the event from a moment ago.</span></p>
  <p><span style>They had started to lightly spread their magic to probe each other. Then Azell’s magical energy suddenly hardened, and the thread of mental wave emerged into Giles’ territory. The illusion of a blade sliced him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Afterwards, Azell ran forward, he swung his sword.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles blocked the attack by luck. When he was learning his family’s martial arts, and Spirit Order Mysteries, he had learned a technique which enabled him to separate his mind and body. It he hadn’t learned to block with this technique, then he would have lost on that single strike.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Giles spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…impressive. Even my father had never shown me a technique like that. I really thought I was going to be cut. It is akin to the hallucination magic used by magicians. How is this possible?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>At those words, Azell spoke as if he was a teacher lecturing his student.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Spirit Order is a technique that can manipuate the mind. When one train martial arts, you train your body, learn techniques, and then train your mind. However, Spirit Order is the opposite. As you train your mind, you are able to feel the movement of the magical energy, then you learn the technique. Finally, you apply it to your body.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Basically, this is possible if one learns the techniques that control the mind?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was the reason why it was called Spirit Order. The Dragon Demons and the Dragon Demon race used Dragon Demon magic as their nucleus. It was an ‘intuitive and sense-based magic used through one’s body’, so it had evolved into a different form of magic.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was mystified.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘The techniques that handle the magical energy and the techniques that uses one’s body, is on par with my era. Instead, there are some aspects that are better. He didn’t luck into the previous block. It is the result of training an established technique.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, the techniques dealing with the mind was of very low standard. Was Giles inexperienced?</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Probably not.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>When he looked back at the events couple days ago, it wasn’t the case. At the time, a small group of monsters didn’t hide their mental energies, when they were carrying out a sneak attack. Moreover, the troops couldn’t read their mental energy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Even so, Giles had learned a high level technique in shielding his mind. It wasn’t an active skill. It was like erecting a castle wall around one’s mind. It was an naive way to do it, but the quality was above average.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It seemed like many of the techniques that could influence the minds of one’s opponent was lost. If one thought about the origin of Spirit Order, this was totally absurd.</span></p>

 <p>Chapter 30 - Raised Social Status (4)</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>4</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first day of travel passed without anything happening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t known whether the people called the Dragon’s Shadow had entirely given up on kidnapping Arrieta or they were avoiding operating within the influence of the Southern Border guard after failing once.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During lunchtime, they camped on the side of the road, and they reached the vicinity of a small town at night. Arrieta didn’t need to reveal her identity. At a glance, one could tell their party was of high station, so they were able to pass through the gate without any problems.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you not going to notify the lord of this town?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think so. If I notify him, then our schedule would be unconditionally delayed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If she revealed her identity as the Dragon Demon princess, they had to hold a reception for her. The reception wouldn’t end after she stayed for a night, and she would be put in a troublesome position.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had to maintain her relationships amongst the noble society, so she probably couldn’t excuse herself unless she had an urgent matter. This was why Arrieta refused to reveal her identity, and she decided to press on her way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arreita spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll go wash and rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess I’ll go play with Sir Giles for a brief time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean by play?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta was unsure, so she asked a question. She couldn’t understand what he meant by the expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell replied back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We decided to spar against each other.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ho oh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta showed interest. As a Dragon Demon, her inborn magical energy stood out, but she had trained in swordsmanship since her childhood. She was also a martial artist, who had learned various martial arts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you mind if I look on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t mind. Sir Giles might find it a bit uncomfortable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is also a knight, so he’ll consider me taking interest as an honor. Of course, wouldn’t he consider this an opportunity?”(TLN: to impress the princess)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm? I guess that’s how it’s going to be.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If one could show one’s talent in front of the Dragon Demon princess Arrieta, it might lead to a promotion. Arrieta fully understood what her station signified.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Moreover, he is a talent recommended to me by the commander, so I want to see his skills. He is still very young….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you looking at me like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, princess called Sir Giles ‘young’, and I thought it was really out of place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta was a 16 year old girl, and Sir Giles was a knight. No matter how young a soldier was, one would at least be 19 years old. When one heard such words, it was no wonder it felt out of place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arreita laughed bitterly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can see how it could sound like that. However when I take issue with a person’s age, more often than not I don’t compare their age to mine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can see you doing that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir Azell, what do you think about him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you mean Sir Giles’ skills?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t think he falls short when compared to Sir Boar. I can’t predict how he’ll do in a real battle. I’m just looking at his ability as a Spirit Order practitioner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I also thought he possessed a good amount of magical energy. His achievement is surprising considering his age.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When princess says those words, it’s…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are making commentary on every word I say. If this was the palace, I would have hit you hard based on your insolence. No wonder she is staring daggers at you from the side.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta said this as she laughed. This caused Azell to sneak a peek to his side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enora was fuming, and she glared at him. It looked like she was holding herself back from saying a word to him. If Arrieta hadn’t shown an indifferent attitude, she would have stepped forward, and said something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not a Spirit Order practitioner, but…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a Dragon Demon, she couldn’t become a Spirit Order practitioner. In the first place, Spirit Order was a technique made by humans for humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Dragon Demon magic didn’t use magic as its foundation. The Dragon Demon race and the Dragon Demons used something that was more sensitive than magic. The technique could be considered the parent of Spirit order, and the technique called ‘Dragon Spirit Skill’ was passed down amongst them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta was a Dragon Spirit practitioner. During a battle, this was the reason why she often used words of power as a medium for the Dragon Demon magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve seen a lot of Spirit Order practitioners around, so I have the ability to discern their abilities to a certain extent. It’s hard to find someone like Sir Giles in my memories, who have this much achievement at that age. I’ve never heard of a family headed by Viscount Vince, but his offspring was well educated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess Sir Giles’ family isn’t that famous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“At the very least, it is a family I have never heard of. There are as many noble families as grains of sand. Unless there is a relationship with the other family, one wouldn’t know their names.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can see that….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta probably had numerous names she had to memorize. As the Dragon Demon princess, she would only remember the renowned families or those who held special significance to the crown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Also, after hearing her story, he understood why Sir Giles, who was born to a noble family and promoted to knighthood, was working as a soldier in the Western Border guard. His family wasn’t that high in status, and they didn’t have any connections. It was hard to earn a proper rank with only his skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let us go. Where are you going to do it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I saw a garden behind the inn.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta, Azell and Enora went towards the garden. Giles, who had arrived earlier, was surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Princess?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard you two will spar.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That, that is so, but….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to see your skills, which the commander was so complimentary of. Can you show me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles, who was taken aback by Arrieta’s question, hardened his face. Then the light in his eyes changed as he answered back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It will be my honor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was a bit surprised by his attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Unexpectedly, he might have ambitions for success?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>From Azell’s point of view, Giles wasn’t a person that was too attached to promotion or power. When they were in the Western Border guard, he never imposed his authority over Azell, who was of unknown origin. Even today, he didn’t react to every instances of Sir Boar trying to seize the leadership role. A person like that was overflowing with enthusiasm when Arrieta expressed her desire to see his skills. It was odd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Maybe he always wanted to in his heart, but his personality didn’t allow it?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>That might be possible. He probably wanted to show his aggressiveness on the battlefield. He probably wanted to be accepted for his skills, and receive a promotion through his accomplishments . However, there were those like him who were clumsy at creating various opportunities for promotions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles spoke in front of him as Azell showed interest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Azell, no… Sir Azell. Could we change the arrangement?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Azell was promoted to knighthood, he spoke to Giles as an equal. Before he had done so out of respect for his rank, but he didn’t have any reason to do so now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He also told Giles to treat him with ease, and he should drop the respectful form of speech. Unexpectedly, Giles smoothly accepted Azell’s change in attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let us spar, so we can show everything we got.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll do that. However, let us restrain ourselves from using big technique with physical after-effects, so we won’t destroy the surrounding.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them raised their swords and they faced each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>5</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell worried about what to do when he saw Giles, who was more serious then ever before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What should I do?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles still didn’t know about Azell’s skill level. It was because Azell had faced him, while he somewhat adjusted to Giles’ level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Arrieta already knew about Azell’s skill level. She was probably the only person in this current era, who possessed the most information about him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I guess I can’t half ass it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell thought about it for a moment, and he eventually came to a decision. However, it would be unfair for him to immediately show his skill against Giles. He decided to arouse his attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir Giles. I’ll be attacking first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is unusual.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles found it odd. Azell always waited and counter-attacked during their sparring sessions, and he had rarely taken the initiative. Azell had done this to sell the perception of ‘I’m short on magical energy’ to Giles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Azell was still short on magical energy. The strength he had absorbed from the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual was rapidly processed, and it was used to complete his second Ring of Life plus its dual banding. He had started making his 3rd Ring of Life, but it couldn’t be compare to his glory days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, if he compared himself from couple days ago, the difference was far apart as earth from the heavens. Not only did the amount of magical energy inside his body changed, but the quality had also changed. When one used the first level of magical energy, there is a big difference between amplifying it through one Ring of Life and two Rings of Life. After the Dual Banding is complete, the difference was again much larger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the person controlling the power was as skilled as Azell, then it goes without saying he’ll be outstanding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles shivered as he looked into Azell’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is it?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Until now, he felt a sensation he had never felt when facing Azell. He had already accepted that Azell was a Spirit Order practitioner with outstanding techniques. However, when he faced him right now, it was the first time he felt an imposing feeling emitted from him. It felt sharp enough to cut.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Choo-paht!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next moment, a blade cut Giles, and it passed on by.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’ve been had…..?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In an instant, Giles felt the sensation of being cut. The blade flew out without showing any signs, and it accurately cut at his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, even as this was going on, Giles swung his sword as he retreated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clang!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The swords clashed, and a sharp sound rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This sound woke Giles from his stupor. Giles panted as he breathed rapidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…what happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected, Sir Giles has a keen sense. I don’t know who his teacher is, but he trained him well. Very thoroughly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was laughing in front of him. As Giles saw him smile leisurely, cold sweat started dripping down his face. When fighting someone, he would watch his opponent, and he would predict the next move. Gaze, expression, breathing, movement of the shoulders, etc…. One had to process all the information from the five senses, and it became an ingredient for an insight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, if one faced someone who was skilled then the opponent would, of course, try to disrupt the other’s insight. The movement would blend substance and weakness to trick the opponent. It drastically cut down on the time needed to react.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, the previous attack by Azell…. There were no warnings about when, where or how it would happen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He didn’t even move. No, he moved after he thrusted.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gile’s mind replayed the event from a moment ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had started to lightly spread their magic to probe each other. Then Azell’s magical energy suddenly hardened, and the thread of mental wave emerged into Giles’ territory. The illusion of a blade sliced him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afterwards, Azell ran forward, he swung his sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles blocked the attack by luck. When he was learning his family’s martial arts, and Spirit Order Mysteries, he had learned a technique which enabled him to separate his mind and body. It he hadn’t learned to block with this technique, then he would have lost on that single strike.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…impressive. Even my father had never shown me a technique like that. I really thought I was going to be cut. It is akin to the hallucination magic used by magicians. How is this possible?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At those words, Azell spoke as if he was a teacher lecturing his student.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Spirit Order is a technique that can manipuate the mind. When one train martial arts, you train your body, learn techniques, and then train your mind. However, Spirit Order is the opposite. As you train your mind, you are able to feel the movement of the magical energy, then you learn the technique. Finally, you apply it to your body.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Basically, this is possible if one learns the techniques that control the mind?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the reason why it was called Spirit Order. The Dragon Demons and the Dragon Demon race used Dragon Demon magic as their nucleus. It was an ‘intuitive and sense-based magic used through one’s body’, so it had evolved into a different form of magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was mystified.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The techniques that handle the magical energy and the techniques that uses one’s body, is on par with my era. Instead, there are some aspects that are better. He didn’t luck into the previous block. It is the result of training an established technique.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the techniques dealing with the mind was of very low standard. Was Giles inexperienced?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Probably not.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he looked back at the events couple days ago, it wasn’t the case. At the time, a small group of monsters didn’t hide their mental energies, when they were carrying out a sneak attack. Moreover, the troops couldn’t read their mental energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even so, Giles had learned a high level technique in shielding his mind. It wasn’t an active skill. It was like erecting a castle wall around one’s mind. It was an naive way to do it, but the quality was above average.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like many of the techniques that could influence the minds of one’s opponent was lost. If one thought about the origin of Spirit Order, this was totally absurd.</span></p>
