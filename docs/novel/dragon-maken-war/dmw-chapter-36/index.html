  <p></p>
  <hr>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>1</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis loved the dark when there wasn’t a single speck of light present. She could achieve complete serenity only in a space with this kind of darkness. However, she loved the darkness, not the silence.</span></p>
  <p><span style>She was staring in to the empty darkness when a whisper entered her mind.</span></p>
  <p><span style>-You haven’t concluded your business yet?</span></p>
  <p><span style>She heard a voice from a very distant place. From across the mountains, lakes and even beyond the boundaries drawn on the map by humans, the voice reached the dark snow-covered fields…</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis answered.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The preparation is finished. We’ll have it wrapped up soon..”</span></p>
  <p><span style>-Why are you taking so long?</span></p>
  <p><span style>-That place is a dangerous land for you.</span></p>
  <p><span style>-If you aren’t careful, they will realize your existence. There is a danger of the Dragon Demon Duke moving</span></p>
  <p><span style>-Maybe even Count Michael…….</span></p>
  <p><span style>There weren’t only one voice. From various places from the continent, the voices flew in, and they were having a conversation as if they were sitting next to each other.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Do we have any reasons to fear them? They are parasites living off the humans.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis revealed her distaste.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Dragon Demon Duke, and Count Michael was listed as people they had to be cautious around in the Rulain Kingdom. Dragon Demon Duke was of the Dragon Demon race, and Count Michael was a Dragon Demon.</span></p>
  <p><span style>There weren’t that many from the Dragon Demon race, who had integrated into the human society, so their names were well-known. They were able to live longer than humans, and most of them held great power. There were few who didn’t train their fighting technique and magic after assimilating into the human society. Most of them cultivated their talent to spread their fame with their strength.</span></p>
  <p><span style>From the perspective of Dragon Demon King’s worshipers, they were existence to be afraid of, since they’ll indiscriminately kill the worshipers. However, Niberis wasn’t afraid. Her voice indicated she was unsatisfied.</span></p>
  <p><span style>-We can’t underestimate them.</span></p>
  <p><span style>-Our forces are too weak to go against the Rulain Kingdom. If we let down our guard, then we might meet with disaster.</span></p>
  <p><span style>-Niberis. We all acknowledge you possess great abilities, but….</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I understand. However, there is a reason why I had delayed carrying out this mission.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis felt disgusted.</span></p>
  <p><span style>In the organization, she was considered to be young. Moreover, she was treated like a child. Now that she thought about it, the old elders were basically like senior citizens nagging at everything. She felt her irritation well up.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m being sufficiently cautious. I am waiting for the day when the clouds will cover the moon. When the world is blanked by complete darkness, I’ll take care of them.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The power of the Magicians were significantly influenced by the surrounding. It also depended on what their specialty was in magic, and where they placed their source of magic.</span></p>
  <p><span style>As a Magician, Niberis’ source was the darkness.</span></p>
  <p><span style>When the darkness grew thicker, her power grew stronger. Moreover, on a night without a moon, her presence wouldn’t leak out. She could covertly put up a barrier that could isolate one from the outside.</span></p>
  <p><span style>She hadn’t attacked Arrieta’s party, because she had been waiting for this day. She had chosen a suitable location and the day to attack Arrieta’s party. Then she prepared as she predicted the climate.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The one with the name soaked in sin has a secret…. I’ll definitely find out what it is.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>2</span></p>
  <p><span style>For good or for bad, a person doesn’t change easily.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, if given a chance, a person could change in a surprising way.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It had been a while since Azell was able to experience this truth.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If…if you don’t mind, could you give me some pointers, Sir Azell?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Boar asked after he summoned his courage.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The day after the fight, Boar didn’t complain as he shared in the work. He did the dishes, prepared the camp and he also cleaned after himself. He even asked for things to do from his own volition, and the discontent he had in his eyes from before melted away like snow.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Still, he didn’t get along with the other party members. Previously, he kept a natural distance between them, but now he hung back while he studied us.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He knew why Boar was doing this. Azell, Giles and Arrieta discussed each other’s techniques after sparring sessions, and he probably wanted to join in.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After four days after the duel, he finally worked up his courage.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was a bit surprised at his change in attitude, but he readily accepted it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ll welcome it any time.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta spoke when she saw this.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You are really popular, Sir Azell.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I guess so.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Unlike me.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…Hahaha.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell awkwardly laughed when he saw Arrieta sulk.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Since Giles sparred with Azell, Arrieta wanted to spar with Giles. However, he said he was afraid his inexperience might lead him to make a mistake. He was afraid of making a mistake, so he declined her request. This caused Arrieta to sulk.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was the same for Boar, who joined them later. During the spar, Azell discreetly put out a feeler. The two of them told him they were uncomfortable by the fact Arrieta was a woman.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmmm. That is… The fact that she is of royal blood makes it overwhelming. Moreover, she is a woman. I don’t think…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Boar gave a similar answer.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ve never pointed my sword against a woman. I want to fulfill princess’ expectation, but….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>There were women fighters in the Rulain Kingdom. However, the number was low compared to the male counterparts. Moreover, chivalry was a bit full of machismo, and narcissism. These two young men were earnest knights, so from their perspective, they felt uncomfortable crossing swords with a woman.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was simultaneously baffled, and understanding of the two people’s attitude.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Well, what if your enemy is a woman? Last time there was a woman amongst the group called the Dragon’s Shadow.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmmm.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“T, that is…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell clicked his tongue inside as he looked at the conflicted Giles and Boar.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Jeez. It turned out like this after 220 years have passed?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>During the Dragon Demon War, there were a lot of female enemies. Whether it was Dragon Demons or those of the Dragon Demon race, both males and females exhibited overwhelming power. Moreover, there had been a lot of human women, who joined the Dragon Demon King’s camp. They recruited people who were shunned by the society. Then they guided those with magical talent, and they were commonly used as troops. Magical talent didn’t discriminate between gender, so it was common to come across a strong female magician.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was why Azell faced a woman using all of his might. However, it seemed this generation of knights didn’t feel the same way.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘These guys are being troublesome. It’ll be trouble if I do nothing.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>If they hesitated when facing Regina, because she was female then their head will be severed in a blink of an eye. It was imperative to get rid of their awkwardness when fighting a woman.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell gave Arrieta a suggestion.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…this is why I wan’t you to give them an order.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Are you trying to make me a bad woman?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It will be your noble sacrifice.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You are skilled at putting a pretty package over it. Now I’m sure you are a bad man.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You got me.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta snorted then she followed Azell’s instruction. After that day, Giles and Boar was forced to fight Arrieta. Moreover, they experienced getting absolutely annihilated by her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>In the beginning, they forcefully insisted that they were worried Arrieta would get hurt. However, Arrieta snorted then she dominated both of them.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Both of you are very prideful. Even the kingdom’s famed knight tried their best against me without holding their skills back. How can the two of you, who are so young, be so arrogant?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>This made Giles and Boar embarrassed, but they still refused to yield. They acknowledged Arrieta’s skill, but their pride was hurt when they lost to a 17 year old girl.</span></p>
  <p><span style>From that point on, they faced Arrieta with a serious attitude. Since this was a sparring session, Arrieta didn’t bull them over my using her Dragon Energy. This allowed her to experience a meaningful sparring session.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, a problem occurred on that very night.</span></p>
  <p><span style>3</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Mmmm?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell’s eyes opened in the dead of the night.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Originally, they had planned on staying in a village across the mountain, but several small accidents during the trip delayed them. In the end, they weren’t able to cross the mountain, and they had to camp outside. One of the small accidents was actually coming across a party with a broken carriage axle. It had broken when they were running away from the monsters.</span></p>
  <p><span style>His party chased away the monsters. While receiving their thanks, Arrieta’s party helped them return to the previous town they had just left.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This caused a delay, so they had to sleep outside. They had hoped to avoid this.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…Sir Azell?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Boar, who was standing guard, turned a questioning look towards him. Azell put a finger to his mouth. He signaled to Boar to stay quiet.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Even though, there was a night watch, Azell hadn’t lowered his guard. Since he already knew someone was watching them, he couldn’t be careless.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Even when he was sleeping, he put up a barrier fence that reacted to a specific set of triggers. Some might think this could be only done by a Magician, but it was possible for a Spirit Order practioner to use this ‘technique’. It was established as a technique in Azell’s time, and it had been passed on since then.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Something unknown was caught in the barrier fence.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘This evil energy… Is it a black magician?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>He felt a dark and damp energy of darkness.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This energy was hiding magic. He could sense someone was trying hard to hide their existence.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, he had been trained by the one armed swordsman, Balf. Azell’s absolute senses was focused to detect the energy leak coming front the hidden one. He was sensitive enough to feel the reverberation caused by the energy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Moreover, this ground resonance…….’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell touched the ground as he focused his mind. He used the vibration caused by the slight tremor to find the large numbered group approaching them from a couple hundred meter away.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘However, I can’t sense their group thought. A big fish has shown up.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>If it was a normal person… No, even if it was a Spirit Order practitioner, they would have ignored the faint and barely existent vibration from the ground. However, Azell had used it to speculate the existence of the enemies.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, when he expanded his senses, he couldn’t feel their group thought, so he knew this was the result of someone using the power of magic. This person was different from the Dragon’s Shadow Magician, who used the monsters to attack them in the Balan forest. There was a powerful magician here, who probably held the common knowledge used in the Dragon Demon War.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell immediately woke his companions up.</span></p>
  <p><span style>-Everyone wake up. Don’t make a sound. Just pretend to be asleep.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He didn’t open his mouth. He delivered his message using Whispering. Then he used a faint mental energy to naturally stimulate his eyes to open.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The reason why he used such a cumbersome method was simple.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He felt gazes on him. It wasn’t just one or two people. He was sure the enemy was observing their location from within visual range.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Regina. That woman is here.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell never forgot the energy signature he had once seen. Of course, this was limited to those like Sir Giles, who had magical energy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Also, Kirion.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>From beneath the earth, he could feel Kirion’s energy signature. When the enemy starts their attack, he’ll probably use his special skill. He’ll use his magic that allows him to freely travel underneath the earth to ambush them.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Still, how is the bastard hiding his Dragon Demon energy?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>He was able to sense their existence using the mental wave and magical wave that was faintly flowing out. However, he couldn’t feel the Dragon Demon energy used by the Dragon Demon. It was the same last time. It was thoroughly hidden enough to fool Arrieta and also Azell’s senses.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘These bastards wasn’t that skilled… Did they develop a new method during my sleep?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>The society treated the Dragon Demon King worshipers as if they deserved to die. Therefore, it wouldn’t be too strange if they developed a technique that allow one to hide themselves. Wouldn’t 220 years be enough for this?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell had already asked about the skills developed during his sleep. For example, Giles used a defensive technique that could separate the mind and the body.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Hmmm…….’</span></p>
  <p><span style>When he was deep in thought, Arrieta opened her eyes as she asked a question.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"What’s happening?"</span></p>

 <p><span style>-Why are you taking so long?</span></p>
 <p><span style>-That place is a dangerous land for you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-If you aren’t careful, they will realize your existence. There is a danger of the Dragon Demon Duke moving</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Maybe even Count Michael…….</span></p>
 <p><span style>There weren’t only one voice. From various places from the continent, the voices flew in, and they were having a conversation as if they were sitting next to each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do we have any reasons to fear them? They are parasites living off the humans.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis revealed her distaste.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon Duke, and Count Michael was listed as people they had to be cautious around in the Rulain Kingdom. Dragon Demon Duke was of the Dragon Demon race, and Count Michael was a Dragon Demon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There weren’t that many from the Dragon Demon race, who had integrated into the human society, so their names were well-known. They were able to live longer than humans, and most of them held great power. There were few who didn’t train their fighting technique and magic after assimilating into the human society. Most of them cultivated their talent to spread their fame with their strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the perspective of Dragon Demon King’s worshipers, they were existence to be afraid of, since they’ll indiscriminately kill the worshipers. However, Niberis wasn’t afraid. Her voice indicated she was unsatisfied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-We can’t underestimate them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Our forces are too weak to go against the Rulain Kingdom. If we let down our guard, then we might meet with disaster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Niberis. We all acknowledge you possess great abilities, but….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand. However, there is a reason why I had delayed carrying out this mission.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis felt disgusted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the organization, she was considered to be young. Moreover, she was treated like a child. Now that she thought about it, the old elders were basically like senior citizens nagging at everything. She felt her irritation well up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m being sufficiently cautious. I am waiting for the day when the clouds will cover the moon. When the world is blanked by complete darkness, I’ll take care of them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The power of the Magicians were significantly influenced by the surrounding. It also depended on what their specialty was in magic, and where they placed their source of magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a Magician, Niberis’ source was the darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the darkness grew thicker, her power grew stronger. Moreover, on a night without a moon, her presence wouldn’t leak out. She could covertly put up a barrier that could isolate one from the outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hadn’t attacked Arrieta’s party, because she had been waiting for this day. She had chosen a suitable location and the day to attack Arrieta’s party. Then she prepared as she predicted the climate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The one with the name soaked in sin has a secret…. I’ll definitely find out what it is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>2</span></p>
 <p><span style>For good or for bad, a person doesn’t change easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, if given a chance, a person could change in a surprising way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had been a while since Azell was able to experience this truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If…if you don’t mind, could you give me some pointers, Sir Azell?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boar asked after he summoned his courage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The day after the fight, Boar didn’t complain as he shared in the work. He did the dishes, prepared the camp and he also cleaned after himself. He even asked for things to do from his own volition, and the discontent he had in his eyes from before melted away like snow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, he didn’t get along with the other party members. Previously, he kept a natural distance between them, but now he hung back while he studied us.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew why Boar was doing this. Azell, Giles and Arrieta discussed each other’s techniques after sparring sessions, and he probably wanted to join in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After four days after the duel, he finally worked up his courage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was a bit surprised at his change in attitude, but he readily accepted it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll welcome it any time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta spoke when she saw this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are really popular, Sir Azell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unlike me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…Hahaha.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell awkwardly laughed when he saw Arrieta sulk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Giles sparred with Azell, Arrieta wanted to spar with Giles. However, he said he was afraid his inexperience might lead him to make a mistake. He was afraid of making a mistake, so he declined her request. This caused Arrieta to sulk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the same for Boar, who joined them later. During the spar, Azell discreetly put out a feeler. The two of them told him they were uncomfortable by the fact Arrieta was a woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm. That is… The fact that she is of royal blood makes it overwhelming. Moreover, she is a woman. I don’t think…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boar gave a similar answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve never pointed my sword against a woman. I want to fulfill princess’ expectation, but….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were women fighters in the Rulain Kingdom. However, the number was low compared to the male counterparts. Moreover, chivalry was a bit full of machismo, and narcissism. These two young men were earnest knights, so from their perspective, they felt uncomfortable crossing swords with a woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was simultaneously baffled, and understanding of the two people’s attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, what if your enemy is a woman? Last time there was a woman amongst the group called the Dragon’s Shadow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T, that is…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell clicked his tongue inside as he looked at the conflicted Giles and Boar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Jeez. It turned out like this after 220 years have passed?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the Dragon Demon War, there were a lot of female enemies. Whether it was Dragon Demons or those of the Dragon Demon race, both males and females exhibited overwhelming power. Moreover, there had been a lot of human women, who joined the Dragon Demon King’s camp. They recruited people who were shunned by the society. Then they guided those with magical talent, and they were commonly used as troops. Magical talent didn’t discriminate between gender, so it was common to come across a strong female magician.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why Azell faced a woman using all of his might. However, it seemed this generation of knights didn’t feel the same way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘These guys are being troublesome. It’ll be trouble if I do nothing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If they hesitated when facing Regina, because she was female then their head will be severed in a blink of an eye. It was imperative to get rid of their awkwardness when fighting a woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell gave Arrieta a suggestion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…this is why I wan’t you to give them an order.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you trying to make me a bad woman?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It will be your noble sacrifice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are skilled at putting a pretty package over it. Now I’m sure you are a bad man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You got me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta snorted then she followed Azell’s instruction. After that day, Giles and Boar was forced to fight Arrieta. Moreover, they experienced getting absolutely annihilated by her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the beginning, they forcefully insisted that they were worried Arrieta would get hurt. However, Arrieta snorted then she dominated both of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Both of you are very prideful. Even the kingdom’s famed knight tried their best against me without holding their skills back. How can the two of you, who are so young, be so arrogant?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This made Giles and Boar embarrassed, but they still refused to yield. They acknowledged Arrieta’s skill, but their pride was hurt when they lost to a 17 year old girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From that point on, they faced Arrieta with a serious attitude. Since this was a sparring session, Arrieta didn’t bull them over my using her Dragon Energy. This allowed her to experience a meaningful sparring session.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, a problem occurred on that very night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>3</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Mmmm?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s eyes opened in the dead of the night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, they had planned on staying in a village across the mountain, but several small accidents during the trip delayed them. In the end, they weren’t able to cross the mountain, and they had to camp outside. One of the small accidents was actually coming across a party with a broken carriage axle. It had broken when they were running away from the monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His party chased away the monsters. While receiving their thanks, Arrieta’s party helped them return to the previous town they had just left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This caused a delay, so they had to sleep outside. They had hoped to avoid this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…Sir Azell?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boar, who was standing guard, turned a questioning look towards him. Azell put a finger to his mouth. He signaled to Boar to stay quiet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though, there was a night watch, Azell hadn’t lowered his guard. Since he already knew someone was watching them, he couldn’t be careless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even when he was sleeping, he put up a barrier fence that reacted to a specific set of triggers. Some might think this could be only done by a Magician, but it was possible for a Spirit Order practioner to use this ‘technique’. It was established as a technique in Azell’s time, and it had been passed on since then.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Something unknown was caught in the barrier fence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This evil energy… Is it a black magician?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt a dark and damp energy of darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This energy was hiding magic. He could sense someone was trying hard to hide their existence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he had been trained by the one armed swordsman, Balf. Azell’s absolute senses was focused to detect the energy leak coming front the hidden one. He was sensitive enough to feel the reverberation caused by the energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Moreover, this ground resonance…….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell touched the ground as he focused his mind. He used the vibration caused by the slight tremor to find the large numbered group approaching them from a couple hundred meter away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘However, I can’t sense their group thought. A big fish has shown up.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was a normal person… No, even if it was a Spirit Order practitioner, they would have ignored the faint and barely existent vibration from the ground. However, Azell had used it to speculate the existence of the enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when he expanded his senses, he couldn’t feel their group thought, so he knew this was the result of someone using the power of magic. This person was different from the Dragon’s Shadow Magician, who used the monsters to attack them in the Balan forest. There was a powerful magician here, who probably held the common knowledge used in the Dragon Demon War.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell immediately woke his companions up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Everyone wake up. Don’t make a sound. Just pretend to be asleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t open his mouth. He delivered his message using Whispering. Then he used a faint mental energy to naturally stimulate his eyes to open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason why he used such a cumbersome method was simple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt gazes on him. It wasn’t just one or two people. He was sure the enemy was observing their location from within visual range.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Regina. That woman is here.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell never forgot the energy signature he had once seen. Of course, this was limited to those like Sir Giles, who had magical energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Also, Kirion.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>From beneath the earth, he could feel Kirion’s energy signature. When the enemy starts their attack, he’ll probably use his special skill. He’ll use his magic that allows him to freely travel underneath the earth to ambush them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Still, how is the bastard hiding his Dragon Demon energy?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was able to sense their existence using the mental wave and magical wave that was faintly flowing out. However, he couldn’t feel the Dragon Demon energy used by the Dragon Demon. It was the same last time. It was thoroughly hidden enough to fool Arrieta and also Azell’s senses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘These bastards wasn’t that skilled… Did they develop a new method during my sleep?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The society treated the Dragon Demon King worshipers as if they deserved to die. Therefore, it wouldn’t be too strange if they developed a technique that allow one to hide themselves. Wouldn’t 220 years be enough for this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had already asked about the skills developed during his sleep. For example, Giles used a defensive technique that could separate the mind and the body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Hmmm…….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he was deep in thought, Arrieta opened her eyes as she asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What’s happening?"</span></p>
