 <p>Chapter 89 - Birth of the Dragon Sword (4)</p>
 <p><span style>“I heard an interesting story about you in regards to what my brother went through. &nbsp;Could you confirm the veracity of this story?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Which story are you referring to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher said that the Dragon Demon king worshippers had brought a Thunder Dragon to facilitate Segiar's kidnapping. &nbsp;He said you bested a Thunder Dragon in an one-on-one battle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is true.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As I had suspected…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had expected it to be true, but she was still surprised when Azell confirmed it. &nbsp;A single human had fought and won against a Dragon. &nbsp;How was such a thing possible?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, this wasn't just anyone. &nbsp;If it was Azell, she thought it was possible. &nbsp;When she had travelled with him, Azell had been an existence that was full of surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know I'm reaching back far for this question, but did you kill the Earth Dragon we met in the Balan Forest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;It was possible, because something anomalous occurred to my benefit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell didn't hesitate to answer the question. &nbsp;He readily admitted to his deed. &nbsp;He had determined that it would be ok to tell her what had happen now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that the 'friend' you referred to before?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Correct. &nbsp;He was an incredible magician. &nbsp;He had left something behind in my body, and thanks to it I was able to win.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had just heard something incredible, yet Arrieta didn’t question him. &nbsp;She lauded his deed. &nbsp;She didn't doubt Azell. &nbsp;He had done too much for her to doubt him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, she couldn't stop her curiosity. &nbsp;Arrieta asked him a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is your identity, sir Azell?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems I'll have to give you the same speech as the duke. &nbsp;What if....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had expected this question. &nbsp;He had show Arrieta too much to gloss over it by saying he had lost his memories. &nbsp;As he did with Kairen, he was going to tell her the truth first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"After defeating the Dragon Demon king Atein in the Dragon Demon war, Azell went missing two years after the war. &nbsp;The record doesn't specify if he died or not. &nbsp;Isn't that true?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What if he hadn't died?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His best friend, Archmage Carlos, devoted himself to completing an incredible magic. &nbsp;What if this magic was used to put Azell in a deep sleep where his aging process was suspended? &nbsp;What if he was placed in a location far away from prying eyes? &nbsp;What if he slept like a Dragon through the long years in a place where humans didn't dare travel?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That's…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta furrowed her eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you saying that you are the actual hero Azell Karzark? &nbsp;An incredible magic allowed you to sleep for 200 years, and now you are awake?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Will you believe me if I told you that is true?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen had immediately rejected this question. &nbsp;However, Arietta was having a hard time answering the question, and her face hardened. &nbsp;It was most definitely an absurd story, but Azell had shown her too much marvelous deeds to outright deny his claim. &nbsp;Even if he was the actual Azell Karzark, his powers of persuasion was a bit....!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No. &nbsp;If it is true, most of the questions I have becomes resolved.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had seen and experienced many secrets by watching Azell. &nbsp;It was as if he was from a different world. &nbsp;This sense of dissonance could be cleanly resolved by this single answer. She had seen Azell from an earlier date than Kairen, so she was having a hard time rejecting Azell's words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta asked Giles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think, sir Giles?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want my opinion?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;From my knowledge, you were the first one to find sir Azell. &nbsp;You've seen seen things about him that I haven't. &nbsp;I am curious as to what you think about this matter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hadn't Giles seen Azell when he first awoke in his corpse-like state? &nbsp;After he thought for a brief moment, Giles shook his head from side to side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm sorry, but I don't know. &nbsp;In truth, the story is too incredible for me to say it is true or not. But…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it was proven that sir Azell's story was true, I feel as if I would accept it. &nbsp;At the same time, I would feel silly for not accepting it beforehand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At his words, Arrieta smiled as she looked at Giles briefly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see. &nbsp;I feel the same way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you really believe in my words?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In truth, it is unbelievable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Arrieta shook her head from side to side, Azell put on a bitter smile as if he had expected this. &nbsp;Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is such an outlandish story. &nbsp;However, I can't help myself from entertaining the possibility of it being true. &nbsp;I've thought this from the first time I saw you. &nbsp;You are a really amazing man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you. &nbsp;In truth, I am a secret descendant of Azell Karzark. &nbsp;This is why the knowledge and techniques I have were passed down from my forefathers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That story is a bit more easier to digest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let's leave it at that for now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;I think I'm satisfied with that explanation for now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she spoke, she raised her tea cup.</span></p>
 <p><span style>6</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell shared a conversation with Arrieta, Enora and Giles as they caught up on what they’ve been doing for the past 7 month. &nbsp;When he exited the room, Azell was immediately confronted by Seigar. &nbsp;It was as if he had been waiting for Azell. Seigar had on an expression as if he was dubious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should immediately make time for me, sir Azell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“May I ask what this is about, prince?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell queried when he heard the domineering order. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want you to be my sparring partner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At those words, Azell let out a bitter laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is just a guess, but did the duke instigate this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My teacher said, 'you'll know once you fight him.' &nbsp;I don't think I can pass this by without confirming it for myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see. Then I'll be your opponent. &nbsp;Shall we go to the back mountain where it'll be more discreet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Those words…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar's eyes narrowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you saying it, because you are sure I'll be humiliated in front of my subordinates?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are so inexperienced that you can't even gauge how much internal energy your opponent has right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Seigar turned around in surprise as if he had been burned by fire. &nbsp;He was sure Azell was in front of him, but Azell's voice was suddenly heard from his back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How can this be? &nbsp;I didn't even see him move?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was looking at him from where the direction where the voice had emanated from. &nbsp;&nbsp;The man that was in front of his was behind Seigar, and he hadn’t realized Azell had moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell smiled as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In truth, I'm disappointed in you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you just say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your previous reaction was understandable, but now you won't accept reality even when you saw it with your own two eyes. &nbsp;&nbsp;Will you not be able to accept reality until your reality shatters from being struck? &nbsp;If that is true... &nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t think you will have much luck in facing your future opponents. &nbsp;The enemy has plenty of ‘humans’ that can dominate you. &nbsp;You will suffer a miserable defeat by underestimating opponents that are better than you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His words were arrogant beyond measure. &nbsp;However. Seigar wasn't able to get mad at his words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, he was looking at Azell with cold sweat running down his body. &nbsp;He felt an overwhelming and frightening feeling coming from Azell as Seigar looked at him. &nbsp;Was this feeling similar to what one felt when facing a Dragon?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You believe there is no way a human can be stronger than a Dragon Majin. &nbsp;If you aren't able to throw away such arrogance.... &nbsp;I will do as you wish. &nbsp;In truth, we don't have to go far. &nbsp;I can show it to you right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kook…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar gritted his teeth as he extended his hand towards his back. &nbsp;His sword was too large to equip at his waist, so he had it strapped to his back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Kairen's voice was heard from behind Azell. &nbsp;At the same time, the pressure that was pressing down on Seigar disappeared as if it had been a lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duke.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Both of you are overflowing with power. &nbsp;If you fight here, the damage to my property would be massive. Do you really want to destroy my storied castle?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Somehow, I feel like destroying it. &nbsp;However, I'll restrain myself. &nbsp;It'll be troublesome for Mr. Havanz.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I kind of want to put the duke in a difficult situation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ughh. &nbsp;You hate to lose even a single exchange of words.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen shook his head as if he had lost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn't realize you were so against fighting Seigar.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don't want to unnecessarily catch the prince's interest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar had been quite &nbsp;blunt with his interest in Azell. &nbsp;This was why Seigar tried to bait Azell into a fight in their last meeting. &nbsp;However, Azell disliked Seigar’s actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. &nbsp;I apologize for ignoring your wishes. &nbsp;I want you to forgive me. &nbsp;I did it for the sake of my student.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar jumped up when Kairen showed deference to Azell. &nbsp;From a common-sense standpoint, this shouldn’t have happened. &nbsp;Even the king shows deference to Kairen, yet he was apologizing to a young human over such a trivial manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar was taught by Kairen at an early age, so he was just and &nbsp;even-handed in treating others compared to the others in the royal family. &nbsp;Still, the fact that Seigar was of royal blood hadn’t changed, and he was very self-aware about ranks. &nbsp;&nbsp;If he applied his common sense to this situation, Seigar couldn’t understand what had just gone on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen ignored Seigar as he asked Azell for a favor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me formally ask you this. &nbsp;Could you break apart my lacking student’s ego? &nbsp;Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since you are asking me in such a manner, I can’t refuse. &nbsp;Anyways, this was something I always thought had to happen one day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell accepted his request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>7</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar received favorable assessment as a commander of an organization.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn't care about the background of his men. &nbsp;He valued competence above all else, and he &nbsp;knew how to take advice from his subordinates. &nbsp;Even if he was outstanding, he knew there was a limit on what he could do by himself. &nbsp;This was why he didn't hesitate to borrow help for him subordinates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, there was a part of Seigar that didn't trust them at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Humans are weak.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He believed in the the competence of his human subordinates. &nbsp;However, no matter how competent they were, he believed there was a hard cap in terms of martial ability for humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This idea had solidified in his mind as he lived his life. &nbsp;This was where he differed with Arrieta in how he viewed the men he found. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He searched all over for competent people, but the people he found were always within his preconceived notion. &nbsp;&nbsp;Every man he found just reaffirmed his way of belief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was an anomaly that went against Seigar’s way of thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-oohk……!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar let out a moan as he rolled across the ground. &nbsp;He immediately tried to right his balance as he stood up. &nbsp;Right before he got up the exquisite sword strike came in to disrupt his Energy Pulse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kah-ahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was barely able to block the blow with the blade of his enormous sword. &nbsp;He once again rolled across the floor. &nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, the sword was coming in at an angle right at the location where he would land.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This doesn't make any sense!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He dropped to the floor in fright. The balance he had almost recovered was broken once again. &nbsp;He had to roll across the ground again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This process kept repeating itself in an endless loop. &nbsp;Azell adjusted his sublime power on the first clash to put Seigar on the ground. &nbsp;It had been 3 minutes, yet Seigar was unable to get up even once. &nbsp;He continued to roll across the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My god…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta was at a loss for words when she saw the sight. &nbsp;She already knew Azell was outstanding in terms of the techniques. &nbsp;&nbsp;However, the techniques he was showing right now was beyond her imagination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giles also stood there looking with rapt admiration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I never knew it was possible to control an opponent to this degree.....”</span></p>
