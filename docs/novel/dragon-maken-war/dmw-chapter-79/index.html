 <p><span style>Chapter 79 - Those who Covet the Blood of a Royal (5)</span></p>
 <p><span style>7</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell and Kairen climbed the mountain as they were guided by the Guardian Shadows. The terrain of the mountain was rough, and on top of that, the sun had set. Even in the dark, their speed hadn’t slow at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when they were halfway up the mountain, bandits hidden on superior grounds started shooting arrows at them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them were unperturbed. They had known beforehand that the bandits were there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-pah-pah-pah-pah-pah-pah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them swung their swords. A transparent blue force followed the path of the sword as it blocked the arrows. &nbsp;While the ambushing bandits were confused, Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your entire body has completely assimilated the technique for detecting the gaze of others.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is a very useful technique.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gaze Detection.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Azell went into the Lance mountain to train, Azell had taught Kairen of the method behind detecting other's gazes. There was a lot of overlap between Spirit Order and Dragon Arts, so the main concept behind the technique was easily understood by Kairen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, Kairen had completely perfected his technique in the past 4 month. His opponents completely hid their bodies, and they didn’t show any indication of life. &nbsp;However, they couldn't hide the fact that their 'gazes' was on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still, these bastards are able to completely evade my eyesight. Incredible. Still, I think the one that kidnapped Seigar isn't here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess they have a lot of high quality individuals in their ranks. Even last time, there were men who used camouflage skill comparable to this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell wasn't just able to detect their gazes. &nbsp;He was able to read the mental waves leaking out of the ambushing men. It was natural for humans to naturally emit a mental wave when they were concentrating. Since they weren't able to hide their mental waves, these men were inferior to the Dragon's Shadow members inserted to kidnap Arrieta.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell and Kairen saw the enemies reload their bow, so they split up in opposite directions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then they ran up the cliff to attack the enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-ha-ha-ha-hahk!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The swords were moving like flashes of lightning, and blood was sprayed into the air. Azell and Kairen were too fast as the enemies couldn't see their movements. &nbsp;The men weren't even sure when they had been stabbed, but they fell as blood surged out of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are they dying so easily?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The magician was taken aback. He used an invisibility spell as he floated in the air. &nbsp;He was like the men from the Dragon's Shadow, who worked with Niberis. &nbsp;He was affiliated with a lower level organization. &nbsp;This was also the reason he wasn’t well informed on what was going on. Still, he was able to catch the scent of Kairen's powerful Dragon Demon magic, so their group had been expecting the appearance of a Dragon Demon. &nbsp;However, the two who showed up was completely beyond their imagination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then…….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Puh-uhk!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A gruesome sound was heard from below.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh……?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The magician looked down with a dumbfounded expression on his face. His stomach had been fine a moment ago, yet he found something had erupted from his stomach.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No. &nbsp;This can't...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn't an eruption. A sword had been thrown from the ground, and that sword had pierced through his stomach.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He tried to come up with some measure in the midst of the shock and horror he felt. &nbsp;However, it was too late. &nbsp;The sword that was planted in his body moved as if it was alive, and it was obliquely cutting open his upper body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah-ahk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The magician fell as he screamed, and he immediately died as he impacted on the ground. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell changed the direction of the sword in mid-air, and it returned to his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this was a deception. &nbsp;The sword suddenly switched direction right before it could be grasped by Azell's hand. It passed through the boulder next to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-uh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From behind the boulder, an inhuman cry rang out. &nbsp;An enormous Orc immediately came flying out. &nbsp;It was about two heads taller than a regular orc, and it had a ruddy coloring. Its body was rippling with muscles, and blood was dripping down its chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell used telekinesis to bring his sword back to him. &nbsp;He looked up as he grasped his sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you are the Orc that's purported to be the leader of the mountain bandits.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You bastard! You are only a weak human, yet you dare!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are a dumb Orc, yet you are quite fluent in the words of men. It means you aren't a normal one. &nbsp;I don't have time. Hurry up and come at me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell glared at it. &nbsp;In the next moment, the Orc charged forward. It moved as fast as a Spirit Order practitioner. A human would have to use both hands to raise the enormous mace, yet it used one hand to swing its mace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ggwah-ahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of an explosion rang out as the ground exploded. The rock fragments shot into the air. &nbsp;It was powerful enough to crush one's bones. Human knights, who boasted as being superior to other humans, were easily sent flying in the previous battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it missed. &nbsp;At that moment, the Orc moved its body as it swung the mace to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-ah-ahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The orc's mace collided with Azell's sword as a loud and resonant sound rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell's sword was slender compared to the enormous mace, and it looked as if it should shatter as it absorbed a hit from the mace. &nbsp;However, Azell's sword was fine, and Azell didn't even budge an inch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell asked the Orc in a calm voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this all you got?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-ooh! Bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rage made the Orc's eyes turn the color of blood. &nbsp;At the same time, a powerful magical resonance poured out, and the mace started to let out a light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell waited as he gave the Orc an opportunity to raise its mace. &nbsp;At the same time, he let his sword droop to the floor as he awoke his magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Orc let out a yell as it brought down its shining iron mace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, a thunder struck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ggah-roo-roohng! Ggwah-gwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kooh-ooh……?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, a blue light erupted in front of the Orc's vision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was surrounded by a blue light as he leisurely passed by the Orc. The Orc couldn't comprehend the man's unhurried movement, so it tried to grab the man with his hand. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, it realized something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Its arm was gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, it wasn't just its arm. Half of its upper body was charred, and it was sent flying away. &nbsp;Azell's sword had let out lighting, and it had cut off the arm holding the mace. &nbsp;As if that wasn't enough, a large chunk of its body was sent flying with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This can't be……!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Orc was in disbelief as it fell over with its eyes wide open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell didn't even look back. &nbsp;He started running immediately as he spoke to Kairen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you took too long, I was going to help you. &nbsp;I guess it wasn't necessary.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen had already taken care of all the enemies that had been hiding in ambush. Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It stinks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you talking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That Orc smells similar to a mutated Orc I knew.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Which mutated Orc?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll give you a more thorough explanation at a later time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have a lot of things you'll have to explain to me. &nbsp;Keep that in mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If this happens as I expected it to, the number of explanations I'll have to give will mount. Let us go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two men followed the Guardian Shadows as they ran.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were eyes that were watching the two from a very far away distance. &nbsp;Jaress was one of them. &nbsp;As a Keeper of Prophecy, he was given the codename of Omicron. &nbsp;Jaress clicked his tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is very cool. He killed the Orc that troubled the knights under the Dragon Demon Prince with one blow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had made sure that Azell wouldn't be able to sense their gazes. The reason why they were able to avoid detection from Azell, who had the ability to detect gazes on him, was simple. They weren't actually looking at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Including Jaress, there were four Keepers of Prophecy here, and they all had their eyes closed. &nbsp;A Guardian Shadow was floating in the air, and they were looking through its eyes. The Guardian Shadows had the unimaginable ability to share the information on its surveillance of the Dragon Demon King worshippers. They had the ability to see out of each other's eyes from a far distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group started to speak amongst themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn't he completely different from Leone's report?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A little bit of time did pass, but... &nbsp;It was only half a year.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A human could change so much in that small amount of a time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess. At the time of your report, it was said he was very outstanding in terms of skills. &nbsp;I think what he showed right now just confirms that assessment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm. &nbsp;Is that how it looks through the eyes of a high rank Spirit Order Practioner? &nbsp;He looked overpowering to me...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They evaluated Azell's martial skills. Jaress spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is a bit different from what we planned, but we can work with this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Omicron.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Instead of testing Azell Zestringer, shouldn’t we be saving the Dragon Demon Prince from the Dragon Demon King worshippers? &nbsp;”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There's the Guardian Shadows, and Epsilon has taken out the 'Guardian that Never Sleeps.' &nbsp;I don't see it as a problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, let's just observe for now. &nbsp;I realize the other task is more important.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jaress snickered as he left. When they heard Jaress' unreliable laugh, the other Keepers of the Prophecy frowned as they looked at each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>8</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Azell suspected, Laura Aunsaurus had already subdued Seigar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar was strong. &nbsp;However, his power was only passable in an outside world where the true techniques had been erased. &nbsp;Seigar had an unbelievable amount of fighting spirit for a 15 year old teen, but he wasn't even able to harm the hem of Laura's dress.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it had taken Laura a good amount of time to subdue Seigar. The cause being she wanted to take him, while causing the minimum amount of damage. It had been about two hours, since Seigar had fallen from exhausting his power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Laura encountered a totally unexpected problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How is this possible? ’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Guardian Shadows were tracking her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had deployed her subordinates carefully in an attempt to avoid the detection of the Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;She had readied bandits that most wouldn't call Dragon Demon king worshipers. &nbsp;She used them to trick the Dragon Demon Prince to come out to a location where there weren't any witnesses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had been in luck when the Dragon Demon Prince separated from his party to scout. &nbsp;It really made her wonder if he really didn't realize how valuable he was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In her original plan, she would have disguised herself as a human, and she would have lured Seigar out. &nbsp;Then she would have used Vitan's Maze on him. &nbsp;However, when Seigar separated from his main force, she was able to omit the middle portion of her plan. &nbsp;The main force was destroyed without them finding out how Seigar had gone missing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no reason why the Guardian Shadows should intervene, yet they surrounded the Vitan's Maze as if they had been waiting for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Vitan's Maze was a pocket dimension that severed her from the outside world. However, the exit from this space was fixed if she decided to unravel it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura had tried moving slowly for the exit, but the Guardian Shadows weren't fooled. &nbsp;They continued to chase after her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is getting difficult.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As time continued to pass, the Guardian Shadows from various regions would congregate, and their number would grow. When Laura comprehended this, Laura used a hidden card she had readied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had called out the Thunder Dragon that was living deep within the mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Thunder Dragon was mobilized using the Dragon Slayer's Ritual as bait. &nbsp;The Thunder Dragon unhesitatingly attacked the Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;However, even then another unexpected situation occurred. </span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They brought a Dragon too?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Frost Dragon that lived nearby appeared, and it started to fight the Thunder Dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One couldn't just snap one's fingers to get a Dragon to move. &nbsp;One had to negotiate beforehand. One had to agree to do the Dragon Slayer's Ritual. &nbsp;This was an immemorial contract, and it was unforgivable if one lied during the negotiation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the reason why the Plain of Darkness had to go into the negotiations expecting to participate in the Dragon Slayer's Ritual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was quite possible that the Guardian Shadows predicted the kidnapping of the Dragon Demon Prince. &nbsp;Laura had moved with that worry in the back of her mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she had no idea how they could have prepared a Dragon too. &nbsp;It wasn't as if they had predicted this kidnapping. &nbsp;It was as if they had been sure this would occur.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How can this be?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, she didn't feel any sense of crisis. &nbsp;Her role in this endeavor had pretty much ended when she suppressed Seigar. If she bought some time, the reinforcements would be here. They would get her out even if they had to sacrifice their lives. &nbsp;From that point, she'll go to a place where she would be able to use the legacy left behind by the Dragon Demon King Atein. &nbsp;She'll be able to use the ‘Road of Emptiness’ to escape her enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that thought in mind, she had been observing the outside situation, and something unexpected happened.</span></p>
