 <p>Chapter 124 - Specters from the Past (4)</p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They are living their lives as members of society, so there are cases where we can’t mobilize some of our members. &nbsp;For example, what happens if there was an uprising of monsters in a certain region, and it required the member to take care of the region for an extended amount of time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This truth could be discerned by looking at Kairen and Beorein. &nbsp;The Guardian Shadows had a preference for picking members, who had influence over society. &nbsp;In terms of martial prowess, they didn’t need much help, but they needed members, who could carry out their work as members of society.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In recent days, everyone is tied down in taking care of their own responsibilities. &nbsp;Anyways, we are doing our best.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see. &nbsp;So why do you keep following me? &nbsp;Are you trying to confirm that I am the person from the prophecy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is one of them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So that isn’t your only aim. &nbsp;What other goals do you have?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If Reygus does show up, I’m pretty sure he will appear in front of you. &nbsp;I look forward to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You look forward to it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell furrowed his brows. &nbsp;If it was as Balseru had said last time, the Keepers of Prophecy had fought with Reygus’ Undead form, and they had been crushed. &nbsp;Yet Balseru was looking forward to it? </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Will you be able to defeat Reygus’ Undead form? &nbsp;If not, are you planning on fighting Reygus with us as a united front?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since he is an Undead, I’ll be able to take care of him by myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell stared at Balseru. &nbsp;Something really bothered Azell about him. &nbsp;He knew the other man was a Spirit Order Practitioner, but Azell couldn’t read the depth of his power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Normally, he would consider such a person to be formidable. &nbsp;However, Azell couldn’t make that call yet. &nbsp;He had a weird feeling about Balseru.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However… &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;If there are others aside from the Undead, it might be hard for me to defeat them. &nbsp;In such a situation, I would like to work with your party. &nbsp;At the very least, when we are fighting the Dragon Demon king worshippers, we can be sure that we are allies.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let us do that. &nbsp;Still, our movements haven’t been revealed to our enemies yet. &nbsp;Maybe….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you are thinking about the possibility of me leading the enemies to you, I won’t. &nbsp;I don’t do such acts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve shown myself the least amongst the Keepers of the Prophecy. &nbsp;They probably don’t even know what my code name is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You codename? &nbsp;Now that I think about it you guys use the ancient alphabet like Delta and Theta. What is your code name?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta, Theta, Iota, Kappa, Lambda, Mu, Nu, Xi, Omicron, Pi, Rho, Sigma, Tau, Upsilon, Phi, Chi, Psi and Omega.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Keepers of the Prophecy used the 24 ancient alphabets, which existed before the legend of Babel, as their code names. &nbsp;It was also letters frequently used by magicians when they conducted a magic ritual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m Alpha.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you are Alpha, you are the first letter in the ancient alphabet. &nbsp;Is your code name related to seniority?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you allowed to just give out such answers like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We decided we could tell you a certain amount of information.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m thankful that you hold me in such high regards. &nbsp;So you are the first amongst the Keepers of the Prophecy…. &nbsp;&nbsp;Doesn’t that contradict with your previous story?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Which story?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You said you quit being a knight around 50 years ago. &nbsp;If you became a Keeper of the Prophecy at that point in time, you became one during the Great Darkness. &nbsp;Doesn’t that mean you became one much later than Leone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Correct.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then your story doesn’t match.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I inherited the code name when the original Alpha died. &nbsp;My memory of that person is fuzzy, but I think he was my uncle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You think….. &nbsp;What do you mean by that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t remember much from before I became a Keeper of the Prophecy. &nbsp;It might be the fact that my body had suffered through death. &nbsp;I believe it is the cost for being revived as a Keeper of the Prophecy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems Leone hadn’t discussed this with you. &nbsp;All the Keepers of Prophecy used to be humans. &nbsp;We are existences that were raised from the dead..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys were raised from the dead? Do you really want me to believe such nonsense?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand it sounds preposterous. &nbsp;Still, is it so absurd when one takes in the fact that we don’t age?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Dragon Demon king is a murderer, and we were killed while holding a grudge against him. &nbsp;At the moment of our deaths, the nucleus of the magic making up the Guardian Shadows made contact with us. &nbsp;We were revived…. &nbsp;Or that is what we think happened. &nbsp;We were revived from death by some means or other.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Some means or other…. &nbsp;Aren’t you guys being a little bit too loose on the facts?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Those of us, who were originally magicians, are divided in opinion. &nbsp;We aren’t able to come to a consensus no matter what. &nbsp;The non-magicians amongst us just accept the situation as is. &nbsp;In the end, the only thing that is important to us is the slaughter of Dragon Demon king worshippers. &nbsp;We don’t care about anything else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A forced laugh leaked out of Azell. &nbsp;This guy was really an absurd bastard. &nbsp;He kept revealing incredible facts, yet he was serene. &nbsp;It was as if he was talking to a neighbor about an unimportant matters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You said you lost your memories?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, I have no memories of my previous life. &nbsp;We only know about the reason why we are doing these tasks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you, at the very least, suspicious?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“About what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you suspicious of that fact that someone might have manipulated all of you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had no memories of their past. &nbsp;They had no idea,who had made them that way. &nbsp;They didn’t even know what criteria allowed them to become Keepers of the Prophecy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The were completely ignorant of their own situation, yet they followed the truths that came to them on an instinctual level. &nbsp;They had become the embodiments of revenge. &nbsp;They possessed the body of a human, yet they had given up being humans. &nbsp;They devoted themselves to eradicating the Dragon Demon king worshippers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…aren’t you suspicious about the possibility that this is all a fabrication made through magic?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I never thought about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You expression is asking how I can be so foolish.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You speak as if you can see me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can see you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even though you have your eyes closed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not blind. &nbsp;Even if my eyes are closed, it doesn’t interfere with my sight. &nbsp;Anyways, that is how it is. &nbsp;When we became the Keepers of the Prophecy, we were given an offer by an unknown being, and we made a choice. &nbsp;We remember making our choice, so we have no doubt.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that really enough?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;Do you want us to become suspicious of the process? &nbsp;Wouldn’t that in turn make us deny our own existence? &nbsp;I have no desire to do so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you afraid of doing so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. &nbsp;I just… &nbsp;I believe in the evidence provided by my hatred.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hatred?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Funnily enough, I can’t feel anything. &nbsp;This conversation I am having with you feels like a daydream.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when he was in front of the Dragon Demon king worshippers, he could feel that he was still alive. &nbsp;The hatred he had for them burned. &nbsp;It awoke him to the fact that he was still alive and breathing in this world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell now identified the madness he had felt when he saw Leone. &nbsp;These people really had lost everything. &nbsp;The elements that used to make up the identity of these people were all snatched away by the Dragon Demon king worshippers. &nbsp;The only thing left behind were empty dolls that were driven by hatred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Who made this system?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The curiosity he felt for this truth was almost unbearable. &nbsp;How much enmity did the creator of the Guardian Shadows have that he went down this ruthless road?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is my warning to you, sir Azell. &nbsp;Reygus will come looking for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How do you know this? &nbsp;According to Laura….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is someone amongst them that has the ability to find you. &nbsp;At the very least, we know that fact.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You speak as if you are a soothsayer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m something akin to that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Azell became surprised, Balseru answered in a calm manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Amongst the 24 Keepers of the Prophecy, only two of us has a fixed role. &nbsp;Alpha and Omega. The name has nothing to do with when we became a Keeper of the Prophecy. &nbsp;The one named Omega can catch a glimpse of what the Plain of Darkness is doing. &nbsp;They keep track of their members through the being, who resides in the Great Darkness. &nbsp;We are able to learn about what power they possess and what they are going to do….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Basically, you are using their information network against them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t as clear cut as you make it out to be. &nbsp;In truth, it isn’t that helpful. &nbsp;We don’t know the content or the timing of the information we will receive. &nbsp;However, once we learn of an information, we are sure of its veracity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I always have this thought….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can't tell if you guys are amazing or extremely poorly run.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The world is an inconvenient place where there isn’t a clear cut answer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru answered in a disinterested manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as Azell walked away, Balseru spoke as he looked between the trees.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should come out now, Omega.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is far away enough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…still, I’ll be discovered if I’m not careful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, a voice of a young girl could be heard. &nbsp;Accompanying a rustling sound, a girl appeared from between the trees and bushes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Azell saw this sight, he would have been shocked. &nbsp;She had been so close, yet she had been able to evade Azell’s senses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl looked to be 15 or 16 years old. &nbsp;From her appearance, she didn’t look too special. &nbsp;Since she had been hiding in the bushes, she was dirty. &nbsp;Her hair was tied in twin tails, and her hair was disheveled. &nbsp;She had a plain looking face with freckles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only thing unusual about her was her green eyes. &nbsp;She was looking straight at Balseru’s face, yet her eyes were out of focus. &nbsp;It was as if she couldn’t see….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, her sense of presence was absent like Balseru. &nbsp;It was understandable to see why Azell failed to notice her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru spoke as he filled a bowl with soup.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does it matter if he finds out about you? &nbsp;At the very least, we aren’t enemies with him right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still, he really hates us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is true.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t like being hated. &nbsp;At the very least, I don’t want him to look at me like that. &nbsp;I’ll decline.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it because he might be the person from the prophecy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Omega took the bowl of soup from Balseru as she nodded her head. &nbsp;Omega’s eyes were out of focus, so it looked as if she was looking into the empty air. &nbsp;However, she had no problem receiving the bowl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If he is the person from the prophecy…. &nbsp;I have to give my everything to him. &nbsp;I don’t want to do something like that to someone that hates me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think every one of us are already hated by him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is why I won’t show myself until it is necessary. &nbsp;Unlike you, I don’t move in a herd with the other Keepers of the Prophecy. &nbsp;I don’t want him to hate me as an individual.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Omega drank the soup after she said those words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You still cling to your romantic ideals.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unlike you, I even lost my name.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Omega camly spoke about her loss. &nbsp;It didn't’ matter what order she joined as the Keeper of the Prophecy. &nbsp;She was given the last codename. &nbsp;Of course, she didn’t remember her past, but she also didn’t remember her name.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, you’ll find out about it soon enough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How do you know this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just have a hunch.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are speaking as if you are a soothsayer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know about anything else, but my hunches are almost always correct. &nbsp;It has been so for 50 years, so you can put some trust in it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that why you gathered everyone?”</span></p>
