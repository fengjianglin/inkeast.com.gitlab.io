 <p>Chapter 95 - Those who Seek Their Own Destiny (4)</p>
 <p><span style>6</span></p>
 <p><span style>The encounter repeated itself several times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The County of Karzark was a pretty big stretch of land. &nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there had been several towns and cities within the County of Karzark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell walked through the towns that had been turned into ruins.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He walked past the ruins of cities where everything was destroyed. &nbsp;Even the &nbsp;castle walls were demolished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked for sceneries that was left within his memories. &nbsp;He had always wished the beauty of these locations to last forever, yet they were all destroyed. &nbsp;They were in a state he had never wanted to seem them in. &nbsp;As he passed by each location, rage started to disappear from Azell's face. &nbsp;There was no expression on his face now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had prepared himself for such possibilities. &nbsp;While he was coming here, he imagined the worst case scenario, and he prepared his heart for what he'll see.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the shock he felt when seeing it with his own two eyes was beyond what he had imagined.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the past, I'm sure…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell smelled something familiar right now. &nbsp;He smelled the blood that had poured out from monsters he had cut open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I've experienced something similar to this. &nbsp;I've experienced it numerous time. &nbsp;Still... &nbsp;It is quite hard to stomach.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were countless corpses of monsters littered around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell hadn't bothered to hide his presence, while he was coming here. &nbsp;If he was able to make rational decisions, he would have avoided going to the towns or cities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ruins were ideal nesting ground for monsters. &nbsp;It was almost certain that the monsters had taken possession of all the locations where humans had resided in the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Azell didn't avoid them. &nbsp;He walked through ruins as if he wanted them to see him. &nbsp;He attracted the monsters to him, and he had fought them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a very foolish thing to do. &nbsp;However, Azell was wrapped up in his desire for revenge, and Kairen was swept up in the mess. &nbsp;However, Kairen wasn't angry. &nbsp;Cold sweat was running down his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is unbelievable. &nbsp;He is so overwhelming.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen had thought he was well aware of how much Qi was stored within Azell. &nbsp;However, he realized he had been fooling himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It didn't matter if it was a violent one, careful one, small one, or a big one... &nbsp;In fact, it didn't matter if they came in a group. &nbsp;It didn't matter if the monsters attacked or ran away. &nbsp;If the monsters were close enough to be seen, they were all considered to be hostiles. &nbsp;Azell started his slaughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he continued to fight, the commotion got larger. &nbsp;The monsters that had been spread out gathered to the center of the commotion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had been about a day and a half since they had entered the County of Karzark. &nbsp;Azell and Kairen had already faced several hundred monsters in the ruins of the small cities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koong koong koong koong koong!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The heavy sound rang out as the ground shook.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From beyond the half broken building, a house-sized Ogre appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-oo-uh-uh.... &nbsp;Uh...?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had a habit of trying to intimidate its enemies, so it started letting out a roar. &nbsp;However, it was killed in the blink of an eye. &nbsp;Azell was already in front of it, and Azell's foot had impacted on the Ogre's chest. &nbsp;The impact was delivered inwards. &nbsp;The Ogre's heart exploded, and Azell's sword cut through its thick neck. &nbsp;It was as if he was cutting through pudding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Poo-hwah-ha-ha-hahk!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A spray of blood erupted into the air. &nbsp;In the midst of the blood, Azell disappeared as if he was an illusion, and he attacked the group of monsters that had followed behind the Ogre.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-ahk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-uh-uh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The monsters didn't even have the time to assess what had happened. &nbsp;Something flashed in front of their eyes, and they fell over with a critical wound. &nbsp;The group of 20 monsters took only a brief moment to slaughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-ooh-oong!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It all occurred before the Ogre's corpse could fall to the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There wasn't a single speck of blood on Azell's body. &nbsp;Azell had moved much faster than the spray of blood. &nbsp;While the blood were falling down, Azell leisurely moved towards a different location.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen's blood curdled as he watched Azell with interest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Did his rational mind erode away from the rage?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed likely, since Azell was fighting the monsters by attracting them to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when he observed Azell’s fights, it made Kairen doubt his initial assumption. &nbsp;When one was crazy from rage, the logical and technical skills were thrown to the wind. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shouldn't he be flailing like a madman?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell's fight made Kairen suspicious as to whether Azell had the ability of premonition. &nbsp;He integrated insight and technique flawlessly that it almost seemed mystical. &nbsp;He used noise and visible signs to draw in the enemies to where he wanted, and he used his mental waves to confuse them. &nbsp;Azell was using the minimal amount of power to kill his enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He even let several of them go. &nbsp;He was allowing fear to spread, since it would be easier to plant illusions using Spirit Order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wanted to spread misinformation, so the chaos would spread. &nbsp;He also purposefully lured his enemies into traps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If there were flying monsters, it would have been a bit tiring... &nbsp;I guess no monsters control the skies here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had climbed the half broken castle wall, and he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Caw, caw…….</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sun was slowing descending. &nbsp;Within the red glow of the sunset shining down on the land... &nbsp;Corpses of several hundred monsters were strewn in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The factions of monsters that had fought for dominion over this small city was all killed. &nbsp;Azell had killed every one of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell suddenly spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…I'm sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“At least, you were aware of what you were doing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen let out a bitter laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell knew what he had done was really stupid. &nbsp;However, he couldn't help himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen watched the despondent Azell through the light of the sunset. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why is he like this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He once again wondered about Azell's identity. &nbsp;If Azell really was the descendent of the hero Azell Karzark, it was understandable for him to become enraged at the terrible sight of the County of Karzark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, how could he be enraged to this degree?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Maybe, he really is……?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen thought back to the time when Azell discussed his own identity. &nbsp;He remembered the first version of the story. &nbsp;Azell had said he had been put into a deep sleep through Carlos' great magic. &nbsp;He had woken up after a long sleep, and he was the real Azell Karzark. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a ridiculous story. &nbsp;On the other hand, it had been a detailed story, and something always nagged at him in the back of his mind. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no way it was possible, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amongst the magicians, Archmage Carlos was worshipped like a god, but Rulain kingdom's best magician Beorein determined it couldn't be done.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, as he saw more of Azell.... &nbsp;He couldn't help feel as if Azell's story seemed more likely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Maybe not... &nbsp;Still, it wouldn't be too strange if it really turned out to be true.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen was feeling something similar to what Arrieta and Giles was feeling. &nbsp;This feeling got stronger as he spent more time in Azell's presence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell turned to look at Kairen as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I've killed all of them in this region, but more will flock here in time. &nbsp;Let's move to a place where we can rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm. &nbsp;Let's do that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At Azell's words, he suddenly woke up from his thoughts. &nbsp;They were moving once again, and Kairen couldn't hold back his question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you do this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm not sure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell let out a bitter laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His most precious memories had been smashed into pieces. &nbsp;He had skipped 220 years into the future, and Azell had thought his land would be the rope that'll connect him to the past. &nbsp;However, the only thing waiting for him was the traces of destruction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The monsters had destroyed and dirtied this land. &nbsp;He couldn't stand these monsters acting like master of this land as they step on the corpses of the people, who used to live here. &nbsp;This fight was a requiem for those who died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This won't be enough to appease the souls... &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;I'll make a promise.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>At one time, Azell had ruled over this land as the lord. &nbsp;The deceased souls had been his vassals when they were alive. &nbsp;He made an oath to those people, who had been his sons and daughters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I won't forgive those who carried out this deed. &nbsp;Moreover... &nbsp;I'll return this land to the hands of the people.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would send those, who destroyed this land, straight into hell. &nbsp;Whether they were Dragon Demon king worshippers or not, he didn't care. &nbsp;Azell promised to make this happen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he couldn't tell this to Kairen. &nbsp;Azell made up a likely excuse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just… &nbsp;It felt as if a holy ground had been defiled.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn't an excuse that was particularly believable. &nbsp;Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You let your anger take over your body, yet your mind was working very well. &nbsp;This was why I thought you had some other underlying reason you haven't told me about...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I would have preferred if I could just let my anger take over me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you are saying there aren't any rational reasons behind your actions?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still… I guess there are cases when one actually becomes calm in an intense rage. &nbsp;Moreover, you are a high rank Spirit Order practitioner, so you are proficient at controlling your own mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You words aren't wrong, but it doesn't tell the whole story.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I've seen too many innocents killed by people berserking on rage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I needed to learn to harness it. &nbsp;No matter how large my rage gets I had to become cold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell thought about his past. He had berserked from rage, and he had been pushed to the brink of death several times as a result. &nbsp;He hadn't care what was around him, and he had experienced killing his comrades in these fits of rage. &nbsp;He made sure he didn't get overwhelmed by such emotions anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell suddenly raised his head. &nbsp;Kairen, who had been running besides Azell, mumbled as he hardened his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Someone is 'watching' us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>7</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was someone watching them. &nbsp;This being was very far away, and this person was hidden in a very clever way. &nbsp;However, this person couldn't hide his gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke with Whispering instead of his voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I don't think it is the border guards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-If a normal border guard was this skilled, we would have to worry about the Bijes kingdom taking over the continent with their surprisingly strong military force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-It couldn't be those perverted Keepers of Prophecy that used to stalk me....</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a possibility, but the Keepers of Prophecy kept away from Azell after the rescue of Seigar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, Kairen was a member of the Guardian Shadows, so his location could be discerned easily by them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyways, they had found out that someone was observing them, so they couldn't just ignore it. &nbsp;Azell and Kairen continued a conversation about some random topic as they walked towards the place where they felt the gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was how Azell was able to confirm it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-It is magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-How do you know?</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I can tell by the angle. &nbsp;There is a magical eye in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Magic, Spirit Order and Dragon Arts all had 'far-seeing techniques'. &nbsp;It wasn't merely the enhancement of one's eyesight. &nbsp;The technique allowed one to send one's gaze into the distance to survey a location.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When comparing the limits of these techniques, he had found that magic was much superior than Spirit Order and the Dragon Arts when using such techniques.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Spirit Order and Dragon Arts used the far-seeing technique, one just expanded the sphere of one's vision. &nbsp;Azell could use his Clones to circumvent this limitation, but the limitation of the ability was clear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, a magician could create a magic eye, and it could be sent far away into the distance. &nbsp;It was at the command of the magician.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A high ranking magician could even look over a wall from a very far distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen accepted Azell's assessment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I see. &nbsp;So that is how you can discern such information.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I don't feel any hostility or murderous intent, but... &nbsp;It is hard to feel emotion through a magic eye. It is hard unless it attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell and Kairen had been moving for a while, and they became a bit surprised.</span></p>
