 <p>Chapter 136 - Gathering Legends (2)</p>
 <p><span style>Kwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of an explosion rang out as she was flung away. &nbsp;Reygus’ speed couldn’t be compared to before. &nbsp;It struck out at her, and it immediately followed up with an additional attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kah-ahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia was almost beaten all too soon, but the one to save her was Kairen. &nbsp;He was startled into action. &nbsp;His left sword turned the path of the hammer, and his right sword aimed for its head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Reygus’ reaction was totally unexpected. &nbsp;Instead of avoiding the Dragon sword, it received the attack with its head. &nbsp;Reygus moved so fast that it felt as if time had been sped up in that brief moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ggwah-gwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The head of the hammer fell like thunder as the shockwave detonated. &nbsp;Normally, the position of its body wouldn’t allow a powerful blow to be used, yet its attack was devastating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an Undead. &nbsp;A living being was limited by the range of motion of one’s joints, but that didn’t matter to an Undead. &nbsp;The joints of its shoulders and elbows were moving at unnatural angles, yet it didn’t kill the power behind the blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen and Letica was sent flying in a bloody mess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-ahk……!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The left side of Kairen’s armor was ripped away. &nbsp;It hadn’t even been a direct hit. &nbsp;He was grazed by the attack, yet his magically enhanced armor was demolished!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia was also in a rough shape. &nbsp;Her left arm was broken as her gauntlet was ripped away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen breathed raggedly as he asked it a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Until now…. &nbsp;&nbsp;Were you playing with us……?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was anger behind his voice. &nbsp;Did Reygus act like it was losing on purpose? &nbsp;Had it been treating them with kid gloves? &nbsp;It was so humiliating that it was almost unbearable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While they had been fighting, Reygus had shown momentarily boost of speed. &nbsp;However, the speed he had just displayed was in a totally different dimension. &nbsp;No, it wasn’t just its acceleration. &nbsp;Its overall movement had increased in speed by a factor of two. &nbsp;It was almost inevitable that Leticia had been caught flat footed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those weren’t they only changes. &nbsp;Its overall magical energy emanating from Reygus’ body swelled to an oppressive amount. &nbsp;It almost rivaled a Dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I hope you don’t misconstrue my words. &nbsp;I enjoyed fighting you guys, but I didn’t go easy on you.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha ha ha ha. &nbsp;How can you say….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I’m speaking the truth. &nbsp;Until a moment ago, my power had been suppressed. &nbsp;That Guardian Shadow had some kind of strange ability related to his eyes.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru always had his eyes closed. &nbsp;There was a strange power residing within his eyes. &nbsp;After Reygus had woken up, it had never seen anyone capable of interfering with the power of an Undead. &nbsp;However, Balseru was able to halve its power by looking at Reygus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is quite strange. &nbsp;Their Undeads are similar to me…. &nbsp;Did that brat Carlos steal the king’s secret technique, or…..’</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it seemed there was a limit to his power. &nbsp;When the Dragon Demon king worshippers pushed back, the suppressive force dissipated. &nbsp;This was the result . &nbsp;The body of an Undead was rotted away, so everything was influenced by magical energy. &nbsp;When the suppression of its magical energy was gone, Reygus’ strength and speed was rapidly increased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia caught her breath as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If that was true… &nbsp;Now that I know how fast you are we won’t fall so easily. &nbsp;Moreover, we have support.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Ah ah. &nbsp;Do you mean that miss over there?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura appeared from behind Leticia. &nbsp;Kairen used Whispering to ask for help, and Laura was able to come to their aid by letting Yuren handle everything by himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Reygus saw her, it spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I can tell at a glance. &nbsp;You look very similar to my friend, who couldn’t return from the world of the dead. &nbsp;You are the one that betrayed us, Ms. Laura.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is correct.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura spoke in respectful words. &nbsp;She did betray them, but Reygus was one of the eldest even amongst the elders. &nbsp;Everyone revered him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, she didn’t let that fact affect her actions. &nbsp;A frightening wave of Dragon Demon magic spread into the surrounding, and a curse swept over Reygus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It is true that even I would have some difficulties if a magician of her caliber joined in, but….&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen and Leticia had been taken unawares by the sudden change in Reygus. &nbsp;However, they were formidable fighters. &nbsp;If Laura joined in to support them, Reygus would have considerable trouble dealing with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Your opponent is someone else.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t see anyone, who is in the position to fight me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura had come here, because her side had a handle on the Dragon Demon king worshippers. &nbsp;Yuren was capable of taking care of the rest. &nbsp;Moreover, the Guardian Shadows had joined the fray, and it was turning into a free for all. &nbsp;The Dragon Demon king worshippers didn’t have the numeric advantage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, at that moment, a beam of light came flying towards her from afar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Puh-uh-uhng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the magic spell was activated, Laura saw the signs immediately. &nbsp;She was easily &nbsp;able to defend against it. &nbsp;Moreover, she was able to change the direction of the spell to hit Reygus with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Traitor Laura.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she heard the bleak voice, she couldn’t help but flinch. &nbsp;Laura raised her head in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She saw a Dragon Majin youth. &nbsp;He was surrounded by six swords that had been infused with powerful curses. &nbsp;The Dragon Majin youth’s hair had already turned white, and he had a pale complexion with blue eyes. &nbsp;There was a black feather-like horn protruding from atop his pointy left ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura’s amethyst eyes shook.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dikal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>2</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Majin youth was full of madness. &nbsp;He snickered as he looked at Laura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You remembered my name. &nbsp;It is an honor. &nbsp;However, you are wrong. &nbsp;You should call me by a different name.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dikal Aunsaurus. &nbsp;That is now my name.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Dikal activated his Dragon Demon magic. Six swords, which were letting out powerful Curse magic, rose into the air. &nbsp;They flew towards Laura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura blocked the swords as she flew into the air. &nbsp;Dikal chased after her as he poured out continuous magic spells.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-cheet! &nbsp;Pah-jee-jeek! &nbsp;Pah-baht!</span></p>
 <p><span style>High ranked magicians were fighting in the air with magic. &nbsp;It caused sparks and ripple like waves. &nbsp;They were performing magic spells at high speed, but they were severing the flow of energy before the magic spell could take shape. &nbsp;It was a quiet, yet fierce battle. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal asked her a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why aren’t you using your Dragon weapon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That… &nbsp;I do not have it anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha! &nbsp;So it was true that the man, who possesses the name steeped in sin, asked for the Vitan’s Chalice in exchange for accepting your betrayal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You admit to it too easily! &nbsp;Foolish bitch!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal suddenly stopped speaking, and he cackled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;I shouldn’t be mad about it. &nbsp;Of course, I also had to struggle through hell to gain that…. &nbsp;Thanks to your betrayal I was able to take off that damnable mask. &nbsp;I’m able to live with my face out in the open, so you are my benefactor, Laura.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal Aunsaurus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He hadn’t possessed a name until not too long ago. &nbsp;No, to be precise, his name had been taken away from him. &nbsp;On the day Laura received her name, he received the name of Dikal. &nbsp;When he was branded as a failure, his name was stolen again. &nbsp;He was restrained using black magic, and he had become a mere tool to be used in battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had thought he would expire after being used in such a way forever. &nbsp;However, he had regained his name when Laura betrayed them. &nbsp;The leaders of the Aunsaurus was taken aback by the news, so they gave back Dikal his name. &nbsp;He was named the new heir. &nbsp;Then he was given orders to kill Laura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since you’ve already bestowed me a favor, you should go all the way by dying here. &nbsp;I’ll be very thankful. &nbsp;This will solidify my position….. &nbsp;I would have liked it if I could have taken back the Vitan’s Chalice, but I guess I’ll have to kill the man, who possesses it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He sent a fierce attack towards her. &nbsp;He had just finished the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual, so his condition was optimal. &nbsp;He was overflowing with firepower, and his Dragon Demon magic came up as if it was flowing forth from a spring with an endless source.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>His six swords weren’t Dragon weapons, but they were powerful magical weapons created by Aunsaurus during the Dragon Demon War. &nbsp;It flew around at high speed, and there were six different yet powerful curses infused within them. &nbsp;The weapons possessed a sense of self &nbsp;that worked in concert with the user. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In terms of magical attacks, they were almost equal. &nbsp;The difference were the tools they possessed. &nbsp;Laura was slowly losing ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-ah-ahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“……!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura was flung away by an explosion. &nbsp;Her face crumpled from the pain. &nbsp;When she blocked the cursed swords, a magic spell arrived from another direction. &nbsp;It pierced through her barrier, and it had delivered a shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal mocked Laura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected, you are amazing. &nbsp;You are able to hold up to this extent without the Dragon weapon? &nbsp;However, we don't have to all join the fight…. &nbsp;I’ll kill you on my own!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…we? &nbsp;Did you bring the Shadow’s Sword Belt?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At his words, Laura asked the question as if she was groaning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Shadow Sword Belt was a unit formed of beings, who failed to become the Aunsaurus’ heir. &nbsp;The Aunsaurus family didn’t use this force unless it was something very important. &nbsp;Dikal had been a member of the Shadow’s Sword Belt not too long ago. &nbsp;Each member was stripped of their names, and their faces were covered with a cursed mask. &nbsp;His pale face was caused by it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal gave her an answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;Do you know how much importance they are putting on killing you? &nbsp;Moreover, do you realize how little trust they put in me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He spoke mockingly about himself. &nbsp;Dikal was given the magic weapons of Aunsaurus, and the Shadow’s Sword Belt was send along with him. &nbsp;It meant they had no confidence that he would be able to win again Laura by himself. &nbsp;They believed so even though she no longer possessed her Dragon weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, they will find out through this event! &nbsp;They’ll realize they were wrong in their judgement! &nbsp;They will realize their selection process was flawed from the beginning!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After driving Laura’s back against the wall, Dikal’s voice was now filled with ecstasy &nbsp;Everyone had fought desperately for the title of heir. However, the standard they were measured up against was strict, and even a minor mistake would disqualify one from the competition. &nbsp;There were picking one child from a crop of talented kids that numbered over 100. &nbsp;Some weren’t even given identities before they were used as tools. &nbsp;It exemplified how crazy of a process it was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the ones that failed were discontent with the process. &nbsp;A very minor mistake had robbed them of all opportunities in life, and they were thrown into the pits of hell. &nbsp;How could they not be bitter?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal was Laura’s last competition, so he felt especially aggrieved. &nbsp;The Aunsaurus family had been wrong. &nbsp;He was given another opportunity to show them he was the most suitable candidate to become the heir….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Laura spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…so that was what you were thinking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You speak as if you've never thought the same thing. &nbsp;Isn’t it the same for you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was different for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura shook her head from side to side. &nbsp;She spoke as she looked straight at Dikal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t have the luxury to think such thoughts unlike you, Dikal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I never thought about the future. &nbsp;I didn’t care about what I was trying to accomplish was worth. &nbsp;What you guys were thinking about…. &nbsp;I never thoughta bout it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Until Laura became the heir, she never thought she was exceptional. The number of disqualified candidates mounted as her siblings disappeared. &nbsp;At some point in time, everything lost meaning to her as the color faded from the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was ridiculous, but until she became Aunsaurus heir, she had been going through the motion. &nbsp;She let the inertia of her circumstances carry her until she had met Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a time when she had been happy to receive a name. &nbsp;Then she worked desperately to measure up to the standard of the ones that were giving the test. &nbsp;The events are her created a momentum, and she was merely pushed forward by it. &nbsp;The desire to go forward had been extinguished a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the time, even her will to live had been starting to fade. &nbsp;When she went into a test, she knew there was a chance that she would no longer exist at the end. &nbsp;This was why she had let go of determining her own fate. &nbsp;She stood up with an empty heart. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she had survived. &nbsp;Maybe, her indifference had helped her inadvertently. &nbsp;Her competitors had been desperate, and their hearts were shaken by hope and despair. &nbsp;Her heart had never shook as she </span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Laura spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry.”</span></p>
