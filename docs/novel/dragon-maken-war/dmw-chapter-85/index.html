 <p>Chapter 85 – The Scar Left on the World (5)</p>
 <p><span style>9</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura Aunsauras had failed at her mission, and she eventually returned to the Plain of Darkness. The elders didn't blame her. &nbsp;They had read the reports given by her, and the members that went along to carry out the plan. &nbsp;They decided nothing else could have been done by her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she retreated away from the elders, Laura went towards a detached palace where the Aunsaurus family lived. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone appeared in front of her when she arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Laura.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a beautiful blonde haired Dragon Demon teen. &nbsp;He possessed horns that looked as if it had been cut from ice, and color was infused into it. &nbsp;It was Kieren Baldazark. &nbsp;Laura spoke as she looked at him with a blank face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Baldazark. &nbsp;Shouldn't you be conducting a mission right now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kieren had addressed Laura in a friendly manner. &nbsp;However, Laura was strict in using honorifics &nbsp;by calling him a lord. &nbsp;Kieren shrugged his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was merely given a scouting mission where I had to assess the marquisate of Karzark. &nbsp;As I was conducting my mission, I received a report saying the Cold-blooded Queen was on the move. &nbsp;I was given an order to return.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you just cleanly broke off from your mission. &nbsp;That is very like you, Lord Baldazark.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, I was given a return order.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it was Niberis, she would have stayed to obtain a good result. &nbsp;She would have fought with the Cold-blooded Queen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baldazark's expression stiffened slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, I'm not in a position to speak about such things.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. Mmmm. &nbsp;Laura. What happened this time....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kieren knew Laura had come back after failing her mission. &nbsp;Laura had never experienced failure before. &nbsp;He was wondering if he should console her or not.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Surprisingly, it wasn't too bad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm talking about failure. Now that I experienced it, and I don't think it's that big of a deal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn't comprehend what she was talking about. &nbsp;Laura spoke to Baldazark, who had a puzzled expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, it is regretful that sir Rick had to meet his death..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…I judged he would be able to succeed in his task. &nbsp;I guess I was too hasty with my decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At those words, Kieren let out a bitter laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rick was a Dragon Majin that had been a vassal of the Baldazark family. &nbsp;He was dispatched alongside Laura to complete this mission. &nbsp;Originally, he was tasked to do the Dragon Slayer's Ritual with the Thunder Dragon after the mission. &nbsp;However, he was pushed into a Dragon Slayer's Ritual with the Frost Dragon, which was unexpectedly brought forth by the Guardian Shadows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, he was defeated in the life and death battle. &nbsp;He died after presenting his Wisdom to the Frost Dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura was silent for a brief moment as she looked at Kieren. She dropped the issue as she changed the topic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cold-blooded Queen. &nbsp;I've never seen her, but I heard she is more dangerous than the Dragon Sword Duke.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm. I haven't met her either. &nbsp;Even if I do come across her, I was given orders not to fight her. These were the guidelines given to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She is someone I want to pit against Niberis at least once.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Laura…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kieren's brows furrowed a little bit as Laura continued to express her desire to trip up Niberis. &nbsp;Normally, Laura didn't even bother with Niberis. One could actually feel the tangible malice emanating from Niberis towards Laura. &nbsp;However, Laura's indifferent attitude had always bugged Niberis. &nbsp;So what had changed?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry. &nbsp;Am I being petulant?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm somehow in that sort of a mood. &nbsp;When I return, I'll probably be compared to Lord Baldazark, and you know how much I don't like hearing that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis, Laura and Kieren were the young geniuses that received the most attention in the Plains of Darkness. &nbsp;Of course, they thought of each other as competition. &nbsp;This was why they were mindful of each other's merits. &nbsp;In truth, this wasn't something they demanded of themselves. &nbsp;Their backgrounds put pressure on them, and it was sometimes hard to breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kieren was someone that was pulling ahead of the competition. &nbsp;Unlike Niberis and Laura, he had experienced several failures earlier on. &nbsp;However, he had used this experience to better himself. &nbsp;He was more careful in his planning now, and he steadily increased the merits he achieved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis had been doing well compared to Kieren, yet she had suffered a very painful failure. &nbsp;Laura had suffered something very similar this time around. &nbsp;The elders of the Aunsauras family had requested perfection from her starting a young age. &nbsp;It had been said enough that she was fed up with it. &nbsp;She was annoyed when she thought about the words that would be directed towards her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Baldazark. &nbsp;What would you do if there was a descendant of Azell Karzark still alive?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm? You mean THE Azell Karzark? &nbsp;Why are you asking such a question?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm just curious.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura didn't go out of her way to explain to Kieren about Azell Zestringer. &nbsp;Kieren tilted his head in confusion at the question that had came out of nowhere. &nbsp;He answered her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess it could happen. &nbsp;Humans are able to procreate easily, so there might be some descendants left in the world. &nbsp;We killed the house of Karzark, and anyone related to him by blood. &nbsp;However, we aren't gods. &nbsp;We can't always be perfect in our tasks..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Azell had heard this conversation, he would have used every method possible to kill them. &nbsp;The eradication of the Karzark family had been a calamity carried out by the Dragon Demon King worshippers. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess that isn't what I wanted to ask you. &nbsp;What would you do if his descendant really got in our way?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We have to kill him. &nbsp;That is an obvious question.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn't it? &nbsp;Thank you for giving me an answer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if she expected such an answer, she nodded her head before she turned her body away. &nbsp;However, when she reached a point where Kieren couldn't see her, she looked up into the air as she mumbled to herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, I want to ask him a question. &nbsp;How did our burdens, which comes with our bloodlines, differ from each other....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon King had wanted to make a new world, and they were the chosen ones that had received the blood of such an exalted being.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then there were the humans, who had received the blood of the one that stopped the Dragon Demon King from establishing himself as a ruler.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had been 220 years, and she wondered the difference significance each side put in their bloodlines. &nbsp;Laura was very curious as to learn about this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She stopped walking. &nbsp;She had been heading towards the detached palace of the Aunsaurus family. &nbsp;However, she started heading towards a new direction. She wanted to meet someone that'll give a different answer to the question she posed. &nbsp;She was going to meet an elder, who was the oldest being on this land.</span></p>
 <p><span style>10</span></p>
 <p><span style>After rescuing the Dragon Demon Prince Seigar, the Guardian Shadows didn't say any goodbyes. &nbsp;They just disappeared. &nbsp;It seemed they didn't want to reveal themselves to Seigar, who wasn't part of the Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The unconscious Segiar woke up the next day. &nbsp;Seigar realized his teacher had saved him, and this knowledge made his face turn red. &nbsp;Then he explained what happened in his battle with Laura.....</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So if we piece together your story, Segiar....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he heard Segiar's words, Kairen was able to come to a conclusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So the reason why they tried to kidnap you and Arrieta... &nbsp;Maybe you guys are from the Dragon Demon King's lineage?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is what I think.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Laura Aunsaurus was subduing him in the fight, she had dropped several clues, and he was able to come up with a conjecture. &nbsp;She had pointed out Seigar as she spoke regarding the Great Being. &nbsp;She had said he was someone, who had a part of the king within him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In some ways, their conclusion was a bit hastily made. &nbsp;They only had snippets of information. &nbsp;However, Laura was basically a noble that had come out from the Plains of Darkness. &nbsp;The only one she would call 'king' was the Dragon Demon King.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The probability is high. &nbsp;It somewhat explains the reason behind their kidnap attempts... &nbsp;Mmmm. &nbsp;No. &nbsp;This doesn't really explain it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can it not?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know right? &nbsp;However, there are a lot of Dragon Majins, who were descended from the Dragon Demon King Atein”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm? What are you talking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen asked in surprised. &nbsp;From what he observed from working as part of the Guardian Shadow, the Dragon Demon King worshippers treated anyone with the blood of Dragon Demon King Atein as nobles. &nbsp;No, they were treated almost as royalty. &nbsp;Yet Azell was speaking about such existences as if they were commonplace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is… Atein is one of the oldest Dragon Demon, and he is hypothesized to be the very first mage. &nbsp;He named himself the Dragon Demon King, but before he could unite the Dragon Demon race to muster up an army, &nbsp;he had lived for a very long time. &nbsp;He probably had a lot of relationship throughout his lifetime, and from what I know, he left behind a long of descendants. &nbsp;Therefore, &nbsp;there are an abundant amount of beings all over the world with Atein’s blood in them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…this is the first time I've heard such a story.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did the records regarding Atein get erased too?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. &nbsp;That's... &nbsp;Hmmm. &nbsp;I guess so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen had been about to deny it, but he furrowed his brows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the past 220 years, the Dragon Demon King worshippers had erased numerous records off of the world's history. &nbsp;It was reasonable to think that records about Atein was included in this deletion. &nbsp;No, it was likely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I knew the Dragon Demon King had lived for a long time, and he was one of the very first Dragon Demons. &nbsp;However, I never realized he had so many descendants. &nbsp;No. &nbsp;It would be more accurate if I said I've never even thought about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, it is probably hard to fathom a being that named himself a king left behind descendants all over the world. I guess it is normal to not want such information spread widely.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell accepted that possibility. &nbsp;Before the Dragon Demon war had started, Atein's existence was an unverified legend. &nbsp;He had been treated like a character from a myth that disappeared a long time ago. &nbsp;The knowledge of the origin of the Dragon Demon race and the existence of Atein was limited to magicians. &nbsp;Moreover, no one expected Atein to live so long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Basically, the world found out about Atein's existence after he named himself the Dragon Demon King, and started the Dragon Demon war. &nbsp;Even Azell didn't know about Atein, and he had learned the information through Carlos at a later date. &nbsp;Moreover, Atein’s past was discovered when Carlos researched in depth into the subject.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well… &nbsp;Even if the princess and prince was born with a more undiluted blood of the Dragon Demon King, it wouldn't be a reason to kidnap them. &nbsp;If we are comparing the purity of their bloodlines, the ones in the Plains of Darkness are probably superior in those terms.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That's true. &nbsp;Yet they still tried to kidnap them even as far as going through such danger. &nbsp;There must be an underlying reason….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We don't have any other clues to speculate on the topic. &nbsp;We could expend more of our efforts on speculation, but it’ll be a shock in the dark.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is unfortunate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen clicked his tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm. &nbsp;That woman was a really scary magician. &nbsp;If compared to the Dragon Demon Niberis, whom my sister fought, Laura was her equal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She probably is stronger than Niberis. &nbsp;This is why you don’t have to be so down on yourself. &nbsp;Of course, you would have come up short against her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. If I was a little bit more careful....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar let out a sigh. &nbsp;He was too careful with his subordinates. &nbsp;He made the error of stepping forward in such a defenseless state. &nbsp;He knew what he was worth, so he should have been a little bit more cautious....</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen just looked at Seigar before he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seigar.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As this event as an impetus, why don’t you come with me to be retrained for an extended period of time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. I still have a lot I can still teach you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar was conflicted. It was an attractive offer. &nbsp;It was true the teachings under Kairen had been pure pain. &nbsp;However, if he hadn't spent that time with him, Seigar wouldn't be the man he is right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew he couldn’t hold a candle to Kairen, but he had thought he had enough power. &nbsp;However, that notion was demolished by what had happened. &nbsp;He almost felt a compulsive need to get stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want you to think over it then you can make your decision. I'm going to spend a good amount of time exchanging sword strikes with Azell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar was surprised. &nbsp;He didn't know how he had been rescued. &nbsp;He had just woken up from his state of unconsciousness. &nbsp;The Guardian Shadows had hidden themselves long time ago, and Seigar assumed it was Kairen, who had rescued him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, he would have such a reaction. &nbsp;If one looked at Seigar's standards, Kairen represented absolute strength to him. &nbsp;Kairen hadn't said he would instruct this human knight. &nbsp;He had used the expression of sharing swords with Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen could read his pupil's thought, so he smirked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Azell distinguished himself greatly in his actions to save you. &nbsp;If sir Azell hadn't fought and defeated the Thunder Dragon called out by them, you would probably be still on your way to the Plains of Darkness. &nbsp;You might have been subjected to all kinds of treatments.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He fought and defeated the Thunder Dragon in an one-on-one battle?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Segiar's confusion became much deeper. &nbsp;A human had fought a 1on1 battle with a Dragon, and he had won? &nbsp;&nbsp;Did they want him to really believe such a story?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke as he looked at Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As you can see, you did something that couldn't be done by a human in Segiar's way of looking at this world.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the past, wasn't Duke skeptical of my claims too?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still, I remember myself showing a little more flexibility in my attitude towards your claim.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, I guess everyone beautifies the past memories sometimes in the course of one's life. &nbsp;I heard this tendency develops as one gets older....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chet. You are always so insolent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen clicked his tongue as if he was indignant. &nbsp;Then he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So in the spirit of this conversation, I want you to have a sparring session with Segiar.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll have to refuse the offer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ho-oh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think what I did this time around allows me to be a little bit more obstinate. &nbsp;Isn’t that so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unfortunately, I cannot gainsay you on that point.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If the prince accept your offer and he comes to the Dukedom of Tarantos, I’ll think about it. &nbsp;In truth, I just want to rest for the next few days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen shut his mouth at those words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m such a… &nbsp;I spoke for the betterment of my student, and it caused me to put my foot in my mouth.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen lamented on the fact that his thoughts had been too shallow. &nbsp;Azell's condition had been poor prior to arriving here, and he hadn't been able to sufficiently grow his power. &nbsp;He also didn't have the needed tools, yet he had gone through the Dragon Slayer's Ritual. &nbsp;After all that, Kairen was asking him to have a sparring session with Seigar.....</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…I'm sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don't have to be so earnest with your apology. In terms of my physical health, I'm much better now than when I arrived here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell let out a light laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar was listening to the conversation, and his expression indicated that he had no idea what was going on. &nbsp;Everyone in this kingdom including the royal family treated his teacher with the utmost respect. &nbsp;Yet his teacher was being so friendly and respectful towards a young human....</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, it would be understandable if his teacher was treating Azell as if he took a liking to him. &nbsp;However, Kairen's attitude indicated that he was treating Azell as an equal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen didn't pay attention to Segiar's confusion as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, you probably have a lot of work to do now, so you should go meet your lieutenant. &nbsp;We are going to stay here for the night, and we plan on leaving in the morning.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On that day, Seigar had to thorough a busy day of work. &nbsp;In the end, he couldn't give an answer to Kairen's offer. &nbsp;Moreover, there were too many things for him to consider when making the decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen didn't ask for an immediate answer. &nbsp;He gave his farewell to Seigar, and he left for the Dukedom of Tarantos with Azell in the morning.</span></p>
