 <p>Chapter 135 - Gathering Legends (1)</p>
 <p><span style>1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dragon Sword Duke Kairen was a living legend. &nbsp;He had lived much longer than the lifespan of a human, and he had achieved many accolades. &nbsp;This was why the people of the Rulain Kingdom looked up to him, and in truth, he was proud of that fact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Kairen had also been a youth before, and there were figures in legends he had idolized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were the shining stars, who distinguished themselves in the largest war in human history.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The heroes and villains were all important figures that had their names immortalized. &nbsp;The countless legends from before that existed on the continent were overshadowed by those, who fought in the Dragon Demon war. &nbsp;People would only remember their names in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sometimes Kairen wondered what would have happened if he was born during those times. &nbsp;He had many accomplishments under his belt, but his name would never be immortalized like the heroes of that time. &nbsp;If he was born during that time, how effective would he have been against the big names, who sided with darkness?</span></p>
 <p><span style>In his life, he never thought he would be able to find out the answer to that question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwah-gwah-gwah-gwah……!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The deflagration covered a wide region. &nbsp;It was hard to believe that this was a fight between only two people. &nbsp;The overwhelming shockwave shook the ground. &nbsp;Everyone, who had been fighting for their lives, turned to look at the site of the explosion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Splendid! &nbsp;It has been awhile since I’ve met someone that makes me want to fight! &nbsp;Yes! &nbsp;When a man takes up the sword, one has to have the resolve to charge forward even in front of certain death!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus was laughing uproariously. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It rang out like a thunderclap. &nbsp;Afterwards, a flash of light exploded forth. &nbsp;&nbsp;Kairen, who had taken on Reygus’ attack using all his strength, &nbsp;was immediately attacked again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen had made the right decision. &nbsp;If he hadn’t used an all out attack to fend of Reygus’attack, he would be dead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen’s attack had offset the shockwave created by the head of the hammer, and the attack opened up a path towards Reygus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koohk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen groaned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had never been inferior in terms of power before. &nbsp;However, he couldn’t keep up with Reygus’ strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;When one determined the strong point of an opponent, it was idiotic to insist on playing into the other’s strength. &nbsp;He felt annoyed since his pride had been hurt. &nbsp;However, he was sensible. &nbsp;He fought Reygus with his speed and technique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, his defense was surprisingly strong. &nbsp;Its large body frame and the length of its weapon created a big disparity in terms of reach. &nbsp;Moreover, Reygus’ attack was terrifyingly powerful. &nbsp;Kairen was having a hard time getting in a hit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia had been watching the battle, and she voiced her frustration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Muscle brained idiots….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She surrounded herself with ice walls, and she had endured the shock wave created by the attack. &nbsp;The explosion had created a blast center. &nbsp;It was as if a meteor had impacted on the ground to create a crater. &nbsp;The aftershock had spread to a radius of 500 meters. &nbsp;The nearby forests were overturned as if a volcano had gone off nearby.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s join forces!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Oh my! &nbsp;Girls these days seems to not understand the optics of a battle. &nbsp;Wouldn’t it be better if you looked on with warm eyes as the men fight a one on one battle?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When was that ever in fashion? &nbsp;If you want modest women to dance in front of you, you should have stayed in your grave!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia snorted as she surrounded her spear with frigid winds, and she stabbed with it. &nbsp;Reygus chuckled as it received Kairen and Leticia’s almost simultaneous attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Both of you are splendid!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cold sweat was running down Leticia’s body. &nbsp;She had thought Kairen was fairing well against Reygus, so she thought a joint attack would be able to take it down. &nbsp;The two of them attacked Reygus from the front and back, but Reygus wasn’t being pushed backward easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How can a monster such as this exist?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It’s body was large, and it was swinging a medium sized weapon in heroic fashion. &nbsp;It looked as if it had many openings. &nbsp;However, once she fought it, she knew she had been wrong. &nbsp;Reygus’ fighting style was typical of someone who used a mid sized weapon in conjunction with heavy armor. &nbsp;However, everything else about it was on a ridiculous level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Ho-ooh!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus let out a breath as if it was a living being, and it swung its hammer. &nbsp;At a glance, the attack was full of openings. &nbsp;However, the problem was its reach, and the force of the attack. Reygus swung it at a slight angle as he brought his hammer up from below to the top. &nbsp;At a glance, the attack looked like it was full of openings. &nbsp;However, the problem was the range and force of the blow. &nbsp;Reygus’ big attack was like a runaway train where the force of the attack was too strong to deflect it. &nbsp;One would be sent flying on contact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-pah-pah-pah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then there was an explosive current that followed the attack’s trajectory. &nbsp;It was explosive. &nbsp;The strong wind made it hard for Kairen and Leticia to breathe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If we try to win this by force, we’ll be killed instead.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen and Leticia came to the same conclusion. &nbsp;Reygus’ overall movement was slow, but it was able to accelerate and boost its power to an overwhelming degree at any given moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;Each strike looked like a light attack, but there was great power behind each blow. &nbsp;Moreover, it was an Undead, so it didn’t have to catch its breath. &nbsp;It could continue attacking without breathing, so in a high speed battle, it was at an advantage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Che-eek! &nbsp;Kee-keeng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Harsh sounds were emitted as sparks flew off of Reygus’ armor. &nbsp;Kairen’s sword has slid off of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how skilled Reygus was, it couldn’t block all the high speed attack that was coming at it from both sides. &nbsp;It pushed the two out into the perimeter using its power, but attacks got through intermittently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Ooh-mmm!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t for the heavy armor infused with powerful magic, they could have ended this long ago. &nbsp;Kairen and Leticia’s attack was that excellent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It really feels like I’m fighting against a castle.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen was letting out cold sweat. &nbsp;In the first place, Reygus was the type of fighter to fight while taking on blows like a berserker. &nbsp;The magical energy surrounding its body was so strong that it was hard to pierce through its defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia was also in a bind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘My cold winds aren’t working at all.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Normally, cold based attacks weren’t that effective against the Undead. &nbsp;If it was a living being, the extreme cold would slow down the bodily functions, and her enemies would have to worry about frost bites. &nbsp;The Undead could be physically frozen, but it took no other damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Reygus was showing a stronger resistance than normal to the cold than the other Undead. &nbsp;The cold energy should have turned a normal person into an ice pillar. &nbsp;It was cold enough for frosts to form on the surface of one’s skin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Kairen grinded his teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Koohk! &nbsp;If I was alone, I wouldn’t have been able to handle it. Shit!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was called the Dragon Sword Duke, and he had always held the upper hand in terms of power. Now he was on the wrong side of the power balance, so it was the first time he had wanted his allies to come to his aid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His pride hurt that he couldn’t face Reygus alone. &nbsp;He was facing an opponent that was too much for him. &nbsp;This was the first time he judged he couldn’t beat an opponent since he faced Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What the hell are the Guardian Shadows doing?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he gained some distance, he surveyed his surrounding. &nbsp;What was the two Undead, who had been fighting with Balseru, doing right now? &nbsp;&nbsp;They clearly had the advantage, so if the others helped out, Kairen thought he could end this battle….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, Kairen discovered the reason why.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Shit. They are numerous, and they are elite troops.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>His attention had been focused on Reygus, so he hadn’t realized that there were a great number of Dragon Demon king worshippers present. &nbsp;Kairen and Leticia was in charge of confronting Reygus, who was like a sweeping force. &nbsp;The rest was being taken care of by the Guardian Shadows, Yuren and Laura. &nbsp;There were several Dragon Demons and Dragon Majins officers present. &nbsp;The rest were elite troops, so everyone was busy fighting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;This is fun. &nbsp;I heard our side did some funny business in erasing the old techniques from the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;However, you guys are quite good.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus was being pushed back in a hurry, yet it seemed it was enjoying itself. &nbsp;Was its personality like that in life? &nbsp;Or did it lose the ability to fear death when it became an Undead?</span></p>
 <p><span style>At its words, Kairen’s face crumpled. &nbsp;It was humiliating, but he would have lost outright if it wasn’t for the techniques taught to him by Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In his past battles with Dragon Demon king worshippers, he had been able to win without using such secret techniques. &nbsp;His wealth of Dragon Demon magic and Dragon swords were enough. &nbsp;He hadn’t even possessed any high level skills. &nbsp;He kept working on his foundation to build himself up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Reygus was an enemy that couldn’t never be overcome with just that. &nbsp;Dragon Arts of very high difficulty was being used by Reygus. &nbsp;It was influencing the surrounding and Kairen’s magical energy. &nbsp;His mind was being attack, and his senses were askew on top of physical damage. &nbsp;Reygus looked as if it was fighting in a simple style, but it was using these high level skills as if it was nothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh……!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen, who had been glaring at Reygus, shuddered. &nbsp;He sensed an overwhelming amount of Dragon Demon magic from afar. &nbsp;It stimulated his senses so much that he took eyes off of an opponent he should have his eyes glued to. &nbsp;He looked towards the source where the wave of power emanated from.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Oh yeah!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Terror struck Kairen’s heart, and he got into a defensive stance. &nbsp;However, Reygus didn’t attack. &nbsp;Instead, he laughed as if he enjoyed all of this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Ho-oh. &nbsp;I didn’t like that brat, because he was so gloomy. &nbsp;However, I have to acknowledge his skill. &nbsp;He was able to kill a Dragon.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did the the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual end?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He mumbled to himself as if he was groaning. &nbsp;The feeling he felt was familiar. &nbsp;He felt it when Laura was trying to kidnap Seigar. &nbsp;It was the same feeling he felt when Azell won against the Thunder Dragon using the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Yes. &nbsp;From what I’ve heard, kids these days only have a 20 percent chance of succeeding in the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual. &nbsp;He managed to succeed.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Shall we continue to play? &nbsp;It seems my guys are starting to lose, so I’ll have to end this soon.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as it had said. &nbsp;The Dragon Demon king worshippers were at a disadvantage. &nbsp;While Kairen and Leticia occupied Reygus, Yuren, Laura and the Guardian Shadows had teamed up to cut down on the number of Dragon Demon King worshippers that were present.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia made a sarcastic remark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve been busy dodging attack, so you aren’t in a position to say those words.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It hurt Kairen and Leticia’s pride to join forces, but they held the upper hand in the fight. &nbsp;&nbsp;Reygus had been hit several times, so a part of its armor was damaged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Reygus was still full of confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;That’s… &nbsp;Unfortunately, that won’t be true anymore.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leticia became confused at that moment.</span></p>
