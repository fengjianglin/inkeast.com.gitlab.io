 <p>Chapter 140 - Second Coming of a Legend (3)</p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You bastard! &nbsp;I’m trying to transform to show you my true power. &nbsp;Don’t you know the etiquette where you have to wait for me?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I remember correctly, you were the only one in the Dragon Demon king’s army that wanted to observe such etiquettes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell mocked Reygus as he attacked. &nbsp;However, Reygus reacted swiftly. &nbsp;Even after its magical energy doubled, it continued to increase. &nbsp;Reygus was quickly becoming stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I won’t be as easy to deal with as before!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus reacted with surprising speed as it defended against Azell’s fierce attacks. &nbsp;The force didn’t need to be loaded onto its muscles, and it wasn’t constrained by the need to breathe. &nbsp;Even Azell was having trouble dealing with Reygus at high speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zzuhng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, at some point, fire erupted from Reygus’ side. &nbsp;Azell had bypassed its defense to hit it with a solid attack. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;What the hell?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your techniques aren’t as good as before. &nbsp;I don’t know how long you’ve been an Undead, but it seems you aren’t completely used to being one!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was just the beginning. &nbsp;Flame erupted from various parts of Reygus’ body. &nbsp;Since a Dragon Arts practitioner had lost Dragon Demon magic, it was understandable to see it struggle to use techniques. &nbsp;Azell looked for these openings, and he used his mental waves to confuse Reygus’ sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Koo! Shit!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a flash, Reygus lifted its soul hammer in a heroic fashion. As if Azell had been waiting for this move, he let out an an attack. &nbsp;When the Dragon Maken was planted within the empty body of Reygus, an explosive sound rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, in the next moment, Azell was sent flying as blood sprayed into the air. &nbsp;&nbsp;Reygus shrugged off Azell’s stab as if it was nothing, and Reygus counterattacked. &nbsp;Reygus was already dead, so it was nonplussed as it decided to fight in such a manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Sometimes there are advantages to having a dead body! &nbsp;Ha ha ha!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You rotten brained bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell grinded his teeth. &nbsp;It wasn’t as if he hadn’t predicted Reygus would try such a move. &nbsp;However, he was able to pierce it squarely with his Dragon Maken, so he judged that it would be enough to be able to interrupt Reygus’ movement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only thing that occurred was a portion of its armor and ribs breaking. &nbsp;Reygus had already been sturdy like a fortress, but his defense had strengthened considerably with the rapid increase of its magical energy. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, someone used whispering to talk to Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Sir Azell. &nbsp;No… &nbsp;Oh, hero Azell Karzark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Balseru.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-What? &nbsp;I’m busy right now. &nbsp;Can we talk later?</span></p>
 <p><span style>-There is something I have to speak to you about right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-What is it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I want us to switch opponents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-What?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an unexpected suggestion, so Azell furrowed his brows. &nbsp;Balseru continued to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-We will engage Reygus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I thought you guys didn’t fare well against Reygus earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-It is so, but we didn’t lose either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Hmmm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-We can’t win, but at the very least, we can keep it occupied. &nbsp;Wouldn’t it be better for you to take care of the others while we do so? &nbsp;We have to get out of here before their reinforcements arrive. &nbsp;I believe getting rid of everyone except Reygus would secure the safety of our comrades. &nbsp;I believe that will be the better option.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I don’t know where that confidence is coming from, but…. &nbsp;&nbsp;All right. &nbsp;I do have other worries, and I accept that your judgement is correct. &nbsp;I’ll let you handle it for now. &nbsp;We’ll move at the count of three.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-I understand.,</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a count of three, Azell created his clones, and they attacked Reygus. &nbsp;Its broken body parts and armor had been recovered. &nbsp;It raised its hammer in heroic fashion as it parried the attack. &nbsp;However, at that moment, the Dragon Maken held within the clone’s hand turned into a thunderbolt as it exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ggwah-gwah-gwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He used this opportunity to switch places with Balseru and his group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus was a bit late in realizing this fact, and it was furious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Azell! &nbsp;Are you going to run away from a one on one fight between men! &nbsp;You’ve turned into a coward in the time I haven’t seen you!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why don’t you speak more reasonably? If you want a fair one on one fight with me, you shouldn’t have brought your posse with you. &nbsp;You should come at me alone next time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You bastard! &nbsp;Do you really think these bastards will be able to stop me?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru and two Undead stepped forward to face Reygus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus noticed it at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Mmmm?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn't running with the same force as before. &nbsp;It was still fast, but it was noticeably slower than before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zzuh-uhng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Undead Rho blocked the soul hammer. &nbsp;After Reygus’ massive increase in magical energy, it was on a different level in regards to power and speed. &nbsp;However, Rho was able to block it thanks to Balseru’s power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Kook! &nbsp;Is this the thing from before?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus expressed its annoyance. &nbsp;An outside power was restricting its magical energy. &nbsp;If it was a simple trick used by magicians, Reygus could have unravelled it with a snort. &nbsp;However, it had no idea what method was being used.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only thing it was sure about was that this phenomenon originated from Balseru’s eyes. &nbsp;Just looking at them gave Reygus chills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I seems I won’t get my answers unless I destroy you!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus roared as it ran towards Balseru. &nbsp;Rho tried to get in the way, but it was useless. When Rho was about to swing its axe, Reygus accelerated a beat faster to ram its body into Rho.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Koo-ahk!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if Rho was hit by a runaway train. &nbsp;It was sent flying. &nbsp;Phi, the fire Undead magician, had been ready to attack when an opportunity was created through Rho’s attack. &nbsp;It was taken aback. &nbsp;It was going to attack with magic when Rho stopped Reygus’ charge, but the result hadn’t occurred in a manner it expected!</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You guys are terrible at adapting to different situations! &nbsp;Brats!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus maintained his momentum as it sent the Guardian Shadows protecting Balseru flying. &nbsp;It was so fast that Balseru standing in an awkward posture as if he was having a hard time reacting to what was going on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Reygus knew it had made the wrong decision when its hammer was about to come down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It seems you have a death wish.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru rushed forward to swing his sword. &nbsp;Did he really want to receive the blow of the hammer with such a thin sword? &nbsp;He was begging to be crushed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next moment, a pure white light washed over them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Ooh-huhk?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they were about to clash, Reygus’ movements suddenly slowed, and Balseru’s movements accelerated. &nbsp;It was as if time moved differently for the two of them. &nbsp;Balseru’s attack came towards it before the hammer could be swung. &nbsp;Reygus had no choice, but to avoid it in fright.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus staggered backwards as it retreated. &nbsp;It grinded its teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Shit! &nbsp;It seems he has other talens aside from being able to glare at others?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru used Instantaneous Movement to charge forward. &nbsp;The thunder-like strike of the sword was blocked by the head of the hammer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ddah-ahhhhhhng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the ground shook, something unbelievable happened. Reygus was being pushed backwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-oohk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balseru groaned. &nbsp;He felt the force delivered by the clash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His eyes had absolute power over the Undead. &nbsp;He just had to look at an Undead. &nbsp;No, if he was to be more precise, he could suppress any techniques that dealt with death. &nbsp;This was the ability given to the one with the codename Alpha. &nbsp;Undead beings were supposed to fall under him. &nbsp;They weren’t supposed to be able to defy him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Reygus was still displaying incredible battle capabilities. &nbsp;Its power had only lessened by a little bit. &nbsp;This was why he was confronted with a problem he had never worried about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he had his eyes closed, it meant his stored magical energy within his eyes had been expended. &nbsp;He would need time to recharge his magical energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They are similar in some ways.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reygus was similar to the ‘Sleepless Guardians’, who guarded the Keepers of Prophecy. &nbsp;It wasn’t just the fact that they were outstanding Undead. &nbsp;The energy they were emitting was strikingly similar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There must be a connection between the two. &nbsp;However, he didn’t dwell on such matter right now. &nbsp;He finally knew the true meaning behind destiny, so all he could do was fight with all his might against the enemy in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is a matter of how long I can last.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew he couldn’t win. &nbsp;However, he was trying to come up with a plan that would allow him to stall Reygus. &nbsp;He had to give Azell a little bit more time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…Dragon Demon general Reygus.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A strange light was being emitted from his eyes as Balseru smiled. &nbsp;He had an awkward smile as if he had never laughed before. &nbsp;This was why It was a sickening smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;What?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thanks to you, I…. &nbsp;No, we finally realized what our origin and fate is. &nbsp;I never imagined a time would come where I would have to express my thanks to a Dragon Demon king worshipper.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A laughter tinged with madness flowed out of Balseru’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>4</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s party was fighting well in conjunction with the Guardian Shadows. &nbsp;However, there was one person, who was in danger. &nbsp;She had been isolated from her party.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha-ah, ha-ah…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Laura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked disheveled as she tried to get her breathing under control. &nbsp;In an one on one battle, she was able to dominate Dikal. &nbsp;However, she was helpless against the relentless attacks by the Shadow’s Sword Belt. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if Laura was a powerful magician, her opponents had all been candidates that had fought for the title to be heir. &nbsp;Their achievements in the study of magic was a bit lacking, but all thirty of them were linked through Dragon Demon magic. &nbsp;Moreover, they were under the control of Dikal, and they were being used effectively against her. &nbsp;Of course, she would be on the losing side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was busy blocking endless magic spells coming from all sides that she hadn’t realized that she had been separated from her comrades. &nbsp;She was 2 kilometers away from the main battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why she couldn’t expect help from her comrades. &nbsp;Of course, this was what Dikal had been aiming for.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems even the great Ms. Laura is showing signs of tiring?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal let out a nasty laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no way he could win against her in an one on one battle. &nbsp;However, he commanded the power of the disqualified candidates. &nbsp;He felt an unsightly joy at cornering her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura didn’t have the luxury to answer him. &nbsp;The Shadow’s Sword Belt didn’t want her to catch her breath, so they kept sending spells towards her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He plans on taking me alive.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dikal’s intent was clear. &nbsp;If they had been aggressive in their attempt to kill Laura, she would already be dead by now. &nbsp;However, they were trying to catch her alive at all costs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They blocked Laura from contacting her allies, and they had slowly isolated her. &nbsp;Then they kept chipping away at her stamina and magical energy. &nbsp;In the process, Dikal felt a sadistic joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your fate is sealed, Laura.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The elders want to see the face of the traitor. &nbsp;You already know what will happen next, right? &nbsp;Even if you did betray us, you were an outstanding subject. &nbsp;You might bear the children of the the next generation by receiving our seed or maybe you’ll just become a test subject. &nbsp;It won't matter which fate is chosen for you. &nbsp;You’ll be in a hell appropriate for a traitor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The malice he displayed was hair-raising. &nbsp;She would rather die than be caught by the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;They had the ability to make her experience hell. &nbsp;In an attempt to appease the Aunsaurus family, Dikal would willingly throw Laura into hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s see…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the encircling net backed off, Dikal stepped forward. &nbsp;At the same time, a hole was punched through the wall of fire that Laura had been fighting against.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Puh-uhng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kyahkkk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura let out a scream as she was pushed backwards. &nbsp;Dikal had intentionally made this hole. &nbsp;Laura was well aware of this fact. &nbsp;In such a situation, she had to try something even if it was a longshot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if he had been waiting for her response. &nbsp;He deflected Laura’s magic. &nbsp;Then he overpowered her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha ha ha ha! Is that all &nbsp;you got? &nbsp;If you were going to end it like this, why did you trouble us so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura glared at him. &nbsp;&nbsp;Dikal made an invidious remark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph. &nbsp;That’s right, Laura. &nbsp;You were right. &nbsp;I did come here too early.”</span></p>
