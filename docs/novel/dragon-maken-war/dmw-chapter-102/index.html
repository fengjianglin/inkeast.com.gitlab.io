 <p>Chapter 102 – The Sword that Split the Heavens (5)</p>
 <p><span style>Jeffers was a powerful Dragon Arts practitioner, and he was holding a Dragon Demon weapon in his hand. &nbsp;Therefore, he shouldn't be fighting a normal sword fight with Azell. &nbsp;Every swing should be flattening the surrounding as if a typhoon had descended upon the land.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he wasn't able to do so. &nbsp;Since Kieren was a magician, he couldn't see through the problem, but he could tell something was wrong by looking at Jeffers' expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was perfectly controlling Jeffers' movements.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jerffers was somehow able to match each sword strike, but he was being overwhelmed in all other aspect. &nbsp;He tried to raise his Dragon Demon Qi, and it was as if Azell had been waiting for it. Jeffers’ Energy Pulse was cut off. &nbsp;If he tried to use the power of the Dragon Demon weapon, it was interfered with. &nbsp;Jeffers was adept at using the flow of power. &nbsp;Most of his moves required amplification. &nbsp;It was needed to create burst damage, yet it was being sealed. &nbsp;This situation was a nightmare for Jeffers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Hmm. Who the hell is this bastard?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jeffers was a mystery he couldn't solve, so Azell furrowed his brows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was trying to confirm something in this sword battle. &nbsp;Instead of focusing on killing his enemy, Azell was obsessing over the question he had. &nbsp;It was very foolish thing to do, yet Azell couldn't help himself. &nbsp;He decided he had to figure out if there was some secret design being carried out by the Dragon Demon king worshippers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However... &nbsp;Azell wouldn't be able to find the answer by fighting him. &nbsp;Jeffers Almarick's existence was a puzzle that couldn't be solved by Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen sent a Whispering towards Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-How long are you going to play with him? &nbsp;It isn't the time to play around right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>7</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen was protecting Yuren as he fought against the Dragon Demon king worshippers. &nbsp;Azell had blown away most of the enemy's forces, so it wasn't difficult for Kairen to face the remaining troops. &nbsp;However, Laura gave intermittent assistance to the troops, so Kairen was at a disadvantage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell sighed at those words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;In the end, I can't solve this problem right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you talking about about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Jeffers furrowed his brows, Azell took a big leap backwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The summon of the Dragon Maken had reached its limit. &nbsp;At the very least, he wouldn't be able to summon it again in this battle. &nbsp;It would be impossible for him to kill all of them with overwhelming force. &nbsp;He had to incrementally cause confusion, and this would cause his opponents to reveal their &nbsp;weak points....</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a being ran past Azell to attack Jeffers. &nbsp;It was Leticia.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll take this guy. &nbsp;This bastard... &nbsp;No, I have a debt to settle with this bastard's bloodline.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Anyways, it seems you have your own opponent you will have to deal with.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if she didn't have any more words for him, Leticia turned her head away. &nbsp;While Azell was taken aback by her actions, someone rushed towards Azell as he brought down a black sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zzhuhng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white Dragon Sword and the Black Sword, which was a nexus of Darkness Magic, clashed against each other. &nbsp;A clear sound rang out. &nbsp;Azell looked at the Black Swordsman Duran, who was letting out a fearsome killing intent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;I guess I have to settle my debt against you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the previous battle with Niberis, Azell had suffered under the hands of Duran. &nbsp;It was an unforgettable memory. &nbsp;Azell's fighting spirit burned as he assessed Duran's battle capability. &nbsp;After the first clash, the two of them exchanged five moves in a flash. &nbsp;When they disengaged from each other, Zell had a decent idea about the other man's power level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He's a Septuple Master. &nbsp;He is the strongest Spirit Order practitioner I've met in this era.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to Kairen, the Rulain Kingdom also possessed a high rank Spirit Order practitioner. &nbsp;Viscount Haven was the kingdom's greatest swordsman, and his skills were even acknowledged by Kairen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Azell hadn't had the opportunity to meet him. &nbsp;While he was staying at the Dukedom of Tarantos, the most accomplished Spirit Order practitioner he met was a Sextuple master. Moreover, every time one added a ring the difficulty of progressing to the next ring increased. &nbsp;Duran was at a level where Azell considered him to be the top Spirit Order practitioner he had personally met in this era.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Duran was shaken to the core when he looked at Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What did this runt do? &nbsp;Even if he did go through the Dragon Slayer's Ritual, how could he have gone through such a rapid growth?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran had never gone through the Dragon's Slayer Ritual before. &nbsp;However, as an officer living inside the Plain of Darkness, he was allowed access to the knowledge about the Dragon Slayer's Ritual. Even if one did had experienced a successful Dragon Slayer's Ritual, Azell's growth rate couldn't be explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He can now rival my power... &nbsp;No, could it be higher than mine?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran wasn't able to get a measure of Azell's fighting power. &nbsp;Since he assumed Azell wasn’t able to see assess him either, Duran didn't consider this occurrence to be strange. &nbsp;It was something that happened quite often amongst Spirit Order practitioners of similar level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran shook off his confusion, and he yelled out in anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How dare a sinner harm the Miss' precious body! &nbsp;I'll send you to hell!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have such a great slave mentality that I'm in awe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are a fool that doesn't know the truth. &nbsp;I won't forgive your transgression!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…actually, I have a question I want to ask you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell asked his question as he blocked Duran's violent attacks. &nbsp;Azell wasn't being pressed into a corner. &nbsp;Azell didn't show any urgency, and his attitude made Duran's eyebrows twitch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Were you perhaps a talent grown from within the ranks of the Dragon Demon king worshippers?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell still couldn't understand why humans of this era chose to become Dragon Demon king worshippers. &nbsp;However, if the person grew up from within the organization of the Dragon Demon king worshippers, he could somewhat understand how it could happen. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran snorted at Azell's conjecture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was saved by a benefactor, and he blessed me with the knowledge, which allowed me to find the correct path.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm. &nbsp;So you weren't originally a Dragon Demon king worshipper? &nbsp;You chose to become one? &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;The Dragon Demon war ended a long time ago, and it is the era where humans reign. &nbsp;So why do you worship a phantom from the past?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His teaching is the real truth. &nbsp;Our god may be considered to be history after his death, but our worship for him hasn't ended yet. We have to fight in the darkness until our savior returns. &nbsp;This is the tribulation the believers have to bear.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is his teaching the correct one? &nbsp;Do you really relish the idea where the Dragon Demons rule over the humans?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don't make me laugh. &nbsp;The evil that has to be fixed in the world is the human’s domination of this world.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One's ability doesn't matter to humans. &nbsp;Good and evil doesn't matter either. &nbsp;The only thing that matter is bloodlines. &nbsp;Just because one is born from better parents... &nbsp;These irredeemable trashes look down and steps on the other humans based on their bloodlines. &nbsp;How is that just? &nbsp;We aren't talking about beings born from another race. &nbsp;Humans use other humans to build up their destiny. &nbsp;They do this by controlling, dominating and exploiting those of the same race. &nbsp;How can you say this world order is just!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Azell listened to Duran's words, he knew that he would never be able to bridge the emotional distance he felt with Duran. &nbsp;Duran’s voice was filled with hate and sadness that won't be erased in his lifetime.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell didn't know what kind of life Duran had led. &nbsp;However, Spirit Order practitioners dealt with the mind. &nbsp;Even amongst high level Spirit Order practitioners, one could get a glimpse of the underlying truth of the other using one’s will.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is it because he is a religious fanatic?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had seen countless variation of shortcomings expressed by humans. &nbsp;He saw humans betray each other in order to live. &nbsp;In front of reality that was unbearable, he saw the minds of humans break as they searched for refuge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No, he is different. &nbsp;This man...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had seen people like Duran before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the Dragon Demon war, the environment made it easy for humans to hate on other humans. &nbsp;It wouldn't be too hard to become inflamed by the action of humans. &nbsp;It was easy to see why one could hate, scorn and give up on the humans. In extreme situations, humans had the capacity to become feeble-minded and unsightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell also had despised many humans, and he had given up on them. However, he was also able to find humans he was able to love. &nbsp;How miraculous was that?</span></p>
 <p><span style>A human, who didn't love the world made by humans, was standing in front of him. &nbsp;It wasn't strange to see such an occurrence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the Dragon Demon War, Azell had despised the system he was affiliated with. &nbsp;He had raged as he looked at the stupid and self-centered humans above him. &nbsp;In such an unreasonable situation, he had struggled for a solution to do away with the difficulty he faced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what if the difficulty and unreasonableness had been so huge that Azell hadn't been able to overcome it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>What if Azell didn't have the power, talent or luck to cause change? &nbsp;He would basically be trampled by his own fate...</span></p>
 <p><span style>What would he have been like in such a situation?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘…I see.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell finally received an answer to his question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the Dragon Demon war, there were Dragon Demons, who had loved humans. &nbsp;They hadn't agreed with the will of the Dragon Demon King. &nbsp;They betrayed their own race to stand with the humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then there were the opposite case. &nbsp;There were humans, who were filled with so much hate, that they agreed with the will of the Dragon Demon king. &nbsp;These humans joined the Dragon Demon army.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demon King was dead, and it had been 200 years since the end of the Dragon Demon war. &nbsp;However, the social composition hadn't changed. &nbsp;It was still too easy for the humans to hate other humans. &nbsp;When one faced an unreasonable amount of adversity in this world, it wasn't strange to see some people consider the worship of the Dragon Demon King as a solution.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn't you say your name was Duran? &nbsp;It has been a long time I've seen someone like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A long time... &nbsp;This is the first time I've seen someone like you, you sinner of a runt!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn't mean it that way. &nbsp;It's just... &nbsp;It is a bit sad. &nbsp;Although, the whole situation is ridiculous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you talking about? &nbsp;”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you want to understand, we'll need to have a long conversation. &nbsp;However, I’m sure that will never happen. &nbsp;I wanted to create a world where people no longer despaired. &nbsp;I fought hard for for the change, and the calamity in front of humanity was averted… &nbsp;However, human nature remained the same.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell put on a bitter smile, and he became unyielding. &nbsp;Azell had barely moved, while blocking all of Duran's attack. &nbsp;However, his iron defense was slowly transitioning into offense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At a certain point, the white blade and the black blade was entwined with each other....</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-gahk!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran's shoulder guard was sent flying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Who is this runt?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran was taken aback. &nbsp;He hadn't been able to see Azell's previous sword strike. By looking at the trajectory of the strike, their swords should have clashed against each other. &nbsp;However, Duran's sword strike hit empty air. &nbsp;In the next moment, it was as if time had skipped. &nbsp;The intermediate step was omitted, and Azell's sword was seeking out his neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he only relied on his reflex, his head would have been severed. &nbsp;However, he used a secret technique, which had been passed down to him from the Plain of Darkness. &nbsp;If his consciousness was messed with by an enemy, a defensive mechanism drilled into his body would activate to save his his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Basically, while Azell was participating in a high speed battle, he had attacked Duran's mind. &nbsp;Duran’s consciousness was altered. &nbsp;Duran had thought he had a perfect defense against such an attack, yet Azell's technique was too intricate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Che-che-che-cheng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sparks flew as the tide of the battle changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Azell had been on defense, his speed had been slower than Duran. &nbsp;However, his incredible Insight had allowed Azell to cut off the secret techniques of the Spirit Order being attempted to be used by Duran. &nbsp;Moreover, Azell was able to predict the destination of each sword strike, so he used the minimal amount of movement to deflect the sword strikes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Azell's movements were incrementally getting faster. &nbsp;In all facets of the battle, Azell was overtaking Duran, and he was slowly taking away Duran's options.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No, I was mistaken! This is……!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran soon realized he was under a misperception. &nbsp;Azell wasn't moving faster. &nbsp;Duran was moving slower.</span></p>
