 <p><span style>Chapter 65 - Those who Follow the Prophecy (4)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell deployed his magic. &nbsp;His three Rings of Life, which had gone through Dual Banding, vibrated, and an enormous amount of magic was emitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Woooooooo!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I'll hit him with everything I got from the beginning!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He put on a strong front, but Azell's instinct was warning him of danger. The Undead in front of his eyes was dangerous. A bizarre armor covered its entire body, and the sword was a powerful magical artifact. &nbsp;Moreover, the soul controlling these items were quite formidable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You will have to just watch this.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, another Undead's voice rang out from the dark. &nbsp;There were two more of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;This is a test given by the Guardian Shadow's Keeper of Prophecy.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this… Are you giving me an order?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen bared his teeth as he laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two Undead within the darkness looked to be a Magician, and an Undead Swordsman wearing similar armor to Zeta. &nbsp;The Undead Swordsman's face was covered with a dark mask. &nbsp;The helm had two horn that looked like the horns of the Dragon Demon race, and it looked fierce.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Don't think of it as an order. &nbsp;It would be great if you thought of it as a request from a fellow member from the same organization.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What if I don't agree to it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Then we will have no choice, but to block you.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Doesn't that sound more fun? &nbsp;I don't care if we are in the organization called Guardian's Shadow. &nbsp;I'm not tolerant enough to be ordered around by Undead bastards.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hoooooooo!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen unsheathed his dual swords, and he deployed his Dragon Demon magic. The air around him responded to his intent, and the sound was loud and resonant. &nbsp;The Undead magician, who saw this, spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Jeez. &nbsp;You did say it would turn out like this. &nbsp;How did you know?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Well, when I was alive, these kinds of things happened quite often. &nbsp;This is the temperament of a &nbsp;swordsman.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Undead Swordsman spoke with laughter in his voice. It sounded as if wind was escaping through the holes in his Skull. &nbsp;It seemed the Undead tried to laugh like he used to when he was alive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Undead Swordsman spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I heard he is a living legend of this era. &nbsp;Shall I see how talented he is? &nbsp;I was always curious as to the skills of kids these days.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kids these days? &nbsp;Are you old enough to speak so insolently in front of me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Of course.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you are old enough to be senile. &nbsp;Why don't you leave behind your disgusting obsession and return to your grave!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen ran in like a ray of light, and he clashed with the Undead Swordsman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwahhhhhhng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Light exploded and the earth shook.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What's the identity of this bastard?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>His first strike was a surprise attack where he put his full power into the strike. If it was a human, any defense would have been meaningless. &nbsp;It would have evaporated in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, his opponent didn't move an inch, and it blocked his attack. It stood atop the shaking earth, and it let out an overwhelming amount of magic. &nbsp;Kairen had exterminated a lot of Undead before, but the amount of magic emitted by this one was on a different level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is almost on par with me in terms of magic.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amongst the Dragon Demon race in Rulain Kingdom, Kairen was the strongest. &nbsp;Surprisingly, the Undead Swordsman in front of his eyes was emitting Dragon Demon Magic that was on par with Kairen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Undead Swordsman spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Don't interfere, Theta.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You are making this more difficult than it has to be, Delta.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I need to amuse myself sometimes like this. &nbsp;Since you are a pacifist, just watch us.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;You are incorrigible. &nbsp;If it looks like you are losing, I'll help you.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;How can I lose to a pup?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;How many years do you really think separates you from him? Moreover, you have retired from life. &nbsp;I don't think you'll be much better than this lively soldier.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Why do all magicians have twisted personalities? They all speak so abominably. Anyways, you should quietly watch us.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of wind flowing out came from inside the Undead Swordsman's mask. The Undead Swordsman named Delta probably had the habit of snorting. &nbsp;It sounded like it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It's my turn, pup.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I haven't heard someone call me that in such a long time that it doesn't seem like you are alluding to me, old man bones.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Then allow me to develop your character, legendary pup!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Delta stomped on the ground as he dashed forward. Then the sword covered in darkness clashed with Kairen's dual swords.</span></p>
 <p><span style>6</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, the sounds of explosion rang out in the surrounding, and the air was getting much hotter. &nbsp;Azell and Zeta glared at each other as they circled around each other. &nbsp;However, it wasn't as if they were standing around doing nothing. &nbsp;At that moment, a fierce battle was occurring in a domain that couldn't be seen by the eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This bastard is only an Undead, but he is quite extraordinary.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell felt a sense of confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, they were controlling their mental waves, and they were engaged in a high speed battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They emphasized certain parts of their body to attract the gaze of each other, and both of them tried to hide their attack stance. However, their sense of distance became messed up as they kept following the movement of each other's stances. &nbsp;Both of them shifted their balance, and they kept changing the rhythm of their breathing. &nbsp;They were trying to mess up each other's timing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This wasn't being done only by what one could see and hear. &nbsp;They used magical energy to directly limit the opponent's senses. &nbsp;Zeta was already dead, so he didn't have the senses that would be present in a living being. &nbsp;This was why Zeta used a very sophisticated technique to face Azell. &nbsp;His skills were not inferior to high level Spirit Order practitioners.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It's probably tough for a dead bastard to do this.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A Magician loses a lot of capability when one becomes an Undead. However, a Spirit Order Practitioner had more to lose as an Undead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At first, one would think an Undead would have no problem as a Spirit Order practitioner, since the technique dealt with the mind. &nbsp;However, Spirit Order practitioners controlled their mind with the Rings of Life as their anchor. This could only happen with a living body. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>When one became an Undead, one lost all the standard techniques one cultivated previously. Everything had to be relearned as one had to match the standards of an Undead. &nbsp;How could such a thing be easy?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Che-ehng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At some point, Azell and Zeta determined each other's timing was off, so they charged. &nbsp;However, the two only reaffirmed that they were both wrong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It seems our suspicion has some merit. You know about the secret arts that had been made to forget by Them.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So the Dragon Demon worshippers were really &nbsp;behind the Spirit Order Practioners of this era being so deficient in handling their mind?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;This era?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zeta reacted in a sensitive manner. &nbsp;Azell knew he made a mistake, but he didn't let that show outwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean by the prophesied being? Why does an Undead want to fight me without giving any explanation? &nbsp;I can't see &nbsp;you as a someone good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I don't care if you see us as good or bad. &nbsp;We just…….&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zeta charged as if he was skipping across space. As a living human, it was hard to predict its movements. &nbsp;The Undead didn't breathe, and one couldn't read the Undead's muscle, since it wasn't there. There were much less clues one could use to predict its movement compared to a human.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwah-chahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sparks flew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It appeared behind Azell, not in the front. &nbsp;It used an illusion to appear as it was jumping from the front, but it had curved the trajectory of the Instantaneous Movement to slide around to the back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;…you are surprising. How are you able to predict an Undead's Spirit Order moves?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zeta rubbed at the chest region of his armor. Azell's sword had left a scratch on its surface. &nbsp;Azell had seen through Zeta's movement, and he had counter-attacked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This isn't something special. You made your Qi too obvious in the early stages. &nbsp;Anyways, that armor is very sturdy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had struck with the intention of slicing through the entire armor. &nbsp;However, the armor was so hard that he could only scratch it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It seems it'll be quite difficult for me to harm him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>His opponent was on a whole different level as the Undead Dragon Demon King worshiper named Jackal, who he had faced before. &nbsp;The armor itself was a powerful magical artifact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell felt unease wash over him. &nbsp;Cold sweat was running down Azell's back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;All right. &nbsp;Shall I bring out a little bit more of what I'm hiding? &nbsp;I'm warning you. &nbsp;I won't be as slow as before.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zeta ran forward. &nbsp;It wasn't Instantaneous movement, but the attack was so fast that it looked as if Zeta had jumped across space.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cheng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Light and darkness intersected. Azell's eyes had narrowed from surprise, yet the exchange continued before he could blink his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Che che che che cheng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The arc of light and the arc of darkness clashed with each other in a dizzying manner. &nbsp;Azell's expression crumpled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Shit! Why is this bastard so fast?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zeta's speed kept increasing. Azell was keeping up with his speed, so Zeta kept increasing his speed as if it was telling Azell to keep up with it. The speed increased more and more as if there was no limit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pee-peet!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shoulder region of Azell's leather armor was sliced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peet!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood flew from Azell's arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Fuck!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was too fast for Azell to keep up. &nbsp;He purposefully opened up a weak point, so he could try to counter attack. &nbsp;However, it was useless since Zeta was too fast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His eyes followed its movement. &nbsp;Azell had accelerated his senses to the extreme, and he was able to process all the information he was taking in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, his body couldn't keep up. &nbsp;He used the least amount of movement to block, and he used Zeta's previous movements to predict the next moves. &nbsp;He was defending against &nbsp;it, yet there was a limit to what he could do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zeta was so overwhelmingly fast and strong that he couldn't cover up his deficiencies with his techniques!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kah-kahk!</span></p>
 <p><span style>His balance was broken. &nbsp;Azell had been stepping to the side in a circle to resist the onslaught, but he had just taken a step backwards. &nbsp;Then he kept being pushed back as the dam had been broken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;No matter how much skills you have, you are a ultimately a human. &nbsp;I wonder how long you can keep up with me now that you aren't regulating your breathing.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Undead didn't need to breathe. &nbsp;While they still had magical energy, the Undead could attack endlessly without rest. &nbsp;It didn't breathe, so it didn't have the weakness of slowing down from muscle fatigue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Also, a high level Undead like Zeta had the cursed power of being able to steal energy from whatever its power of darkness touched. &nbsp;Azell was consuming his magical energy to defend against this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn't use his mind to create an opening. Zeta was way behind in terms of techniques dealing with the Mind, but Zeta was good enough. &nbsp;The difference in magical energy was used to overwhelm Azell. &nbsp;Moreover, the physical fight was so intense that he didn't have the time to use any advanced mental attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah pah pah pah pah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if Zeta was far from done, he kept increasing his speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zeta's strength was several times more stronger than Azell. &nbsp;Zeta's speed was several times faster than Azell. &nbsp;Moreover, Zeta's magical reservoir was so vast that it couldn't' be compared to Azell's magical energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was too big of a difference between Zeta's full strength and Azell's full strength. &nbsp;The fact that Azell hadn't been crushed in an instant was the evidence showing Azell was much superior in terms of techniques.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Azell's Clone appeared. &nbsp;Zeta didn't pay any attention to it. &nbsp;Since he already homed in on Azell's true body, any act of trying to distract him was a waste of magical energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Zeta had been too arrogant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Too-hahk!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What?!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell suddenly appeared from his side, and Zeta was hit with a single strike. &nbsp;Zeta, who had been charging like a hurricane, was sent flying sideways.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then…….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ggwah-roo-roong! Gwah-gwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell used this opportunity to to strike Zeta as he generated thunder with his sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huhk, huhk, huh-uhk……!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell mindlessly took in his breaths. &nbsp;Since he had moved without regulating his breathing, he had almost reached his limit. &nbsp;His heart was pounding uncontrollably, and he felt dizzy in his head.</span></p>
