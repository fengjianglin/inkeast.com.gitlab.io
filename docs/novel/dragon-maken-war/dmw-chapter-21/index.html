  <p><span style><span style>Chapter 21 - Dragon Slayer’s Ritual (6)</span></span></p>
  <p></p>
  <hr>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>Unlike their worries, the ruin didn’t have any systems that’ll threaten the lives of the intruders. However, the items that was stored inside and the relics that was acknowledged to have value by the Archmage Carlos was destroyed when they approached it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The black magician spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I have no idea what the purpose of this ruin is. The relics are ruined just from a touch by an outsider….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Normal ruins were a space where one stores valuable relics. Therefore, there were strong defensive systems placed to protect the relics. It was rare to see an extreme method like this where the relics were destroyed before it could be taken by the intruders.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Still, this ruin was weird. There weren’t any strong defensive systems yet it would make the relics inoperable if a intruder got close.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“This is the only place left….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kirion and the black magician arrived at the cetral portion of the ruin.</span></p>
  <p><span style>While they were coming here, they could only watch as seven relics were wasted.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Then at the central room… There was a blue and white light coming from something like a crystal.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kirion mumbled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What is this? Is it a spirit? Or is it an energy source?</span></p>
  <p><span style>The structure was made from light, and the object didn’t feel like it was real. It was assumed to be a spirit integrated with a strong power or an energy source..</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, the black magician disagreed with him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No, it is a closed space.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Closed space?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“A very dense closed space is surrounding something. However….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The black magician used his magic to make contact with it. It was at that moment.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oong…..! (TLN: think light saber noise)</span></p>
  <p><span style>Suddenly, the light structure started to vibrate violently, and it started to open. Kirion and the black magician retreated in surprise.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I have no idea. However, be ready for an impact.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The black magician’s expression was pensive, and he deployed his barrier. The magical force emitted by the light structure was immense. If its purpose was to cause destruction through an explosion, then it would easily blow this ruin in a flash.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, none of what they feared came to fruition. The violently vibrating light structure suddenly disappeared as if it had flickered out.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kirion dumbly muttered to himself.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What was that?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I believe….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The black magician continued to speak as he stroked his chin.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It must have flown somewhere by leaping through space.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>9</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta dumbly mumbled to herself.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Dragon Slayer’s Ritual? What is that?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell was resolutely staring at the Earth Dragon, but his spirits fell at her words. He looked at Arrieta as if he was amazed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You don’t know about the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It’s the first time I’ve heard of it.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…what has happened to this time period?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell mumbled in low spirits.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Dragon Slayer’s Ritual.</span></p>
  <p><span style>According to legends, the dragons made a pact with the humans and this was the ritual that had been passed down.</span></p>
  <p><span style>If a human had wisdom that the dragons coveted then the dragons would accept the Dragon Slayer’s ritual. The dragons rarely refused the ritual. The reason being the ritual was a method used by the dragons to acquire something they really wanted, which was wisdom.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The ritual was a one-on-one mortal combat. The dragon and the one who challenged the dragon fight one-on-one. This was different from a dragon just eating a human. By being victorious in the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual, the dragon could absorb part of the challenger’s wisdom as its own.</span></p>
  <p><span style>If the challenger wins and slays the dragon, then the challenger drinks the dragon’s blood to gain part of its power. The human and dragon put there life on the line, and it was a battle fought to gain either wisdom or strength. This was the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Arrieta was taken aback when she heard the description.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“This is the first time I’ve heard of this.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…I really don’t now what has happened during all this time.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell felt frustrated as he mumbled to himself then he glared at the Earth Dragon.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After a moment, the Earth Dragon nodded its head. It gestured to accepted the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ok.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell raised his sword, and pointed it at Regina.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You said you were Regina? I’ll warn you since you might not know anything about the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual. There is a condition one must adhere to. It is the fact that this is a one-on-one battle.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>During the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual between Azell and the Earth Dragon, no one is allowed to intervene. The one who interferes will receive the dragon’s wrath.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was the first time Regina had heard about this fact, so she was taken aback.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell turned back toward Arrieta and spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Please take care of Rick and Ms Enora.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You really are thinking about challenging the dragon alone?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m not thinking about it. I’ve already done so. The Dragon Slayer’s Ritual started once the dragon agreed to it. I cannot back out of it now. Therfore… Please leave.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell smiled, while looking at Arrieta. He looked at her golden eyes, which was filled with embarrassment, and it reminded him of old days.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes. Do I need a reason for putting my life on the line for others?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>It had always been that way. He had taken up a sword and put his life on the line, just so he could save someone’s life even if he didn’t know the person that well.</span></p>
  <p><span style>If he was a loner then he would have a hard time doing this. He would have given her to the enemy, and he would have escaped by himself in the end. Even though he complained, he had decided to stick by her side. This moment had already been heralded.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Princess’ responsibility is to take care of the aftermath. If we survive this then we’ll meet again.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Wait…..!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell ignored her words, and he ran towards the Earth Dragon. Finally the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual had started.</span></p>
  <p><span style>A large wall of earth sprang up in front of Azell, who was using the Instantaneous Movement method to move. Azell immediately changed direction, and he escaped to the side. This was the direction where Regina and her companion were located at. At that moment, the two here taken aback when Azell appeared in front of them.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Earth Dragon howled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Koo-ah-ah-ah-ah!</span></p>
  <p><span style>The surface flipped in its entirety, and a wave of earth flew towards him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ve always like surfing!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell accelerated while saying this. Regina was shocked.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No!?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Surprising, Azell was running while riding the wave of earth that was surging forth. He ran toward the crest of the surging wave of earth, and he jumped over it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Afterwards, the wave of earth fell on them. The duo escaped from that place, while spitting out curses.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ha-ah!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell had created a situation he wanted and when he reached the crest of the earth wave, he used the Instantaneous Movement method to shoot towards the Earth Dragon.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Pa-chang! (TLN: sword sfx)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Earth Dragon quickly turned its neck, but it was impossible for the large body to dodge. Azell’s sword strike grazed by the Earth Dragon’s neck.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Kook….!” (TLN: a form of groan)</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell had pulled off a splendid attack, but his complexion wasn’t good. Azell complained.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Shit. Is it impossible to do this with my current strength?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The unscathed Earth Dragon looked back towards Azell. Azell’s sword strike left only a faint mark on its neck. Most forces wouldn’t even be able to wound it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The current Azell could use every method in his disposal, but he wouldn’t be able to wound the dragon. If you don’t have strength then you will get slaughtered no matter how outstanding your skill is.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell glared at the Earth Dargon with nervous eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He mumbled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The scale of the dragon was sturdier than steel. Moreover, the dragon possessed powerful magic, which protected its body.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“This should be enough right, Carlos? Give me the item you prepared.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘How did you know?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Suddenly, a foreign voice rang out inside Azell’s mind. It was Carlos’ voice he had heard inside his dream.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Is there anyone else who knows you better than me? Even if you aged and became bald, there was no way your personality would have changed for the better right?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I told you to not talk about that subject!’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Carlos’ remnant flew into a rage. Azell smirked.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“How would I not know if a remnant had disappeared or not from my energy pulse?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I guess your senses haven’t dulled even though you slept until I died.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Carlos’ remnant snorted.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell had indirectly spoke about Carlos’ story to Arrieta. He had bid farewell to Carlos’ remnant inside his dream, but he had already realized that the remnant hadn’t disappeared, and it still remained. The remnant had inherited the personality of the Carlos that Azell had known. Until now, the remnant had examined the details of the events as time passed by and he was looking for the golden opportunity where he could take the maximum amount of credit. (TLN: basically he wants to save the day)</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Koo-roo-roo?” (TLN: dragon growl)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Earth Dragon tilted its head in front of him. It acted strangely as if it could hear the conversation happening inside Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m in a crisis where the current me can’t do anything here. Stop being so cantankerous and help me.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It can’t be helped.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The remnant of Carlos sighed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘So this will be my real farewell. I wanted to watch a little bit more, but it isn’t going as I want it. I don’t get why my fate is so turbulent.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You are right. It was nice seeing you. Really.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘You are saying some embarrassing things. Don’t die.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Carlos’ remnant snorted. The existence that was residing in Azell’s energy pulse extinguished completely. Then the magic trump card that was preserved for 200 years activated.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh! (TLN: energy sfx)</span></p>
  <p><span style>Blinding light started emanating from Azell and the earth shook. The sudden phenomena made the Earth Dragon flinch and it retreated.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Then… A flash of light stabbed down from the sky.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kwa-gwa-gwang! (TLN: thunder sfx)</span></p>
  <p><span style>Thunderous sound rang out and the earth shook. From inside the light, a sword emnating a blue luster was revealed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I guess this is the arrangement you had made.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>From inside the light that was swirling around him, Azell put his hand forward and grasped the sword.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I couldn’t have guessed you would preserve my Dragon Maken for 220 years… You really deserve to be called an arch-mage. Truly, I would have never imagined this.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Dragon Maken.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was the weapon Azell had used to fight against the Dragon Demon King Atein. There was only one like it in this world, and only the owner Azell could used the sword.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The sword was directly shaped by Azell and it was his alter ego. The sword used Azell’s</span></p>
  <p><span style>thoughts and magical energy as nutrients to exist so he hadn’t expect it be preserved for 220 years.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh! (TLN: wind sfx)</span></p>
  <p><span style>The light dispersed, and a gust of wind started to rage. Beneath the fluttering red hair, Azell’s blue eyes shined more strongly than ever.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell appeared while grasping a sword leaking a blue luster. The magical force from the Dragon Maken flowed in and it filled his magical pulse to the brim. His ring of life started vibrating crazily.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Unfortunately, this is only a momentary miracle…..”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell’s blue eyes was full of luster and he looked at the Earth Dragon.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ll show you the strength of a human, who had defeated the Dragon Demon King.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Then the blue storm started to rage.</span></p>

 <p><span style>While they were coming here, they could only watch as seven relics were wasted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then at the central room… There was a blue and white light coming from something like a crystal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kirion mumbled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this? Is it a spirit? Or is it an energy source?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The structure was made from light, and the object didn’t feel like it was real. It was assumed to be a spirit integrated with a strong power or an energy source..</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the black magician disagreed with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, it is a closed space.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Closed space?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A very dense closed space is surrounding something. However….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black magician used his magic to make contact with it. It was at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oong…..! (TLN: think light saber noise)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, the light structure started to vibrate violently, and it started to open. Kirion and the black magician retreated in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have no idea. However, be ready for an impact.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black magician’s expression was pensive, and he deployed his barrier. The magical force emitted by the light structure was immense. If its purpose was to cause destruction through an explosion, then it would easily blow this ruin in a flash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, none of what they feared came to fruition. The violently vibrating light structure suddenly disappeared as if it had flickered out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kirion dumbly muttered to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What was that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black magician continued to speak as he stroked his chin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It must have flown somewhere by leaping through space.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>9</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta dumbly mumbled to herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dragon Slayer’s Ritual? What is that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was resolutely staring at the Earth Dragon, but his spirits fell at her words. He looked at Arrieta as if he was amazed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t know about the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s the first time I’ve heard of it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…what has happened to this time period?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell mumbled in low spirits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dragon Slayer’s Ritual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to legends, the dragons made a pact with the humans and this was the ritual that had been passed down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If a human had wisdom that the dragons coveted then the dragons would accept the Dragon Slayer’s ritual. The dragons rarely refused the ritual. The reason being the ritual was a method used by the dragons to acquire something they really wanted, which was wisdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ritual was a one-on-one mortal combat. The dragon and the one who challenged the dragon fight one-on-one. This was different from a dragon just eating a human. By being victorious in the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual, the dragon could absorb part of the challenger’s wisdom as its own.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the challenger wins and slays the dragon, then the challenger drinks the dragon’s blood to gain part of its power. The human and dragon put there life on the line, and it was a battle fought to gain either wisdom or strength. This was the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrieta was taken aback when she heard the description.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the first time I’ve heard of this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…I really don’t now what has happened during all this time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell felt frustrated as he mumbled to himself then he glared at the Earth Dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a moment, the Earth Dragon nodded its head. It gestured to accepted the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell raised his sword, and pointed it at Regina.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You said you were Regina? I’ll warn you since you might not know anything about the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual. There is a condition one must adhere to. It is the fact that this is a one-on-one battle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual between Azell and the Earth Dragon, no one is allowed to intervene. The one who interferes will receive the dragon’s wrath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the first time Regina had heard about this fact, so she was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell turned back toward Arrieta and spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please take care of Rick and Ms Enora.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really are thinking about challenging the dragon alone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not thinking about it. I’ve already done so. The Dragon Slayer’s Ritual started once the dragon agreed to it. I cannot back out of it now. Therfore… Please leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell smiled, while looking at Arrieta. He looked at her golden eyes, which was filled with embarrassment, and it reminded him of old days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. Do I need a reason for putting my life on the line for others?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had always been that way. He had taken up a sword and put his life on the line, just so he could save someone’s life even if he didn’t know the person that well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he was a loner then he would have a hard time doing this. He would have given her to the enemy, and he would have escaped by himself in the end. Even though he complained, he had decided to stick by her side. This moment had already been heralded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Princess’ responsibility is to take care of the aftermath. If we survive this then we’ll meet again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait…..!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell ignored her words, and he ran towards the Earth Dragon. Finally the Dragon Slayer’s Ritual had started.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A large wall of earth sprang up in front of Azell, who was using the Instantaneous Movement method to move. Azell immediately changed direction, and he escaped to the side. This was the direction where Regina and her companion were located at. At that moment, the two here taken aback when Azell appeared in front of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Earth Dragon howled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Koo-ah-ah-ah-ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surface flipped in its entirety, and a wave of earth flew towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve always like surfing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell accelerated while saying this. Regina was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Surprising, Azell was running while riding the wave of earth that was surging forth. He ran toward the crest of the surging wave of earth, and he jumped over it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afterwards, the wave of earth fell on them. The duo escaped from that place, while spitting out curses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha-ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had created a situation he wanted and when he reached the crest of the earth wave, he used the Instantaneous Movement method to shoot towards the Earth Dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pa-chang! (TLN: sword sfx)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Earth Dragon quickly turned its neck, but it was impossible for the large body to dodge. Azell’s sword strike grazed by the Earth Dragon’s neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kook….!” (TLN: a form of groan)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had pulled off a splendid attack, but his complexion wasn’t good. Azell complained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit. Is it impossible to do this with my current strength?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The unscathed Earth Dragon looked back towards Azell. Azell’s sword strike left only a faint mark on its neck. Most forces wouldn’t even be able to wound it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The current Azell could use every method in his disposal, but he wouldn’t be able to wound the dragon. If you don’t have strength then you will get slaughtered no matter how outstanding your skill is.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell glared at the Earth Dargon with nervous eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He mumbled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scale of the dragon was sturdier than steel. Moreover, the dragon possessed powerful magic, which protected its body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This should be enough right, Carlos? Give me the item you prepared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How did you know?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, a foreign voice rang out inside Azell’s mind. It was Carlos’ voice he had heard inside his dream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there anyone else who knows you better than me? Even if you aged and became bald, there was no way your personality would have changed for the better right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I told you to not talk about that subject!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos’ remnant flew into a rage. Azell smirked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How would I not know if a remnant had disappeared or not from my energy pulse?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I guess your senses haven’t dulled even though you slept until I died.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos’ remnant snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had indirectly spoke about Carlos’ story to Arrieta. He had bid farewell to Carlos’ remnant inside his dream, but he had already realized that the remnant hadn’t disappeared, and it still remained. The remnant had inherited the personality of the Carlos that Azell had known. Until now, the remnant had examined the details of the events as time passed by and he was looking for the golden opportunity where he could take the maximum amount of credit. (TLN: basically he wants to save the day)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-roo-roo?” (TLN: dragon growl)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Earth Dragon tilted its head in front of him. It acted strangely as if it could hear the conversation happening inside Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m in a crisis where the current me can’t do anything here. Stop being so cantankerous and help me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It can’t be helped.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The remnant of Carlos sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘So this will be my real farewell. I wanted to watch a little bit more, but it isn’t going as I want it. I don’t get why my fate is so turbulent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are right. It was nice seeing you. Really.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You are saying some embarrassing things. Don’t die.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos’ remnant snorted. The existence that was residing in Azell’s energy pulse extinguished completely. Then the magic trump card that was preserved for 200 years activated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh! (TLN: energy sfx)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blinding light started emanating from Azell and the earth shook. The sudden phenomena made the Earth Dragon flinch and it retreated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then… A flash of light stabbed down from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwa-gwa-gwang! (TLN: thunder sfx)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thunderous sound rang out and the earth shook. From inside the light, a sword emnating a blue luster was revealed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess this is the arrangement you had made.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From inside the light that was swirling around him, Azell put his hand forward and grasped the sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I couldn’t have guessed you would preserve my Dragon Maken for 220 years… You really deserve to be called an arch-mage. Truly, I would have never imagined this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dragon Maken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the weapon Azell had used to fight against the Dragon Demon King Atein. There was only one like it in this world, and only the owner Azell could used the sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sword was directly shaped by Azell and it was his alter ego. The sword used Azell’s</span></p>
 <p><span style>thoughts and magical energy as nutrients to exist so he hadn’t expect it be preserved for 220 years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh! (TLN: wind sfx)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The light dispersed, and a gust of wind started to rage. Beneath the fluttering red hair, Azell’s blue eyes shined more strongly than ever.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell appeared while grasping a sword leaking a blue luster. The magical force from the Dragon Maken flowed in and it filled his magical pulse to the brim. His ring of life started vibrating crazily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unfortunately, this is only a momentary miracle…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s blue eyes was full of luster and he looked at the Earth Dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll show you the strength of a human, who had defeated the Dragon Demon King.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then the blue storm started to rage.</span></p>
