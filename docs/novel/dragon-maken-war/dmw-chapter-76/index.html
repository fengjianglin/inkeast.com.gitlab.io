 <p><span style>Chapter 76 - Those who Covet the Blood of a Royal (2)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar spoke after he read the report.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We don't have much experience in fighting on mountainous terrain... This is going to be troublesome.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It will be. It seems we will be relying on the prince more so than usual.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm. I'll catch the orcs and the monsters. &nbsp;How come these orcs are so strong? Count Baldan invited knight Jilbaret. &nbsp;He is a swordsman that is quite well-known in the west. &nbsp;If this report is true, he was defeated without give the orcs much of a fight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These orcs are much stronger than the usual ones.... &nbsp;It isn't as if this is unprecedented.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you talking about Daken?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>About 30 years ago, there was an orc hero named Daken, who raised a great army of monsters called the Great Dark Alliance. &nbsp;This occurred at the Balan Forest where the the Western Border guards were stationed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This particular orc was much stronger than the regular orcs, and it was as smart as a human. &nbsp;It had charisma, and it was able to organize the monsters. At various times in the past, powerful mutated orcs had appeared, but Daken had been at a different level. &nbsp;Moreover, its power was so strong that many knights of that time had died by its hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pulmun spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmm. Have you perhaps seen Daken yourself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When the Western Border guards had been wiped out in the past, the throne had dispatched a punitive force, and I had been a part of that force.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of orc was it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was incredibly large. It was two heads taller than other orcs, and it wore a mishmash of thick armors. &nbsp;It swung an enormous sword, which was large as the one prince uses. &nbsp;Most people died before they could get close to the orc. &nbsp;The bastard was like a walking tornado.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Interesting. I never knew such an orc existed...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“An orc's body is fundamentally stronger than a human's body. &nbsp;Occasionally, an orc that is much stronger than other orcs is born. &nbsp;However, Daken was a being that had exceeded that classification. Anyways, we need to be cautious.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>4</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Seigar and his direct subordinates arrived at the County of Baldan, they received a fervent reception from the people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wahhhhhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seigar! Seigar! Seigar!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The noble Dragon Demon Prince's sword will light our way!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Count Baldan and the residents of his domain had been besieged by constant violence. &nbsp;In such a situation, the Dragon Demon Prince of the rising fame had come to save them. &nbsp;Men and women of all ages yelled out Seigar's name.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems the situation was much worse than we predicted.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They were barely able to harvest their crops for the winter, and their stores were plundered. &nbsp;Moreover, a town was burnt to the ground. &nbsp;The women and children were kidnapped....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pulmun clicked his tongue at Seigar's words. &nbsp;Pulmun had thought this was a minor problem with bandits. &nbsp;However, the County had taken such a large damage that their survivability was being threatened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar rested for the night, and he climbed up the mountain the next day. &nbsp;The Count scraped together more soldiers from his Domain, and they were sent with Seigar and his forces. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar mused when he saw the treacherous terrain of the mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Those bastards are hiding in such a treacherous location? &nbsp;How are they able to conduct their raid? &nbsp;Wouldn’t they have to traverse this terrain every time they want to reach the Count's domain?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A troop of over hundred wouldn't be able to fight on this terrain. &nbsp;He now understood why Count Baldan hadn’t been successful in his subjugation. &nbsp;However, it was almost unbelievable to think that the bandits would traverse this terrain every time they wanted to plunder a village.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maybe they have a secret route?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if there is such a route, it is unlikely that the residents wouldn't know about it…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess this means we won't know anything until we run across them? &nbsp;Since we don't know what might happen, please be vigilant of our surrounding. &nbsp;I'll scout ahead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? That is a bit...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Regular soldiers won't be able to do a proper reconnaissance. I'll be throwing sacrificial lambs to our enemies. &nbsp;Isn't that right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then shouldn't we send out the knights?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I trust in the competence of my knights, but this is the front yard of our enemies. &nbsp;Moreover, I learned how to deal with such situations from my teacher.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar had gone through a massive amount of training as he had been instructed by the Dragon Sword Duke Kairen Tarantos. On occasion, he was required to hunt wild animals and monsters on a frigid mountain during winter. &nbsp;These prior experiences would allow Seigar to make needed tactical decisions during the reconnaissance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would lead from the front if needed. &nbsp;He was conservative with how he used his men. &nbsp;He didn't want to send them into a place where there was a high possibility of them being slaughtered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I'll be going with you..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don't over do it. &nbsp;If you go alongside me, the command structure would be disturbed. &nbsp;I'll take young knights instead of your old bones.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I still can hold my own against the young ones.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, the young ones can't replace your experienced self. This is why I'm asking you to stay behind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Seigar joked around with Pulmun, he picked out three mercenaries he had elevated to knighthood. &nbsp;Two of the three were veterans of many skirmishes, and they moved as they were ordered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar was cognizant of his surrounding as he moved nimbly. &nbsp;The knights were astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The prince was trained in reconnaissance?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone knew Seigar's martial arts was exceptional. He had overwhelming martial power, yet he didn't discriminate others based on their station in life. &nbsp;He judged a person by their ability, and he always looked at others with a fair gaze. &nbsp;He was a young man, yet he boldly fought in the front lines. He put his life on the line with his men, and his actions brought out loyalty from others. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, it was surprising to see such an ability from a person of his station, and power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just a little bit. I wasn't trained as a scout, but I was trained to be a hunter. &nbsp;If you see me making rookie mistakes, please point it out to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems we should be the one learning from you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if you try to flatter me, I won't easily raise your annual salary.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They conversed in low whispers as they scouted their surrounding. &nbsp;Periodically, they used a communication magic tool to send back reports as the main force advanced. &nbsp;They advanced very carefully. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It happened at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are still young, yet you are very cautious.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He heard a voice that shouldn't be present in such a place. &nbsp;He heard a voice of a young woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar raised his head in surprise. A young woman was sitting atop a steep cliff. &nbsp;She kept her knees together as she looked down at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I'm in danger.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar's instinct was give a very strong warning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was almost surreal, since the young woman looked very out of place here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was she of similar age as Arrieta? &nbsp;She had blonde hair, and her eyes were the color of amethyst. &nbsp;Her skin was white as snow. &nbsp;She was a very beautiful young woman. She had on an expressionless face that didn't reveal any emotions. She had a doll-like beauty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her features didn’t suit the rough terrains of the mountain, but her clothes made the dissonance even more pronounced. &nbsp;She wore a black dress with red trims.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar asked her a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm a magician sent to retrieve you. &nbsp;The conditions needed for me to reveal my name hasn't been fulfilled.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are going to take me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm merely following orders.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wahhhhhhhh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, yells erupted from his rear. Seigar was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What's going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A report that sounded like a scream came through the magic communication tool.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Prince! The enemies suddenly appeared!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? That can't be!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>-They climbed up the ridge of the mountain, and we were ambushed without any warning! Koohk! I don't know how this could have happened!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir Pulmun! I'll immediately…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Chee-jeek! Chee-jee-jee-jeek!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The magical communication suddenly broke up. The young woman spoke to the alarmed Seigar. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wanted to observe good manners, so I allowed you to send a brief communication. ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There hadn't been any signs of the girl using magic. It wasn't just that she hadn’t recited any spells or performed any hand seals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I didn't feel any magical reverberation. &nbsp;How can this be?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar's magic detection ability was much more sensitive than others. However, he hadn't felt a single ounce of magic coming from the young woman. Yet she was able to easily terminate the communication magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young woman walked off the cliff as if she was walking on a flat surface. &nbsp;Moreover, a blue pillar of light appeared in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wooooooooooooooo!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, an oppressive magical wave was swept over him. Seigar was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No way! Her magical energy exceeds amount possessed by teacher?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the young woman... No, to be precise, the oppressive magical wave that made him want to scream was being formed in front of her. &nbsp;This was....</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Dragon Demon Magic!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn't magical energy. &nbsp;It was Dragon Demon magic! &nbsp;It was a tool that emitted Dragon Demon magic. &nbsp;Moreover, it was emitting an amount that far outstripped Kairen. &nbsp;It made his heart leap into his mouth. &nbsp;He had thought Kairen and his friends were the only ones able to create Dragon Weapons that possessed Dragon Demon Magic!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young woman mumbled to herself as if she was letting out a sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dragon Magic Device Vitan's Glass.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the light, the young woman pulled out a long staff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The staff looked as if it was carved out of ice. It was colorless, and the light distorted as it penetrated through the staff. &nbsp;There was something that looked like a large chalice attached at head of the staff. Some of the light that passed through the staff flowed upwards. &nbsp;It was a mysterious sight where it looked as if water was flowing upwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kooohk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a brief moment, Seigar gawked at it, but he came to his senses. &nbsp;His hand moved towards the enormous sword strapped to his back. The magically spelled sheathe pushed the sword out. &nbsp;Seigar grasped the sword, and he got into his stance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an unnatural sight. &nbsp;Seigar was a 15 year old young man, so his stature was small. &nbsp;He was only 160 cm tall. &nbsp;However, the weapon in his hand was a very large two handed sword, which didn't suit him. &nbsp;The entire length of the sword almost matched Seigar's height, and normal people wouldn't be able to lift this weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Seigar's physical prowess was much superior to a human, so he swung it easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I call the name of the Light! Become a Dragon that tears away the evil Darkness!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he shouted out his spell, Dragon Demon magic exploded forth from him. &nbsp;The powerful light exited from the tip of his sword, and it shot towards the young woman in an erratic path. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwah-kwah-kwah-kwahk-kwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cliff exploded, and the mountain shook. Seigar let out a shout.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys rejoin the main force! I'll…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seigar flinched from surprise in mid-sentence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three knights that had been by his side only a moment ago was nowhere to be seen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Am I in a dream right now?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did she deceive his senses as she got rid of the knights next to him? &nbsp;Was such a thing possible in reality? He wondered if she used a magic that deceived his mind. Her voice was heard in Seigar's ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How unfortunate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young woman was fine as she walked through the explosion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed she hadn't even paused in her walk. It was as if Seigar's attack wasn’t even a hindrance. &nbsp;She had stepped off the cliff, and now she landed on top of a level surface.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The blood of the Great One is flowing within you. &nbsp;However, you are denied power, because you lack knowledge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you talking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll give you an answer at a later time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She ignored the confused Seigar's question. &nbsp;She grabbed the hem of her skirt with one hand, and she elegantly gave a greeting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems the conditions required to tell you my name has been met. &nbsp;My name is Laura.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She spoke as she raised her strange staff called the 'Vitan's Glass'. &nbsp;It was letting out Dragon Demon magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am the inheritor of the great name of Aunsauras. I welcome you to the Vitan's Maze. &nbsp;Let us test if you are able to defeat me. &nbsp;You will have to find the exit before your power bottoms out.”</span></p>
