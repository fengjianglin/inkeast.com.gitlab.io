 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">1</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It happened when Reygus and Kayalia had left. &nbsp;They had declared their opposition towards Atein. &nbsp;Almarick searched out Atein, and he asked the question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why did you let them go?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if he possessed the highest authority within the Great Darkness, Atein couldn’t coerce Reygus and Kayalia to stay. &nbsp;However, wouldn’t it be possible for Atein to imprison them?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Atein gave his answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There are two reasons why I didn’t do it. &nbsp;There is a rational reason, and there is an emotional reason. &nbsp;Which one do you want to hear first?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll hear the rational reason first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If I hear the emotional reason first, I think I’ll get mad.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I see. &nbsp;I made a deal with Kayalia.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A deal?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kayalia is the first being that had transcended what I had designed. &nbsp;It might have something to do with her experience of living multiple reincarnated lives. &nbsp;I believe it created a new variable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she stood in front of Atein once again, he realized she possessed transcendent power. &nbsp;Her current power couldn’t be compared to her past self. &nbsp;The core of Atein’s plan revolved around the Great Darkness, and from his perspective, she was someone that deserved to be feared. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since she is dependent to the Great Darkness, I might be able to subdue her. &nbsp;The probability of success is high, since I possess a higher authority than her. &nbsp;However, she is an existence that has become one with the Great Darkness. &nbsp;My body is alive, and I am merely connected to the Great Darkness. &nbsp;In the process of fighting her, she might cause massive damage to the Great Darkness. &nbsp;She could do this if she wanted to be reckless.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Atein didn’t want to take such a risk. &nbsp;This was why he had made a deal with Kayalia.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He would let Reygus and Kayalia go. &nbsp;He would give them the chance to fight him as free willed individuals. &nbsp;In exchange, Kayalia would place restrictions on her authority within the Great Darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It was a deal that was acceptable to both parties.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kayalia also didn’t want to resolve the fight at that moment. &nbsp;There was a chance that she might perish without being able to cause any harm to Atein.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why the two of them had made a deal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Almarick accepted that answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I see. &nbsp;What about your emotional reason?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This fight might be the last fight between me and humanity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Atein spoke as he looked into the empty air. &nbsp;There was a far away look in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As long as Almarick could remember, Atein had been like this. &nbsp;Atein fought the current reality in front of him, yet his gaze was always far away. &nbsp;He was always looking at places that others couldn’t see.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if he won this fight, Atein’s fight wouldn’t end. &nbsp;This was merely the first button being buttoned up in Atein’s plan. &nbsp;If he wanted humanity to last forever, there were countless problems he had to fix. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, when one was putting an enormous plan into action, there was nothing more important than the first step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is why I want to see all the possibilities. &nbsp;I want to do it before the fight against humanity ends. &nbsp;I want to see all of it before I make the irrevocable choice….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was basically trying to place a fence around humanity in order to keep them safe. &nbsp;He wouldn’t completely take away their free will, but he would take away their choice to choose evil. &nbsp;He would stop them from self destruction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Reygus’ revolt…. &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;If I’m to be honest, I expected it. &nbsp;That’s the type of man he is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Atein truly felt regret. &nbsp;He knew Reygus’ personality, yet he had chosen to hide the decision he would make in the future. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This also didn’t mean that he had tried to hide the truth in order to delay making a decision. &nbsp;Atein had conducted an experiment with the Plain of Darkness, and his hopes had been high. &nbsp;He knew in the corner of his heart that it was hopeless, yet he desperately wished the Plain of Darkness would give him hope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the result was what it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Reshoo realized that no system created by humans could prevent tragedies. &nbsp;He despaired at this truth, and he agreed to join my cause.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reshoo had told Azell about this in the past. &nbsp;The world made by humans lifted up those that were evil and greedy. &nbsp;They were punitive towards people that were good and selfless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If a person with evil intentions harmed a good person, there should be a punishment. &nbsp;However, this common principle wasn’t often followed. &nbsp;Even if the principle was kept, it wasn’t as if the one that had lost one’s life would come back to life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A fundamental solution was needed. &nbsp;It would be an ironclad rule with no loopholes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reshoo had experience countless tragedies, and he had come to a decision when Baion met his death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Almarick, this might be abrupt, but I want to hear your answer to this question. &nbsp;Why do you continue to follow me to the end?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Atein hadn’t decided to revive the four Dragon Demon generals, because he had absolute trust in them. &nbsp;He had done it out of respect for the four of them, who had lived through the same era as him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if all four of them turned against him after being revived, Atein wouldn’t have regretted his decision. &nbsp;This was why Atein felt thankful towards Almarick, who had decided to remain next to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Almarick spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As you probably know, my aim in life in different from Reygus. &nbsp;As I’ve told you before, I believe true order is needed if the world is to find peace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long ago, Almarick had been a king of a region, and he had lost to Atein.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the same for Reygus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them ruled their lands differently. &nbsp;They were polar opposites.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only thing common was the fact that they had ruled through the absolute charisma they possessed. &nbsp;In the eyes of the normal people, they were gods walking amongst men.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reygus’ country was lawless, and everyone lived a freewheeling life. &nbsp;If a tribe was living like that, it might have been understandable. &nbsp;However, he was in charge of a small nation. &nbsp;It was almost unbelievable that Reygus had been able to maintain his society. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Almarick had been strict in enforcing his law and order. &nbsp;There was clear ranks in his society, and a person was punished if they acted out beyond what their station allowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was obvious as to why Reygus and Almarick had been on bad terms before they served under Atein. &nbsp;Numerous fights had occurred between the two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, no rule I can think up can bring perfect order. &nbsp;Even nature is unpredictable. &nbsp;That is why my choice might have been inevitable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Almarick looked like a fierce beast. &nbsp;At &nbsp;a glance, he didn’t look like someone who followed societal norms. &nbsp;That wasn’t true.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For example, one just had to watch wild beasts form a pack. &nbsp;There was a clear hierarchy and order within the pack. &nbsp;The peace of the pack was only disrupted only when the leader of the pack starts to lose its authority. &nbsp;It brought confusion within the pack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I cannot live by myself. I built my own pack, and I put in place a clear hierarchy. &nbsp;However, &nbsp; &nbsp;neither the humans and the Dragon Demons could escape their base nature.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Almarick had lived for over a thousand years. &nbsp;He believed that humans weren’t that different from beasts when it came down to it. &nbsp;They possessed more intelligence than beasts, but he also observed humans show more ugliness than good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That is why I want to see it once. &nbsp;I want to see true and eternal peace. &nbsp;I want to see the absolute order.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are with me, because you want to see that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I am green compared to you. &nbsp;Still, I’ve lived for a long time. &nbsp;No matter how hard I worked at it, I was unable to achieve my ideals. &nbsp;I have a chance to do so right now, and I believe it is a cause worth risking my life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you plan on doing after that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Atein sounded amused as he asked the next question. &nbsp;Almarick was speechless for a brief moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He never thought about what he would do after he achieved his ideal world. &nbsp;If Almarick could achieve his ideals, it would be akin to an end to an epic story.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not sure. &nbsp;If your majesty’s is able to create the ideal world, wouldn’t a swordsman like me be useless? &nbsp;It might be really late, but maybe I’ll study magic.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, you will still be an important asset to me. &nbsp;Even if our fight against humanity ends, there are countless problems we still have to solve. &nbsp;We’ll have to fight.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Atein smiled. &nbsp;Almarick looked at him for a brief moment before he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If I really don’t like the ideal world, I can go against you. &nbsp;I’ll become your majesty’s enemy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“At that point, it’ll be a meaningless fight. &nbsp;You won't be able to win.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Almarick didn’t hesitate as he gave his answer. &nbsp;Atein nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I see. &nbsp;I have one request, Almarick.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please survive until the end. &nbsp;I want you to see me make the ideal world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time Almarick didn’t answer immediately. &nbsp;He thought over it for a brief moment, then he spoke. &nbsp;Laughter was infused within his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If my fate allows it, I’ll willingly do so.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><br></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><br></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">2</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Koo-goo-goong, koo-roo-roo-roong……!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could hear consecutive explosions outside.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Almarick had been deep within his thoughts. &nbsp;He immediately broke out of his thoughts when he felt the ground shake. &nbsp;He mumbled to himself as he looked at the seal that was layered with magic circles. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We were made a complete fool.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The news about the other seal was delivered through the Great Darkness. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the perspective of Azell’s party, they were probably jumping in joy. &nbsp;Things were turning out exactly as they had planned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A member of Reygus’ party had the ability to use the Extreme Extinction. &nbsp;The Dragon Demon King worshippers were taken unawares. &nbsp;Reshoo was supposed to be guarding this site. &nbsp;However, Reshoo had headed towards the other seal, so it was the worst case scenario for Almarick. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Reshoo left, both sites were attacked simultaneously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The nearby waypoints had already been destroyed. &nbsp;The waypoints that were moderately close were being attacked by the members of the Guardian Shadows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Azell’s party appeared at the location of the seal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Azell, Laura, Kairen, Leticia, Arrieta and Kayalia were participating in this battle. &nbsp;It wasn’t just them. &nbsp;The strongest members of the Guardian Shadows were there too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dragon Demon Prince Seigar, Achmage Beorein Michael and his disciples were present. &nbsp;Moreover, the White Sword Count Rakadi, who was considered to be as dangerous as Kairen, was here alongside his family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On top of that, over 2,000 Guardian Shadows were present. &nbsp;Basically, they were planning on settling the fight here. &nbsp;It was an all out assault.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Almarick realized that he had been their target all along.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘It wouldn’t have mattered Reshoo hadn’t moved from this place. &nbsp;Even if he comes to my rescue, they made it sure that I’ll be dead. &nbsp;That is their goal.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The problem right now was the fact that Azell’s party had seized the initiative. &nbsp;The pillars of the Great Darkness couldn’t be moved even by Atein.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kayalia’s betrayal meant that Azell’s party had gained information that Atein had wanted hidden. &nbsp;Moreover, Azell’s party hadn’t even given Atein’s side the opportunity to respond. &nbsp;They had put everything on the line in order to win this battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘They are my enemies, yet they made an excellent and decisive decision. &nbsp;Hue hue. &nbsp;It has been a long time since I’ve been pushed to the edge of the cliff.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wasn’t the first time he had experienced this. &nbsp;In the Dragon Demon war, he had been driven into a dead end, and he had been killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, if he looked back on his long life, he had faced many life threatening situation. &nbsp;He was able to spurn the allure of the grim reaper until he finally met his end in the Dragon Demon war.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is great.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Almarick let out a ferocious laughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His heart started to beat faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His escape route was blocked, so he would have to fight powerful enemies with his life on the line. &nbsp;His life had always been a series of fights. &nbsp;How could he not be excited for this fight?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On top of that, the foe waiting for him was Azell Karzark. &nbsp;Azell had been the culprit behind his first death. &nbsp;This was the best stage for this fight. &nbsp;He could wish for nothing more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How much time do we have left?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Almarick asked his underlings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ten magicians were sticking close to the seal, and they were desperately carrying out their task. &nbsp;Whether they could finish their repairs would determine the fate of Almarick</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“At the very latest, it’ll be done in 10 minutes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I guess I’ll have stay alive until then. &nbsp;I’m guessing you don’t need my Dragon Demon magic any more?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. &nbsp;I pray for your success.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The magician was resolute as he answered Almarick.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His underlings were dying outside, &nbsp;yet he had been stuck here. &nbsp;His Dragon Demon magic had been needed to continue the repairs. &nbsp;However, the step where the magicians needed his Dragon Demon magic was at an end. &nbsp;He had no reason for staying here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It would have been fun if Reygus had come here. &nbsp;On the other hand, Azell Karzark is a more extravagant meal compared to that dead bastard. &nbsp;I have no complaints.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Almarick mumbled to himself as he exited the building, which had been hastily constructed with magic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come Dragon Demon weapon…….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A frightening wave of Dragon Demon magic swept over the battlefield. &nbsp;Almarick appeared at the heart of the battlefield, and he raised his great sword. &nbsp;It was half translucent as if it was made out of glass, and blue lightning started to erupt from the sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Storm’s Scream.”</span></p>
