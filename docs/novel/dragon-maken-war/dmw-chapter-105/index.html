 <p>Chapter 105 - The One that Chose the Name Soaked in Sin (1)</p>
 <p><span style>1</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old Karzark castle lay in waste. As expected of a domain gifted to the man responsible for saving the world, Azell's castle had been well made. &nbsp;However, 200 years had passed, and the majesty and beauty of the castle was nowhere to be seen. &nbsp;It was merely a horrendously destroyed ruin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell watched the ruins, and he was swept up by emotions that were beyond expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell opened the main door to the castle. &nbsp;He entered into the lounge, and there were stairs on either sides leading up to the second floor. &nbsp;The stairs made a circle. &nbsp;One of the stairway was completely destroyed, and the other one was half destroyed. &nbsp;An old memory overlapped this sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Young masters! &nbsp;Young mistresses! &nbsp;The stairs are meant to be walked on!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The steward of Count Karzark was Bazeck. &nbsp;He was an old knight, who had participated in the Dragon Demon war. &nbsp;Moreover, he was a big softie when it came to the children. &nbsp;It was, because he had lost all his sons and grandchildren in the war.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had adopted children, and most of them were not of noble birth. &nbsp;This was why they were a bit short on grace and manners. &nbsp;They treated the fancy castle as a playground. &nbsp;The guardrails on the stairways were treated as slides. &nbsp;Children screamed as they slid down the guardrails, and it troubled Bazeck. &nbsp;However, he could bring himself to give them a strong scolding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Marquis! &nbsp;Please give a scolding to the young masters and young mistresses! &nbsp;How will they be able to make their debut in society?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Eh-eee. &nbsp;It's ok. &nbsp;All children act that way as they grow up. &nbsp;Should I try it once? &nbsp;In the past, I always wanted to try it when I visited a castle or a mansion.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If you want my old eyes to bleed tears of blood, you can go ahead and try it. &nbsp;Do you realize how much gossip goes around when the Count jumps out the window or climb the wall, because it is annoying to climb up and down the stairs!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They are probably jealous of me since they can't do what I do?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘…unfortunately, half of the opinions are on your side. &nbsp;However, how will it look to the other nobles!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How do you think it will look? &nbsp;It'll look cool.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Coooooooount!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>…he had exchanged countless conversations just like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he walked up the unstable stairway, he thought he could hear the sounds of children laughing as they slid down the rails. &nbsp;Azell felt tears welling up, but he pressed it down as he went up to the 2nd floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My god. &nbsp;He kept harping about how I have to invest in a good desk.... &nbsp;I can't believe it survived.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had entered his office on the 2nd floor. &nbsp;It was a mess inside. &nbsp;The ceiling and walls had fallen, and there were debris piled everywhere. &nbsp;The floor was also half destroyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, to his surprise, Azell's desk was still there. &nbsp;It had been exposed to rain and wind over a long period of time, so it was all rotten. &nbsp;However, he recognized the desk he used 220 years ago, so he marveled at it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Count! &nbsp;Please work inside your office!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have a hard time getting things done in there. &nbsp;It isn't as if I'm shirking my duties. &nbsp;I just want to work with a little wind on my face....’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You can't go up there with those documents!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell hated working in his office. &nbsp;It was a large room, so it often felt a bit chilly. &nbsp;There was a big window inside the room, and the desk had been put in front of it. &nbsp;He had a hard time concentrating in such a set-up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why Azell always took his documents up to the roof, and he worked as he heard the chirping of the birds. &nbsp;His subordinates developed headaches, because Azell's actions were far from being noble-like. &nbsp;However, in the end, they just accepted it as 'Our lord is just like that.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha ha ha…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dry laugh flowed out of Azell's mouth. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no section of the castle that had remained undamaged. &nbsp;It was understandable, since Dragons had swept through here. Still, he could still see a little bit of the outline of its original shape, and his old memories kept washing over him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he knew it, Azell's eyes were flowing with tears. &nbsp;He didn't have the presence of mind to wipe his tears, and he walked without any destination in mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His memories and the destroyed reality in front of him overlapped with each other, and he was swept up in his memories.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…teacher.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell arrived at a grave site behind the castle. &nbsp;There was no way the graves would have been left untouched by the rampaging Dragons. &nbsp;It was a mess back there. &nbsp;Still, Azell was able to locate a particular grave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I knew things would turn out like this, it might have been better not to have moved you here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Balf's grave. &nbsp;He was the teacher, who had taught Azell about Absolute Sense. &nbsp;After the Dragon Demon war ended, Azell had moved his remains to his castle. &nbsp;Two hundred twenty years had passed, and many more graves had been added to this site. &nbsp;It had evolved into a pretty big cemetery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Balf's tombstone was destroyed, and it had been scatter to the winds. &nbsp;Azell was only able to find the grave, because he was intimately familiar with where it was located at.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can't do anything right now, but I'll once again provide a nice grave for you. &nbsp;I promise.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell wiped his tears away, and he gave his respects towards his teacher's grave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>2</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura was completely subdued, and she was being watched by Kairen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her legs, arms and fingers were all bound meticulously. &nbsp;Moreover, a bit was put in her mouth, so she wouldn't be able to use any spells. &nbsp;Then Azell used a secret technique of Spirit Order to form a magical wedge. &nbsp;These magical wedges were placed in various locations of her Energy Pulse to block the flow of magical energy. &nbsp;There was no way Laura would be able to use her magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had wanted a look through the ruins of the old castle by himself, so he had left Kairen behind. &nbsp;It wasn't a good time to be doing such an activity, yet Azell's poor expression stopped Kairen from arguing with him. &nbsp;He just told Azell to do what he had to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell returned after an hour. &nbsp;Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You came back earlier than expected.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It feels like I've spent enough time there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your expression was too heartrending, so at the very least, I thought you were going to come back tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you were ready for such a scenario, maybe I should have taken my time in getting back here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell hadn't said anything before he made himself scarce. &nbsp;He had been gone for a pretty long time. He was thankful for Kairen being considerate of him, so Azell smirked in thanks. &nbsp;Then he asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How are they doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They are still recovering.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was referring to Yuren and Leticia.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had fought against the Dragon Demon king worshippers, so they weren't classified as enemies. &nbsp;However, both groups didn't trust each other. &nbsp;This was true for Azell and Kairen, and it was also true for Yuren and Leticia. &nbsp;This was why they decided to stay in different locations. &nbsp;They would wait until Leticia and Yuren were well enough to converse. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He didn't look like a healer... &nbsp;He is probably using Black Magic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Magic was the use of magic through taking the life of living beings. &nbsp;If they planned on using humans as a source for their magic, Azell and Kairen would have stopped them. &nbsp;However, the County of Karzark had a surplus of monsters and beasts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can we trust them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don't know. &nbsp;I'll have to talk to them first. &nbsp;Personally, I am a bit interested in the Miss Dragon Majin....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She seemed to be quite strong. &nbsp;However, the mark against her is the fact that she seems to have some dealings with Black Magic”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had only briefly aligned themselves with Leticia, but in that short amount of time, they could tell she was a very talented fighter. &nbsp;Moreover, she was a Dragon Majin, yet here magical resonance was on par with Kairen. &nbsp;However, she was also saturated with the energy of Black magic....</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell shook his head from side to side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, that's not the part that interests me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I only saw it briefly, so I can't be sure... &nbsp;The way she used her Dragon Arts looked familiar to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have to confirm it with her, then I'll have a better idea. &nbsp;She might have a connection with an acquaintance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“An acquaintance... Now I'm curious.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll explain it to you later. Anyways, we have to take care of the business in front of us.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell looked at Laura. &nbsp;Laura was bound tight, yet she waited patiently with an expressionless face. &nbsp;Azell took the bit out of her mouth, and she took a deep breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoo-ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We'll question you now. &nbsp;I hope your answer my questions honestly. &nbsp;My magical wedge is deployed, so if you lie, I'll know it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura's expression was so neutral that it would be hard to tell if she was lying. &nbsp;However, Spirit Order dealt with the mind. &nbsp;The magical wedges were placed in her Energy Pulse, and it allowed him to fully control her. &nbsp;It was easy to tell if she was telling the truth or not.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura nodded her head slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Azell could ask a question, Kairen suddenly spoke to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So, Azell...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Doesn't this make us look… &nbsp;Somehow, it feels like we are the bad guys.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…I get where you are coming from, and I agree. &nbsp;However, did you really have to say that out loud?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won't hesitate if it is a straight up fight. &nbsp;However, you are threatening to torture a young lady. &nbsp;This kind of situation is a first...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen scratched his cheek. &nbsp;From her outer appearance, Laura looked like a beautiful girl around 17 or 18 years old. She had long blonde hair, and amethyst eyes. &nbsp;She had lily-white skin, and she looked like a doll. &nbsp;Moreover, the red dress she was wearing made her look like a innocent young lady from a noble house.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell grumbled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is she young? &nbsp;She probably is older than me… &nbsp;Well, I guess from the Duke's perspective she is young. &nbsp;How old are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is rude to ask for a woman's age.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you don't answer me correctly, I'll treat you roughly... &nbsp;It does make me feel shameful for even saying those words.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm much younger than the Dragon Sword Duke.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura unnecessarily confirmed their suspicion about her age.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell grumbled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand how you feel, but please don't take the wind out of my sail. &nbsp;We have to be serious right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm sorry. &nbsp;I'll keep my mouth shut.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll ask you again. &nbsp;We won't ask you for your age...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laura cut off Azell's words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“After I answer your question, do you mind if I ask you a question in return?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…do you really think you are in a situation to ask me questions?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, that was the reason why I surrendered to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, all right. &nbsp;If I think the question is decent, I'll answer it. &nbsp;First... &nbsp;What Miss said to me....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Laura.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My name. &nbsp;It is Laura. &nbsp;Please call me by my name.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Laura Aunsaurus.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please leave the Aunsaurus out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…your demands are getting quite numerous. &nbsp;All right, Laura.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Azell conversed with Laura, he could feel the tension starting to bleed away. &nbsp;If Kairen hadn't said such unnecessary words, the mood wouldn't have shifted this way... &nbsp;Still, he had to take this more seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll ask this first. You said I might be the one, who might turn back the king's destiny. &nbsp;What did you mean by that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Our side is split on how we look at Azell Karzark.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One side looks as him as the being with the name soaked in sin... &nbsp;No, that isn't right. &nbsp;That is a title used for people with the name Azell. &nbsp;Would it be correct in saying the original Azell was the great sinner?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. He was the one, who killed the great king. &nbsp;However... &nbsp;According to the Aunsaurus clan and some other minor clans, Azell Karzark was called 'The being that granted the king the opportunity to turn back his destiny.'”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could you elaborate more?”</span></p>
