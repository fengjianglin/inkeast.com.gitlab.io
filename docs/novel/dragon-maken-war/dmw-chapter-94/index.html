 <p>Chapter 94 - Those who Seek Their Own Destiny (3)</p>
 <p><span style>4</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell and Kairen was almost at their destination. &nbsp;It had only been two weeks since they left the Dukedom of Tarantos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It took them four days to move past the border of the Rulain Kingdom into the Dailan Kingdom. &nbsp;It took them the next four days to traverse through the Dailan kingdom, and they had entered into the Bijes Kingdom. &nbsp;In the past, it used to be called the County of Karzark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If someone said they crossed two kingdoms in a week, one would think it was a bad joke. &nbsp;However, the two of them cut straight across the map. &nbsp;They traveled a distance of 300 km in a straight line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they entered the the Bijes Kingdom, their speed slowed a little bit. &nbsp;They knew where the County of Karzark was located at, but they needed to do some investigation before they went there. &nbsp;This was why they listened to stories from old men, and they searched out nobles, who collected books. &nbsp;They searched for historical records.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since they had crossed the borders without permission, they weren't truthful with their own identities. &nbsp;However, they had the seals proclaiming them of being knights, so they just needed to come up with a decent lie. &nbsp;&nbsp;The lie and seals was enough to be treated like guests for a night at a noble’s house.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen took charge in telling Azell what to do. &nbsp;In the past, Kairen had traveled around the continent with his identity hidden. &nbsp;He was used to traveling as a noble with a hidden identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We'll be there by afternoon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After gathering information, the two of them visited a town nearby the County of Karzark. &nbsp;Since the town was near the Cursed lands, it wasn't prosperous. &nbsp;However, it was a place where they could eat and rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they got closer to the County of Karzark, Azell spoke less and less. &nbsp;Kairen wasn't used to this version of Azell, but he left Azell alone. &nbsp;Kairen didn't want to be a nuisance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The County of Karzark had been the place that had allowed Azell to settle in peace. &nbsp;After the Dragon Demon wars, he need to rest his weary body, and he had started a new life....</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, it had been a short and fragile dream. &nbsp;In only two years after the war, the Dragon Demon King's curse had taken hold, and he had to leave his land. &nbsp;He was put to sleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell still wanted to see his land. He understood that he had been asleep for 220 years, but he had wanted to see if anything remained from his memories. &nbsp;He had wanted to see how his descendants fared in the land they inherited. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this simple hope had already been broken into pieces. &nbsp;There was nothing he could gain by going there, yet... &nbsp;He had to see it with his own eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell wordlessly stared at the location that was considered to be the County of Karzark. &nbsp;The stories he had heard up until now ran through his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The Great Darkness....’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If one talked about the current era, this event never failed to come up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The County of Karzark had fallen to ruins at the end of the Great Darkness. Many lives were taken from the spread of an infectious disease, but the situation had been stabilizing thanks to sage Baion. &nbsp;This was when the crazed Dragons attacked the County of Karzark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to the records, 13 crazed Dragons went on a rampage, and they attacked everything within the County of Karzark. &nbsp;Afterwards, a massive horde of monsters gathered in the land. &nbsp;It was as if they had been hypnotized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the fame of hero Azell Karzark, the County of Karzark was famous for their strong troops. &nbsp;Their knights were of high quality, and they possessed a lot of talented magicians. &nbsp;Of course, the soldiers were also trained well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, they couldn't do anything in front of this situation. &nbsp;In a flash, the County of Karzark was laid to waste, and the monsters started to spread outwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately , the Dragons didn't join in when the monsters advanced. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a desperate fight put up by the County of Karzark, the number of berserker Dragons had been cut down in half, and the rest of the Dragons refused to come out of the County of Karzark. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Bijes kingdom had been weakened by the Great Darkness, and they suffered further damages from the monsters. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the stories told by the old timers, Azell learned that the kingdom had been at the brink of destruction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, in the end, they were able to endure the threat, and the County of Karzark was designated as a Cursed land. &nbsp;The Bijes Kingdom built a fortress at the border.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was akin to the Rulain Kingdom's Southern Border Fortress... </span></p>
 <p><span style>5</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was obvious, but the County of Karzark was a forbidden region, and people were barred from entering the place. &nbsp;The border guards kept up a regular patrol along the border.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Azell and Kairen didn't have a hard time avoiding detection. &nbsp;They were able to sneak past the borders between kingdoms, so this was child's play.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen mumbled to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It hasn't changed much since my last visit. &nbsp;The fortress is still the same.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you been here before?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think it was around 30 years ago. It was after we destroyed the Grand Alliance of Darkness lead by Dakan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“……Hmmm. &nbsp;It is an answer that really drives home the fact that there is a great disparity in age between us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that he thought about it, Kairen was an eyewitness to what had happened in the Great Darkness. &nbsp;At the time, Kairen still would have been the Duke of Tarantos, so he probably knew how the Great Darkness shook the foundation of society.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell asked the question as they walked within the County of Karzark. &nbsp;He wasn't really interested in the answer. &nbsp;He asked the question, because he wanted to be distracted from his turbulent heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What was the Great Darkness like?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“At the time… Everything was a mess..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A contagious disease had swept through the continent, and it had been too ghastly. &nbsp;Until sage Baion came up with a solution, no one knew how to deal with the disease. &nbsp;&nbsp;If one caught the disease, one was quarantined, and the only thing left was to wait and die. &nbsp;That was the only choice available to the sick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No one was immune from it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Demons, Dragon Majins, famous knights and magicians were all powerless in front of the virulent disease. &nbsp;If one caught the disease, one could only look forward to death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, the Dragon Demons, Dragon Majins and the strong knights had great resistance against the disease, but.....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even that had its limit. In the end, their stamina was chipped away slowly, and they fell sick. &nbsp;It was the end for them too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, their presence actually accelerated the spread of this infectious disease. &nbsp;Since they had more resistance against this sickness, it took them longer to realize that they were sick compared to normal people. &nbsp;These beings met with other unsuspecting people, and it acted as a catalyst to spur the rate of infection.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen continued to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“From what I remember, the temples used to be quite prideful. &nbsp;If I told my old self about how humble the priests are right now, there is no way my old self would believe it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before the Great Darkness, the temples held absolute power. &nbsp;They used the Holy knowledge and techniques passed down by the gods to treat diseases and wounds. &nbsp;This made the priests act high and mighty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, during the Great Darkness, they had been powerless. &nbsp;They had been prideful as they claimed that they'll be able to cure the disease in a short period of time. &nbsp;The priests, who had stepped forward, died from the disease instead. &nbsp;It was unknown how many priests died during that time, but it was numerous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then there were the priests that said the Great Darkness was a divine punishment sent to strike down the people wallowing in their arrogance. &nbsp;A good number of priest spouted such nonsense.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Somehow I get an impression that the people who spoke such nonsense in front of you didn't go away unscathed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll leave what happened up to your imagination.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen grinned as he had a faraway look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It really was a terrible time. &nbsp;When I look back on it, it is hard to believe that it came to an end....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people laughing and talking the day before was struck down by the disease. &nbsp;The neighbors, who one had been good friends, were treated like monsters. &nbsp;People shunned the infected people. &nbsp;Kairen had believed in the humanity that was within people, yet any illusion of humanity was destroyed under the untreatable disease. It brought out the ugliness in people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…it sounds like what happens in a war.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the Dragon Demon War, the true character of humans had been tested. Everyone had acted as if all humans possessed humanity and benevolence. &nbsp;When in trouble, how many people really upheld these ideas?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen let out a bitter laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In my opinion, the Great Darkness was much worse than the wars. &nbsp;Unlike a war, there was no opponents one could fight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The values everyone had believed in crumbled away, and the world was sunk into darkness. &nbsp;Everyone fought desperately to live. &nbsp;However, people didn't know what to fight. &nbsp;They didn’t know how to fight this disease. &nbsp;No, it hadn't been a fight to live. &nbsp;It was a struggle one fought to delay one's inevitable demise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that era, there had been only one man, who had identified and fought against the 'enemy'.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Baion knew what to do. &nbsp;He knew that he had to fight against the disease itself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you met him before?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I've met him. &nbsp;I actually worked with him frequently when he was setting up the medical association. &nbsp;He had tried to gain support and help from the influential nobles. &nbsp;He needed a lot of political and monetary support to do what he wanted.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see. Is he still alive?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. &nbsp;He is probably dead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm? &nbsp;You aren't sure?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“After the medical association was established and running well, he started appearing less and less in public. &nbsp;Maybe, he hated being bothered with political matters.....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baion had been middle-aged during the Great Darkness. &nbsp;If he was still alive, he would be well over 100 years old.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them were maintaining speed of a normal person running at full tilt, while they held their conversation. &nbsp;The scene around them quickly changed, and they finally came to a place that held evidence of human occupation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At a certain point in time, the ruin used to be a town.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything was completely destroyed, and one couldn't find anything in tact. The buildings had been burned a long time ago. &nbsp;Trees and grass now grew where the buildings had stood before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell suddenly mumbled to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think this place was called...Digol.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm? &nbsp;What are you talking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is the name of this town.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was swept up in an unspeakable emotion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a lord, he had taken care of his County for only a brief amount of time. &nbsp;However, he had gone all over his lands as he settled in as the lord of this land. &nbsp;He knew every inch of this land.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sight he remembered superimposed itself on top of the ruins. &nbsp;Azell traveled far into his memory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were the people, who had cheered when they saw him. Then there were the innocent children, who had run around....</span></p>
 <p><span style>Digol was located at the edge of his domain, and the town had acted as a gateway to his lands. &nbsp;It had be fairly large, and after the Dragon Demon wars, the population had grown drastically. &nbsp;It had been a thriving town.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kairen was about to say something to Azell, who was standing there vacantly. &nbsp;However, he gave up on it. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell's expression had crumpled in such a frightening manner that Kairen couldn't say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell was the one, who broke the silence first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I needed targets to take out my anger on, and they are here just in time...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before one knew it, monsters started appearing from the surrounding. &nbsp;These were Orcs, who commanded ox-sized Blood Wolves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was to be expected. &nbsp;This land was designated as a Cursed land. &nbsp;It was so full of monsters that the Bijes Kingdom gave up on recovering this stretch of land.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Azell and Kairen was coming here, they had avoided the detection of the monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-ooh. &nbsp;These humans are fearless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A rough and awkward speech was heard. &nbsp;One of the Orc separated from the group, and it spoke as it walked towards the two humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How fortunate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Azell's gaze landed on him, the Orc, who had been talking, flinched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll ask this just in case. &nbsp;Did you come here with the wholesome intention of speaking with us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An indescribable anger was burning beneath his blue eyes. &nbsp;The Orcs were known for their grit and ferocity, yet the Orc froze for a brief moment when it saw the man's eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Orc raised its sword as it yelled out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Attack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An unimaginable massacre, which had never been seen before, since the Orcs had settled here, was carried out.</span></p>
