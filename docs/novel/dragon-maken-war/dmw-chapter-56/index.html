  <p dir="ltr">Chapter 56 - Dragon Demon Prince (3)</p>
  <hr>
  <p dir="ltr">"Yes. This is the first time I've seen my sister and teacher speak so passionately about someone.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It seemed after returning to the palace, she had talked about Azell in the presence of her family.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Seigar spoke.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Also, I wanted to thank you.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Thank me for what?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I heard my sister wouldn't have been safe if it weren't for you. Thank you for protecting my sister, sir Azell.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had a cold expression but his words were sincere. Azell spoke.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No. I just did what I had to do.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“There aren't a lot of people in this world who would have done the same. My elder sister is strong. She is a woman, but she carries the burden of fighting by herself to raise the throne's reputation. She's always pushing herself to the limit yet we keep asking her for more.... I would like her to think a little bit about her own happiness.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Seigar spoke after he let out a sigh.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sir Azell. I've heard your skills are outstanding. Do you have any thoughts about being one of my knights? You won't be disappointed by the remuneration I will give you.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You have such a high opinion of me even though this is the first time you have seen me. I'm thankful. However, I have some unfinished businesses that will require me to travel. I won't be able to accept your offer. I apologize.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hmm. I heard my sister knighted you. Are you perhaps thinking about working under my elder sister?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Is what my elder sister said was true? You have no ambitions towards being promoted?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“That is true at least for right now. There is something I have to do first...”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I heard you've gone through some difficulties that are hard to explain. I won't ask you any further questions. However, it's too bad. I've only recently started my activities, so I need a lot of men with skills..”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Even if it isn't me, doesn't the prince have a lot of talented prospects within your service?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The throne always lends me men, but it isn't enough. I need a lot of men who will work directly under me. Unfortunately, there aren't many men like that. The veterans are already entrenched in their positions, and it would create some friction if I just take people as I like. So in the end, I have to look for men who have potential, yet they mustn't hold any high positions. It isn't easy.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I see.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He spoke about a topic that didn't suit a young man. However, he had grown up as a royal, so he knew the meaning of his work. Moreover, he could accurately pinpoint what issues were causing problems when dealing with people.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“My elder sister is experiencing similar troubles… Unfortunately, she also doesn't plan on increasing her immediate staff. We need to aggressively find people that could assist my elder sister, but she doesn't like others sacrificing themselves for her. This is why she jumps into danger and overworks herself. I want to lessen the burden of my elder sister. This is why I need talented people.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Seigar wanted his activities to lessen the burden on Arrieta. This was why he had come here to poach Azell…….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">‘He is assuredly a strange human, but…….’</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As Arrieta and Kairen noticed, Seigar also felt a faint sense of Dragon Demon Magic. However, it was very subdued compared to the Dragon Demons or the Dragon Majins. It was an oddity. That was all he thought it was.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">‘It seems my elder sister and master exaggerated their story a little bit.’</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If he ignored the scent of Dragon Demon magic from him, Azell's magical energy wasn't that great. This made it impossible for Seigar to think of Azell as a strong person, since this was their first meeting. Even if he was a strong person hiding his magical waves, he would be able to sense whether the person was hiding a powerful strength or not.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Seigar didn't trust other's evaluation of people. He was satisfied only after he checked the person himself.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was already a lot of stories going around about Azell. Arrieta had mentioned him, and the royal knights who went out to escort Arrieta was making a fuss after they witnessed the sparring match between Azell and Kairen. However, now that he had met Azell, Seigar determined that the stories about Azell had been exaggerated.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">‘Well, he is only a human. I put too high of an expectation on him.’</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Seigar reaffirmed to himself the fact that he was strong. If he excluded his master Kairen, there weren't that many, who exceeded him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This wasn't a simple childish assessment from a young man. It was an opinion supported by his experience in actual battle. He had his first live battle experience this year, and he had participated in two more battles after that. He had overwhelmed his foes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After being trained by Kairen, he had faced off against a lot of humans. However, he had never come across one that he considered to be really strong. Even the royal knight, who was called the strongest swordsman, couldn't do much against Seigar. Without realizing it, Segiar formed the opinion that humans could be outstanding in terms of techniques, but they won't be able to touch him in terms of overall battle ability.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ah. I don't plan on thanking you with only words on saving my sister. Do you want anything? If you don't have anything particular in mind, I can give you riches as a reward.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mmm. What if… Could you make it so that I'll be able to enter the palace's library?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The Royal Library?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Seigar was puzzled. This was a request he had never expected.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell spoke.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes. I want to see the books in there. I would be thankful if I was given full access.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“That won't be too hard. I'll put in a word. Just in case, I'll ask them to give you an admission pass."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Thank you.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I'll excuse myself now. This conversation was enjoyable.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Please take care on your way back.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After receiving his respects from Azell, Seigar joined the servants waiting for him outside to leave.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell mumbled to himself.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It seems my stay in the palace will become annoying… Mmmm.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">4</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His prediction was spot on.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell placed a hand on his head the next day when he received a mountainous pile of invitations and presents.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Aigo. My god.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The noble society was always like this. Their main source of amusement was their interest in people and their social life. This was especially true in capital. There were too many of their peers gathered in a single place. This meant cultural and fashion changes happened up-to-the-minute here.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If they saw someone eye-catching, the nobles wouldn't leave that person alone.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Dragon Demon Princess had never knighted anyone before him. Moreover, she hadn't required him to take the oath of loyalty. This had surprised everyone.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Moreover, they had heard from his travel companions that he had shone brightly when facing the Dragon Demon King worshippers, who had targeted Arrieta. Even the Dragon Sword Duke, who was called the living legend, gave him compliments. On top of that, Sir Veran had gone to escort the princess, and he swore he saw Azell fighting on par with the Dragon Sword Duke in their sparring match.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The story started to spread. The nobles were very sensitive to rumors, and their eyes sparkled at the chance to see someone interesting. Of course, the nobles would show interest in Azell.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Wow. I envy you.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Enora had come to invite Azell to lunch, and her eyes were sparkling. Azell replied in an apathetic manner.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What's so good about this?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You've become the star of the social circles overnight. Everyone is sending you invitations and presents. As a noble lady, it is a dream-like scenario.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“…Since I'm not a noble lady, this isn't welcomed.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Well, it wasn't as if he hadn't experienced this before. Maybe, that was why he wasn't excited about it. Before he was put to sleep, every noble had shown interest, respect, and affection towards him. Even the members of the royal family begged for some face time. They even begged for him to teach them martial arts.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Moreover, the presents are a little bit... Do you want this perfume, Ms. Enora?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Amongst the present he received, there were perfumes, scarves, and silver jewelries. A lot of them were meant for female use. Enora's eyes sparkled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Are you sure?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Well, I don't need these items. Also, if you want anything else here, you can have it.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It hadn't even cross Azell's mind to return these presents.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">From the perspective of a normal person, the presents sent along with the invitations were very expensive items. From the perspective of the nobles, it was something they sent out of formality to keep up appearances. If one returned the presents, because of the expensive price tag, it would be considered rude. The only time he would be able to turn down a gift was if the item was more expensive than all of these presents combined.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Also, this couldn't be seen as an unnecessary favor. Azell would need clothes befitting the noble society. From the perspective of nobles, they didn't want the person they invite to embarrass themselves by dressing informally. This was why they even sent items for female use.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Enora was smiling with joy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Wow. You seem to be a really good person, Sir Azell!!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“…By looking at the timing of your words, you make it seem like I was a really bad person in the past.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Are you sure about this? If you plan on accepting the invitations, you will need these stuff. If you don't have a female companion to go to these events, I can introduce you to some of my Unnis that I know...”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">All the palace maids were of noble birth. This was why they were all eager for a chance to make their debut in high society. Everyone would love for the chance to escort an emerging character in Azell.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell clicked his tongue.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“A young lady shouldn't speak such words. I have no interest in them.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The palace maids have an appearance standard they have to pass, so they are all beauties. They also know how to carry themselves, since they are of noble birth. You still aren't interested?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ms. Enora. Are you perhaps trying to sneakily paint yourself as a beauty?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Oh my. Are you denying it?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ms. Enora is more cute than beautiful.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If you talk like that, you won't be popular with the women, Sir Azell.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell couldn't help but laugh when he saw Enora put on a sullen expression. Then, he spoke.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Anyways, I'm thankful for the offer, but I will have to decline. I'm not planning on accepting any invitations.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What? Are you serious?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Enora asked as if she couldn't believe what she was hearing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was a chance of a lifetime for Azell who had been recently knighted. Even if one was a skilled martial artist, it was hard to advance through the ranks without any background. That is why he needed to make his face known to the nobles. It was a precious opportunity where he would be able to build personal connections with those in high society.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She was young, but Enora had worked for the throne. She understood how things worked here. She couldn't help, but think Azell was being naive on how the world works.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Please think about it one more time, Sir Azell. You won't be able to get this kind of opportunity even if you tried in the future. If you don't capitalize on this opportunity, it won't matter how many meritorious deed you do in the future. You'll end up running around endlessly in a circle.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“…Wow, Ms Enora. I'm a little bit impressed right now.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No, you really sounded like an adult, who had gone through all sorts of hardships.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Please be serious when I'm talking about a serious topic.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Enora's pouted once again. Azell laughed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It's a compliment. Ms Enora is a noble, but you grew up in the country. You are still young, yet you understand how the noble society works in the capital. It's very surprising. Moreover, you've only been a royal maid for less than a year. Ms. Enora is very smart. Of course, you wouldn't have become the princess' personal maid unless you were very smart and perceptive.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Jeez. You are making me blush with all the praises you are giving me.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell's list of innocent praises made Enora's face turn red.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Azell spoke.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I know what you are worried about. However, I don't want to become successful through that method. At the very least, I want some freedom for awhile. I don't want go head first into troublesome businesses.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ha-ah. Sir Azell is too weird.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Well, as a royal maid, Ms. Enora would see it that way. Anyways, hurry up and pick what you want. The princess is probably waiting for us.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Soon, Enora had picked a mountainous pile of female items, and she exited Azell's room in delight.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">“I heard you've gone through some difficulties that are hard to explain. I won't ask you any further questions. However, it's too bad. I've only recently started my activities, so I need a lot of men with skills..”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Even if it isn't me, doesn't the prince have a lot of talented prospects within your service?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The throne always lends me men, but it isn't enough. I need a lot of men who will work directly under me. Unfortunately, there aren't many men like that. The veterans are already entrenched in their positions, and it would create some friction if I just take people as I like. So in the end, I have to look for men who have potential, yet they mustn't hold any high positions. It isn't easy.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I see.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He spoke about a topic that didn't suit a young man. However, he had grown up as a royal, so he knew the meaning of his work. Moreover, he could accurately pinpoint what issues were causing problems when dealing with people.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“My elder sister is experiencing similar troubles… Unfortunately, she also doesn't plan on increasing her immediate staff. We need to aggressively find people that could assist my elder sister, but she doesn't like others sacrificing themselves for her. This is why she jumps into danger and overworks herself. I want to lessen the burden of my elder sister. This is why I need talented people.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Seigar wanted his activities to lessen the burden on Arrieta. This was why he had come here to poach Azell…….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">‘He is assuredly a strange human, but…….’</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As Arrieta and Kairen noticed, Seigar also felt a faint sense of Dragon Demon Magic. However, it was very subdued compared to the Dragon Demons or the Dragon Majins. It was an oddity. That was all he thought it was.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">‘It seems my elder sister and master exaggerated their story a little bit.’</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If he ignored the scent of Dragon Demon magic from him, Azell's magical energy wasn't that great. This made it impossible for Seigar to think of Azell as a strong person, since this was their first meeting. Even if he was a strong person hiding his magical waves, he would be able to sense whether the person was hiding a powerful strength or not.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Seigar didn't trust other's evaluation of people. He was satisfied only after he checked the person himself.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was already a lot of stories going around about Azell. Arrieta had mentioned him, and the royal knights who went out to escort Arrieta was making a fuss after they witnessed the sparring match between Azell and Kairen. However, now that he had met Azell, Seigar determined that the stories about Azell had been exaggerated.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">‘Well, he is only a human. I put too high of an expectation on him.’</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Seigar reaffirmed to himself the fact that he was strong. If he excluded his master Kairen, there weren't that many, who exceeded him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This wasn't a simple childish assessment from a young man. It was an opinion supported by his experience in actual battle. He had his first live battle experience this year, and he had participated in two more battles after that. He had overwhelmed his foes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After being trained by Kairen, he had faced off against a lot of humans. However, he had never come across one that he considered to be really strong. Even the royal knight, who was called the strongest swordsman, couldn't do much against Seigar. Without realizing it, Segiar formed the opinion that humans could be outstanding in terms of techniques, but they won't be able to touch him in terms of overall battle ability.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ah. I don't plan on thanking you with only words on saving my sister. Do you want anything? If you don't have anything particular in mind, I can give you riches as a reward.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mmm. What if… Could you make it so that I'll be able to enter the palace's library?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The Royal Library?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Seigar was puzzled. This was a request he had never expected.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell spoke.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes. I want to see the books in there. I would be thankful if I was given full access.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“That won't be too hard. I'll put in a word. Just in case, I'll ask them to give you an admission pass."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Thank you.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I'll excuse myself now. This conversation was enjoyable.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Please take care on your way back.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After receiving his respects from Azell, Seigar joined the servants waiting for him outside to leave.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell mumbled to himself.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It seems my stay in the palace will become annoying… Mmmm.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">4</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His prediction was spot on.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell placed a hand on his head the next day when he received a mountainous pile of invitations and presents.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Aigo. My god.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The noble society was always like this. Their main source of amusement was their interest in people and their social life. This was especially true in capital. There were too many of their peers gathered in a single place. This meant cultural and fashion changes happened up-to-the-minute here.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If they saw someone eye-catching, the nobles wouldn't leave that person alone.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Dragon Demon Princess had never knighted anyone before him. Moreover, she hadn't required him to take the oath of loyalty. This had surprised everyone.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Moreover, they had heard from his travel companions that he had shone brightly when facing the Dragon Demon King worshippers, who had targeted Arrieta. Even the Dragon Sword Duke, who was called the living legend, gave him compliments. On top of that, Sir Veran had gone to escort the princess, and he swore he saw Azell fighting on par with the Dragon Sword Duke in their sparring match.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The story started to spread. The nobles were very sensitive to rumors, and their eyes sparkled at the chance to see someone interesting. Of course, the nobles would show interest in Azell.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Wow. I envy you.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Enora had come to invite Azell to lunch, and her eyes were sparkling. Azell replied in an apathetic manner.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What's so good about this?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You've become the star of the social circles overnight. Everyone is sending you invitations and presents. As a noble lady, it is a dream-like scenario.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“…Since I'm not a noble lady, this isn't welcomed.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Well, it wasn't as if he hadn't experienced this before. Maybe, that was why he wasn't excited about it. Before he was put to sleep, every noble had shown interest, respect, and affection towards him. Even the members of the royal family begged for some face time. They even begged for him to teach them martial arts.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Moreover, the presents are a little bit... Do you want this perfume, Ms. Enora?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Amongst the present he received, there were perfumes, scarves, and silver jewelries. A lot of them were meant for female use. Enora's eyes sparkled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Are you sure?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Well, I don't need these items. Also, if you want anything else here, you can have it.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It hadn't even cross Azell's mind to return these presents.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">From the perspective of a normal person, the presents sent along with the invitations were very expensive items. From the perspective of the nobles, it was something they sent out of formality to keep up appearances. If one returned the presents, because of the expensive price tag, it would be considered rude. The only time he would be able to turn down a gift was if the item was more expensive than all of these presents combined.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Also, this couldn't be seen as an unnecessary favor. Azell would need clothes befitting the noble society. From the perspective of nobles, they didn't want the person they invite to embarrass themselves by dressing informally. This was why they even sent items for female use.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Enora was smiling with joy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Wow. You seem to be a really good person, Sir Azell!!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“…By looking at the timing of your words, you make it seem like I was a really bad person in the past.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Are you sure about this? If you plan on accepting the invitations, you will need these stuff. If you don't have a female companion to go to these events, I can introduce you to some of my Unnis that I know...”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">All the palace maids were of noble birth. This was why they were all eager for a chance to make their debut in high society. Everyone would love for the chance to escort an emerging character in Azell.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell clicked his tongue.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“A young lady shouldn't speak such words. I have no interest in them.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The palace maids have an appearance standard they have to pass, so they are all beauties. They also know how to carry themselves, since they are of noble birth. You still aren't interested?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ms. Enora. Are you perhaps trying to sneakily paint yourself as a beauty?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Oh my. Are you denying it?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ms. Enora is more cute than beautiful.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“If you talk like that, you won't be popular with the women, Sir Azell.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell couldn't help but laugh when he saw Enora put on a sullen expression. Then, he spoke.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Anyways, I'm thankful for the offer, but I will have to decline. I'm not planning on accepting any invitations.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What? Are you serious?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Enora asked as if she couldn't believe what she was hearing.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was a chance of a lifetime for Azell who had been recently knighted. Even if one was a skilled martial artist, it was hard to advance through the ranks without any background. That is why he needed to make his face known to the nobles. It was a precious opportunity where he would be able to build personal connections with those in high society.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She was young, but Enora had worked for the throne. She understood how things worked here. She couldn't help, but think Azell was being naive on how the world works.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Please think about it one more time, Sir Azell. You won't be able to get this kind of opportunity even if you tried in the future. If you don't capitalize on this opportunity, it won't matter how many meritorious deed you do in the future. You'll end up running around endlessly in a circle.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“…Wow, Ms Enora. I'm a little bit impressed right now.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“No, you really sounded like an adult, who had gone through all sorts of hardships.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Please be serious when I'm talking about a serious topic.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Enora's pouted once again. Azell laughed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It's a compliment. Ms Enora is a noble, but you grew up in the country. You are still young, yet you understand how the noble society works in the capital. It's very surprising. Moreover, you've only been a royal maid for less than a year. Ms. Enora is very smart. Of course, you wouldn't have become the princess' personal maid unless you were very smart and perceptive.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Jeez. You are making me blush with all the praises you are giving me.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell's list of innocent praises made Enora's face turn red.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Azell spoke.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I know what you are worried about. However, I don't want to become successful through that method. At the very least, I want some freedom for awhile. I don't want go head first into troublesome businesses.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ha-ah. Sir Azell is too weird.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Well, as a royal maid, Ms. Enora would see it that way. Anyways, hurry up and pick what you want. The princess is probably waiting for us.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Soon, Enora had picked a mountainous pile of female items, and she exited Azell's room in delight.</p>
