  <p><span style>Chapter 43 -&nbsp;</span><span style>When I Met Someone Who Was Dead (8)</span></p>
  <p></p>
  <hr>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>Azell continued to speak.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I know the barrier wasn’t solely made to prevent us from escaping. I’m not sure of its exact purpose, but there must be a reason why you waited until this time to attack us.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Kook……!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis bit her lips.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell’s words got to the heart of the matter. The Curtain of Darkness wasn’t prepared to simply block Arrieta from running away. She had put in all the effort to conceal was happening inside the barrier from outside eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell grinned.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I guess I’m right?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell confirmed his conjecture was correct, when he saw Niberis’ reaction. He didn’t know what her reasons were, but she had a reason for using a grandiose magic like the Curtain of Darkness to kidnap Arrieta in secret.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis’ expression soon calmed down. Her face was filled with a cold fury as she glared at Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“We’ve been dancing on the palm of your hand. However… Don’t think everything will turn out as you intended.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>If Niberis acted wisely, she would have retreated right now. However, her pride wouldn’t allow it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘How could I fail at such a insignificant mission? I won’t allow this to happen.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>After her skills were recognized, she had never failed a mission tasked to her. Her perfect career will be blemished from this? She wouldn’t allow it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Only death awaits those who raise the Dragon’s ire.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis let out a thick wave of darkness. Azell disappeared in front of her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Pah-jijiji-jeek!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell moved towards her using his Instantaneous Movement, and he swung his sword right on top of her barrier….or that’s what she had thought for a brief second.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Clone?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis was taken aback. Azell’s clone had attacked her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘His clone is able to attack like his real body?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>If he was using magic, then she would understand how he did it. One would just have to materialize magic at the clone’s location.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, this attack wasn’t carried out in that fashion. She most definitely felt the impact of a sword with magic imbued within it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘This is impossible.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>She wasn’t able to comprehend what was happening using her knowledge, so she froze for a moment. Azell used this hesitation to grab Arrieta’s hand, and they attempted an escape.</span></p>
  <p><span style>-Everyone run! I’ll hit them from the side, so coordinate an escape!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell shouted with his Whispering. After fighting without support, Giles and Boar had defeated most of the monsters on their end, and they looked up in surprise. Azell ran into their midst, and he ruthlessly cut down any monsters near them.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After a second delay, Giles and Boar surprisingly reacted swiftly. After cutting down the monsters frozen from Azell’s sneak attack, Boar put Enora over his shoulder, then he started running.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Kyahhk!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ms Enora! Please pardon my action!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Enora let out a scream, but Boar didn’t have time to be considerate.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Oh no!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis realized a beat too late, and she was taken aback. Who could have guessed they would run away like this?</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I won’t let you get away!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Darkness erupted beneath Niberis’ feet. The darkness coalesced to form crawling tentacles. From below, a large shape that would be the body connecting to the tentacles revealed itself.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was like the corrupted being in that it chased after the party as if it was sliding across the ground.</span></p>
  <p><span style>8</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell’s party started to run away. From the start, they all dispersed into different directions.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was a decision made by Azell. Azell surmised they would all die if they initially ran away in a group. He ordered everyone to disperse.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Before everyone could carry out his instructions, an unexpected problem arose. It was something even Azell couldn’t have foreseen.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Oooooooooh!</span></p>
  <p><span style>A light flashed in front of his eyes. Azell quickly raised his sword to block.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kwah-ahng!</span></p>
  <p><span style>The sound of an explosion rang out, and Azell was flung back.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Kuh-uhk!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The impact spread through his entire body, and his body was briefly paralyzed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The existence giving off a fearsome aura cleared his throat, then he opened his mouth.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hmm hmmm. I was on standby just in case…. It seems I will be of some help, miss.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>He was a swordsman wearing a black armor that covered his entire body. Judging by his voice, he was an imposing male. His face wasn’t visible, so his age couldn’t be determined. He had a large body that was over 2 meters tall.</span></p>
  <p><span style>As if it was a set to his armor, he held a black sword. As befitting his large 2 meter frame, the sword was twice as large and twice as thick as a normal sword.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Duran? Why are you here….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis, who was tracking the party, revealed her dismay. It seemed even she didn’t realize the presence of the dark swordsman.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ah ah. I was here, since I also have some business in this country.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Did the elders send you?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No. The elders didn’t order it, but…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“But?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“This old man’s overly cautious nature brought me here. I will apologize if this offends you.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You couldn’t trust me to take care of a ……!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>For a moment, Niberis’ hurt pride made her angry. However, she regained her composure soon.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…no. I am in your debt. You made a wise decision. Thank you.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The large dark knight named Duran looked towards Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell gritted his teeth.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Kook. This bastard… He is strong.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>The pressure emitted by his entire body wasn’t normal. Even if Azell had been ambushed, he had received enough damage to receive internal wounds. This person was the strongest Spirit Order practitioner he had encountered since he had woken up in this age.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘If it was only that woman from the Dragon Demon race, then I could have handled…….’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Originally, Azell wanted the party to run away in different directions. He planned on running away with Arrieta to lure Niberis away. After putting a sufficient distance away from the enemy’s troops, he planned on risking himself by blocking Niberis as Arrieta ran away. He would have done his utmost to delay her, then he would have extracted himself. That was his plan.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, when Duran made his appearance, that plan was scrapped.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘This is a hopeless situation. Shit.’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell wasn’t omniscient and omnipotent. His constant self-assured appearance was a false front he put up to gain a psychological advantage against his enemies. Inside, he was desperately thinking of a way to break away from this situation. He merely acted on a faint hope.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Duran was in the front, and Niberis was in the rear.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Will they be able to break away from this situation?</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘If we ran away as we scattered…….’</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hoo hoo. I can hear the gears in your head turning, shrimp.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>At that moment, Duran let out a cold laugh. Simultaneously, Duran’s murderous intent swept over Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, he didn’t attack immediately. Duran spoke to Niberis.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ll keep telling you this, miss…. I’m not here, because I was worried about you failing in your mission.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What are you saying?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Even if you were successfully pulling off the plan, I would have joined in to wrap this up as soon as possible. Or I would have advised you to pull back.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“…you want me to give up on the fishes I have already almost caught?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Niberis asked with an edge in her voice. Duran replied softly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I would recommend that course of action. It would be safer that way.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I don’t know your reason, but I won’t do so.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Then I will first respect my lady’s wishes, and I will do my best to help you. However, if the event I am worried about comes to pass, then please listen to my request.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Duran warned Niberis that he didn’t agree with her, but he was also trying to be considerate of her pride. Niberis was that important to the organization. She held an important status. This is why Duran personally treasured Niberis.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After deciding on their course of action, Duran asked a question.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What would you like to do with everyone excluding the Dragon Demon Princess, miss?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“We’ll kill them all here.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If the report about the Dragon Demon Princess’ temperament is correct, then wouldn’t she have some worth as a hostage?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That may be true, but I wouldn’t put too much trust in the information. No matter how noble a character she possesses, wouldn’t she be filled with guilt if she realizes her current situation?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Understood. Then…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Duran’s figure disappeared.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Shwee shwee shwee shweee!</span></p>
  <p><span style>In a blink of an eye, Duran appeared in front of the party. Duran appeared in front of each member of Azell’s party.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Everyone was surprised, so they reflexively attacked. However, everyone struck empty air.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Too-hahk!</span></p>
  <p><span style>There was only one real body, and it was the one that had appeared in front of Enora. As Azell blocked his attack, sparks flew everywhere.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ho-oh.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>From within Duran’s helmet, a sound of admiration leaked out.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You were able to realize which one was my real body. You are pretty good for a shirmp.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell had ignored the clone that appeared in front of him, and he had immediately ran in front of Enora.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell glared as his blade pressed against the other’s sword.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You attacked a weak child first… Your actions are quite dirty befitting a dark heretical organization.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I was being merciful.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You guys will all die here anyways. She would be tormented if she saw the dirty deeds I was going to inflict on all of you. Wouldn’t it be a mercy if I killed her first?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Duran wasn’t making a sarcastic remark. He meant what he said.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Since Niberis decided to kill them all, he would follow her order. He would also have to kill Enora, so he would rather not draw it out. He was going to kill her before she realized what was happening. He considered it a mercy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Anyways, now that I see your skill, I can understand why you gave the miss so much trouble. However…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Duran’s figure disappeared. Azell quickly used his Instantaneous Movement to follow him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Che Che Che Che Cheng!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Both men disappeared. Sounds of steel clashing and sparks rang out from everywhere.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The others couldn’t even follow the two men’s movements. It was a high speed battle. Boar and Giles couldn’t pick up their movements at all. Arrieta could barely follow the shapes with her eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Suddenly, Duran stopped in one place. Azell appeared right in front of him, and Azell brought down his sword.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hoop!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Too-hahk!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Duran held firm like a boulder as he flung Azell’s sword strike away. The surface beneath Azell broke, and he was flung away.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Duran spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You are lacking in power.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Even Duran was surprised by Azell’s techniques. This age had already forgotten the great techniques of the past yet a young man possessed this level of skill.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The only problem was his strength was too low compared to his skills. It wouldn’t be a problem if he could overwhelm an opponent with his superior skill, but Duran had learned the secret techniques passed down through the organization.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Moreover, you are quite tired from facing the young lady.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Duran swung his sword down through empty air. A transparent force suddenly formed following the arc of his swing.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kwah-kwah-kwah-kwah!</span></p>
  <p><span style>The wave of power expanded into a crescent shape, and it shot towards Azell’s party. He had merely swung his sword, yet the earth in front of him parted. Moreover, a shock wave that looked as if it would swallow the party whole was formed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>At the same moment, Niberis casted her magic.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kwah-gwah-gwahng! Ggwah-gwahng!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Lightning poured down towards everyone except Arrieta. The wave of power Duran produced with his sword was timed exquisitely with the lightning as they struck.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Kwahhhhhng!</span></p>
  <p><span style>The surface of the ground shook as the sound of explosion rang out.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Duran spoke as he saw the the earth being flung in all direction.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You are a very surprising shrimp. I knew my lady wouldn’t have any trouble facing someone like the Dragon Demon Princess…. I guess it was all him?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It is unpleasant, but I acknowledge his skill.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The cloud of dust settled, and Azell’s figure came into view.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Koooh…….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Blood was running down Azell’s face.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The previous attacks was too well time that Azell couldn’t block it without taking damage. It would have been possible to dodge on his own, but he had to protect everyone in this party. This additional condition didn’t give him much option.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘What should I do?’</span></p>
  <p><span style>He didn’t see any way out.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Duran was too big of an existence. His skill was at a level where Azell couldn’t look down upon it, and his magical energy would overpower Azell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Also, the difference in equipment was too large. Duran had a suit of armor. His sword and equipment were enchanted with strong magic.</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘I’ll have to think of this as the worst case scenario..’</span></p>
  <p><span style>Azell resolved this was the place where his bones would be buried. He couldn’t take out everyone. He had no choice, but to decide on a priority list.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was at that moment.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“A?rri?e?ta?!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>From afar, a thunder-like sound rang out, and the shout shook the heavens.</span></p>

 <p><span style>Chapter 43 -&nbsp;</span><span style>When I Met Someone Who Was Dead (8)</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Azell continued to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know the barrier wasn’t solely made to prevent us from escaping. I’m not sure of its exact purpose, but there must be a reason why you waited until this time to attack us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kook……!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis bit her lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s words got to the heart of the matter. The Curtain of Darkness wasn’t prepared to simply block Arrieta from running away. She had put in all the effort to conceal was happening inside the barrier from outside eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell grinned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess I’m right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell confirmed his conjecture was correct, when he saw Niberis’ reaction. He didn’t know what her reasons were, but she had a reason for using a grandiose magic like the Curtain of Darkness to kidnap Arrieta in secret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis’ expression soon calmed down. Her face was filled with a cold fury as she glared at Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ve been dancing on the palm of your hand. However… Don’t think everything will turn out as you intended.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Niberis acted wisely, she would have retreated right now. However, her pride wouldn’t allow it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How could I fail at such a insignificant mission? I won’t allow this to happen.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>After her skills were recognized, she had never failed a mission tasked to her. Her perfect career will be blemished from this? She wouldn’t allow it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Only death awaits those who raise the Dragon’s ire.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis let out a thick wave of darkness. Azell disappeared in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pah-jijiji-jeek!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell moved towards her using his Instantaneous Movement, and he swung his sword right on top of her barrier….or that’s what she had thought for a brief second.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Clone?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis was taken aback. Azell’s clone had attacked her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘His clone is able to attack like his real body?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he was using magic, then she would understand how he did it. One would just have to materialize magic at the clone’s location.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this attack wasn’t carried out in that fashion. She most definitely felt the impact of a sword with magic imbued within it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is impossible.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wasn’t able to comprehend what was happening using her knowledge, so she froze for a moment. Azell used this hesitation to grab Arrieta’s hand, and they attempted an escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Everyone run! I’ll hit them from the side, so coordinate an escape!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell shouted with his Whispering. After fighting without support, Giles and Boar had defeated most of the monsters on their end, and they looked up in surprise. Azell ran into their midst, and he ruthlessly cut down any monsters near them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a second delay, Giles and Boar surprisingly reacted swiftly. After cutting down the monsters frozen from Azell’s sneak attack, Boar put Enora over his shoulder, then he started running.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kyahhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ms Enora! Please pardon my action!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enora let out a scream, but Boar didn’t have time to be considerate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh no!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis realized a beat too late, and she was taken aback. Who could have guessed they would run away like this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t let you get away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Darkness erupted beneath Niberis’ feet. The darkness coalesced to form crawling tentacles. From below, a large shape that would be the body connecting to the tentacles revealed itself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was like the corrupted being in that it chased after the party as if it was sliding across the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>8</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell’s party started to run away. From the start, they all dispersed into different directions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a decision made by Azell. Azell surmised they would all die if they initially ran away in a group. He ordered everyone to disperse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before everyone could carry out his instructions, an unexpected problem arose. It was something even Azell couldn’t have foreseen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oooooooooh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A light flashed in front of his eyes. Azell quickly raised his sword to block.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwah-ahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of an explosion rang out, and Azell was flung back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuh-uhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The impact spread through his entire body, and his body was briefly paralyzed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The existence giving off a fearsome aura cleared his throat, then he opened his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm hmmm. I was on standby just in case…. It seems I will be of some help, miss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was a swordsman wearing a black armor that covered his entire body. Judging by his voice, he was an imposing male. His face wasn’t visible, so his age couldn’t be determined. He had a large body that was over 2 meters tall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if it was a set to his armor, he held a black sword. As befitting his large 2 meter frame, the sword was twice as large and twice as thick as a normal sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duran? Why are you here….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis, who was tracking the party, revealed her dismay. It seemed even she didn’t realize the presence of the dark swordsman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah ah. I was here, since I also have some business in this country.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did the elders send you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. The elders didn’t order it, but…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This old man’s overly cautious nature brought me here. I will apologize if this offends you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You couldn’t trust me to take care of a ……!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a moment, Niberis’ hurt pride made her angry. However, she regained her composure soon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…no. I am in your debt. You made a wise decision. Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The large dark knight named Duran looked towards Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell gritted his teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Kook. This bastard… He is strong.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pressure emitted by his entire body wasn’t normal. Even if Azell had been ambushed, he had received enough damage to receive internal wounds. This person was the strongest Spirit Order practitioner he had encountered since he had woken up in this age.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If it was only that woman from the Dragon Demon race, then I could have handled…….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, Azell wanted the party to run away in different directions. He planned on running away with Arrieta to lure Niberis away. After putting a sufficient distance away from the enemy’s troops, he planned on risking himself by blocking Niberis as Arrieta ran away. He would have done his utmost to delay her, then he would have extracted himself. That was his plan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when Duran made his appearance, that plan was scrapped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is a hopeless situation. Shit.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell wasn’t omniscient and omnipotent. His constant self-assured appearance was a false front he put up to gain a psychological advantage against his enemies. Inside, he was desperately thinking of a way to break away from this situation. He merely acted on a faint hope.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran was in the front, and Niberis was in the rear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Will they be able to break away from this situation?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If we ran away as we scattered…….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoo hoo. I can hear the gears in your head turning, shrimp.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Duran let out a cold laugh. Simultaneously, Duran’s murderous intent swept over Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he didn’t attack immediately. Duran spoke to Niberis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll keep telling you this, miss…. I’m not here, because I was worried about you failing in your mission.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you saying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if you were successfully pulling off the plan, I would have joined in to wrap this up as soon as possible. Or I would have advised you to pull back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…you want me to give up on the fishes I have already almost caught?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Niberis asked with an edge in her voice. Duran replied softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I would recommend that course of action. It would be safer that way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know your reason, but I won’t do so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I will first respect my lady’s wishes, and I will do my best to help you. However, if the event I am worried about comes to pass, then please listen to my request.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran warned Niberis that he didn’t agree with her, but he was also trying to be considerate of her pride. Niberis was that important to the organization. She held an important status. This is why Duran personally treasured Niberis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After deciding on their course of action, Duran asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What would you like to do with everyone excluding the Dragon Demon Princess, miss?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll kill them all here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If the report about the Dragon Demon Princess’ temperament is correct, then wouldn’t she have some worth as a hostage?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That may be true, but I wouldn’t put too much trust in the information. No matter how noble a character she possesses, wouldn’t she be filled with guilt if she realizes her current situation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood. Then…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran’s figure disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shwee shwee shwee shweee!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a blink of an eye, Duran appeared in front of the party. Duran appeared in front of each member of Azell’s party.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was surprised, so they reflexively attacked. However, everyone struck empty air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Too-hahk!</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was only one real body, and it was the one that had appeared in front of Enora. As Azell blocked his attack, sparks flew everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ho-oh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From within Duran’s helmet, a sound of admiration leaked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You were able to realize which one was my real body. You are pretty good for a shirmp.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell had ignored the clone that appeared in front of him, and he had immediately ran in front of Enora.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell glared as his blade pressed against the other’s sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You attacked a weak child first… Your actions are quite dirty befitting a dark heretical organization.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was being merciful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys will all die here anyways. She would be tormented if she saw the dirty deeds I was going to inflict on all of you. Wouldn’t it be a mercy if I killed her first?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran wasn’t making a sarcastic remark. He meant what he said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Niberis decided to kill them all, he would follow her order. He would also have to kill Enora, so he would rather not draw it out. He was going to kill her before she realized what was happening. He considered it a mercy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Anyways, now that I see your skill, I can understand why you gave the miss so much trouble. However…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran’s figure disappeared. Azell quickly used his Instantaneous Movement to follow him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Che Che Che Che Cheng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both men disappeared. Sounds of steel clashing and sparks rang out from everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The others couldn’t even follow the two men’s movements. It was a high speed battle. Boar and Giles couldn’t pick up their movements at all. Arrieta could barely follow the shapes with her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Duran stopped in one place. Azell appeared right in front of him, and Azell brought down his sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoop!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Too-hahk!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran held firm like a boulder as he flung Azell’s sword strike away. The surface beneath Azell broke, and he was flung away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are lacking in power.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Duran was surprised by Azell’s techniques. This age had already forgotten the great techniques of the past yet a young man possessed this level of skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only problem was his strength was too low compared to his skills. It wouldn’t be a problem if he could overwhelm an opponent with his superior skill, but Duran had learned the secret techniques passed down through the organization.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Moreover, you are quite tired from facing the young lady.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran swung his sword down through empty air. A transparent force suddenly formed following the arc of his swing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwah-kwah-kwah-kwah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The wave of power expanded into a crescent shape, and it shot towards Azell’s party. He had merely swung his sword, yet the earth in front of him parted. Moreover, a shock wave that looked as if it would swallow the party whole was formed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same moment, Niberis casted her magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwah-gwah-gwahng! Ggwah-gwahng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lightning poured down towards everyone except Arrieta. The wave of power Duran produced with his sword was timed exquisitely with the lightning as they struck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kwahhhhhng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surface of the ground shook as the sound of explosion rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran spoke as he saw the the earth being flung in all direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are a very surprising shrimp. I knew my lady wouldn’t have any trouble facing someone like the Dragon Demon Princess…. I guess it was all him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is unpleasant, but I acknowledge his skill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cloud of dust settled, and Azell’s figure came into view.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koooh…….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood was running down Azell’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The previous attacks was too well time that Azell couldn’t block it without taking damage. It would have been possible to dodge on his own, but he had to protect everyone in this party. This additional condition didn’t give him much option.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What should I do?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t see any way out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duran was too big of an existence. His skill was at a level where Azell couldn’t look down upon it, and his magical energy would overpower Azell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Also, the difference in equipment was too large. Duran had a suit of armor. His sword and equipment were enchanted with strong magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’ll have to think of this as the worst case scenario..’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azell resolved this was the place where his bones would be buried. He couldn’t take out everyone. He had no choice, but to decide on a priority list.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A?rri?e?ta?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From afar, a thunder-like sound rang out, and the shout shook the heavens.</span></p>
