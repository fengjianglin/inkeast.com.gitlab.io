 <p>Chapter 606: News of Cang Lan!</p> 
 <p>The veil of night quietly fell. In the middle of the training field in the Illusion of Demons, a huge bonfire had been set up, and neatly placed all around it were all kinds of meat and sauces.</p> 
 <p>As Leng Liushuang was in her busy work mode, one delicious dish after another was brought to the banquet tables, waiting for their moment to be enjoyed.</p> 
 <p>“Mo Ka, Shi Kui, how long ago did I tell you guys to go and buy some Blossom Wine? If you don’t go now, don’t even think about eating any of these later!” roared Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The two guys in question who were sneaking food hurriedly ran out, their mouths so full that they couldn’t even reply.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Fei! When are we going to light the fire? The food’s going cold!” Holding a torch, Wu Chi looked very eager. He had to go through fierce competition to earn the role of igniting the bonfire, but Bai Xiaofei seemed to be purposefully delaying the moment, not letting him do it even though it was already dark.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the rush? Not everyone has arrived yet!” Bai Xiaofei prepared a reasonable excuse.</p> 
 <p>Helpless, Wu Chi gave a long sigh and then stood there like a piece of wood. Who could imagine that the second-year killer star would be so easily intimidated?</p> 
 <p>That’s right. Wu Chi had risen to fame since the grand celebration. His outstanding performance made him a celebrity among the second-years, and some even compared him with the previous generation of Newcomer Kings.</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er and Lin Li shuttled back and forth around the training field helping out Leng Liushuang and also arranging the venue while they were at it.</p> 
 <p>As for getting Bai Xiaofei to assist… Who could even order him around?</p> 
 <p>“Lil’ Bai<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>, not enough sauce! Go to the kitchen and get some!” Leng Liuying gave Bai Xiaofei a new nickname. It was then quickly popularized.</p> 
 <p>“Lil’ Bai, go out there and receive people. What if they don’t know where we are?” said Hu Xian’er coldly.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei hurriedly ran out and looked around. In the end, he simply pushed the work onto Huskie, leaving it at the entrance as a welcoming dog…</p> 
 <p>“Lil’ Bai, if you keep standing around doing nothing, you don’t have to eat tonight!” Leng Liuli refused to be outdone as well. A roar frightened Bai Xiaofei into bringing the trays to the tables.</p> 
 <p>Well, there <em>were still people who could order him around…</em></p> 
 <p>Amidst the bustle, the people invited by Fang Ye arrived one after another. Everyone was an acquaintance, so the formalities were skipped and everyone started helping out right after they arrived.</p> 
 <p>“Light the fire!” shouted Bai Xiaofei excitedly after everyone was accounted for.</p> 
 <p>An even more excited Wu Chi ran to the bonfire and shoved the torch into it. Then, the torch went out…</p> 
 <p>“What the hell?? This is bullying!” Wu Chi stomped his feet. Laughter broke out from the crowd.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei kept a straight face but was also laughing inside. <em>That’s for ‘robbing’ the ignition job! Let’s see how you’re gonna do it if this lord doesn’t let you!</em></p> 
 <p>“Xian’er.” Bai Xiaofei grinned and looked at Hu Xian’er, who was trying to hide her smile.</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er gently snapped her fingers, and a flame flew out of her hand and slowly landed on the bonfire. The next second, the small fire spread and lit the whole bonfire.</p> 
 <p>“Music!”</p> 
 <p>The moment when the bonfire lit up, Fang Ye, who was in charge of music, poured his energy into the oversized reverberation equipment in front of him. Cheerful music sounded and everyone started dancing…</p> 
 <p>The training for the Blossom Competition proved useful again at that moment. The Leng triplets, Hu Xian’er, Lin Li, and Qin Lingyan warmed the field with their swaying figures, beautiful singing, and dreamy illusions, turning the small gathering into a near-grand performance. Fortunately, Wu Chi came up with a timely crude roar that he thought to be singing, and then the party became an impromptu vent of emotions. Some even confided their feelings out loud in words.</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei had said, the pressure had been too heavy recently. He had called everyone to vent before getting themselves ready for new challenges…</p> 
 <p>After getting tired, Bai Xiaofei sat down quietly in a corner. Looking at the group of people laughing by the campfire, a heartfelt smile bloomed on his face, but it was quickly replaced by sorrow out of nowhere.</p> 
 <p>Everyone was here, the Demon of Illusions, the Savage Class, Qin Lingyan, Bai Ye, Chu Tianyi, Feng Wuhen, Lu Lingyun… All the people familiar with him were here, except only one person.</p> 
 <p>“Thinking of Xue Ying?” Hu Xian’er, who had unknowingly appeared behind, slowly sat down next to him.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, but what can I do about it anyway? Big Sister Xue is gone.” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly fixed his expression and donned a smile.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei announced that Xue Ying had died in battle. He didn’t tell anyone about her relationship with the Shadow Death because he didn’t want her to be the subject of public resentment, even though she did hurt everyone.</p> 
 <p>“You can deceive others, but you can’t deceive me. When we found you that day, her smell still lingered on your body very strongly, but we didn’t find her anywhere around. She didn’t die, and you are hiding something from everyone. For example, her relationship with Shadow Death,” said Hu Xian’er slowly.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei froze.</p> 
 <p>“But you don’t have to worry, I didn’t tell anyone, and I don’t care if she is a Shadow Death member, because it has nothing to do with me. I only know that she saved you, which is enough.”</p> 
 <p>Looking at her beautiful smile as she said words that he could never expect, Bai Xiaofei was once again speechless. This was the second time that he was impressed by her open-mindedness. But he was not stupid. How could someone be open-minded about this kind of thing? This so-called open-mindedness was actually her tolerance for love…</p> 
 <p>“Sorry…” Bai Xiaofei uttered, his tears falling down.</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er didn’t say anything to this. She rested her head on his shoulder and hugged his arm tightly.</p> 
 <p>For a long time, the two people didn’t speak and just sat there in silence.</p> 
 <p>“Remember that person named Cang Lan whose whereabouts you asked Fang Ye to investigate?” Suddenly, Hu Xian’er mentioned a name that shook Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Why? Is there news?” He looked at her, his voice filled with pleasant surprise.</p> 
 <p>“In fact, this information has always been with us, we just overlooked it.” Hu Xian’er looked at the triplets who were chatting with Feng Wuhen, and said something that shocked Bai Xiaofei for half a day, “Cang Lan is those three’s god-grandfather…”</p>
