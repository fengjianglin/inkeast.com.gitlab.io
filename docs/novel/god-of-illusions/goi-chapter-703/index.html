 <p>Chapter 703: Demon King!</p> 
 <p>“Easy, easy! My bones are very brittle, I won’t be able to fix myself if they snap!” complained the prisoner who was tightly bound by A’First.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, all done.” A’First clapped his hands in satisfaction before going to stand behind Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>A golden flame dancing between his fingers, Bai Xiaofei walked slowly towards the pale undead with a sinister smirk. After so long, he finally met one who was afraid of death!</p> 
 <p>“My lord, please don’t hurt me! Your fire is too scary! Keep your distance! You don’t have to force me to say anything! You don’t even have to tie me up! I’ll answer everything!” the undead fired his mouth off like a machine gun, vigorously expressing his stance.</p> 
 <p>“Very well, start with your name,” said Bai Xiaofei with a smile, but the flame on his palm showed no sign of fading.</p> 
 <p>“I’m Yue Xiaofei﻿<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>! My lord, please don’t!“ Yue Xiaofei felt his soul tremble just by looking at the flame.</p> 
 <p>“Yue Xiaofei, huh? I remember you ambushed me just now. Wanna give me an explanation?”</p> 
 <p>If Yue Xiaofei could still sweat, he would be soaked right now. <em>Damn it, how do I even answer this?! Honestly say that I wanted to kill you?!</em></p> 
 <p>“I just wanted to test your strength, really!” Yue Xiaofei finally squeezed out.</p> 
 <p>Interestingly, Bai Xiaofei believed him. Not because of Yue Xiaofei’s face that was incapable of making expressions nor how clever his lie was. The present situation was just too peculiar that it made Bai Xiaofei sensitive toward everything.</p> 
 <p>“Test? Test what?” Bai Xiaofei frowned, not knowing that he was completely fooled by his own judgment.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the trembling Yue Xiaofei was shaken. <em>I got away with it?! Is this person’s intelligence negative? He actually believed my lie??</em></p> 
 <p>“Do you know about parallel world theory?” Fully turning on his liar mode, Yue Xiaofei started with a concept that he believed would give him an absolute advantage.</p> 
 <p>Little did he know that Bai Xiaofei already had some knowledge in this field.</p> 
 <p>“I know.”</p> 
 <p>Two light words stupefied Yue Xiaofei. It took him a long time before his brain could adapt.</p> 
 <p><em>What the hell?! What’s with this boy? He even knows about this? What happened to this world while I was dead?!</em></p> 
 <p>“I just wanted to test whether you are the chosen one of this world!” Yue Xiaofei bit the bullet and continued with his lie, filled with anxiety as he did so.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, he was seen through this time.</p> 
 <p>“Cut the crap and get to the point. I’ll give you a chance, twenty words. Get me interested in twenty words and I’ll give you another chance. It’s not like you are anything special compared with the other undead,” Bai Xiaofei said.</p> 
 <p>Yue Xiaofei was appalled.</p> 
 <p><em>Motherf*cker! And I thought he’s an idiot! How did he suddenly become smart?!</em></p> 
 <p>Horrified in his heart, Yue Xiaofei brainstormed. The next sentence concerned his life!</p> 
 <p>“I know what the biggest danger in this place is, and I even know its weakness!”</p> 
 <p>Driven by survival instinct, one’s potential was really limitless.</p> 
 <p>Everyone exchanged glances. Bai Xiaofei smiled, and the golden flame on his palm vanished.</p> 
 <p>“Now explain what’s going on with you people. You know what will happen if you lie,” Bai Xiaofei threatened.</p> 
 <p>Only now did Yue Xiaofei realize that he had met a devil and not a fool.</p> 
 <p>“I can’t tell you about our detailed history because I will be vanquished immediately if I do. You only need to know that we are from another world.”</p> 
 <p>“Many years ago – I don’t know how long exactly, a large number of people in our world received a mission and came here. They all thought this to be a land of benefits, but it turned out to be a trap. An expert wanted to use our lives to refine a weapon, and the people in your world were also part of his plan.”</p> 
 <p>“But even that expert couldn’t have expected that the information they got about this world was false. A higher existence designed everything with the aim of getting rid of that dishonest expert.”</p> 
 <p>“That battle was earth-shaking. We wanted to live and leave here. Therefore, both your world and that expert were our enemies, as were the other parties. I once heard that a group war was the most terrible war anyone could experience. That war confirmed it.”</p> 
 <p>“At the end, that expert knew he had no hope to survive. He sacrificed everything – his soul, his life, and his energy, to summon a demon from another world! No one was a match for it. People died like flies. Not only that, the army of that demon proceeded to invade this world.”</p> 
 <p>“Just when everyone thought that the world would end, a person of your world, one who never stood out during the whole war, suddenly rose. No one knew what happened to him, but when he acted, countless chains fell from the sky and sealed the demon king.”</p> 
 <p>“After that, we had a final battle with the demon army. I remembered that when I died, there were very few demons left. I don’t know what happened after that.”</p> 
 <p>Upon finishing his story, Yue Xiaofei gazed at Bai Xiaofei. Every word was true this time.</p> 
 <p>The audience entered a long silence to digest the information. It was a bit too much.</p> 
 <p>The Snow Kingdom had a history of 500 years, but there wasn’t a historical record of any such event in the Holy Snow Mountain, so that war must have happened even earlier.</p> 
 <p>In the historical records Bai Xiaofei had read in Starnet Academy, the first generation of puppet masters began over 400 years ago. In other words, it was still a question of whether the experts in Yue Xiaofei’s story could be called puppet masters.</p> 
 <p>Was it actually an era of fighters? Or, was there once other forms of power in the Starnet Continent?</p> 
 <p>No one could provide the answers unless the reincarnation resurrected people of Starnet Continent as well. But so far, they did not show any signs of rising.</p> 
 <p>“Do the roars come from that demon king in your story?” Leng Liuli asked with tension in her eyes.</p> 
 <p>“Yes. I can’t think of anything else with this kind of power except it. But that seal should still be effective, or else this place wouldn’t be this calm,” Yue Xiaofei replied with a sigh of relief. This might be the best news for him yet. Otherwise, even resurrection would be useless.</p> 
 <p>Of course, he didn’t know that his resurrection was thanks to the demon king…</p> 
 <p>“What is its weakness?” Bai Xiaofei frowned. He had come to the conclusion the demon king had not been defeated at all, and it was even possible that there was no one in Starnet Continent who was capable of this deed.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, the weakness that Yue Xiaofei mentioned was probably the only opportunity.</p> 
 <p>Unconsciously, Bai Xiaofei had taken it upon himself to destroy the demon king. Perhaps certain things were decided by fate from the beginning, just like how Bai Xiaofei already felt that a battle with the demon king was inevitable.</p> 
 <p>“Back when that man completed the seal, he left a message: ‘The moment the power of faith and the flame that can burn everything combine marks the end of the demon king.’” Yue Xiaofei solemnly looked at Bai Xiaofei. “I know what the power of faith is, and your flame can be considered one that can burn everything!”</p> 
 <p>Everyone was stunned, and then their eyes gathered upon Bai Xiaofei and Golden Feather.</p> 
 <p><em>Indeed, a flame that can burn even the soul, what else can’t it burn?</em></p> 
 <p><em>But, how did a person accurately predict what would happen hundreds of years later? Just how powerful is he?! Even Revelation can’t do that!</em></p> 
 <p>“I don’t want to assume such a heavy responsibility. Let alone the demon king, I don’t even know what to do with my current enemy.” Bai Xiaofei smiled wryly. He didn’t get carried away by Yue Xiaofei’s words.</p> 
 <p>He wouldn’t refuse to be a world savior, but he would never take the initiative to do it. Putting himself at risk would be unfair to the people around him. He wasn’t alone, and he didn’t live for just himself.</p> 
 <p>“If you absorb enough vitality, you will be completely resurrected, right?” Bai Xiaofei suddenly said.</p> 
 <p>“Yes!” Yue Xiaofei confirmed in high spirits, his eyes wide with hope.</p> 
 <p>“One last question. If you can answer it, I don’t mind taking you out of this place with me.” Bai Xiaofei grew serious. He stressed each word, “How do we get out of here?”</p> 
 <p>The question led them back to the main topic. Whether the origin of the roar or the identity of the undead, Bai Xiaofei wanted to know about them for only one purpose – to survive. And leaving this place was the best way to ensure that.</p> 
 <p>As for the demon king, Bai Xiaofei wouldn’t bother with him unless the circumstances required it. Fated as he felt, now was not the time. He still didn’t even know what the power of faith was. Even if the sky was falling, there were still many people much more powerful than him to shoulder it, at least for now.</p> 
 <p>“This entire place is covered by the energy of the demon king. You can’t get in or out. There are only two ways to leave: build a teleportation formation or kill the demon king,” Yue Xiaofei said with a hint of helplessness.</p>
