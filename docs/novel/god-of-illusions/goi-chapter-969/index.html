 <p>Chapter 969: Into the Palace!</p> 
 <p>After the short noon break, the remaining contestants gathered at the central square. Compared to the fifty thousand-odd from before, the current number could be described as pitiful.</p> 
 <p>“Our afternoon test is going to be quite peculiar. In the eyes of most people, it may even be impossible, but on the other hand, those who pass are likely going to make it into the chosen group, because I can’t say for sure that enough people for our quota will pass.”</p> 
 <p>On the platform was not Ye Tong, but a spirited officer who was obviously more friendly.</p> 
 <p>“The content is simple: Using your own way, get into the palace! You can sneak in, you can find connections to help, etc. In short, as long as you enter the palace, you pass!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the contestants stared in shock. <em>Get into the palace?! Does dreaming that I enter it count?! Let alone the palace, just walking out of here will get us arrested by the city patrol!</em></p> 
 <p>“Is there a time limit?” Bai Xiaofei raised a question just as despair was getting to everyone, his calm expression in sharp contrast with them.</p> 
 <p>“Before dawn tomorrow,” replied the officer.</p> 
 <p>The audience exclaimed at this, while Bai Xiaofei only smiled calmly. He who had broken into the forbidden place of the Snow Kingdom did not fear the Moonlight Palace!</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go,” Bai Xiaofei said to his group and turned to leave. Zhuang Shuo and the muscular men hurriedly followed.</p> 
 <p>The test began just like that. Despite having complained nonstop about how impossible it was, the contestants started to brainstorm once the officer left. Seeing Bai Xiaofei’s group leave, they panicked and rushed out of the camp without any concrete plans.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei returned to the gate of the camp right after the contestants left.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, what are we doing this for?” Zhuang Shuo couldn’t help but ask.</p> 
 <p>The rest of the group also looked at Bai Xiaofei curiously.</p> 
 <p>“Is this your first day in Moonlight? This is the imperial city. Running out without getting arrested? Do you think the soldiers are blind?” Bai Xiaofei dismissed Zhuang Shuo, as if the person who had just confidently headed out wasn’t him.</p> 
 <p>“But you just…” Zhuang Shuo gulped in fear. If Bai Xiaofei hadn’t stopped them just now, they would have rushed into the streets!</p> 
 <p>“If I didn’t act confident, would they run out after us? The slots are limited while there are still so many contestants, so they have to hurry.” Bai Xiaofei chortled evilly and strode back into the camp. “Let’s go back to sleep. We’ll gather at dark!”</p> 
 <p>The three hundred muscular men stood at the entrance looking at one another, not knowing what to say.</p> 
 <p><em>Our boss is… quite a shameless character!</em></p> 
 <p>While Bai Xiaofei’s group rested, the whole capital had become a mess. The patrols suddenly grew busy because of the contestants. As patrols, they couldn’t care less about the contest, and since they hadn’t received any new instructions from their superiors, arresting men who shouldn’t be on the streets was what they did.</p> 
 <p>A large-scale, passionate cat-and-mouse chase occurred in the whole city and raised all kinds of discussions.</p> 
 <p>The contestants who left the camp all started to regret their hasty decision. They had expected consequences, but they didn’t think it would hurt this badly. Moreover, they could not understand why Bai Xiaofei’s group had been the first to rush out, but they became the ones who caused the first wave of chaos.</p> 
 <p>However, some of those contestants stood out. While men weren’t valued in Moonlight, there were still many male puppet masters, and those with hiding and transforming abilities survived the first round of hunts. At the same time, some contestants survived using their brains.</p> 
 <p>It didn’t take long for the storm in the city to gradually calm. The patrols also got to relax a little. This calm lasted until the sun went down…</p> 
 <p>Sitting cross-legged in his bed, Bai Xiaofei opened his eyes with satisfaction while Blackie slowly emerged next to him. An afternoon of observation had allowed him to figure out the patrols’ routine and schedule. After all, no one would care about a wandering stray cat.</p> 
 <p>“Get up! We’ll go to the palace and have a big meal!” shouted Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The next second, all the men in the warehouse bounced out of their beds. Except for Bai Xiaofei, no one had really slept as they were busy thinking about how to pry open the palace gates, all to no avail. They were better at using brawn rather than brains…</p> 
 <p>“Boss! We are ready!” Zhuang Shuo was the first to come over in excitement.</p> 
 <p>“Zhu Chunyang seems to have lost himself in the love village. I really don’t understand. What is there about that little girl that makes him forget everything?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei felt something was missing when Zhu Chunyang was not around. After all, he was used to making fun of the guy…</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, can’t wait for him. In any case, I still have his dark secret. I’m sure he wouldn’t dare to leave our alliance.” Bai Xiaofei chuckled and summoned Huskie, then said seriously to the muscular group, “Remember every word I’m going to say next. If one thing goes wrong, we’ll all be eliminated!”</p> 
 <p>The men instantly pricked up their ears.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei then told them of the plan in the next thirty minutes, then the group officially started moving.</p> 
 <p>Using Huskie’s Mark and Mimicry, they transformed into a group of Moonlight’s capital patrol. Over the next twenty minutes, they left the camp in batches to patrol the city like real guards.</p> 
 <p>In the vast imperial city, the addition of 300 guards was like adding a drop of water to the sea, the possibility of being detected was extremely low. This little trick allowed them to pass the first ordeal of leaving the camp safely!</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, as the veil of night fell, the contestants who had survived the day also came out from hiding. For them, this was the last chance!</p> 
 <p>However, their gambler’s mentality would have to face the alertness of the patrols, who couldn’t be more experienced with ‘bad things are almost always done in the dark!’</p>
