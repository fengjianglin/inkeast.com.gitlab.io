 <p><span style>“You’ve come….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’re you doing here?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>When they saw each other, both of them spoke at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, the surrounding female students held their breath because besides being prying, they wanted to watch the show between two of their idols….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have something to ask you….” Bai Xiaofei paused for a moment and stared right at Hu Xian’er.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What can’t you wait for tomorrow to say? Did you have to trespass into the female dorms?” Bai Xiaofei was unable to discern if she was happy or angry from her expression because his ability to perceive others became useless before Hu Xian’er.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t wait, so I came over.” Bai Xiaofei’s direct words caused stars to appear in the eyes of all the surrounding female students because such a show that they’d dreamt of had actually occurred before their eyes!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then go ahead and ask me.” Hu Xian’er seemed to be extremely calm while the expression on her face didn’t change in the slightest. As for the situation in her heart, only she knew the answer to that….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’re too many people here, I can’t bring myself to ask you here.” These words weren’t a lie at all because if Bai Xiaofei were to ask her directly before so many people, then he would probably die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under Hu Xian’er’s claws….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Forget it, if you can’t ask it then I don’t want to hear it.” Hu Xian’er spoke slowly before assuming a posture that showed intent to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’m sorry!” His voice hadn’t finished resounding out in the air when Bai Xiaofei took a vigorous stride to charge to Hu Xian’er’s side, and then he didn’t say a single thing before directly lifting her off her feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a time, all of the female students were in an uproar once more, and various exclaims of shock resounded throughout the entire dormitory area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me go!” Hu Xian’er shouted in rage, but she didn’t struggle and just stared directly at Bai Xiaofei. Actually, if she did resist, then 10 Bai Xiaofei’s wouldn’t be enough….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll let you go in a moment!” As soon as he finished, Bai Xiaofei seemed as if he’d taken stimulants as he ran madly while holding Hu Xian’er in his arms. In the blink of an eye, they vanished from the fields of vision of everyone, and during the entire process, the sharp cries of the female students had never stopped….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, there’s nobody here. You can put me down now, right?” Hu Xian’er’s voice was farm less icy cold when compared to before, and Bai Xiaofei even faintly discerned a trace of embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei had run all the way until the edge of the academy before running out into the Infinite Mountain Range through the path the members of the Savage Class usually left the academy from.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was precisely because of this embarrassment that Bai Xiaofei felt even more nervous….</span></p>
 <p><span style>It couldn’t be helped at all!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because it looked more and more like his guess was correct!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei whose heartbeat had madly risen to over 100 beats a minute put Hu Xian’er down with a flushed face, and he couldn’t help but gulp down a mouthful of saliva from the warm and soft feeling that came from his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This isn’t like you. Shouldn’t you be sneaking around to come see me? Why did you become so bold today?” Hu Xian’er’s tone carried deep sourness because after the matter of the conflict that day, Bai Xiaofei had come looking for her a few times under the guise of repaying her for her help. She was able to discern that Bai Xiaofei wanted to understand her, but the way he snuck around to see her caused her to be rather displeased.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I clearly should be the closest person to him!!!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“That…. I….” As she looked at Bai Xiaofei’s hesitant appearance, Hu Xian’er couldn’t help but reveal slight contempt and the embarrassment that just arose in her heart had vanished along with this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you say you have something to ask me? Where’s the courage you had from before?” Hu Xian’er turned around to look at Bai Xiaofei with an impatient expression, and if Bai Xiaofei didn’t speak up, then she would absolutely turn around and leave right away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, she didn’t know how violent the activity in Bai Xiaofei’s heart at this moment was.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ask?!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>How should I ask?!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Would I be beaten up if I’m wrong?!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s fine if I’m beaten up, but what if she hates me?!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the f*ck! Should I ask her or not!!!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What if I’m right?!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>How would she answer me?!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What should I do?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei felt that his mind was already on the verge of exploding. But, Hu Xian’er had grunted coldly and intended to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll do it!” As he stopped Hu Xian’er from leaving by pulling her hand, the anxious Bai Xiaofei spat out three words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she turned around once more, Hu Xian’er brows were tightly knit together, but Bai Xiaofei saw a face that revealed unique beauty instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was truly too perfect, perfect to the point that any expression she revealed was capable of causing others to fall for her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei gulped down a mouthful of saliva. He’d finally found a ‘suitable’ way to ask her, and he said with a voice that sounded as if he was afraid of startling a tiny animal, “We…. Have we met before coming to Starnet Academy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, it was precisely words like these that caused Hu Xian’er to be instantly stunned on the spot while her feelings surged in her heart, and her beautiful face that was extremely icy cold just a second ago revealed a trace of an upset expression.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How long have I waited for this moment?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>How long more could I have waited for it?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>You scum! You finally know?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As she cursed Bai Xiaofei in her heart with every single curse she could think of, Hu Xian’er glanced faintly at Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.” A light word contained all the injustice she’d suffered, and it was Bai Xiaofei who was stunned this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regardless of if it was Hu Xian’er answer or reaction, there was too much information contained within it, and it was to the extent Bai Xiaofei didn’t dare continue thinking about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earlier, Bai Xiaofei extremely urgently desired to know the answer. But, when he really approached thee answer, he was afraid instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you have something to ask, then ask frankly. What’re you afraid of when even I dare to answer your questions? Are you a man or not?” Hu Xian’er interrupted the hesitant Bai Xiaofei and directly roared at him while her eyes stared fixedly at him. Her face carried a blush while her eyes were filled with a firm expression.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I can’t wait any longer!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If you dare to continue delaying it today, then I guarantee to make you fall here!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to ask you if I did something that was excessive against you!? Did I take something from you!?” Bai Xiaofei roared as well because of this. As far as he was concerned, the way he asked was sufficiently tactful, but Hu Xian’er felt it was direct enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes! You did something that was very excessive to me! You took the thing that’s most precious to me!” Hu Xian’er roared once more while two rows of clear tears flowed down uncontrollable as she roared madly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t cry after being bullied by Bai Xiaofei, she didn’t cry when she noticed there were numerous other women following by Bai Xiaofei’s side, and she didn’t cry when she found out that Bai Xiaofei had forgotten everything. But, she cried when everything was made clear….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hu Xian’er didn’t know why she cried, but her tears just flowed down uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The boundless grievance in her heart seemed to have completely erupted at this moment, and all the feelings that were suppressed in her heart had surged out as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he looked at Hu Xian’er who cried soundlessly, Bai Xiaofei had the feeling that his heart was shattering for no reason or rhyme.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next moment, his hands raised up uncontrollably and light embraced Hu Xian’er in his arms. At the instant their bodies pressed against each other, a strand of flamed blazed in their bodies at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll let you know what you did to me!!!” Hu Xian’er pushed Bai Xiaofei before shouting ‘fiercely’. In the next second, the clothes on her body automatically fell off, and under the rays of moonlight, this flawless beauty caused Bai Xiaofei to forget to blink.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Subsequently, Bai Xiaofei who hadn’t wrapped his head around what had happened heard the sound of cloth being torn into pieces, and then a cool breeze swept over and caused Bai Xiaofei to tremble slightly for the cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next second, a burning body had already pressed down on him….</span></p>
