<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>After hearing Bai Xiaofei’s words, the four immediately jumped away like cats that had their tails stepped on. Then, they gazed at Bai Xiaofei expectantly.</p>
 <p>“Take your time to gather your thoughts. We will all be waiting here,” Chu Liuyun spoke like an extremely obedient child. Her bearing immediately shifted as her eyes opened wide to make herself look like a cute loli, resulting in a loli with an elder sister flair to it.</p>
 <p>Given a choice, Chu Liuyun would be Bai Xiaofei’s as well. Unfortunately, he couldn’t allow that to happen and only had himself to blame for not having reached Revelation’s level where he could act in a completely unrestrained manner.</p>
 <p>“Oh…are we not attending any classes?” Bai Xiaofei asked meekly. He had a feeling he had come to the wrong place.</p>
 <p>“Classes?” Chu Liuyun cried out accidentally when she heard that. She quickly removed the odd expression she had on her face. The term “attending classes” felt so unfamiliar to her. Or to be precise, the Demon of Illusions’ method of attending classes was completely unlike what Bai Xiaofei had imagined.</p>
 <p>“About that…due to our numbers, the way we hold our classes is rather unique.”</p>
 <p>Chu Liuyun gulped and tried covering up her nervousness. Bai Xiaofei silently gazed at her, waiting for her to explain how unique it was.</p>
 <p>“Cough, cough. Big Sister Min, maybe you should be the one to explain our classes,” Chu Liuyun stepped aside and passed the responsibility to Lei Min instead. She was truly too embarrassed to say it. Bai Xiaofei could see a trace of awkwardness surfacing on Lei Min’s face.</p>
 <p><em>Holy shit. Please, please don’t be something that will drive me nuts again.</em></p>
 <p>Lei Min was older than them, and her age showed in her emotional intelligence, which was higher than the others. After clearing her throat, she said, “The Demon of Illusions has two types of classes. The classes related to the major are taught by me. But we don’t have any strict classifications like the other faculties. Therefore, I usually conduct the classes in a one-on-one basis. Furthermore, we don’t have a fixed schedule. Just look for me anytime you have a question. We will be living together everyday anyway,” Lei Min explained with a smile, but her words caused Bai Xiaofei to blank out.</p>
 <p>“Living together?” Bai Xiaofei cried out, but he was able to stop himself from speaking his thoughts.</p>
 <p><em>What the hell is this?</em></p>
 <p>“Yeah. Since we have so many empty spaces around here, we had converted several classrooms into dormitory rooms. Don’t worry. They are all in good condition. You can move in at any time.”</p>
 <p>“Yeah! They are in good condition! Apart from the dormitory, we even have our own kitchen! Liushuang is a very good cook. We do not need to eat outside like the other faculties. This is a benefit we get because of the lower number of students here!” Yun Sheng said, and the earnest manner in which he spoke made it clear he was being serious. But at the same time, it also looked like he was trying to hide something. And that was completely seen through by Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p><em>Benefit? Pfft! You guys are probably trying to save up on food and accommodation, right?</em></p>
 <p>“So that means I can’t keep staying in my dormitory anymore?” Bai Xiaofei asked with a frown. In truth, he did not want to leave dormitory room 807. If he left, it would be hard for him to see Mo Ka and the others in the future.</p>
 <p>“What? Are you suffering any losses staying with us? Know that our dormitories are all joined. We can easily have long pillow talks. Isn’t that wonderful?” Once again, Chu Liuyun used her trump card and bent down before Bai Xiaofei. With a pair of eyes no man could say no to, she looked straight into his eyes.</p>
 <p>“But moving will take—”</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. Moving won’t be a problem. So long as you agree to it, you will be able to move in by tonight.”</p>
 <p>Before Bai Xiaofei could complete his sentence, Chu Liuyun generously offered to take care of everything, not giving him any chance to reject.</p>
 <p>“So are you willing to move in or not?” She spoke slowly, but her voice was filled with threat. The many faces Chu Liuyun had were already making Bai Xiaofei weary.</p>
 <p>“Ok—”</p>
 <p>“Yun Sheng! Bring Liuying along and start moving his stuff. No food for you if you can’t return before dinner!”</p>
 <p>Again, Bai Xiaofei was interrupted. Before he could finish his sentence, Chu Liuyun had already arranged everything. It seemed like they were really afraid he would flee! Wiping his cold sweat, Bai Xiaofei gulped and looked at Lei Min again.</p>
 <p>“How about the other classes? I heard that other than the major, there are also secondary courses in Starnet Academy. The academy isn’t joking around when claiming that a student will be trained in all aspects, right?”</p>
 <p>Facing a new question, Lei Min assumed a serious expression again. That’s right. She was was going to feed Bai Xiaofei bullshit with a straight face.</p>
 <p>“Ah, trust me. We are definitely unique and unlike all others,” Lei Min guaranteed, yet Bai Xiaofei’s eyes were filled with disbelief. He sat there silently waiting for Lei Min to continue.</p>
 <p>“Cough, cough. Due to our low numbers, we have high flexibility. Anything you want to learn, you can visit the classrooms of other faculties and listen in. You don’t need to do the homework yet you get to learn the knowledge. Isn’t that great? Only we are allowed to do this in the entire academy!”</p>
 <p>Sure enough, she was bullshitting with a straight face. The truth would be something like this: due to their low numbers, the teachers of the secondary courses were completely unwilling to waste their time conducting classes here. Therefore, they would have to listen in during the classes of the other faculties.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was able to instantly figure out the hidden meaning behind their words. At the same time, his understanding of these people grew as well. This was a group that would do anything for the sake of preserving this faculty.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, escape was already impossible for Bai Xiaofei, but he couldn’t bring himself to sit back and accept his fate. And thus, he started altering a certain plan that he had been forming in his mind.</p>
 <p><em>You guys have a lot of extra spaces, right? Well, we can’t let that go to waste, can we?</em> Bai Xiaofei thought, the corner of his mouth curving upward to form a grin.</p>
 <p><em>The so-called grade evaluation is merely a competition in making money, making points, and fighting. That doesn’t seem too hard at all.</em></p>
 <p>Fortunately, none here knew what Bai Xiaofei was thinking. Otherwise, he would probably end up as a human experiment. Not hard? He had no idea how much they had been hurting their brains for a solution.</p>
 <p>“I can try to help with the grade evaluation. But I have a condition,” Bai Xiaofei said with a resolute gaze. When they saw the look on his face, the flames in their hearts were ignited.</p>
 <p>“Say it. As long as you can do it, even if you want the stars in the sky, I will think of a way to pluck them down!” Lei Min could no longer keep her calm.</p>
 <p>“My condition is nothing difficult. It’s simple. I only require that all of you listen to me!”</p>
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei said that, they all blanked.</p>
 <p><em>Just that simple? Is that even a&nbsp;</em>condition<em>? Isn’t that a given?</em></p>
 <p>“Just that?” Lei Min was in disbelief. She had already braced herself for a difficult condition.</p>
 <p>“Don’t ever think it is simple. I want obedience, complete obedience!”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was probably the only student in the academy who dared to speak like that to the deputy of the faculty on his first day. However, he was completely at ease, his confidence backed by his ability to turn things around for them!</p>
