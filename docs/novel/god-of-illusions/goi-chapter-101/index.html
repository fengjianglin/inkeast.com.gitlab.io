<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>After he sent away the young women from the second batch, the third batch walked in with grins on their faces, and the hearts of the members of the Savage Class that hadn’t had their chance instantly rose to their throats.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This sort of feeling of anticipation was always capable of causing one to become extremely excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because there aren’t many pure frost energy puppets, so we didn’t create them in bulk. I’ve only brought three puppets over this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Frost Chain. It carries the effect of frost strengthening, and its supplementary ability is the Icethorn Armor. It’s capable of creating an armor completely condensed from ice, and it reflects close ranged attacks in the form of thorns of ice. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Frost Gloves. They are created from the fur of a Frostwolf King, and it carried the effect of frost strengthening. Its supplementary ability is the Hand of Ice, and its capable of freezing anything that comes into contact with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Snow Queen’s Staff, it carries the effect of frost strengthening, and its supplementary ability is called Frost Rain. Once activated, it will summon frost arrows within a certain area around the user before attacking all enemies within its range. I personally recommend choose this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though he was prepared since the beginning, Chen Hui couldn’t help but gulp down a mouthful of saliva when he heard Feng Wuhen’s introduction because it was the first time he’d seen so many violet-grade puppets, and he couldn’t control himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t for his arrival in the Savage Class, his Snowfreeze Pearl might be the only violet-grade puppet he possessed in his entire lifetime….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want the second, Frost Gloves.” Chen Hui’s choice caused everyone to be slightly stunned, but no one could refute what he said next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to make the puppet my mother left to me be my main offensive puppet forever and not allow it to be replaced by a puppet of the same type.” Chen Hui’s eyes carried a trace of persistence, and it was the type of persistence that wouldn’t be swayed in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Spirited and filled with comradeship. Everyone from your Savage Class really is extraordinary.” Feng Wuhen spoke in a timely manner, and his ability in flattery was comparable to Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Student from the Assassin Stream. I’ve brought over two puppets for you. Actually, there are numerous puppets for the Assassin Stream. But, once I saw these two, I knew that you’d surely not chose another because to a certain extent, you can be said to be fortunate!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Hang who’d gotten slightly excited from Feng Wuhen’s introduction looked along the direction Feng Wuhen pointed at, and he saw a pair of simple and unadorned shoes and a puppet core.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shadowflash Shoes, the pride of the number one divine smith, Pi Nuocao. No more than three are created every single year, and its effect is to flash towards to designated location while entering into the Vanish state at the same time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vanish!</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the most fundamental abilities of an Assassin Stream puppet master was concealment, whereas, there was a total of three types of concealment in the continent. They were respectively Imitation, Stealth, and Vanish.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imitation was also called simulation, and the assassin avoided the field of vision of others by merging into the surroundings. But, the assassin’s movement speed while in this state was normally extremely slow, so this was the most inferior type of concealment and the easiest to detect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Stealth was the reliance on various special objects for the assassin to hide within before launching a lethal attack at the essential moment!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amongst the three types of concealment, the strongest was Vanish. Under the state of Vanish, &nbsp;it was basically impossible to detect the assassin. Moreover, the assassin could move freely while under this effect until the moment of attack!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Besides that, the Shadowflash Shoes didn’t just allow an assassin to enter the Vanish state, it carried the ability to flash, so it was really a bit too terrifying….</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shock on Wang Hang’s face clearly displayed all this, but this was merely his first shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Path of Assassins. This core carries the ability ‘The Path of Assassins’. After this ability is executed, you can choose a target, and the shields and armor worn on the target would lose all effect when attacked by you. Moreover, it will provide a boost to your attack based on the shield and armors worn by the target. Once the assassination is complete, the Path of Assassins can be used on another person!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll take both!” The person that spoke wasn’t Wang Hang but Bai Xiaofei who stood at the back because these two puppets allowed Bai Xiaofei to see the champion’s trophy of the New Student Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without any suspense, Wang Hang had absolutely instantly become the number one assassin amongst the new students! No one was capable of competing with him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, no one noticed that Xue Ying who sat at the back couldn’t refrain from gulping down a mouthful of saliva….</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Wang Hang, the next to be called was Zhu Nuo, and the anxious girl bounced right off the sofa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You asked me to choose puppets with healing abilities, so I brought you the work of the divine smith, Bai Hua.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Dawnstar Crown, it carries the ability Divine Realm. All friendly troops within its range that are selected by you will obtain the effect of Starlight Blessing, and it will continuously recover their injuries for five seconds.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A single puppet caused Zhu Nuo to instantly become awesome!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After dealing with another three people, the final batch of young women walked in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Sister from the Blitz Stream, your shoes are a part of the Martial Goddess Set, so I’ve found a few others from the set, and you can choose one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as he finished speaking, four young women revealed four puppets made of similar materials as Zhu Si’si’s shoes, and they were respectively a pair of bracers, light armor, a helmet, and a short sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Zhu Si’si seemed to have been prepared since the beginning, and she selected the bracers before Feng Wuhen could introduce them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Martial Goddess’s Bracers, and its effect, Shield Breaker!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Its supplementary ability was drag. It was capable of pulling the user to the target, and if the target’s body weight was lower than the user, then the target would be pulled over to the user instead!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Zhu Si’si, Xing Nan finally welcomed his chance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike Zhu Si’si who was a little rich lady that already possessed a violet-grade puppet, Xing Nan’s first puppet was only at the yellow-grade, so the requirements he gave Feng Wuhen was a puppet core as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Concentration, it can allow the might of you arrow to rise steadily to a limit of 10 times its might through accumulation of strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bulk Up, it’s similarly carried out through the accumulation of strength, but its effect just happens to be the opposite of Concentration. The Origin Energy arrow under the effect of Bulk Up would enlarge and transform from a single target type attack to an area of effect type.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Erupt, it adds the effect of eruption to the arrows you release. After it hits its target, the arrow will explode, and the might of the explosion is dependent upon the amount of Origin Energy used in this arrow.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Nan fell into a dilemma as soon as Feng Wuhen finished introducing them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erupt was something he would surely pick, but the problem was whether he should choose the first or the second. One was a single target attack, and the other targeted a group, and this was a problem that all Ranged Stream puppet masters were conflicted about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Choose Bulk Up. Fang Ye is sufficient for single target attacks. Moreover, the penetration force of your arrows isn’t low already.” In the end, Bai Xiaofei gave a suggestion, and Xing Nan considered it briefly before agreeing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without Bai Xiaofei, he wouldn’t have this chance to make a choice, so he had to think about the Savage Class as a whole at this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After these two people were done, the last person remaining, Fang Ye, gulped down a mouthful of saliva, whereas, there was no need to mention that the last young woman surely carried his puppet!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Brother, guess who called me over when I went back to the headquarters and mentioned that I was looking for a second puppet for a Rifle Stream puppet master?” Feng Wuhen kept every guessing for the first time when facing the final person, Fang Ye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Ye stared his eyes wide open as he spat out a few words with trembling lips. “Nan…. Nan Wusheng?”</span></p>
