 <p>Chapter 413: Next Time We Meet, We Will Be Enemies!</p> 
 <p>“Hand over my little sister, and I will spare your life,” standing in front of Bai Xiaofei, Fang Lei coldly demanded. Coiling around his left and right hands were visible winds and lightning arcs respectively. Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei was covered in injuries.</p> 
 <p>This was the Thunderstorm Bandits’ arrangements. Everything they had done was to pave the way for Fang Lei. However, they had over-complicated the problem as Nie Qing wasn’t heavily guarded as they had imagined. Bai Xiaofei was the only one guarding her. After all, Nie Qing wasn’t really captured…</p> 
 <p>“You must be the head of the Thunderstorm Bandits. So your gang’s name is based on your ability, that’s rather crude,” when Bai Xiaofei was saying this, his wounds all healed again. His almost indestructible nature gave Fang Lei a headache.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t think that I can’t kill you just because you have a strong recovery ability. I haven’t shown my real strength yet!” From the echoes of the explosions in Yun Mo’s direction, Fang Lei realized that he didn’t have much time. Moreover, he also had gotten word from Xia He to finish the battle as soon as possible. Therefore, he decided to get serious, even if it meant offending Starnet!</p> 
 <p>“Nie Qing isn’t in custody. You got our relationship wrong. If possible, we may not have to be enemies.” Bai Xiaofei disclosed something he’d not said when he realized that he couldn’t beat Fang Lei.</p> 
 <p>If he had said it earlier, they might have not started a fight at all, but it was different now. Fang Lei only thought that Bai Xiaofei was deliberately stalling.</p> 
 <p>“Since you won’t let my little sister go, don’t blame me for being rude!” The moment Fang Lei said this, the electric arcs around his hand suddenly intensified. The originally clear night sky became overcast.</p> 
 <p><em>What the hell?! Astronomical Level fighting capacity?!</em></p> 
 <p>The Astronomical Level was a recognition of the elites, generally referring to people who were so abnormally powerful that they could create a phenomenon by themselves. Under normal circumstances, this kind of attack was extremely difficult to defend against.</p> 
 <p>“Big brother! Stop!” At that critical moment, Nie Qing pushed open the door and shouted. The familiar voice instantly stopped Fang Lei.</p> 
 <p>However, seeing that Nie Qing couldn’t stand properly, Fang Lei erupted in anger.</p> 
 <p>“What did you do to my little sister?!” He arrived next to Bai Xiaofei in a flash and punched with his lightning-covered fist.</p> 
 <p>Raising his right hand to block Fang Lei’s punch, Bai Xiaofei heavily kicked at his waist, but the wind that enveloped Fang Lei’s body deflected his kick. At the same time, a sharp wind blade appeared in Fang Lei’s left hand as he stabbed down at Bai Xiaofei’s head.</p> 
 <p>“He rescued me!” cried Nie Qing at that grave juncture, but it was too late.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t expect Fang Lei to stop either. The Starnet Brilliance barrier appeared, allowing him to ignore Fang Lei’s attack. He grabbed the guy’s right hand and smashed him onto the ground with an abrupt shoulder throw. Getting on Fang Lei with a flip at the last second of the Starnet Brilliance’s barrier, Bai Xiaofei pierced through his protective wind barrier and grabbed his neck.</p> 
 <p>“If it weren’t for Nie Qing, you would be dead right now!” Panting heavily, Bai Xiaofei stared straight at Fang Lei with bloodshot eyes. The continuous impact of the lightning arcs burnt half his body both inside and out. If it wasn’t for his abnormal physique, he would have died…</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s clemency and Nie Qing’s earlier words doused Fang Lei’s fury. After Bai Xiaofei got up, he also stood up and looked at Bai Xiaofei dubiously.</p> 
 <p>The anxious Nie Qing endured her discomfort and ran to Bai Xiaofei to check on him. After making sure that there was no threat to his life, her heart fell back to its place.</p> 
 <p>“If anything happens to him, I’ll risk my life with you!” Nie Qing stared intently at Fang Lei and dropped a sentence that struck him dumb.</p> 
 <p><em>What did that mean?!</em></p> 
 <p>Looking back and forth between Nie Qing and Bai Xiaofei, Fang Lei’s brain stopped functioning for a moment.</p> 
 <p>“You two…”</p> 
 <p>“Yes, it’s what you think. I’m his woman now!” declared Nie Qing with a look of ‘if you don’t like that, bite me!’. The stubbornness on her face turned Fang Lei’s consternation into anger.</p> 
 <p>“Nonsense! Do you know anything about him?! This kind of thing isn’t a joke!” Yanking Nie Qing’s hand, Fang Lei looked at Bai Xiaofei with hostility. “I don’t know what kind of lies you used, but don’t use your scheming on Nie Qing again, or I swear you will die an ugly death!”</p> 
 <p>Before Bai Xiaofei could answer to this, however, Nie Qing broke free from Fang Lei’s grasp.</p> 
 <p>“It wasn’t him who hit on me, but the other way around! I warn you, if you threaten him again, I will quit the group!” defied Nie Qing with displeasure written all over her face. Normally, she wouldn’t have said such a thing, but Bai Xiaofei had been beaten so badly that it distressed her to the point that she lost any sense of rational thought.</p> 
 <p>“What nonsense are you saying?!”</p> 
 <p>“I’m not!”</p> 
 <p>As the two started quarreling without a care, a reminder from Xia He rang out in Fang Lei’s mind.</p> 
 <p>“Fine, you are determined to be with him, right? Then I will ask you some questions. If you can answer them, I will fulfill your wish!” Fang Lei suddenly said.</p> 
 <p>His words stunned Nie Qing. She didn’t want to leave the Thunderstorm Bandits, and her words just now were only out of anger. But now, it was obvious that she had no way to go back on them. Her only choice was to bite the bullet and comply.</p> 
 <p>“How well do you know him? Do you know if he has any other women?”</p> 
 <p>A blank look appeared briefly on Nie Qing’s face. She woodenly turned to Bai Xiaofei, who was wearing an expression of struggle.</p> 
 <p>“Tell him you don’t have another woman.” Nie Qing’s voice contained a hint of expectation and a hint of anxiety. She was scared that his answer might be different from what she expected.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei didn’t confirm her hope.</p> 
 <p>“I’m so sorry…” with difficulty, he slowly uttered three words that shocked Nie Qing and her mind went blank. He continued, “I wanted to find a suitable time to tell you about this. After all, your state in the past two days…”</p> 
 <p>“Enough!” Nie Qing cut him off. “What I hate most is being fooled by others!”</p> 
 <p>Her eyes were red and tears uncontrollably streamed down. Before Bai Xiaofei could explain, she hobbled to Fang Lei’s side.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t ever look for me. The next time we meet, we will be enemies!”</p>
