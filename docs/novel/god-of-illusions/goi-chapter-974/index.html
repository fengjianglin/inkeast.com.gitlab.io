 <p>Chapter 974: Berserk?!</p> 
 <p>“Have you ever heard of the Token of Heroes?” Bai Xiaofei got straight to business.</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingcheng’s expression turned dark. “You know Bai Longfei?!”</p> 
 <p>The seething anger in her voice astonished Bai Xiaofei. <em>This reaction… is a little too intense!</em></p> 
 <p>“Err, I do, but not very well…”</p> 
 <p>These words weren’t a lie. After all, he never had direct contact with his father.</p> 
 <p>“Not very well? Your surname is Bai too. Is he your father?” His playing dumb didn’t work on Ye Qingcheng, who seemed extremely sensitive to this issue.</p> 
 <p>“He’s not. I’m also entrusted by others on this matter. The surname is really just a coincidence.” Bai Xiaofei decisively chose to betray his soul. There was obviously something wrong with Ye Qingcheng’s current state, and he had no habit of seeking death.</p> 
 <p>“Is that so?” she asked icily.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately nodded. “Who would be so shameless to deny their own father, right?” he said with a nonchalant shrug, as if the person he talked about wasn’t himself.</p> 
 <p>“Then don’t ask about the Token of Heroes,” declared Ye Qingcheng.</p> 
 <p>Feeling the stone he had picked up smashing on his own feet, Bai Xiaofei was dumbstruck. <em>What was that?! Even if you have a feud with him, it has nothing to do with me, an ‘outsider!’</em></p> 
 <p>“Er… Can I ask why?” He bit the bullet and asked. After all, he could not miss this rare opportunity.</p> 
 <p>“Why do you ask so many questions? Did you lie about him not being your father?” Ye Qingcheng’s tone was below freezing point.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei started to ooze cold sweat. <em>Damn, why is she so obsessed with this? Dad, what did you do again?!</em></p> 
 <p>“As you said, this is your territory. How dare I tell such an obvious lie?” Bai Xiaofei carried forward the shameless spirit to gloss over this matter.</p> 
 <p>“In fact, Moonlight wasn’t so strict on men before. It only became like this because of that heartbreaker!” Ye Qingcheng suddenly snapped, her whole body exuding hostility.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was secretly glad. <em>Good thing I’m clever enough to deny it, or else I’d be executed because of my unreliable dad!</em></p> 
 <p>“Can you… elaborate…?” he gulped.</p> 
 <p>“More than 30 years ago, Bai Longfei appeared in Moonlight and got to know my mother. Using sweet words to earn her trust, he received her help and made leaps in his cultivation. But when Mother asked him to stay, he fled overnight!!”</p> 
 <p>“After that, Mother was so depressed that she became ill. Even our father, who came into her life later, failed to cure her heartbreak, and she passed away after giving birth to our little sister. The Token of Heroes you mentioned is something that bastard sent to her long after he left!”</p> 
 <p>Every word was said between gritted teeth. In Ye Qingcheng’s perception, Bai Longfei was an enemy who killed her mother.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei made out another story from her narration: His unrestrained father and the previous emperor of Moonlight became an item, but in the end, his father didn’t want to be tied to one place, so they split up. The previous emperor swallowed her grief and got together with another, but she never forgot about him…</p> 
 <p>It was hard to say who was right and who was wrong in this kind of matter!</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei was certain that his father had always trusted the previous Moonlight emperor, and she had later reconciled about his departure from her life. Otherwise, his father wouldn’t have sent a Token of Heroes to her, and she wouldn’t have kept it for him.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, Ye Qingcheng didn’t seem to understand it to this degree…</p> 
 <p>“In fact, you don’t have to hate him…” Bai Xiaofei found an aspect to break it to her.</p> 
 <p>“Do you think this is possible?” Ye Qingcheng snorted. Her attitude was clear. If she could, she would kill Bai Longfei with her own hands.</p> 
 <p>“After all, he is no longer in this world…” Bai Xiaofei finished his words.</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingcheng was thunderstruck. “Impossible! Mother said that he…”</p> 
 <p>“Is the strongest puppet master ever?” Bai Xiaofei finished her words. He had already heard this so many times in the Gorge of Heroes that his ears had grown calluses. “Maybe he is strong, but misfortunes happen. He really passed away. Otherwise, his affairs wouldn’t have been passed to me, an outsider.” Bai Xiaofei had become a natural when addressing himself as an outsider. Talk about being shameless…</p> 
 <p>This time, Ye Qingcheng fell into a long silence. The news of Bai Longfei’s death was equivalent to a bolt from the blue for her, whose top priority had always been to find him for revenge.</p> 
 <p>Now, it had all become meaningless…</p> 
 <p>“Besides, are you sure your mother really wants you to remember Bai Longfei this way? If that’s the case, she wouldn’t have entrusted you with the Token of Heroes. If I guess correctly, she also told you something else, right?” Bai Xiaofei tentatively asked. He was quite confident about his conjecture.</p> 
 <p>Sure enough, Ye Qingcheng’s expression changed and she began hesitating. However…</p> 
 <p>“Why?! It’s clearly because of him that Mother left us so early! But why didn’t she want me to take revenge! He clearly killed her! We sisters have only had each other to rely on ever since we were little!” she suddenly roared and her aura abruptly changed. At the same time, a terrifying energy burst out from her!</p> 
 <p>At that same moment, the other three sisters in the imperial city jerked up in dread. The nearest Ye Tong instantly rushed toward Ye Qingcheng’s sleeping quarters.</p> 
 <p>“Fickle Bai, what did you do?! Big Sister hasn’t gone berserk in ten years!!!”</p> 
 <p>The other two were also filled with worry as they raced toward the palace…</p>
