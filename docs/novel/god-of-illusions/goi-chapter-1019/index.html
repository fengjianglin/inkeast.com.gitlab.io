 <p>Chapter 1019: Acting and Stalling!</p> 
 <p>“What’s wrong? You don’t want to believe it? Doesn’t matter, you can experience it for yourselves if you like,” Bai Xiaofei broke the silence, and to cooperate with him, Qiu Muxue stepped forward.</p> 
 <p>“What are you saying, Third Elder? Although there are no puppet masters in our clan, we can still tell if Saintess just used a puppet or not,” the Second Elder quickly replied. He had been able to easily crush Qiu Muxue at will before, but an awakened person was not someone he dared to try and provoke.</p> 
 <p>In the history records of the Sacks, ‘awakened’ basically meant ‘invincible.’</p> 
 <p>“Since everyone has no objection, isn’t it time you honored your promise?” Qiu Muxue mentioned the ‘agreement’ again.</p> 
 <p>Upon hearing this, the three elders’ mouths twitched, which Bai Xiaofei was startled to see. However, it did not delay him from cooperating with Qiu Muxue.</p> 
 <p>“I, Third Elder of the Sacks, firmly support the Saintess!”</p> 
 <p>At Bai Xiaofei’s statement, the three people exchanged glances with a frown. Qiu Muxue’s awakening had really disrupted all of their plans.</p> 
 <p>“We naturally support the Saintess as well. However, the First Elder has yet to arrive. It would be more appropriate that we reach a conclusion together and let him announce it to the whole clan,” said the Second Elder, who Bai Xiaofei had identified as the brains of the group.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, this time he miscalculated.</p> 
 <p>“No need. Don’t tell me you don’t know that Mamba brought people to surround the First Elder upon returning. So, just before coming here, the Saintess had paid the First Elder a visit,” said Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The implication was obvious. The three elders’ faces instantly paled.</p> 
 <p>“At present, the Guard Team is cleaning up the mess at the First Elder’s place. I believe it won’t take much longer,” Bai Xiaofei added a heavy blow.</p> 
 <p>Beads of sweat could be seen on the foreheads of the three elders.</p> 
 <p>“Honorable Saintess, what Third Elder said…?” asked the Second Elder, his fear obvious from the way he addressed Qiu Muxue and how hesitant he was.</p> 
 <p>“All true. The First Elder no longer exists, so according to our regulations, the announcement shall be made by you, Second Elder,” replied Qiu Muxue unhurriedly. After several months being the army’s commander-in-chief, her aura coupled with her icy voice made the elders shudder.</p> 
 <p>“Naturally! I will get the ceremony prepared!” said the Second Elder, who then quickly turned to leave.</p> 
 <p>“Why are you in such a hurry? Having a… guilty conscience?” Bai Xiaofei stopped him with a smile.</p> 
 <p>The Second Elder froze in his steps. He gnashed his teeth so hard that they creaked, but the moment he turned back around, he was wearing a relaxed expression.</p> 
 <p>“Why would you say that, Third Elder? I just want the clan to learn of this good news as soon as possible.”</p> 
 <p>It was a good excuse, but Bai Xiaofei refused to let him off just like that.</p> 
 <p>“Whatever it is, shouldn’t you apologize to the Saintess first?”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Bai Xiaofei said this, the atmosphere turned bizarre.</p> 
 <p>Everyone knew why he was demanding this apology. When Qiu Muxue had just returned from Starnet, they had often made things difficult for her. If it wasn’t for Mamba, who used his identity as well as his father’s influence, she wouldn’t have become the Saintess.</p> 
 <p>“Honorable Saintess, I have repeatedly offended you before, and I hope you will forgive me for that.” The Second Elder was the first to break the long silence.</p> 
 <p>Following him, the other two also bowed to her and offered their apologies.</p> 
 <p>After all, this world followed the strong!</p> 
 <p>“I can let bygones be bygones, but regarding the future development of Barbaric Godism, I have something to say,” said Qiu Muxue as she began to delay them as planned.</p> 
 <p>“Any idea you have, we won’t fail to implement,” Bai Xiaofei immediately said, cutting off whatever the Second Elder wanted to say.</p> 
 <p>“I’m going to relax the criteria for recruiting members. In the war with Moonlight, I have learned that our biggest problem lies in the quality of personnel. We lost because they have a special army. So, as long as we cultivate such an army for ourselves, not only can we fend off the heretics but we will also certainly win in the next war with Moonlight!” Qiu Muxue started spewing nonsense. After all, she wouldn’t have to take responsibility for it later.</p> 
 <p>And in the face of this sketchy proposal, the Second Elder naturally refused to agree. Once more people joined, there would be higher-ups, meaning the authority would be spread thin.</p> 
 <p>“Honorable Saintess, please think twice about this matter. Barbaric Godism has existed a long time, there is a reason why it has been running like this till now. Our current resources are simply not enough to sustain us if we expand,” he analyzed for the good of the religion.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, Qiu Muxue didn’t want Barbaric Godism to do well at all.</p> 
 <p>“It having existed for so long and still failed to change the status of the Sacks isn’t enough reason for you? This barren land does not let us develop, it’s only tying us down! Leaving is our only way out!” she said coldly with an attitude of ‘I’m not listening to any objections.’</p> 
 <p>“If the Honorable Saintess has made up her mind, there is nothing we can do. But in any case, you will need to officially take over Barbaric Godism before making an announcement,” said the Second Elder in resignation.</p> 
 <p>Only at this moment did Bai Xiaofei fully understand what Qiu Muxue meant by the ‘agreement.’ As long as someone was awakened, they could immediately jump above the five elders and become the leader of Barbaric Godism!</p> 
 <p>At this thought, Bai Xiaofei’s heart bloomed with joy. If he had known about this earlier, he wouldn’t have had to waste so many brain cells!</p> 
 <p>“Certainly. I hope the four elders will continue to help me in the future as there are still many things I need to learn about Barbaric Godism. As long as you give it your best, I promise that there will not be a fifth elder.” Calculating that she had stalled for enough, Qiu Muxue threw out the final and biggest bait.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei almost laughed out loud. <em>Of course there won’t be a fifth elder. You guys already need to thank Heaven if you can survive after this!</em></p>
