 <p>Chapter 941: Sealing Ability!</p> 
 <p>A long and grand motorcade slowly left Indigo City, marking it as the most memorable point in its history as its destination was the imperial capital. According to the presiding officer, all the people in the group would be personally welcomed by the emperor!</p> 
 <p>This news was like thunder on a clear day for everyone. The masters of all the thirty contestants who had passed the qualification round also joined the team, hence the big number of people.</p> 
 <p>Since women who had servants normally would have a certain status, they and their servants all traveled in their own carriages.</p> 
 <p>“Tch!! What’s there to show off about that?!! If it weren’t that my Windsurfing Ship is recharging, even hundreds of their trashy carriages won’t be its match!”</p> 
 <p>Inside a carriage provided for Moonlight officials, Tan Xin stamped her feet in anger. Just now, all the other women mocked her for not having her own carriage.</p> 
 <p>“Why bother with them? It’s enough that I know how powerful you are,” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly coaxed while peeling an orange for Tan Xin.</p> 
 <p>“When we get to the capital… um… delicious… I will teach them a lesson!” Tan Xin chewed her orange as if she was chewing those women.</p> 
 <p>“Uh-huh, definitely teach them a good lesson,” Bai Xiaofei chimed in.</p> 
 <p>Suddenly, the motorcade came to a halt.</p> 
 <p>“HELP!!!”</p> 
 <p>A shrill cry for help rang out just as everyone was wondering why they stopped. Bai Xiaofei immediately got out of the carriage and saw a group of women in tattered outfits being chased by a group of men.</p> 
 <p>“Mountain bandits! Prepare to fight!”</p> 
 <p>At the officer’s command, all the guards rushed past the women in distress to protect them.</p> 
 <p>Mountain bandits were the only group of Moonlight men who could still retain their dignity, but were also a target of high priority of the Moonlight Army!</p> 
 <p>“Behind you!” shouted Bai Xiaofei to the soldiers.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, he was too late. The protected women now behind the soldiers had suddenly turned and violently attacked a group of soldiers, making them face the armed and charging mountain bandits while in a vulnerable state.</p> 
 <p>After only one round, the soldiers fell into a disadvantageous predicament.</p> 
 <p>“Help them!” Bai Xiaofei shouted to Tan Xin and rushed out.</p> 
 <p>Before he reached the battlefield, Tan Xin’s skill had already taken effect. Earth spikes accurately pierced through a large number of bandits and disrupted their momentum.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the rest of the motorcade had also gotten out of their carriages to help, proving how every woman in Moonlight was scarier than the next. Every single master of the contestants was a puppet master. The situation instantly became one-sided after they joined in.</p> 
 <p>The seventy-odd bandits either died or fled with injuries. However, the soldiers had suffered heavy casualties from the first wave of attacks, therefore the motorcade had to stop.</p> 
 <p>After this battle, the people who had laughed at Tan Xin before started to be very enthusiastic toward her. They weren’t blind and could see that the fighting ability of both Bai Xiaofei or Tan Xin could not be underestimated. Although Moonlight was a country that favored women and was dominated by women, power was still the universal passport of the continent.</p> 
 <p>“What do you think of that ambush?” Bai Xiaofei found the presiding officer who was bandaging her wound. Just now, he had blocked a knife for her, which was a good stepping stone to get close.</p> 
 <p>“Ordinary bandits, what else?” replied the officer lightly. She was already showing gratitude by not directly driving him away.</p> 
 <p>“Ordinary bandits would dare to block an imperial motorcade? You think they’re really tired of living? And they clearly came prepared, alright? From what I can see, not everyone has the ability to seal energy circulation,” said Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The officer’s face instantly sank. “One will die soon for knowing too much!” Her voice was cold and murderous.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei wasn’t scared. “A quick death is actually better than to die not knowing why. Even if you don’t tell me now, I’ll still know after we arrive at the capital. So, how about doing me this favor? Who knows, you may need my help later.”</p> 
 <p>It was obvious from Bai Xiaofei’s manner that he was going to pester until she agreed. Staring at him for a long time, the officer finally revealed a slight smile.</p> 
 <p>“You are not from Moonlight. Who are you?”</p> 
 <p>The sudden question made Bai Xiaofei’s heart leap to his throat. He must not reveal that he was Bai Xiaofei!</p> 
 <p>“My master and I are really not Moonlight people. But in our place, having a loverboy servant is not easily accepted by society, so she brought me here.” Bai Xiaofei did what he was best at – lie on the spot.</p> 
 <p>Deciding not to pursue this matter, the officer answered his earlier question, “The power to seal energy is not unique to Moonlight. To be more precise, we also borrowed it.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s curiosity was instantly piqued.</p> 
 <p>“From whom?!”</p> 
 <p>“The Sacks,” the officer uttered an answer that Bai Xiaofei could never think of.</p> 
 <p><em>I thought you were enemies?! Borrowing such a perverse ability from your enemy?!!</em></p> 
 <p>“The Sacks are born with tremendous physical strength. All people with Sack blood in their veins can trigger a sealing field in battle, where energy will stop running altogether and only brute force can be used.”</p> 
 <p>“This was why we suffered a lot in battles with them, but gradually, we discovered that weapons stained with the blood of the Sacks will also have a similar sealing ability. The more blood stained and the purer the blood, and the stronger the ability,” the officer explained.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei stared blankly in shock. This was not recorded at all in any of the books in Starnet, which was to say there was no record of it anywhere in the continent. If this matter was really exposed, the Sacks would be slaughtered!</p> 
 <p><em>Wait! But shouldn’t that be what Moonlight wants to see?!</em></p> 
 <p>“You want to ask why we don’t disclose this information, right? If we do, the other empires will definitely send reinforcements right away.” The officer was no stranger to this idea and she quickly caught onto Bai Xiaofei’s thoughts.</p> 
 <p>“Your stakes are related?” Bai Fei probed.</p> 
 <p>“Sort of. We really can’t imagine the consequences when the whole continent knows about this. I’m afraid the peace barely maintained between the major empires will be broken.” The officer sighed, then stood up and shouted to everyone, “Three more minutes before we resume! This trip must not be delayed!”</p> 
 <p>Watching her bearing change back to that of a cold officer, Bai Xiaofei laughed.</p> 
 <p>“You’re still soft-hearted after all…”</p>
