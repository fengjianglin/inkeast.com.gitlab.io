 <p><span style>“According to what you said, this kid is really extraordinary.” Lei Shan had always only partially believed what Revelations said. Especially when it was related to Revelations himself, like the course of how he encountered Bai Xiaofei, Lei Shan absolutely didn’t believe it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because asking Revelations to lend a hand and assist a stranger was simply like a daydream, and Lei Shan might have believed him if he said he watched misfortune befall someone….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, how could the son of that kid, Bai Longfei, be ordinary? Not to mention he’s the disciple of I, Revelations, now.” Revelations raised his head and took the opportunity to boast about himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But, Bai Xiaofei doesn’t look like Bai Longfei.” Lei Shan frowned and added. “But, their characters are rather alike….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boys are all like their mothers, so not looking like his father is normal.” Revelations’ excuse was very good because there was no need to doubt Bai Xiaofei’s identity and merely the Token of Heroes was irrefutable evidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re right. But, you didn’t just come here today to tell me this, right?” A man wizens with age just like a ghost gains intelligence with age. As an old friend of Revelations, Lei Shan knew Revelations like the back of his hand, and he would absolutely not make the trip specially for the sake of this news.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you remember that cultivation technique I obtained in the ruins?” Revelations raised his brows while the sly smile on his face grew slightly deeper, and it drew out an extremely surprised reaction from Lei Shan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You made Bai Xiaofei cultivate that bullshit cultivation technique?!” Lei Shan had practically roared these words out, and if he could, he even wished to choke Revelations to death on the spot.</span><span style>“What do you mean by bullshit cultivation technique? My f*cking cultivation technique is absolutely a divine-grade cultivation technique, alright!? Not to mention the meridians in that kid’s entire body were blocked up, so besides this cultivation technique, could it be that you have a better method to clear up his meridians!?” Revelations retorted without holding back in the slightest, and it caused Lei Shan to instantly be rendered speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the truth, but he still felt that Bai Xiaofei’s cultivation of that cultivation technique was too risky because its infinite unpredictability was no different than gambling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Originally, I intended to find a chance to give him a second puppet after the New Student Competition ended, but now it would seem like there’s no hope for that.” Lei Shan let out a long sigh, and his tone carried a trace of helplessness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, this is also the true reason why I came to see you this time.” Revelations who was like an old child chuckled while rubbing his hands together, and his expression was extremely similar to the expression of an unscrupulous merchant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean? Even though I’m the principle, I’m unable to act as a pimp.” Lei Shan had directly refused before Revelations could speak because unlike Revelations, he still wanted his face, so he was really unable to do some things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cheh! You’re really good for nothing. Would the disciple of I, Revelations, need you to act as a pimp? The cultivation technique of that precious disciple of mine has already advanced in grade once.” Revelations’ face carried a trace of complacency while he seemed to be boasting, but he couldn’t help but shudder subconsciously when he thought of Hu Xian’er.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Heavens above, I hope that little fox doesn’t bear a grudge against me!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It has advanced in grade?!” Lei Shan was angered to the point his lips trembled, and he was at a loss for words to curse at Revelations with. </span><i><span style>Bai Xiaofei is only 16!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s only a child!!!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be so agitated. In any case, it’s a step that he has to take sooner or later, so there’s no difference between it being a few years earlier or later. Do you think everyone is old-fashioned like you?” Revelations knew why Lei Shan was so agitated, but he was still unable to understand.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If he doesn’t be a bit more unrestrained in his youth, then could it be that he should only become ‘enlightened’ when all the beauties have become the possession of others?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, alright, I won’t argue about it with you. But, since this child is in my academy now, you better not think of handing your trash to him!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, there was really no need for Revelations to teach Bai Xiaofei all this because Bai Xiaofei had finished his apprenticeship in this matter a long time ago while he was still in the Gorge of Heroes….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough. You’re really overthinking things. Some things can’t be held back just because you want to hold it back. That disciple of mine is fated to be entangled by love, and there’ll never be an end to the beauties by his side. If you don’t believe me, then you can wait and see.” Revelations sneered and displayed his contempt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t be bothered to argue about it with you as well, we’ll wait and see!” Just like every single time they met in the past, there wasn’t a single time they wouldn’t tell each other to wait and see in the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, they couldn’t end it here today because Revelations hadn’t attained his goal!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right, old goat, since that precious disciple of mine can form an agreement with a second puppet, then shouldn’t you who’s his Martial Uncle no matter what make some sort of display?” He originally intended to talk it over with Lei Shan, but he could only resort to extortion now….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even though I’m a principal, I’m not in charge of money. You’re well aware of who the person that takes care of that is, so if you’re able to get it, then take as much as you please.” Lei Shan shrugged and acted as if it wasn’t his business.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think there’s something wrong my head like you? If I tell that little girl Luo Xi about my disciple, then he probably won’t even be able to live past today.” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Damn, another person that called Luo Xi a little girl….</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Moreover, I don’t want your money!” Revelations raised his brows and revealed an expression that said ‘you understand’ to Li Shan, and it terrified Lei Shan to the point goosebumps arose all over him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That won’t do. That’s the thing I intend to use as the prize during the New Student Competition. If I give it to you now, then what will I use as the first prize?” Lei Shan refused in a stern and just manner, yet Revelations revealed a smile that seemed as if he’d already succeeded half way.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s fine so long as you intend to give it away, and so long as you are willing to do that, then I’ll be f*cking taking it for sure!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you want to know when there’ll be a favorable turn in the situation between you and that young lady, Lei Min?” Revelations snapped his fingers before the Heavenly Secret Disk slowly floated up above Revelations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next second, Lei Shan gulped down a mouthful of saliva with great difficulty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since they left the Ethereal Pavilion and snuck out, the group from the Savage Class hadn’t returned to the academy for an entire day, and even their lunch and dinner was dealt with the way they used to do it here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only were the pitiable magical beasts their sparring partners, the magical beasts even took on the responsibility of filling their stomachs….</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a day of training, basically everyone in the Savage Class had attained an initial grasp of their puppets. But, it would at least take around half a month for them to attain a skilled level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, the magical beasts had to continue being pitiable for a period of time….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Fei, do you think we're invincible amongst the new students now!?” On the way back</span><span style>，</span><span style>all of them were extremely excited because under the combination of their new puppets, the strength of the Savage Class could be described as having 'risen explosively’, so it could be said that they didn't let down their desperate efforts of earning money in the past month.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re dreaming if you think we’re invincible. Don’t forget that there are always mountains beyond mountains and others that are more extraordinary. I heard that many students from the internally recruited classes have already attained the Master Rank.” Bai Xiaofei was the one and only person that remembered to douse all of them with cold water. But, no matter how one looked at it, based on his confident expression, it didn’t seem like these words were spoken sincerely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could my disciple possibly not be invincible! Stinking kid, if you don’t even have this bit of confidence, then don’t tell anyone you’re the disciple of I, Revelations!” A voice that caused Bai Xiaofei to have the urge to commit suicide sounded out, and in the next second, Revelations descended slowly to arrive before Bai Xiaofei and the others on his golden arrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Besides Bai Xiaofei, everyone else was stunned….</span></p>
