 <p>Chapter 328: The First Public Performance; Yun Jingshuang’s Idea!</p> 
 <p>“I believe that everyone didn’t come here to see me, but I still have to waste some of your time. You won’t be able to see our beautiful girls without passing through me first.”</p> 
 <p>With a slight smile and a gentle wave of his hand, a part of the space on the big screens was divided, on which some crucial rules about the event were written in a clear font.</p> 
 <p>“First of all, our girls’ performances may be very exciting, but I believe that you all are well-mannered. Please don’t attempt anything demeaning, that will not only lose the favor of our girls but also attract the attention of our Big Boss Lei, which I believe none of you would desire.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei brought up Lei Shan. Although he felt unlikely that Lei Shan would personally make a move, just a reminder was enough.</p> 
 <p><em>Whoever you are, don’t forget where you are right now!</em></p> 
 <p>“Secondly, please don’t spare your applause and cheers during the performances, because you may not be able to see such wonderful performances in your life again. You know, this is the first show of many beautiful girls! And finally, if you see your favorite sister, please remember her name. Everyone present can only vote once! In addition, I hope you will consider carefully before voting, because the results will determine who can proceed!”</p> 
 <p>Here, Bai Xiaofei took a deep breath.</p> 
 <p>“Let it begin!”</p> 
 <p>As soon as those words resounded, all the lights went out. As the moonlight wasn’t enough for the audience to adapt to the sudden darkness, the whole square was almost pitch-black.</p> 
 <p>The next second, explosive music and colorful lights hit the stage, as five enchanting belles in white tank tops and short pink skirts appeared in the lights, their flawless fair arms and long legs instantly attracted the eyes of all.</p> 
 <p>And that was only the beginning. Along with the music, the five girls who had been sculpture-still suddenly moved, elegantly and flexibly stretching. Each movement flawlessly showed off their perfect bodies.</p> 
 <p>Waves of cheers swept through the audience. Those with discerning eyes instantly recognized that the dance was choreographed by Shang Qiu’er.</p> 
 <p>In a short five minutes, the five girls perfectly completed their mission as the opening dance and had the entire square boiling!</p> 
 <p>At the moment the dance ended, smiles bloomed on the faces of the five sweat-covered girls at the same time, perhaps because they were excited or moved, or perhaps because their hard work in the past month hadn’t been in vain. Looking at the excited audience and listening to their thunderous applause, the five girls suddenly felt that victory was no longer that important.</p> 
 <p>This kind of experience was going to be the treasure of their lifetime. They had proved that they were not inferior to anyone!</p> 
 <p>“Thank you, everyone! If you like us, please write down our names and cast us your precious vote!”</p> 
 <p>Right after these words fell, the lights dimmed again.</p> 
 <p>In the next second, a new group had already appeared on the stage…</p> 
 <p>33 performances ended faster than expected. When Bai Xiaofei stepped onto the stage again, everyone still had a feeling of wanting more, because every single performance was refreshing to their eyes and ears!</p> 
 <p>“I know you guys don’t want to see me very much, but if I don’t appear, I think you wouldn’t notice that it’s already past midnight.” As Bai Xiaofei’s voice echoed in the square, the audience gradually calmed down. “For the last time, let’s thank the 33 teams for their performances today with applause!”</p> 
 <p>At this, long applause resounded again. This was their sincere, heartfelt gratitude for the girls for a night of visual feast.</p> 
 <p>“I believe everyone has remembered many. Pray for them. If they ever go all the way till the end, your vote will have played a crucial role!”</p> 
 <p>These words from Bai Xiaofei shook the minds of the audience. Holding the rights to exercise power always gave people an instinctive sense of pride.</p> 
 <p>“This time tomorrow, we will welcome the 34 middle-ranked teams. Please look forward to their excellent performances!”</p> 
 <p>With that, all the lights in the square went on, and all the girls performing today stood with Bai Xiaofei, watching as the audience left.</p> 
 <p>After the guests had left, Bai Xiaofei once again gave the teams who finished performing today his blessings and a reward of 50,000 Amethyst Coins to each girl! For these girls, Bai Xiaofei could be said to have a change of his stingy character. Over 5 million Amethyst Coins were gone just like that…</p> 
 <p>After sending off the girls, Bai Xiaofei was finally at ease after a busy day. Yun Jingshuang, who hadn’t shown up for a long time, came up while carrying the dishes of the Hundred Flavor House in his hands.</p> 
 <p>“Damn. You’re such a dear after such a long time. You should have something to tell me I guess?” Bai Xiaofei eyed Yun Jingshuang suspiciously while he was taking out the food.</p> 
 <p>Casting a scornful glance at Bai Xiaofei, Yun Jingshuang acted like he disdained being friends with him.</p> 
 <p>“I poisoned the food. I want to kill you and then take all your money,” said Yun Jingshuang ferociously, with a hint of seriousness in his eyes.</p> 
 <p>Stunned for a moment, Bai Xiaofei laughed heartily. He continued to open the food, and then…</p> 
 <p>“Huskie, come and try our senior’s love dinner!”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Bai Xiaofei said this, Huskie hopped over. Bai Xiaofei hurriedly poured out only half of each dish, otherwise, he might have nothing to eat later.</p> 
 <p>As for Blackie, its expression wasn’t much different from Yun Jingshuang, only that its eyes had a trace of shame.</p> 
 <p><em>How can I have such a master?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Also, stupid dog, can’t you understand what he said at all?! He’s using you to test for poison!!</em></p> 
 <p>Of course, Huskie could understand, but it couldn’t care less with all the food right before its eyes.</p> 
 <p>“Mhmm, the Hundred Flavor House never disappoints.”</p> 
 <p>After having Huskie act as a guinea pig, Bai Xiaofei enjoyed his supper without any burden. Looking at his contented expression, it was hard to believe that he was fearful just now.</p> 
 <p>“Let me ask you something.”</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei was eating happily, Yun Jingshuang suddenly spoke. Bai Xiaofei wasn’t surprised, very few came to see him for no reason…</p> 
 <p>“Let me guess, you’re gonna relay your will?” The instant Bai Xiaofei said this, a huge ice block smashed down on his head. Fortunately, he was fast enough not to receive this blow from him.</p> 
 <p>“You’ll suffer sooner or later with such a character.” Yun Jingshuang sighed as he deleted the idea of teaching Bai Xiaofei a lesson.</p> 
 <p>“I can’t help it. It’s easier to change mountains and rivers than to alter one’s character, I don’t think I’ll change for the rest of my life. As for suffering or whatever, it’s not within my scope of worry. Whoever hurts me, I’ll hurt them back ten times, a hundred times before long,” stated Bai Xiaofei seriously, followed by a silly smile.</p> 
 <p>“Tch, say what you want, I just hope you won’t regret it then.” With a look of indifference, Yun Jingshuang gave up on the idea of advising Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>In fact, he shouldn’t have had such an idea in the first place.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s get down to business.”</p> 
 <p>Yun Jingshuang’s expression grew serious again, but before he could say anything more, Bai Xiaofei suddenly raised his right hand.</p> 
 <p>“I’m not doing it, find someone else!”</p>
