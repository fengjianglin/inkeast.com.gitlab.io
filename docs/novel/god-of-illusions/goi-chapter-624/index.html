 <p>Chapter 624: Raising a Dog for One Thousand Days, just for this Moment!</p> 
 <p>The knuckles losing effect only surprised Bai Xiaofei. What brought him to the verge of explosion was when he checked his Amethyst Card. He had obviously watched Xiao Yao input only one million Amethyst Coins, but his card had ten million deducted!</p> 
 <p>What was ten million? His pocket money only added up to a few tens of millions! Xiao Yao literally had bitten a good chunk of flesh from him!</p> 
 <p>“Huskie! You handle this!” Bai Xiaofei said through gritted teeth. He just wanted to skin Xiao Yao and rip out his tendons, and Huskie was the one he pinned all his hopes on.</p> 
 <p>Sniffing the knuckles, Huskie gave Bai Xiaofei a human-like smile.</p> 
 <p>“Smell’s still here, but at least five… eh no, ten pieces of Crystal’s Longing!” Huskie wagging his tail, looking exactly the same as that of Bai Xiaofei when he blackmailed others.</p> 
 <p>“Damn you! You f*cking learned to fish in troubled waters, huh?! Then I will stop your dog food!” Bai Xiaofei bounced up in an instant like an enraged lion. Having just been cheated, he was quite sensitive at the moment.</p> 
 <p>“Tch, then go ahead, we’ll see who’s afraid of whom!” Huskie snorted overbearingly, obviously determined to drag Bai Xiaofei down together.</p> 
 <p>Watching these two weirdos going back and forth, the triplets covered their lips to hide their smiles. Indeed, like master like puppet. If they ever got an animated puppet in the future, they’d better keep it away from Bai Xiaofei…</p> 
 <p>“Fine! Ten pieces!” Grinding his teeth, Bai Xiaofei agreed to Huskie’s demand in the end. His priority now was not haggling with Huskie but to catch Xiao Yao.</p> 
 <p>“Deposit first, five pieces!” Huskie stretched his paw with another demand that nearly set Bai Xiaofei off again, but he could only endure…</p> 
 <p><em>Xiao Yao! This is on you!</em></p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei took out five pieces of Crystal’s Longing from his storage ring and passed them to Huskie, who jumped around in joy, the triplets could hear the sound of blood dripping from his heart.</p> 
 <p>What no one expected was that Huskie didn’t keep all the five pieces for himself. Instead, he ran to the napping Blackie and happily gave her three.</p> 
 <p>That’s right, three, happily!</p> 
 <p>Blackie’s reaction was even more miraculous. She first rolled her eyes at Huskie, and then she accepted the Crystal’s Longings. From her attitude, it was clear that she was only interested in the crystals, but Huskie was still jubilant…</p> 
 <p>Heh, poor dog…</p> 
 <p>Having delivered his love tribute, Huskie got to work. He led the group all the way to the city gate.</p> 
 <p>“He should have left the city. Are we still chasing?” Huskie turned to Bai Xiaofei and received a firm look from the latter.</p> 
 <p>“Chase! I don’t believe that he can outrun our Blackscale Horses!” said Bai Xiaofei viciously. He then took out a whistle and used it. A moment later, the four Blackscale Horses galloped over.</p> 
 <p>Dust flew as the horses ran at full speed under Bai Xiaofei’s urging, they disappeared from the city gate in the blink of an eye…</p> 
 <p>“The smell is very close!” Peeking his head out from Bai Xiaofei’s arms, Huskie delivered some good news.</p> 
 <p>“In a while, you guys stay out of it. He’s all mine!” Bai Xiaofei shook his fist with a hint of malice.</p> 
 <p>He could accept any kind of opponent, but not being lied to and tricked! This was his bottom line, the ultimate ethic of a professional liar!</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Xiao Yao had stopped for a rest thinking that he had escaped the danger zone. On a small fire hung a piece of meat that didn’t look to be from an ordinary animal, and Xiao Yao was humming a little song while sprinkling all kinds of spices.</p> 
 <p>Obviously, this wasn’t the first time Xiao Yao had done something like this.</p> 
 <p>Soon, the delicious aroma of barbecue spread. Xiao Yao contentedly sniffed it, but the moment he just opened his mouth, a shadow suddenly descended from the sky!</p> 
 <p>“Let’s see where you’re gonna run now!”</p> 
 <p>With a pair of wings at his back, Bai Xiaofei slapped his right hand onto Xiao Yao’s head with a loud thud as dust was kicked up all around.</p> 
 <p>When the dust cleared, Bai Xiaofei’s brow creased. The sure-hit strike didn’t achieve the result that he had expected. What he pinned down was only a doll.</p> 
 <p>“Master, isn’t it only 10 million Amethyst Coins? Surely it’s not worth you chasing me all the way here?!”</p> 
 <p>His hand holding a barbecue skewer, Xiao Yao slowly came out from behind a big tree not far away and smugly took a bite. His arrogant expression was even more irritating than that of Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“My silly master, that’s an illusion! Can’t you see through that?!” cried Huskie suddenly just as Bai Xiaofei was about to pounce again.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei froze a little, then tried to concentrate. When he looked at Xiao Yao again, the figure indeed became hollow.</p> 
 <p>Illusion Stream puppet masters were better than most at attacking the mind because once the opponent’s mind was confused, they would lose composure and be easier to fall for illusions!</p> 
 <p>Knowing that he was played once again, Bai Xiaofei flapped his wings and shot up into the air. Closely observing, he saw three figures running in different directions. Taking out the newly acquired Iceheart Pill bottle, he swallowed one pill without hesitation. Three figures that originally looked exactly the same then instantly changed.</p> 
 <p>Locking onto Xiao Yao’s true body, Bai Xiaofei’s first thought was to catch him, but he changed his mind in the next second.</p> 
 <p>His mouth curling up into a meaningful smile, Bai Xiaofei flew straight to an illusion. In a rumble, he turned the illusion into the same state as that ragged doll at the beginning.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Xiao Yao’s true body had run far away, but Bai Xiaofei wasn’t worried at all.</p> 
 <p>“Ahh, I reminded you, how can you still make mistakes? Why do I have such a stupid master?” Huskie’s disdainful voice rang out as the rest of the group ran to Bai Xiaofei’s side.</p> 
 <p>“If you don’t want to become hotpot dog meat, shut your dog’s mouth. What do you know with your pea-sized brain?” Bai Xiaofei ruthlessly retorted, then picked Huskie up by his neck. “I’ll give you two more Crystal’s Longings, chase after him again!”</p> 
 <p>The struggling Huskie instantly behaved upon hearing ‘Crystal’s Longings.’ His tongue swung around in excitement.</p> 
 <p>“Four!” <em>Since I have offended you anyway, a little more won’t matter! Compared to delicious food, nothing else matters!</em></p> 
 <p>“Fine, four!” giving Huskie his promise, Bai Xiaofei looked in the direction that Xiao Yao had fled. “Wanna use illusions on this lord, huh? This lord will play with you!”</p>
