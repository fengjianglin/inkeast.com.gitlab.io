 <p>Chapter 758: The Big Fish Takes the Bait!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had to temporarily put aside the matter with Rui Mengqi. It was not that he didn’t want to make it clear, he just didn’t have the time.</p> 
 <p>Tong Fei was coming!</p> 
 <p>After half a year of cooperation, Bai Xiaofei proved with practical actions that he was a reliable partner. If nothing else, Tong Fei had pocketed quite an amount thanks to Bai Xiaofei, while he had never said a word out of line or asked a question he should not ask. He had been a businessman from the inside out.</p> 
 <p>The people around Bai Xiaofei were simply family members and servants, and he had even organized many blind dates for his ‘daughters,’ because of which he had received protests from Duan Yiyi and Zhu Nuo many times.</p> 
 <p>In a nutshell, Bai Xiaofei’s group had turned the fake family into a real existence with their acting. Currently, he was a rising star known even to empires. However, the fact that he had been living in a small town as a local tyrant prevented him from having direct contact with those bigshots. His range of activity was mostly around big merchant groups.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei planned to put an end to those kinds of days. He only had one year to complete the graduation mission, and the time had come to pull in the net.</p> 
 <p>In the evening, Tong Fei arrived with Heartless as agreed. For a big character like him to come to this small town, it was entirely to give Bai Xiaofei face.</p> 
 <p>“My brother, long time no see. You look energetic as ever!” Tong Fei came up and gave Bai Xiaofei a big hug.</p> 
 <p>“I’m nothing compared to you, Brother Tong, you’re too kind. I have two daughters who are at the age to start a family of their own. You are still in your prime!” said Bai Xiaofei humbly.</p> 
 <p>The two people then flattered each other all the way as Rui Mengqi led them to the banquet room.</p> 
 <p>“You’re all dismissed. We don’t need to be served today.” Bai Xiaofei dismissed everyone else after he sat down.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, Master.”</p> 
 <p>Rui Mengqi bowed and led the other maids to retreat. In the mansion, she and Xu Chen were not the only maids, otherwise, it would look too fake. Xu Chen’s group were all maid-in-waitings for the ‘madams’ and ‘young misses.’</p> 
 <p>Seeing Bai Xiaofei’s face suddenly darken, Tong Fei had a bad feeling. He turned to Heartless. “Heartless, you step out as well. Brother Bai and I are having a private talk tonight.”</p> 
 <p>Upon his order, Heartless retreated without delay. Their caution against Bai Xiaofei was currently infinitely close to zero. After all, who would have thought that someone would keep up an act for half a year just to get to their goal?</p> 
 <p>“There’s only the two of us now. Just say it, my brother,” Tong Fei said as he poured Bai Xiaofei a cup of wine. Compared with their first meeting, his tone was much more careful. Bai Xiaofei was his god of fortune, someone he could not afford to offend.</p> 
 <p>In other words, Bai Xiaofei successfully made himself someone that Tong Fei could not let go of!</p> 
 <p>“Let us drink first!” Bai Xiaofei did not get into the topic. He raised his cup, drained it, and refilled. “A toast to our happy cooperation in the past six months!”</p> 
 <p>Seeing Bai Xiaofei drain another cup, Tong Fei could only follow.</p> 
 <p>“This one is to the discord between the two of us when we first met. No matter who is in the wrong, I apologize!” Bai Xiaofei drained the third cup, then sighed.</p> 
 <p>This sigh flustered Tong Fei.</p> 
 <p>“My brother, if I have done something wrong, just tell me directly and I’ll fix it!” Tong Fei grew anxious. He was not a fool. Something had definitely happened to make Bai Xiaofei drink like this, and judging from his tone, he was obviously trying to say goodbye!</p> 
 <p>“The problem is not between you and me, there is nothing I can do!” Bai Xiaofei gave an ambiguous reply and shook his head.</p> 
 <p>“My brother, I never kept anything from you. Why do you keep me in suspense like this?” Tong Fei frowned in displeasure. As far as he was concerned, there was a ‘bond’ between him and Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Our organization is giving up on the Blood Diamond business,” Bai Xiaofei said lightly.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Tong Fei gawked in shock.</p> 
 <p>“Give up?! On such a gold mine?! Is your boss out of his mind?! Everyone knows how much your group gets monthly from trading Blood Diamonds!” Tong Fei exclaimed, his voice kept rising as if he had heard the biggest joke in his life.</p> 
 <p>“Brother, calm down. I also told my boss the exact same thing, but I can’t help after hearing his answer.” Bai Xiaofei helplessly sighed.</p> 
 <p>“What did he say?!” Tong Fei just wanted to fly directly to that ‘boss’ and interrogate him to the end. Little did he know that the biggest boss was sitting right before him…</p> 
 <p>“He said the Blood Diamond business yields high profits, but the origin of Blood Diamonds is unknown and the supply is completely in the hands of others. So, it’s good for developing the organization during a critical period, but not long-term-wise. Or else, our merchant group will inevitably be subject to others even after becoming big. Moreover, our business is on the right track and has certain competitiveness in other industries. We won’t slump from giving up on Blood Diamonds.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei recited the excuse he made up. However, it was valid as no business was willing to put its vital point in the hands of others, which was a big taboo.</p> 
 <p>“This is indeed a problem, but my brother, can you give me some time? If I resolve it, can you help me talk to your boss?” After a short silence, Tong Fei composed himself and said something that Bai Xiaofei expected and looked forward to.</p> 
 <p>“Resolve it? Old Song told me that this is your secret, so I have never mentioned it in the past six months. Did he lie to me?” Bai Xiaofei smiled bitterly. “I basically swore to our boss that this problem could not be solved. Brother, you are slapping me in the face!”</p> 
 <p>Tong Fei was embarrassed by the accusation. He said, “Well, to a certain extent, it’s indeed a secret. But if the other party is reliable, it’s not impossible to disclose some intel. However, it stops as far as taking you to see the supply location of the goods.” He stared fixedly at Bai Xiaofei. “Brother, you absolutely will not harm me, will you?”</p> 
 <p>In the face of Tong Fei’s question, Bai Xiaofei chuckled and patted the man’s pocket.</p> 
 <p>“Ask your wallet.”</p>
