 <p>Chapter 1007: Zhuang Shuo, Solo!</p> 
 <p>“Someone’s back again!”</p> 
 <p>The gates of Colorful Star Fortress opened, and the neat army coming in was greeted with exclamations from onlookers.</p> 
 <p>“What is the Saintess planning? Didn’t this army just leave?” a Sacks civilian whispered.</p> 
 <p>Let alone the civilians, even the recalled soldiers were confused. They had just deployed to a small fortress at the front lines, but they had just arrived when an order from the Saintess summoned them all back. This was the third group that had returned to Colorful Star today.</p> 
 <p>“Eat your food, this has nothing to do with you.”</p> 
 <p>In an inn inside the fortress, Bai Xiaofei’s group was sitting around a table. Except for Zhu Chunyang’s team, everyone else managed to get in.</p> 
 <p>However, the fortress was not peaceful at all. Because Ye Qingtong had killed over a hundred Sacks patrols, they naturally noticed something was wrong and after the situation was reported, the whole fortress was on the alert. At the moment, all Moonlight people were inspected.</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, for some reason, the Moonlight people here weren’t imprisoned. Instead, the Saintess ordered them to continue operating their shops, and even those without jobs weren’t harmed. In addition, a large number of Sacks civilians had poured into the fortress. At a glance, if one didn’t know about the situation between Moonlight and the Sacks, they would have thought that the two shared a friendly relationship</p> 
 <p>“Fine, I eat, I eat.” Tan Xin coldly snorted, obviously unhappy that she was reprimanded by Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Do you know why they spared the Moonlight people? If they just want someone to serve them, there is absolutely no need to keep everyone,” Ye Qingtong wondered. Ever since this problem occupied her mind, she had been unable to care about anything else.</p> 
 <p>“The Sacks have always been nomads and are not good at town management. If they don’t keep these people, they may not be able to maintain the basic operation of the fortress. But as you said, there’s absolutely no need to leave so many people, so they should have a deeper purpose. Unfortunately, I can’t make an educated guess,” replied Bai Xiaofei calmly. Compared with this matter, he was more concerned about something else –</p> 
 <p>His bet with the three generals was still in progress!</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, it’ll all work out… But what should we do now? At this rate, they will find us before our plan can even begin,” Tan Xin muttered as she carefully scanned the surroundings.</p> 
 <p>“Well, if you keep acting like this, we are really not far from being caught,” Bai Xiaofei remarked.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin immediately retracted her eyes and shot him a glare.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I’ve asked Zhuang Shuo to figure out the situation. We will act when he returns,” said Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t tell me we have to wait until dark again.” Tan Xin had seen through Bai Xiaofei. He seemed to be a nocturnal creature whose brain would only work well at night.</p> 
 <p>“No, this time we will move during the day. The Sacks have already started to guard against the people in the fortress and they should be extra careful at night. Meanwhile, most are busy with the investigations during the day, making it the best time for us.” Bai Xiaofei grinned.</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingtong once again learned how wicked a person could be. It was a good thing that he wasn’t her enemy…</p> 
 <p>“Boss!”</p> 
 <p>Speaking of the devil, Zhuang Shuo stumbled into the room, the excitement on his face speaking volumes.</p> 
 <p>“There are four granaries in the fortress. Aside from the one we’ve been to that day, there is another publically known one and two hidden ones. The two public granaries used to be used by Moonlight while the two secret ones are in the south and the west respectively. Both don’t have many people guarding them. Also, just like you said, they currently have all of their focus on the investigations and so have let down their guard on those key parts.”</p> 
 <p>After finishing his report, Zhuang Shuo poured a cup of water into his mouth. Clearly, he had spent a lot of effort to get the information.</p> 
 <p>“Is everyone all right?” Bai Xiaofei’s primary concern was not intelligence, but the situation of the Fickle Army. Every single member was extremely valuable to him.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, Boss, not even a scratch on anyone.” Zhuang Shuo smiled happily.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei then put down his bowl and chopsticks. “Let’s clean up. Time to get down to business!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, everyone perked up.</p> 
 <p>“Tie up these people well, I don’t want any problems here,” said Bai Xiaofei as he glanced at the shivering Sacks soldiers in the corner of the room.</p> 
 <p>“Tch, look at you. So there are also Sacks people who are scared of death too, huh?” Zhuang Shuo walked to them with a grin, his stark-white teeth looking particularly scary.</p> 
 <p>“Cut the nonsense. Let them smell this, then send a signal to Zhu Chunyang and them to assemble.” Tan Xin handed Zhuang Shuo a small bottle, which was the enhanced version of the sleeping drug previously. Even if these people’s heads got sawed off, they still wouldn’t wake up.</p> 
 <p>As Zhuang Shuo finished with the Sacks soldiers and the Fickle troops inside the fortress assembled, Bai Xiaofei began to assign missions.</p> 
 <p>“There are four granaries, each of us takes one. Sister Qingtong and I are in charge of the public ones and you two the secret ones. Remember, after setting them on fire, run away and do not engage in combat. After destroying the granaries, immediately head towards the barracks and meet up there,” Bai Xiaofei said and took out a Recording Eyeball. “Set the fires in one hour from now. If anyone fails to infiltrate your target within one hour, then give up on it and go directly to the barracks.”</p> 
 <p>The four then looked at each other with the same smirk on their faces.</p> 
 <p>“If anyone fails, treat the rest to a meal, how about it?” Bai Xiaofei suddenly said.</p> 
 <p>This time, no one had any objections.</p> 
 <p>“Then I want the most expensive meal!”</p> 
 <p>“I know a place where it’s both expensive and delicious.”</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin and Ye Qingtong raised the stake one after the other.</p> 
 <p>Zhuang Shuo suddenly felt a great pressure. <em>Why do I feel like it’s all directed at me?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Boss, does the Fickle Army have allowances?” Gulping, Zhuang Shuo already considered a way out just in case.</p> 
 <p>“Give it up, with your Boss’s appetite, you’ll have to sell your life to the military to buy him a meal!” Tan Xin looked at Zhuang Shuo with pity. She could already imagine his expression when he paid for the meal.</p> 
 <p>“Haven’t you always wanted to have your own mission? This is your chance, so don’t screw it up, or I’ll eat until you’re broke!” Patting Zhuang Shuo’s shoulder, Bai Xiaofei added fuel to the fire.</p> 
 <p>Leaving the poor guy standing there in shock, the three walked out while laughing merrily. Zhuang Shuo returned to his senses and hurriedly caught up.</p> 
 <p>“Wait for me, Boss! This is cheating, you guys are cheating!“</p> 
 <p>As the four set out with their teams, the Fickle Army continued to carry out their plan after a day of rest.</p> 
 <p>“Brothers, this time Boss isn’t with us, so we’re all on our own. However, we must not let him look down on us! Do you understand what I mean?” Zhuang Shuo had never been so careful and serious.</p> 
 <p>“Boss Zhuang, just tell us what to do, we believe you!”</p> 
 <p>As his team looked straight into his eyes and said words of encouragement, Zhuang Shuo’s heart tightened. <em>Oh mother, the pressure is too great!!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Shit, let’s just do it!” Zhuang Shuo slapped his thigh and stood up. “The city is now full of troops transferred from all over. As long as we are calm, no one will dare to come up and question us. Lil’ Six, you’re the only one among us who can imitate the Sacks accent. If anyone stands in our way, you’re up.”</p> 
 <p>Zhuang Shuo tried to consider every possible situation. Although he had no such thing as a Plan B, one plan was good enough as long as it was executed well.</p> 
 <p>After the plan was finalized, the group changed clothes and swaggered onto the street.</p> 
 <p>Groups of soldiers walking around had become a common sight in Colorful Star Fortress lately, so no one came up to Zhuang Shuo’s group and asked about their situation. Even the patrol along the way would move aside to make way for them.</p> 
 <p>“Stop right there! State your names!”</p> 
 <p>Just as Zhuang Shuo’s group was about to arrive at their destination, a loud shout rang out behind them.</p> 
 <p>Everyone looked back and saw a teenager guarded by several Sacks soldiers. The little guy was holding a dagger in his hand and wearing a bossy expression.</p> 
 <p>The Fickle soldiers instinctively clenched their weapons. They were confident that they could take down the opponent’s small group in just three breaths!</p> 
 <p>“Where did this brat come from, how dare you stop us?!” Lil’ Six <br> immediately stepped out and started scolding the teenager, shocking the latter.</p> 
 <p>After a brief silence, the little guy started crying, “Uncle! He scolded me!!”</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Lil’ Six immediately drew his long blade. “Very well, just as this lord has no one to vent my fury on!” he said while walking toward the teenager.</p> 
 <p>One of the teenager’s guards immediately stepped forward with a big smile. “Brother, please don’t get emotional. How about giving Tribe Head Shulan some face?”</p> 
 <p>Lil’ Six had no idea who Shulan was and whether the man was testing him, so he wisely decided to evade it. “Who gives a damn about some tribe head?! This lord only serves the Saintess! I shall teach this brat a lesson today for blocking our leader’s road!” saying this, he acted as if he was going to charge forward. The Fickle soldiers behind him also drew their weapons.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, the teenager’s guard completely relaxed. A heavy pouch appeared in his hand.</p> 
 <p>“Brother, this is a little money to buy you a meal. Please calm your anger,” he said and stuffed the pouch into Lil’ Six’s hands.</p> 
 <p>Taking the pouch, Lil’ Six peered inside quickly before putting away his weapon.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t let me see this little brat again!”</p> 
 <p>With a snort, he returned to Zhuang Shuo’s side. The Fickle Army also sheathed their weapons and resumed toward their destination…</p>
