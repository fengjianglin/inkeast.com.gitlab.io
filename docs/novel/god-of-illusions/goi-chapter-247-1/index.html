 <p>“Why are you giving me such detailed instructions? Are you not planning to come with me?” Lei Min asked after Bai Xiaofei was done telling her what to say.</p>
 <p>“With Big Sister Lei dealing with the principal, I’m not worried. I still have something else I need to work on. All of you need time to complete your tasks, and I am the only one who can give you more time.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei might appear to be at ease, but Lei Min could hear the hesitation in Bai Xiaofei’s voice.</p>
 <p>“So are you going to confront Di Jiang next?” Lei Min asked, and Bai Xiaofei nodded.</p>
 <p>“It is unavoidable. If I don’t show myself, he will forever be on alert, which will be unfavorable for my plan,” said Bai Xiaofei with a resolute gaze. He was already bracing himself to be taught a harsh lesson by Di Jiang.</p>
 <p>“Bring Liuyun and the others with you. I don’t want to see my people getting beaten up so badly they are crippled. If I allow that to happen, people will think that the Demon of Illusions can be easily bullied,” Lei Min said before walking away, leaving Bai Xiaofei standing there in a daze.</p>
 <p><em>Bringing Chu Liuyun and the others? Would that be helpful?</em></p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was astonished, but what he had seen at the entrance surfaced in his mind. They might be helpful after all. But they were still facing the Fist of the Beast. Would they be able to contend against an entire faculty? While Bai Xiaofei hesitated, Chu Liuyun’s group of five entered. It was clear they had received instructions from Lei Min.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go. I thought you were going to do something big?” Chu Liuyun said with a smile. She showed no dissatisfaction for being sent outside to give Bai Xiaofei and Lei Min some privacy.</p>
 <p>“Oh, Big Sister Liuyun, the moment we step outside, the entire Fist of Beast will hunt me. You guys…” Bai Xiaofei was still anxious about them. They had only known each other for about a day. He couldn’t bring himself to trouble them for something this troublesome.</p>
 <p>To repay kindness with even more kindness. This was something Bai Xiaofei had learned from the Gorge of Heroes. One should never forget one’s roots.</p>
 <p>“Xiaofei, you are overthinking. With us around, there will be no more Fist of the Beast members coming for you,” said Leng Liuli, the liveliest of the three sisters, before Chu Liuyun could reply. As she spoke, she patted Bai Xiaofei’s head like how Bai Xiaofei normally patted Huskie’s.</p>
 <p>But since Leng Liuli was too short, she had to tiptoe to reach Bai Xiaofei’s head. This image completely shattered the “big sister” image Bai Xiaofei had in his mind. A pleasant scent drilled into Bai Xiaofei’s nostrils, and when he lowered his head, he was faced with a pair of fair bountiful peaks and a face of perfection.</p>
 <p><em>Amitabha! I need to control myself!</em> Bai Xiaofei swallowed as he forcefully suppressed the raging fire within his heart and quickly shifted his focus.</p>
 <p>“What do you mean? Are you trying to say that the Fist of the Beast students are terrified of you guys?”</p>
 <p>“Brother, you are underestimating us. The Fist of the Beast students are not the only ones terrified of us,” Yun Sheng said with a mysterious smirk. The others also had the same expression on their faces. Bai Xiaofei was stupefied. <em>What was going on? Why were they so confident?</em> But he did not dare to voice his doubt. They were all his seniors. If he said the wrong words, he might suffer…</p>
 <p>“Let’s go. You will understand what we are saying when the time comes. For now, only remember that the Demon of Illusions people need not bow!” Chu Liuyun declared and stopped Bai Xiaofei from guessing. There were things that one would never be able to understand by thinking about it and that were similarly hard to explain with words. The easiest way around this was to show him to help him understand. Bai Xiaofei was unable to understand why they were behaving this way, and he could only listen to them obediently.</p>
 <p>He had no choice but to obey anyway, since he was running out of time. When they reached the main entrance of Demon of Illusions, they saw that the bloodstain left by the six poor souls was still there. Because of that, Yun Sheng was berated again. The moment they appeared, the students from the Fist of the Beast keeping watch saw them. This time, they had smartened up and did not come looking for trouble. Rather, they went back and reported what they saw.</p>
 <p>“Are we allowing them to leave just like that?” Yun Sheng asked with indignation on his face. As far as he was concerned, it was an insult to the Demon of Illusions. Only by crushing the scouts would he be able to vent his anger.</p>
 <p>“We are here to attract their attention. After beating up their scouts, are you going to be the one telling them about our whereabouts?” Chu Liuyun berated. She was as ruthless as ever when speaking to Yun Sheng. As for Yun Sheng, he was already used to bowing before Chu Liuyun. It wasn’t like he had any other choice. He was not her match!</p>
 <p>“We can’t be strolling aimlessly around right?” Leng Liushuang, who looked like an obedient child, always spoke meekly. But her meekness did not imply bashfulness. It was simply a trait of hers, just like some people would be tall while some people would be short. Therefore, one should never think that she was the easiest to bully among the three sisters just because of her voice. None of the three could be easily bullied. Of course, Bai Xiaofei was still unaware of that…</p>
 <p>“Let’s go shopping. We’ll use my card,” Bai Xiaofei offered leisurely, stunning the five of them.</p>
 <p>“For real?” The three sisters turned and screeched. Three pairs of watery eyes gazed straight at Bai Xiaofei, making him feel like he was going to drown in those eyes.</p>
 <p>“Yes…,” Bai Xiaofei said hesitantly, his confidence from earlier nowhere to be seen. For some reason, he was having a bad premonition…</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Xiaofei, I knew you were the best!”</p>
 <p>“When we come back, I will make you a big meal as a reward!”</p>
 <p>“Do you want me to warm your bed for you tonight?”</p>
 <p>The moment Bai Xiaofei replied, the three sisters surrounded him. Leng Liuli and Leng Liushuang each hugged one of his arms, while the bravest, Leng Liuying, directly wrapped her arms around Bai Xiaofei’s neck. She winked at him before speaking with a tone of voice that could kill all men. “Remember, you can’t go back on your word.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s heart beat wildly.</p>
 <p>“Senior sisters, if you let go of me, I will keep my promise,” Bai Xiaofei forced those words out of his mouth after swallowing. The three sisters immediately leaped away from him. Each of them wore a wide smile, as if they had seen the funniest thing in the world.</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Liuyun, see, I told you Xiaofei won’t be able to resist us!”</p>
 <p>“I heard his heart beating so fast just now.”</p>
 <p>“Pfft. That’s nothing. Do you know what I felt when I pasted my body against him?”</p>
 <p>The three sisters spoke one after another, but after the final sentence spoken by Leng Liuying, the roaring laughter stopped. They looked at her with an odd gaze. Leng Liuying immediately blushed when she realized she had misspoken. As for Bai Xiaofei, he quickly turned his back to them. Why? Because a certain Demon of Illusions “member” was currently standing upright…</p>
