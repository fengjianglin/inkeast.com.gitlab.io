 <p>Chapter 1000: On-Site Teaching!</p> 
 <p>“Assemble!”</p> 
 <p>The happy bath time soon became a thing of the past with Bai Xiaofei’s order. Everyone immediately jumped out of the pond.</p> 
 <p>The morning’s exhaustion had been washed away by a meal and a bath. The group was energetic as they stood in front of Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Looking all chipper, aren’t you? Well then, let’s start our second course of today’s training,” Bai Xiaofei announced.</p> 
 <p>Everyone immediately pricked up their ears. After the experience in the morning, no one had the guts to raise objections. After all, the physical fatigue had been washed away, but the mental fatigue remained.</p> 
 <p>Recalling the feeling of being drained to their limit, everyone trembled.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t be so nervous, the content is very simple,” Bai Xiaofei comforted. Just when everyone was ready to hear their fate, he said, “Come together and beat me to the ground!”</p> 
 <p>With that, Bai Xiaofei rushed out, and his first target, Zhuang Shuo was sent flying. Then, the men either took off like him or punched down to the ground. Although Bai Xiaofei held back his strength, he made sure that it did not feel good.</p> 
 <p>By the time the men came to their senses, they had already kissed the ground.</p> 
 <p>“Go!!!” someone yelled, finally pulling the group together.</p> 
 <p>However, being responsive and being able to keep up with Bai Xiaofei’s speed were two different concepts, even though he had deliberately slowed down to be just a hint faster than whoever he was facing.</p> 
 <p>“Shall we go?” Looking at the mighty Bai Xiaofei who was beating up people left and right, Zhu Chunyang swallowed hard.</p> 
 <p>“If he wanted us to, Zhuang Shuo wouldn’t have been the first to fly.” Tan Xin looked at Zhu Chunyang like looking at an idiot.</p> 
 <p>Zhu Chunyang was confused. “Then who would it be? The three of us? He wouldn’t dare…”</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin shook her head with a sigh. “Us two, he really dares not, but you?”</p> 
 <p>Poor Zhu Chunyang had actually put himself on the same level as Tan Xin…</p> 
 <p>After being ruthlessly given a reality check, a scowling Zhu Chunyang still couldn’t resist asking, “So we just stand here and watch?”</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingtong finally couldn’t bear it anymore. “Can’t you see his intention? Look carefully, what is he doing?”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Zhu Chunyang began to watch the match seriously.</p> 
 <p>“When someone approaches you from behind, your first reaction should not be to look back, but to duck while counter-attacking at the same time! Turning around is equal to delivering your head to them!” One unlucky man was smacked flying as Bai Xiaofei used him as an example for a lesson.</p> 
 <p>“You only know how to fight back with your hands and feet? Is the dagger beside your leg just a decoration?!” Bai Xiaofei grasped the wrist of another in a counterattack and kicked his butt.</p> 
 <p>“Such loud noises and turtle speeds when doing sneak attacks?! Trying to give me time to handle you?!” Appearing behind a person in a flicker, Bai Xiaofei hand-chopped his neck.</p> 
 <p>“A numerical advantage has its tactics. Why are you coming at me one by one? Afraid of scaring me?! All together, do you understand?! Or is your number advantage for nothing?!” Bai Xiaofei took down one after another as he voiced his dissatisfaction. Only then did the men realize that their equipment was dedicated to besieging the opponent.</p> 
 <p>“Lock hook!” a battered Zhuang Shuo suddenly shouted as he crawled up.</p> 
 <p>A group of men instantly held up Bai Xiaofei while the rest of the people scrambled to take out their lock hooks. However, the item flustered them.</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother, how do you use this thing?!” one bitterly asked.</p> 
 <p>Zhuang Shuo stared at his lock hook and sank into thought. In the end…</p> 
 <p>“Whatever it is, just throw!!” He decided to blindly go for it out of desperation.</p> 
 <p>The rest immediately threw out their lock hooks like madmen.</p> 
 <p>“You fools, look over here!” Bai Xiaofei suddenly shouted, and a lock hook that he had snatched from someone was thrown out.</p> 
 <p>Before Zhuang Shuo could even react, the hook had wrapped around his ankle and he was jerked down to the ground.</p> 
 <p>“This is a customized lock hook. You just need to press the mechanism when you pull, and it will automatically retract. During that time, you can decide whether to throw out a dagger or think about what you intend to do with the target.”</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei gave his lesson, the hook in his hand had taken down several people. Finally, he demonstrated his words by throwing the dagger at a stone and splitting it into pieces.</p> 
 <p>“You’ve been equipped with a lot of similar equipment. If you use them skillfully enough, it’s not impossible for you to take me down,” Bai Xiaofei concluded.</p> 
 <p>The men immediately revealed looks of enlightenment. However, reality was cruel like this:</p> 
 <p>Eyes: I see!</p> 
 <p>Brain: Lesson learned!</p> 
 <p>Hands: What the hell is this?!</p> 
 <p>The whole afternoon, Bai Xiaofei was a tireless perpetual motion machine while the 600-odd men were exhausted. When the sun went down, they still failed to feel the joy of taking him down.</p> 
 <p>“Ahh, looks like you guys are still lacking.” Bai Xiaofei, the only standing one in the field, remarked with a sigh before his eyes fell upon the trio of Zhu Chunyang.</p> 
 <p>“Watching this whole afternoon hasn’t been for nothing, has it?” he chuckled.</p> 
 <p>Zhu Chunyang immediately felt goosebumps all over. “What do you want?!” he shouted while backing away, even readying his Godly Speed Technique.</p> 
 <p>“I have no worries about Sister Qingtong and Xin’er, but you… Use your Third Realm directly!” said Bai Xiaofei as he suddenly accelerated to a speed that exceeded what he had shown the whole afternoon. “Watch your back!”</p> 
 <p>Zhu Chunyang was half a beat slower, but when Bai Xiaofei appeared behind him, he ducked his head and slightly dodged sideways, while at the same time pulling out the dagger at his leg with his right hand and stabbing down.</p> 
 <p>The beautifully executed counterattack forced Bai Xiaofei to retreat. During this brief period, Zhu Chunyang had grabbed his lock hook with his left hand. By the time he turned his body, the hook had completed a rotation of accumulating momentum before it was thrown at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Great response, but the accuracy needs more work.” Bai Xiaofei wriggled slightly to avoid the hook, but this also slowed him down.</p> 
 <p>Zhu Chunyang seized this opportunity to abandon the lock hook and sprinted at Bai Xiaofei with the horrifying speed of his Third Realm. Even though he was still slower than Bai Xiaofei, this speed was good enough for a surprise attack!</p> 
 <p>The moment he approached Bai Xiaofei, a small flexible net was thrown out. At the same time, Zhu Chunyang pulled out the long blade at his waist and slashed down as the net covered Bai Xiaofei!</p> 
 <p>No matter how it looked, it was impossible for Bai Xiaofei to dodge. Bai Xiaofei inwardly applauded Zhu Chunyang’s series of reactions. He really didn’t waste the afternoon and had learned everything that had been taught!</p> 
 <p>However, their gap could not be filled with just one afternoon alone.</p> 
 <p>With a flash of cold light, the net was slashed in half by Mind Sunder, which then proceeded to parry Zhu Chunyang’s blade while Bai Xiaofei’s right hand grabbed at his neck.</p> 
 <p>Surprisingly, Zhu Chunyang seemed to have been prepared for this. The moment Bai Xiaofei took out Mind Sunder, he had switched to holding his blade with only one hand and raised his other hand to shoot a spring-loaded arrow.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, the spectators gasped. However, what happened next dealt a heavy blow to them.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei closed his eyes and let the arrow hit his face!</p> 
 <p>With a clang, the arrow wasn’t even able to scratch his skin. During this, Bai Xiaofei had grabbed Zhu Chunyang’s neck and pressed him to the ground.</p> 
 <p><em>Oh, dear heavens! Just how thick is his face?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Mhm, not bad. Keep working hard, and you will be able to beat me one day,” Bai Xiaofei praised with a chuckle and loosened his grasp.</p> 
 <p>Zhu Chunyang got up with a wry smile, finally having had a deep understanding of how terrifying Bai Xiaofei was. “You mean in the next life?! With your monster-like body, this life is impossible,” he sincerely remarked.</p> 
 <p>“Not bad, you’re also very self-aware!” Bai Xiaofei patted his shoulder and quickly walked away.</p> 
 <p>The ‘praise’ had Zhu Chunyang freeze for a moment before he exploded, “Fickle Bai!! I’ll kill you!!!”</p> 
 <p>His roar echoed in the empty field. The 600-odd people present all sympathized with him, but none of them dared to stand up for him for fear of being beaten…</p> 
 <p>“What are your plans exactly?”</p> 
 <p>As night fell and everyone was enjoying their dinner break, Ye Qingtong came to Bai Xiaofei and voiced her doubts.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, he did not satisfy her curiosity this time.</p> 
 <p>“You’ll know soon enough. Believe me, you’ll be surprised!”</p>
