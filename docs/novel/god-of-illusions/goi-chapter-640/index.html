 <p>Chapter 641: All Cards Revealed!</p> 
 <p>Finishing the wine that An Yue offered, a warmth rushed through Bai Xiaofei’s body.</p> 
 <p>“Hm? This wine…” Bai Xiaofei’s expression suddenly changed!</p> 
 <p>His origin energy, the wine was eroding the energy in his body at an extremely fast speed! He wouldn’t be able to recover even in the Endless State!</p> 
 <p>In fright, Bai Xiaofei’s first reaction was to mobilize the remaining energy to grab An Bang Ting in front of him. However, An Yue had obviously anticipated this and had stepped in front of An Bang Ting.</p> 
 <p>His palm turning into a fist, Bai Xiaofei punched An Yue flying, but just as he was about to grab An Bang Ting, a patch of blood-colored, silky threads suddenly bloomed under his feet and firmly wrapped around him.</p> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei finally broke free from the threads, his origin energy had been completely drained. However, that warm feeling did not dissipate from his body until his physical strength was exhausted as well.</p> 
 <p>Huskie and Blackie realized something was wrong and instantly jumped to Bai Xiaofei’s front, glaring at An Bang Ting.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the Leng sisters fared even worse than Bai Xiaofei. They didn’t even have the strength to stand up. Zheng Gong and Zhi Daoyuan were also going through the same experience. The originally lively banquet came to an abrupt silence after they lost all ability to resist.</p> 
 <p>“Do it,” said An Bang Ting lightly.</p> 
 <p>The guards around instantly moved. The unsuspecting Zheng Gong and Zhi Daoyuan died under the blades of the guards with their eyes wide open.</p> 
 <p>“F*ck off!” The guards who rushed to Bai Xiaofei’s group were all beaten back by A’Tao.</p> 
 <p>Looking at A’Tao in front of him, Bai Xiaofei’s heart was warmed, but An Bang Ting’s words caused him to turn cold before he could speak.</p> 
 <p>“What are you doing?!” An Bang Ting showed no fear toward A’Tao at all. The tone he used was that of a superior questioning his underling.</p> 
 <p>“Nothing. He is my master. I don’t want him to die at the hands of these small fries,” A’Tao’s icy voice replied.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei painfully smiled. Sweeping his eyes around the high platform, he suddenly looked up at the sky and burst out laughing.</p> 
 <p>“Formidable, very formidable!”</p> 
 <p>Lying down on his seat, Bai Xiaofei took a deep breath. The excessive consumption of physical strength made him tired even while talking, but the heart-rending pain told him that it was not the time to stop. Even if he died, he wanted to thoroughly understand why!</p> 
 <p>“You’ve won, you’ve all won, but there are many things I can’t figure out. You don’t mind letting me be a knowing ghost, do you?” His face full of bitterness, Bai Xiaofei looked at An Bang Ting and at A’Tao whose back was facing him. “My good disciple, this wish of your teacher is not too much, is it?!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s heart-wrenching voice made A’Tao tremble slightly. As he slowly turned around, his eyes were red and two lines of tears were streaming down.</p> 
 <p>“A’Tao is so sorry, Master…”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s heart jerked at the boy’s miserable appearance. He could see that A’Tao wasn’t faking it, and in this situation, there was no need to at all.</p> 
 <p>“Allow me to explain then.” The angry An Bang Ting suddenly calmed down and quietly looked at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“I’m all ears!” Bai Xiaofei spat out these words with difficulty and fixed his eyes on An Bang Ting.</p> 
 <p>“Much of what I told you before is true.”</p> 
 <p>The first sentence earned a bitter sneer from Bai Xiaofei. However, it also comforted him. If this had all been some made-up story, it would hurt him too terribly to end up like this for a lie.</p> 
 <p>“I did all this for my Consort Rui, and everything about her is true, except a little of what happened during this period.” An Bang Ting started to reveal the details, “After she caught a strange disease, I went crazy. I ordered the imperial physicians and doctors to be killed, after which I realized my mistake. However, no one in the whole city blamed me, including A’Tao.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was shocked. <em>He went that far overboard and no one blamed him?!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei looked at A’Tao. Although having his heart broken to pieces by this disciple, he could only look to him for verification.</p> 
 <p>“We could all understand the emperor. Moreover, my father and the doctors made an oath when they went to treat Lady Rui that if they failed to save her, they would apologize with their lives!”</p> 
 <p>A’Tao thoroughly confirmed what An Bang Ting just said. Only now did Bai Xiaofei see the madness of this country. This was no longer reverence, but blind fanaticism! An Bang Ting had become akin to a state religion!</p> 
 <p>“I gave up on trying to treat her after that. I really wanted to follow her to the underworld then. I was too tired,” An Bang Ting recounted with pain and struggle on his face. “However, it was then that Lin Rui and Lin Xiu returned from their trip.”</p> 
 <p>The rims of An Bang Ting’s eyes turned red. Lin Rui and Lin Xiu were the two ‘Teachers of the Nation’ who had been beheaded on the high platform.</p> 
 <p>“Those two earlier?!” Bai Xiaofei’s face was full of disbelief. According to what An Bang Ting revealed, the title ‘evil spawn’ was all made up because there would be no Tranquil people who would trick An Bang Ting. But if that was the case, there was no reason for An Bang Ting to order their execution.</p> 
 <p>However, An Bang Ting nodded slowly.</p> 
 <p>“Do you think we didn’t know you before you came? You underestimate your fame. Maybe ordinary people may not hear of you, but your deeds have spread among the major empires.”</p> 
 <p>“Lin Rui and Lin Xiu knew that it’s impossible to completely nullify your combat ability using the wine refined with the Energy Devouring Worms alone, so they gave their lives to create the blood silk forest under your feet because there’s no one in Tranquil who can contain you.”</p> 
 <p>Tears flowed uncontrollably down An Bang Ting’s face as such an arrangement was not what he wanted, but he was out of options.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei was no longer just shocked, he was beyond flabbergasted. All this information kept refreshing his understanding of Tranquil over and over again, and it still looked as if there was no ceiling to its limit!</p>
