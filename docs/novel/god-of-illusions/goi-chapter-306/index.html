 <p>Chapter 306: Dialogue, Hearing about Bai Longfei Again!</p> 
 <p>“Why, is it something that you can't say?” asked Bai Xiaofei when he saw Old Man Illusionary freeze.</p> 
 <p>“No, it's just that I didn't expect you’d ask this question,” replied the old man with a trace of loss in his voice, as if he had sunk into some memories.</p> 
 <p>“You weren't the guardian here before, were you? Or, let me put it another way, were you from the continent?” From just an expression, Bai Xiaofei made a very close guess.</p> 
 <p>“That’s right, I used to be a puppet master on the continent. Because I said something I shouldn't have, my body was destroyed. Lei Shan, who was present, used a soul tool to store my soul, and then I became the guardian of this Illusionary Sandboard.”</p> 
 <p>A not-so-long speech gave an amount of information that had Bai Xiaofei reflect for half a day.</p> 
 <p>“Are you a survivor from the ruins?” Bai Xiaofei asked softly, his eyes shining brightly.</p> 
 <p>“You know of the ruins?!” Old Man Illusionary was a little surprised, and he looked at Bai Xiaofei in disbelief.</p> 
 <p>“I heard it from someone else.” When Bai Xiaofei said this, the old man couldn't help but feel relieved. It wasn’t like the ruins couldn't be discussed, only that the exact situation inside was forbidden to be spread.</p> 
 <p>“I did come out of the ruins, and the destruction of the flesh was also because I said something about the ruins,” the old man finally answered Bai Xiaofei’s question with a sigh and regret in his voice. If he had known any of that would happen, he wouldn't have even tried!</p> 
 <p>“Can anyone outside see and hear what we are saying now?” Bai Xiaofei suddenly asked a question completely unrelated to the previous topic.</p> 
 <p>“Apart from your command scenes, nothing you say here will be known to anyone, and I will not reveal it to anyone,” Old Man Illusionary gave a reassuring answer with a smile.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei grew obviously excited.</p> 
 <p>“Do you know Bai Longfei?” Bai Xiaofei asked the question he wanted to ask most!</p> 
 <p>“Bai Longfei?!” Alarmed, Old Man Illusionary began to scan Bai Xiaofei from top to bottom for half a day, but he didn’t seem to see what he wanted to. “What is your relationship with him?”</p> 
 <p>“He is my biological father.”</p> 
 <p>“But you don't look alike at all!”</p> 
 <p>“I may look more like my mother, although I’ve never seen either of them.”</p> 
 <p>The last time it had been Revelation who answered this similar question. This time Bai Xiaofei had only had himself to rely on…</p> 
 <p>Old Man Illusionary was still suspicious upon Bai Xiaofei’s answer as he kept shaking his head and muttering, “Not alike, not alike…” But after whispering for a while, he still chose to answer.</p> 
 <p>“I do know that little fellow Bai Longfei. Although he was only of the Exquisite Rank, he had the strength to compete with a Legend Rank. In the end, he successfully emerged from the ruins. Should no accident happen, he must now be at least peak-grade Legend Rank.” From the approval when he said this, the old man obviously regarded Bai Xiaofei's father very highly.</p> 
 <p>“He's gone…” Bai Xiaofei’s tone was laced with a hint of loss, for he still had some attachment for this father who he had never met. After all, he gave him life and gave him a playmate – Huskie – who had accompanied him since childhood.</p> 
 <p>“How is it possible?! There’s someone on this continent capable of killing him?! How did he die?!” exclaimed Old Man Illusionary, his face once again full of disbelief.</p> 
 <p>“I don't know, my group of foster parents only know that my father was badly injured. As for who did that to him, they don't know anything. I’ve come out exactly to investigate this matter!” Bai Xiaofei grew emotional as he spoke, subconsciously clenching his fists.</p> 
 <p>“If so, I suggest you visit the Ethereal Empire when you have time. There is a girl named Lan Qiushuang. She should know more about your father than all of us.”</p> 
 <p>As soon as the old man said this, Bai Xiaofei was immediately pleasantly surprised. This was definitely the most useful news he had received since leaving the Gorge of Heroes.</p> 
 <p>However, on second thought, Bai Xiaofei's brow wrinkled again. Looking for a person in an empire was no different from looking for a needle in a haystack.</p> 
 <p>“Don't look so disheartened. The Lan clan is a large family clan in the Ethereal Empire. It shouldn't be difficult to find the girl.” Old Man Illusionary instantly knew what Bai Xiaofei was thinking from his face. Stroking his beard, the old man nonchalantly added a piece of information that delighted Bai Xiaofei again.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you, grandpa!” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly thanked him, then suddenly remembered something. “Erm, grandpa, how old is this ‘girl’ you mentioned?”</p> 
 <p>Indeed, Bai Xiaofei had just recalled that Lei Shan also called Luo Xi a little girl. For these grandfathers who had lived for who-knew-how-long, under the age of 80 was still young.</p> 
 <p>“She should be in her 50s, very young, and very pretty to boot!” the old man said with a sleazy chuckle, and his grand image disappeared in a puff of smoke…</p> 
 <p>A cold drop of sweat ran down Bai Xiaofei’s back as it turned out just like he had suspected.</p> 
 <p><em>A pretty girl in her 50s… Why does this sound so awkward? Then what are Hu Xian’er and Lin Li? There are no suitable words to describe them anymore!</em></p> 
 <p>Keeping his complaints locked in his heart, Bai Xiaofei looked at Old Man Illusionary.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you, grandpa, I’ll remember this!” This came from the bottom of Bai Xiaofei's heart. The conversation had saved him many unnecessary detours in his search.</p> 
 <p>“Is there anything else you want to ask, little fellow?” Perhaps because Bai Xiaofei was the son of Bai Longfei, the old man’s attitude had actually improved a lot.</p> 
 <p>“No… Wait, there is another question.” Bai Xiaofei changed his words halfway.</p> 
 <p>“If you ask, I'll tell you!” Hearing that Bai Xiaofei still had more questions, the old man wasn’t impatient at all and even looked quite happy, which was understandable. He had been guarding the Illusionary Sandboard for decades, saying and doing the same things almost every day. Therefore, he was very excited to finally see someone who he could tell his past to.</p> 
 <p>“Do you know Vice Principal Luo Xi? Why does she hate people surnamed Bai so much?” Bai Xiaofei instinctively shuddered as the picture of Luo Xi’s dark and cold face popped in his mind.</p> 
 <p>Upon this question, the old man froze for two seconds, then began to laugh hysterically for a good while.</p> 
 <p>“Karma, ahhh! It's all karma!” Old Man Illusionary didn’t immediately answer Bai Xiaofei's question but sighed emotionally with a wry smile on his face.</p> 
 <p>“Grandpa, what do you mean?” Gulping hard, Bai Xiaofei suddenly had a bad feeling…</p>
