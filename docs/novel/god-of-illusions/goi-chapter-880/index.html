 <p>Chapter 880: The Little Ancestor is Back!</p> 
 <p>“You obviously don’t know. You there, speak!” Seeing the confused look on Ling Ge’s face, the girl turned to the horrified Yun Tianhe.</p> 
 <p>“Sorry, I don’t know Bai Xiaofei very well. I only met him once, but he seems to have left a long time ago,” Yun Tianhe hurriedly lied. As far as the girl’s strength was concerned, he could not guarantee that Bai Xiaofei was a match for her if she was really an enemy.</p> 
 <p>“That bastard! He agreed to wait for me in the Imperial City, but he ran away??! When I catch him, I will skin him alive!!” The girl suddenly erupted in fury.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Yun Tianhe stared blankly. <em>It’s over. I got it wrong…</em></p> 
 <p>“Er… Miss, you know Bai Xiaofei?” Gulping, he could not stop himself from asking.</p> 
 <p>“I am his fiancee,” said the girl lightly, but her face was full of pride.</p> 
 <p>“I heard that Bai Xiaofei’s girlfriends are all students of Starnet, but your age…” Yun Tianhe probed while still retaining some wariness.</p> 
 <p>“I met him outside, can’t I?” The girl snorted, then stared deeply at Yun Tianhe. “You are so concerned about him, and yet you said you don’t know him very well? Looks like you don’t want your little girlfriend to live.”</p> 
 <p>Facing her sudden change of attitude, Yun Tianhe froze. <em>Damn me for running my mouth…</em></p> 
 <p>“Heroic miss, please! I was just curious!” However, he had no plans to sell Bai Xiaofei out, so he played dumb.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t tell me you think that I’m his enemy? Or did he say something to you? Like if a woman looks for him, just say that he is gone?!” The girl had obviously decided that Yun Tianhe knew Bai Xiaofei’s whereabouts.</p> 
 <p>“Ah! Is Bai Xiaofei that guy who paid to redeem Mu Yun at the Moon Beck Pavilion earlier?!”</p> 
 <p>While Yun Tianhe was racking his brains to make up a lie, Ling Ge’s exclamation nearly caused him to collapse on his knees…</p> 
 <p>The princess was still too green!</p> 
 <p>“What?! Moon Beck Pavilion?! Redeem a woman?! I see he’s tired of living!!!”</p> 
 <p>The girl again exploded in fury. When Yun Tianhe came to his senses, she had already disappeared.</p> 
 <p><em>Such speed…</em></p> 
 <p>“Lil’ Bro, she’s not your enemy, but that doesn’t seem to make your situation better…” Yun Tianhe sincerely sighed as he expressed his condolences for Bai Xiaofei in advance.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei had finished star-gazing with Mu Yun. As he was about to send her back to rest, a chill assaulted his spine…</p> 
 <p>“BAI! XIAO! FEI!!!”</p> 
 <p>Three words full of murderous intent echoed at the entrance of the Moon Beck Pavilion. Although the voice had changed a little, Bai Xiaofei still recognized it right away.</p> 
 <p><em>Tan Xin!</em></p> 
 <p>“You go back first, I have something to deal with.” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly pushed Mu Yun back and jumped off the roof just as Tan Xin was about to burst the door. Upon landing and seeing her, he was shocked…</p> 
 <p>Long legs and small waist, oval face with delicate features, and most importantly, her size… </p> 
 <p><em>Wasn’t she a loli?! How did she grow so fast?!</em></p> 
 <p>However, there was one place that hadn’t changed… much. It had only bulged up a little…</p> 
 <p>“What’s that face you’re making? Can I understand it as you’ve lived enough and want to be buried early?” Seeing that Bai Xiaofei’s reaction was not as she had hoped, Tan Xin squeezed her fists.</p> 
 <p>The cracking sound of her knuckles ran a chill down Bai Xiaofei’s spine! Considering that there weren’t many things that could scare him now…</p> 
 <p>“Of course not! I’m just… a little taken aback. I didn’t expect your closed-door training to mean this…” He gulped, pointing here and there at Tan Xin’s body.</p> 
 <p>“In fact, when we were at the Boundless Flower Sea, I once forcefully made myself grow to this form. You were just too nosy and missed the time frame!” Bai Xiaofei’s words gave Tan Xin some confidence, and the anger on her face was suppressed by pride.</p> 
 <p>“So… then…” Bai Xiaofei awkwardly stuttered. He wanted to ask Tan Xin what plan she had next but didn’t dare to, because he only needed to think with his toes to know…</p> 
 <p>“Don’t change the subject! Do you still remember what I said before I left?” Returning to the main business, Tan Xin had a murderous look on her face.</p> 
 <p>“I can explain! It’s absolutely, absolutely not what you think!” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly blurted out, but right after that, he was surprised at himself.</p> 
 <p><em>Damn it, why do I need to explain to her?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Oh? Then tell me about it. You have thirty seconds.” Tan Xin had a look of ‘I’m ready to enjoy the show.’</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei, who felt no need to explain one second ago, immediately opened his mouth and briefed everything he could about Yun Tianhe and Mu Yun’s situation in 30 seconds before heaving a long sigh of relief.</p> 
 <p>“So you’re saying you came to this brothel in disguise for justice?” Tan Xin did not turn over the page as Bai Xiaofei had expected. <em>Wanna gloss it over me? You’re still too young!</em></p> 
 <p>He quickly brainstormed and said, “You know, in a place like this imperial capital, I need connections to do certain things, and Yun Tianhe is a very important connection for me.”</p> 
 <p>The correct answer to a fatal question is definitely not to try your best to convince the other party to believe in you, but to change the subject along with your reply!</p> 
 <p>“What do you want to do?” Although Tan Xin was experienced, her experience lost to his talent in fooling people…</p> 
 <p>“Did you forget why we came here? I’ve gotten a lead.” Bai Xiaofei successfully steered the conversation in a new direction. As long as Tan Xin stopped worrying about the ‘brothel’ matter, anything else was not a problem for him!</p> 
 <p>“Lead?! What lead?! You found a suspicious target?” Tan Xin immediately grew excited. The human puppet matter was serious, and the feeling of being involved in something grand gave Tan Xin a thrill that she could not refuse.</p> 
 <p>After all, Tan Xin once got herself involved in a whirlpool seeking excitement.</p> 
 <p>“Not yet, but I came across a group of old enemies and taught them a lesson,” Bai Xiaofei said, and then narrated what he had been doing over the last month so that Tan Xin could catch up.</p> 
 <p>“In that case, we’ve encountered something very interesting in Ethereal!” Tan Xin summed up and laughed.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei smiled. <em>Of course it will be interesting!</em></p>
