 <p>Chapter 329: Problem!</p> 
 <p>“I haven’t even said what it is yet and you already refused?!” Yun Jingshuang instantly blew up. If it weren’t for his good temper, he would have already attacked since Bai Xiaofei wasn’t a match for him anyway!</p> 
 <p>“Is there any need to say it? I can already tell from your reluctant expression, you just want to say that you will graduate soon and hope that I can take over the Blossom Ranking before you leave.”</p> 
 <p>Yun Jingshuang was stupefied.</p> 
 <p><em>Is it that obvious?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Well, maybe…</em></p> 
 <p>Yun Jingshuang smiled wryly and didn’t deny Bai Xiaofei’s words. Indeed, he did have special feelings for the Blossom Ranking. If it wasn’t for it, he might already have left after Ling Luo’s incident…</p> 
 <p>“I can’t find anyone more suitable than you,” Yun Jingshuang said sincerely, he didn’t want to give up just like that.</p> 
 <p>“Didn’t you say that I was too capable of attracting bees and butterflies and that I would just wreak havoc to the entire ranking? I think you were right, my self-control isn’t praise-worthy.” Bai Xiaofei’s reason was quite sufficient, and it was also given by Yun Jingshuang.</p> 
 <p>“If your self-control isn’t strong, Hu Xian’er wouldn’t be the only one you pushed down.”</p> 
 <p>“The heck?! You’re still watching me?!” Bai Xiaofei jumped as soon as he heard Yun Jingshuang’s words.</p> 
 <p>After knowing Yun Jingshuang’s ability, Bai Xiaofei had made an agreement with him, forbidding him from monitoring his life, but now it seemed that Yun Jingshuang couldn’t control his curiosity.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t you wrong me, do you really think I need to keep constant watch to know your whereabouts? You underestimate your reputation. Huskie’s ability can’t help you hide from everyone. If I hadn’t been suppressing it, I’m afraid that your relationship with Hu Xian’er would have been made public long ago.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was shocked by this explanation. He could see that Yun Jingshuang hadn’t made this up.</p> 
 <p>“So, I advise you to announce it already. It’s better to admit it yourself than be exposed. That way you won’t end up too miserable,” Yun Jingshuang added, and Bai Xiaofei’s expression settled down.</p> 
 <p>“I was going to do it without you having to remind me, I’ve just been too busy recently. How much do the people you mentioned know about the two of us?” Bai Xiaofei gulped and asked, inwardly feeling nervous about the possible answer.</p> 
 <p>He wasn’t afraid that others knew of his relationship with Hu Xian’er, but he didn’t want them to know the details as this wasn’t good for her.</p> 
 <p>“Not to the extent that you are worried about, they only know that you two are quite close.”</p> 
 <p>Yun Jingshuang’s words calmed Bai Xiaofei’s anxious heart, but he was still determined to resolve this problem soon. Yun Jingshuang was right, active was always better than passive!</p> 
 <p>“Thank you, I will resolve it as soon as possible,” said Bai Xiaofei earnestly with a solemn expression.</p> 
 <p>“I’m not worried about you. However, I hope you can reconsider regarding the Blossom Ranking. As I said, I can’t find a second person in the entire academy who has no lousy ideas about the Blossom Ranking,” Yun Jingshuang once again mentioned this topic with a hint of pleading in his voice.</p> 
 <p>“You can look at the girls for this. They certainly don’t have those kinds of thoughts about the Blossom Ranking.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei kicked the ball to someone else. He was really afraid of trouble. Just talking about the Blossom competition alone, if it weren’t for all kinds of things just piling up together, he wouldn’t have had to go through so much trouble. He wholeheartedly desired carefree days, not a ‘full’ day when he had to be busy from the moment he opened his eyes to the moment he turned off the lights.</p> 
 <p>“It’s not that simple. A girl’s world is more complicated than you think, and they may have no such ideas, but what if someone they know does? There is no second student like you in Starnet who has no social connections but is qualified to take over the Blossom Ranking.”</p> 
 <p>Yun Jingshuang’s affirmation of Bai Xiaofei was real, and moreover, Bai Xiaofei was indeed a fledgling. While it looked like he knew a lot of people now and some of them were even in power in major merchant groups, those people were at best partners to him and not his friends.</p> 
 <p>Moreover, with Bai Xiaofei’s character, even if he came into contact with more and more people in the future, he would not accept unreasonable demands on the Blossom Ranking. This was something everyone who knew Bai Xiaofei could guarantee!</p> 
 <p>“Then what about me after that? I will graduate in four years!” Bai Xiaofei somewhat compromised when he said this. He couldn’t truly refuse Yun Jingshuang, because he already regarded the latter as his friend from the bottom of his heart.</p> 
 <p>“That’s your business. You have four years to find someone to take over. You can even train one yourself. I believe that your vision is definitely much better than mine!” Yun Jingshuang smiled when he noticed Bai Xiaofei’s change of attitude.</p> 
 <p>“So you’ve confirmed that I’m the one.” Gulping hard, Bai Xiaofei cast over a look of inquiry.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, I’ve confirmed!” Yun Jingshuang firmly stated.</p> 
 <p>The two stared at each other for several dozens of seconds. In this long silence, the atmosphere grew strange, and finally, it was Bai Xiaofei who couldn’t stand it.</p> 
 <p><em>Your mother! How can a face like this grow on a man?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Well, I can agree, but you have to answer a few questions without reservations first,” Bai Xiaofei finally said in resignation.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll tell you everything I know!” Yun Jingshuang’s eyes shone with pleasant surprise.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t be happy too early. You might not want to answer my questions. Take some time to reconsider, I’ll give you a chance to refuse!” Bai Xiaofei gazed at Yun Jingshuang seriously as if he was going to say something huge.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Yun Jingshuang’s delight froze on his face. He hesitated because he could see that Bai Xiaofei wasn’t joking, and he did have something he didn’t want to tell anyone.</p> 
 <p>After what seemed like half a day, Yun Jingshuang made up his mind. The worst thing would only be spilling his secret to Bai Xiaofei alone, while Blossom Ranking must not be left unattended!</p> 
 <p><em>What’s more, what he wants to ask might not be what I am worried about!</em></p> 
 <p>Thinking to himself, Yun Jingshuang’s face grew resolute.</p> 
 <p>“Ask away!”</p> 
 <p>Looking at the Yun Jingshuang with the determination to ‘die,’ Bai Xiaofei revealed a shallow smile.</p> 
 <p><em>Senior, you still underestimate me!</em></p> 
 <p>“Do you know Yun Sheng?”</p> 
 <p>This question was asked very lightly, but it successfully made Yun Jingshuang’s heart tighten. However, he controlled it and didn’t let anything show.</p> 
 <p>“Of course I know, there are only so many in the Demon of Illusions. He is also 10th on the Combat Ranking. How can I not know with my intel network?”</p> 
 <p>Yun Jingshuang said casually, but Bai Xiaofei only gave him a look of ‘I don’t buy it.’</p> 
 <p>“You know I don’t mean that kind of ‘know.’”</p> 
 <p>At this, all the calm left Yun Jingshuang and dejection took over his face.</p> 
 <p><em>Ahhh, I can’t escape it after all…</em></p>
