 <p>Chapter 259: Conclusion; Memorial</p> 
 <p>“For this kind of person, dying too quickly would be too good for him! Do you know what kind of agony a person has to go through before they choose suicide?! I've seen people commit suicide! That feeling of hopelessness is worse than death! If Di Jiang hadn't killed Di Hang himself, I’d certainly have let him experience what is ‘a life worse than death!’” When saying this, Bai Xiaofei seemed to completely change into another person. His twisted expression startled Jing Cheng and Chu Qingtian.</p> 
 <p>This… They never really thought of…</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, he's gonna die for sure anyway, I shouldn’t get so emotional.” Bai Xiaofei sat down again.</p> 
 <p>After a moment of silence, Chu Qingtian asked the last question, “Have you never considered the possibility that Di Jiang would be rescued after you leave with us?”</p> 
 <p>“Rescued? You think that’s possible? That the old man is going to continue paying attention to the Furnace of Agarwood after I left, or that Director Ran Qiu would continue to keep watch? The one who cleaned the room was the student in the Furnace of Agarwood who helped me out. I’ve already gone through the plan with them. I’ve considered all of the possibilities. Di Jiang shall never leave Starnet!”</p> 
 <p>With a cold snort, Bai Xiaofei threw all manners to the wind at the mention of Di Jiang.</p> 
 <p>“Moreover, you guys take Di Jiang too lightly. The information I got from the Babel Merchant House is quite explosive. Maybe he might have fought with his life for Starnet, but I can assure you, it was all to climb up the ladder, and only because he made sure he could get out safely beforehand. So, if he is released, Starnet will one day reap the consequences. No need to thank me for this, I just did it without any extra trouble.”</p> 
 <p>Having finished his speech, Bai Xiaofei stood up.</p> 
 <p>“Just who are you, exactly? You said you’d only been in Starnet for three months. I really don't believe it. Why do I feel that everyone in the academy is under your control now?!”</p> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei mentioned the Babel Merchant House, Chu Qingtian couldn’t keep his calm. He could imagine a huge network upon recalling what Bai Xiaofei had done, a net that had penetrated into every corner of Starnet!</p> 
 <p>“I am who I am, not anyone else. I’ve said everything I should. I only did some things that no one has done before. As for my network in Starnet, you can attribute it to my intelligence. After all, I see things that no one else can see.” Saying this with indifference, Bai Xiaofei looked in the direction of Starnet. “It's getting late, can the two vice principals consider taking me back? There’s still one last thing waiting for me to deal with. “</p> 
 <p>Looking at the starry night sky, Bai Xiaofei took a deep breath.</p> 
 <p><em>It's over…</em></p> 
 <p>On the way back, Bai Xiaofei had a long nap. Chu Qingtian and Jing Cheng kept glancing at this student, who they completely couldn’t figure out and even once thought of throwing him out because they really didn’t know whether it was the right decision to take him back. Before he had come, Starnet had been very quiet. But now, Bai Xiaofei had started to reopen old wounds…</p> 
 <p>However, the two decided to discard that idea in the end. If nothing else, they wouldn’t be able to pass through Revelation.</p> 
 <p>Facts prove that having a formidable master has a great influence on things, even if he doesn't teach you anything!</p> 
 <p>When the three returned to Starnet, it was the early morning of the next day, only that the gray atmosphere wasn’t as bright as before.</p> 
 <p>“Tell the old man everything I told you lest he remains in the dark. If he wants to handle me after that, I'll wait!” Dropping his words, Bai Xiaofei took his two puppets and jumped off the Sweeping Air Boat, walking away under the intent gazes of the two vice principals.</p> 
 <p>“How long has it been since Starnet has seen such a person?” asked Jing Cheng after Bai Xiaofei was out of sight.</p> 
 <p>“I don't remember, maybe there has never been one,” Chu Qingtian replied with mixed feelings.</p> 
 <p>“Say, are we really getting a little old?” Another question was asked. Jing Cheng had said a lot today.</p> 
 <p>“Not really, I guess? After all, the principal is still active. We should be better than him,” Chu Qingtian said as he started heading for the office area. Jing Cheng sighed and followed him closely. No matter what, they had to inform Lei Shan.</p> 
 <p>Back to Bai Xiaofei, who headed neither to the Demon of Illusions nor the Blossom Pavilion, but to a very remote direction.</p> 
 <p>This was the cemetery of Starnet.</p> 
 <p>“Finally, I've been waiting for you all night.” Sitting in front of a small tombstone, Yun Jingshuang greeted him in a voice filled with sorrow. New bouquets were placed on both sides of the tomb, but no words were inscribed on the tombstone itself.</p> 
 <p>“I thought there would be many people,” slowly stated Bai Xiaofei. Affected by the atmosphere, his mood also sank.</p> 
 <p>“Ling Luo didn’t want this matter to be known by many people. I made a mistake, so I can’t keep making her unhappy and let people come here.” With a wry smile, Yun Jingshuang looked at the tombstone with regret.</p> 
 <p>“She would understand.” Bai Xiaofei squatted down next to Yun Jingshuang. “Why are there no words on the tombstone?”</p> 
 <p>“I don't know what to write for such a girl.” Yun Jingshuang's answer was so direct that Bai Xiaofei couldn't help but frown.</p> 
 <p>After a moment of silence, Bai Xiaofei suddenly offered, “Then, do you mind if I write it for you?”</p> 
 <p>Yun Jingshuang moved his gaze from the tombstone for the first time and slowly turned to Bai Xiaofei. “You have this right.”</p> 
 <p>Reluctantly squeezing out a smile, Yun Jingshuang then moved aside.</p> 
 <p>Focusing origin energy on his finger, Bai Xiaofei scribbled on the tombstone for half a day before finally showing a satisfied smile.</p> 
 <p>“If she had met someone who could have given her these three words earlier, maybe that wouldn't have happened.” Two streaks of tears slipped down his eyes; the emotion that Yun Jingshuang had suppressed for a long time finally broke out, even if it was only in silence…</p> 
 <p>“It's raining… Do you think it’s Ling Luo looking upon us?”</p> 
 <p>Raising his hand to catch the drops, Bai Xiaofei looked up and closed his eyes, quietly feeling the rain.</p> 
 <p>The weeping Yun Jingshuang also looked towards the sky with the touch of a new, indescribable emotion in his eyes. He had already said the words he wanted to say to Ling Luo for an entire night last night. Now all that remained was silence.</p> 
 <p>“Bai Xiaofei…” After the rain washed away the tears, Yun Jingshuang suddenly spoke.</p> 
 <p>“What's the matter?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei looked back with a smile. The moment Yun Jingshuang saw it, he also smiled.</p> 
 <p>“Nothing, I just suddenly wanted to call your name.”</p> 
 <p>“The heck? What are you doing?! I already said I’m straight!” Bai Xiaofei subconsciously retreated two steps in panic.</p> 
 <p>“If you say that again, I will bend you!” Yun Jingshuang shot a vicious glare at Bai Xiaofei. He looked so scary that Bai Xiaofei repeatedly gulped.</p> 
 <p><em>This fellow isn’t joking!!!</em></p> 
 <p>“I have to go. If I don't return to the Demon of Illusions, I’d be erased from the list!” Hurriedly throwing an excuse, Bai Xiaofei turned to run for his life.</p> 
 <p>Looking at Bai Xiaofei’s back, Yun Jingshuang slowly revealed a smile.</p> 
 <p>“Goodbye, Ling Luo. If there is an afterworld, I hope you will be happier there.” Staring at the three words on the tombstone for a few seconds, Yun Jingshuang turned to leave.</p> 
 <p>Everything had passed, just like the words carved by Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>––A new tomorrow!</p>
