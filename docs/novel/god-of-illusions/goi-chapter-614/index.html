 <p>Chapter 614: The People’s Grievances!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t pay attention to the others’ reactions, he only quietly looked at the little boy in front of him. The latter’s response was even more straightforward –</p> 
 <p>Without a word, the boy knelt and kowtowed thrice on the ground.</p> 
 <p>“From now on, you are a disciple of I, Bai Xiaofei. Believe me, one day you will be proud of this title!” With a big smile, Bai Xiaofei patted A’Tao’s shoulder, then looked at the people around. “As you can see, I have accepted A’Tao as my disciple. Go back first. I will ask A’Tao about the details and will definitely give you a satisfactory answer!”</p> 
 <p>The group of commoners looked at each other and then at A’Tao for a long time without reacting to Bai Xiaofei’s words. Just as he started to frown, A’Tao suddenly spoke.</p> 
 <p>“Please go back, everyone. My teacher and I will bring my sister and your relatives back! I, A’Tao, swear on my father’s name!”</p> 
 <p>To Bai Xiaofei’s surprise, this speech that was nothing extraordinary actually persuaded everyone! Before long, the group of injured people left with heavy steps. Before they did, they thanked Bai Xiaofei and the triplets, some even said things like, “We entrust this to you, Masters.”</p> 
 <p>“Your father is very well-known?” Bai Xiaofei asked A’Tao after the people dispersed. But as soon as the question dropped, two lines of tears rolled down from the boy’s eyes.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t cry, don’t cry! Just tell Sister what happened?” Leng Liushuang hurriedly ran to A’Tao and gently wiped away his tears.</p> 
 <p>“Father died, Sister was taken away, A’Tao has no family now.” Although his tears kept flowing, the expression on his face did not change at all. His glare and the cruelty in those wide eyes were in stark contrast with the tears on his face.</p> 
 <p>“It’s alright, it will be okay. Don’t you have your teacher now? He is your family and he will help you save your sister. Then you won’t be alone.” Leng Liushuang was heartbroken to see A’Tao suffer like this.</p> 
 <p>Leng Liuli and Leng Liuying also squatted down to comfort him. Only Bai Xiaofei stood still and looked at him quietly.</p> 
 <p>Soon, A’Tao noticed Bai Xiaofei’s gaze. Quickly gathering his wits, he ran out from the triplets’ circle and stood straight in front of Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Master, A’Tao is wrong. A’Tao will never cry again!” The boy tried his best to hold back his tears, leaving only the unique stubbornness of a child on his face.</p> 
 <p>“This is not a place to talk, take me to your home.” Bai Xiaofei’s voice was cold as if he wasn’t talking to a child. This brought a hint of anger to the eyes of the triplets.</p> 
 <p>“Okay!” A’Tao, however, didn’t find anything wrong with it. He immediately turned and led the way.</p> 
 <p>“You three are not going to stand here and wait for the guards, are you? I just came out of the palace and I don’t want to go in there again.” Passing the displeased triplets, Bai Xiaofei grinned.</p> 
 <p>The three rolled their eyes at him and followed A’Tao.</p> 
 <p>Heaving a long sigh, Bai Xiaofei reluctantly shook his head. <em>It’s hard being a nice person these days!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had seen someone like A’Tao in the Gorge of Heroes, and that was also the only child he had seen there except himself. When that child first came, everyone thought he needed care and love, even Bai Xiaofei thought so. But in the end, the child died, because when he saw his enemy passing through the Gorge of Heroes, he recklessly rushed up alone…</p> 
 <p>In this law-of-the-jungle continent, what a child with A’Tao’s experience needed was not temporary care and love, but support that could make him stronger. Even if this support came off as a bit crude, he would accept it all and turn it into his own power at the fastest speed!</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, the triplets couldn’t understand this. Therefore, Bai Xiaofei’s plan to sleep together under one big blanket might never be realized…</p> 
 <p><em>Ahhhh, why is my life so hard?!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei lamented as he walked. When he looked up again, their group had arrived at a modest clinic, the plaque displaying ‘Rejuvenation Clinic’ looked like it had existed for quite some years.</p> 
 <p>As A’Tao invited them into the clinic to sit down, thick medicinal incense drifted into their nostrils. A’Tao skillfully brewed a pot of tea and served it to everyone, then stood alone in the center of the front hall.</p> 
 <p>“Go ahead, tell me.” Taking a sip, Bai Xiaofei once again resumed the previous cold tone and expression.</p> 
 <p>A’Tao took a deep breath. The fire of anger in his eyes burned fiercely.</p> 
 <p>“About two months ago, the emperor suddenly summoned all doctors in the city to the palace. No one knew why. The guards just took them. My father was one of them. However, no one ever came back.”</p> 
 <p>“A few days later, the emperor ordered all the doctors to be beheaded and issued an imperial announcement to seek people who were good at treating diseases.”</p> 
 <p>“This imperial announcement was hung for a month. No one dared to answer it until two strangers came out of nowhere and did. They entered the palace, and from then the whole city has been in chaos.”</p> 
 <p>“Those two strangers suddenly became Tranquil’s Teachers of the Nation, and the royal guards began to search for dissidents in the city. That was when my sister was taken away. Similarly, no news of her came out.”</p> 
 <p>“There are many who have been arrested like her. Some people were even killed by the guards on the spot for putting up any resistance. With more and more people arrested, the people in the city began to petition, but every time it ended with everyone being beaten back. The emperor never meant to see us at all.”</p> 
 <p>After explaining what happened, A’Tao gritted his teeth.</p> 
 <p>The triplets’ hearts tightened. Influenced by the boy’s emotions, they started to feel a rising hatred towards An Bang Ting. That man was actually such a tyrant, and they were in the same room as him for such a long time!</p> 
 <p>“Those who were captured are basically civilians, aren’t they?” Bai Xiaofei was the calmest one. From his expression, he seemed to be listening to nothing but an old tale.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, they are all civilians and outsiders.” A’Tao nodded.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei laughed.</p> 
 <p>“I see. I have another question.” Bai Xiaofei paused and looked A’Tao in the eyes in assessment.</p> 
 <p>“If I make you powerful, what are you going to do after?”</p>
