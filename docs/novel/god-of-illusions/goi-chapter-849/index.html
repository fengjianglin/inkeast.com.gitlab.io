 <p>Chapter 849: Fishing Village? Ghost Town?</p> 
 <p>“Benefactor?!” Yun Ye exclaimed.</p> 
 <p>“It’s me. I just wanted to make an unusual entrance, I hope you guys don’t get angry, haha. As for the matter with Vivid Wing, it’s all worked out. You guys can live normally now.” Bai Xiaofei laughed.</p> 
 <p>After two seconds of silence, joy spread among the Yun family.</p> 
 <p>However, Yun Ye could not muster a smile. He had just taken a powerful pill. Without any surprise, he would die after its effect ended.</p> 
 <p>“Old man, don’t worry, your pill is here.” Bai Xiaofei revealed a pill in his palm.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Yun Ye was delighted, then confusion overtook him. “But I just…”</p> 
 <p>“It’s just a simple illusion. I made you feel like you took the medicine, then created an illusionary effect on you, guessing from the situation that it’d be a pill that enhances physical strength. Because you had never tried the pill before, you did not suspect anything,” Bai Xiaofei explained.</p> 
 <p>Although Yun Ye could only understand very little, he knew one thing: he did not have to die!</p> 
 <p>“Benefactor! No matter what, please stay for our wedding tomorrow!” Yun Ni hurriedly came up to Bai Xiaofei with a beaming face. Knowing that people like Bai Xiaofei had to be very busy, she didn’t even pick a good date for a wedding just so that he could be present.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, sure, but can you let He Chang take all that off first? I panic just by looking…” Bai Xiaofei pointed at He Chang.</p> 
 <p>The latter hurriedly threw the torch aside. Or else, if something went wrong, this comedy would turn into tragedy in a flash.</p> 
 <p>“The two of us want to take a walk around, so we won’t disturb you. Don’t worry, we will be there tomorrow.” Bai Xiaofei smiled. As soon as he finished speaking, he and Tan Xin vanished in front of everyone.</p> 
 <p>He only came to deliver the good news. As for the so-called comedy, it was a final test for the Yun family due to his bet with Tan Xin.</p> 
 <p>“Well, as I said, I wouldn’t judge people wrong. So, about washing my socks for a month…” Bai Xiaofei said, his expression so cheap that Tan Xin glared at him viciously.</p> 
 <p>“This one has never broken her word!” Frustratedly leaving a sharp retort, she jumped onto the Windsurfing Ship.</p> 
 <p>Although Bai Xiaofei never looked down on ordinary people, he still tried his best not to interfere with their lives. Sometimes, letting them have a deep connection with people like him was a kind of ruination in itself.</p> 
 <p>Returning to the ship, Tan Xin took out her big, detailed map and sank into thought as she drew on it.</p> 
 <p>“Have you chosen where to go next?” Seeing her so serious, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t bear to rain on her parade and therefore conceded his right to make decisions.</p> 
 <p>“Here!!!” Tan Xin finally settled on the destination after long contemplation. “Known as the most beautiful fishing village, it is close to the river that runs through the north and south. It is said that you can see the most beautiful sunset there and experience the wonders of life.”</p> 
 <p>Seeing the stars in her eyes, Bai Xiaofei simply could not say no. On another note, the place was not far from the Ethereal Empire. <em>We’re finally back on the right track!</em></p> 
 <p>Tan Xin’s excitement resulted in the ship’s speed soaring. Having gotten the affectionate nickname she wanted from the Boundless Flower Sea, she was full of expectation for the next stop and also her future body…</p> 
 <p><em>This fool will see it sooner or later!</em></p> 
 <p>“Wake up! We’re almost there!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei, who unknowingly fell asleep, was mercilessly shaken awake by Tan Xin. Coming up to the deck and watching the sun slowly setting in the west, he also started to have expectations.</p> 
 <p><em>This sunset is different from usual…</em></p> 
 <p>In the middle of an open plains, a wide and long river ran across, reflecting the afterglow of the setting sun. Occasionally, one or two big fish leaped out, and the splash they created was like dancing flames.</p> 
 <p>Peace, this was the only thing Bai Xiaofei was feeling.</p> 
 <p>“I heard it’s more beautiful to see the sunset from below! Let’s hurry!”</p> 
 <p>With that, Tan Xin directly stowed the ship, causing the two to start falling.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t rush to take control. Feel the wind around you.”</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin’s voice echoed in Bai Xiaofei’s mind. Smiling, he flew to Tan Xin’s side and held her hand.</p> 
 <p>“You think too much. I was just scared that you forgot to fly again,” he whispered in her ear.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin laughed in amusement. <em>Humph, who told you I cared!</em></p> 
 <p>As the two ended their flight with a smooth landing, the fishing village mentioned earlier also appeared in sight. However, the atmosphere seemed wrong…</p> 
 <p>“Are you sure this is the place? According to what you said, there should be a lot of people…” Bai Xiaofei scanned the deserted area, unable to feel the supposedly lively atmosphere at all. How would he experience life and appreciate customs like this?</p> 
 <p>“How can I be wrong?! Maybe they’ve all gone to rest! Let’s go in!” Tan Xin struggled, but no matter how one looked at it, it was not the time of day to rest yet…</p> 
 <p>Indeed, Tan Xin’s struggle was proved to be in vain. The two walked around the entire village without seeing a single person. Every house was covered in dust and looked like it had not been used in at least several months.</p> 
 <p>“Do you feel something strange?” Bai Xiaofei frowned.</p> 
 <p>“A little, but I can’t quite put my finger on it.” Tan Xin’s reaction was similar to Bai Xiaofei’s. After all, she did not specialize in the sixth sense either.</p> 
 <p>“Resentment, the resentment here is too strong.” Realizing something, Bai Xiaofei took out a black bead. Suddenly, thin black threads appeared in the air and slowly flowed into the bead.</p> 
 <p>“This is…?” Tan Xin shuddered as she looked at the bead, from which she felt tremendous pressure.</p> 
 <p>“This little thing can absorb the grievances around it. It seems that the people here did leave, but were killed by cruel means,” Bai Xiaofei explained as his brows met.</p> 
 <p>Someone slaughtered an entire village without leaving a body or a trace of blood. They were obviously extremely careful.</p> 
 <p>“Looks like we got ‘lucky’ again, running across another interesting matter!” With a sneer, Bai Xiaofei looked around.</p> 
 <p>There had to be clues left behind!</p>
