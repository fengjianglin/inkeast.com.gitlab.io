 <p>Chapter 857: Declaration of War?!</p> 
 <p>In the sky flew Bai Xiaofei, next to him was Yun Tianhe, flying using the exact same purple wings as the crystal ball in his hand showed the location and trajectory of the blood fog.</p> 
 <p>“Your puppet is good stuff.” Bai Xiaofei broke the tense atmosphere as he looked at Yun Tianhe’s wings.</p> 
 <p>The solemn Yun Tianhe was startled, then became much more relaxed.</p> 
 <p>“My father is very good to me. Without this puppet, I wouldn’t be who I am today.” Yun Tianhe’s tone was full of reverence upon talking about his father.</p> 
 <p>And what he said was no exaggeration. The puppet his father ordered to be made for him really was the reason for his success. It was a peak gold-grade puppet called Body of Reflection, having only one ability: Replication!</p> 
 <p>Any puppet that Yun Tianhe saw could be 100% replicated as long as its grade did not exceed that of Body of Reflection. More terrifyingly, when replicating those of lower grades, the effects would even be stronger than the original.</p> 
 <p>At Grandmaster Rank, Yun Tianhe could replicate five puppets at the same time!</p> 
 <p>As for the crystal ball in Yun Tianhe’s hand, it was a non-binding general puppet. It might be rare, but was no different from candy in Ethereal and especially in large clans like the Yun family.</p> 
 <p>“He stopped. We need to speed up. Enemy number is unknown, it’s likely we’ll face a fierce battle.” Seeing the movement of the blood fog, Yun Tianhe became serious again.</p> 
 <p>“How about we make a bet? There won’t be a fight.” Bai Xiaofei smiled.</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe frowned as he did not dare to agree to the bet. He asked, “Why?”</p> 
 <p>“Because I know our opponents too well. They won’t fight until it’s absolutely necessary. After all, we have crossed paths too many times,” replied Bai Xiaofei as the two arrived above the target.</p> 
 <p>Below was a small village with no trace of human activity. There was no doubt that this was another ghost village.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Yun Tianhe had nothing to say. He thought that there would be an army waiting for them.</p> 
 <p>“See? But it seems we are a step late.” Bai Xiaofei sighed and descended.</p> 
 <p>After searching the whole village Yun Tianhe exclaimed in horror, “How is this possible? How did they move so fast and erase all traces?!”</p> 
 <p>“You’re right, if they only acted after receiving that guy’s message, then this speed is really too fast. However, if it happened right after they noticed us, then it’s just right,” Bai Xiaofei deduced.</p> 
 <p>Indeed, the stalker was originally in charge of monitoring Yun Tianhe, but after seeing Bai Xiaofei, he had immediately switched to him as the main target and informed his nearby companions. At that time, they had already started to evacuate. It was just that the stalker had no idea. In other words, when Bai Xiaofei was discovered, the guy had already become a sacrificial chess piece.</p> 
 <p>“This should be for you.” Golden Feather came up with a letter just as the two people were at a loss. “Blackie found this letter at the entrance of the village.”</p> 
 <p>Receiving the letter and seeing the ‘To Bai Xiaofei’ line on the envelope, Bai Xiaofei smiled weakly. <em>I’m already so famous in Shadow Death, huh…?</em></p> 
 <p>He opened it and took out the piece of paper inside. Reading the short sentence on it, his mouth twitched.</p> 
 <p>‘Choose a graveyard in the imperial city.’</p> 
 <p>That was the content of the letter, very direct and provocative.</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe smiled wryly after reading it as well and couldn’t hold back his curiosity. “It seems they know you very well too. Who are they?”</p> 
 <p><em>This is definitely a mortal-level enemy!</em></p> 
 <p>“Shadow Death. Have you heard of them? The mastermind behind the Starnet grand celebration incident. I also traded blows with them in the Windless Zone not long ago,” said Bai Xiaofei blandly as if it was just something trivial.</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe instantly seethed with fury. His grandfather lost the ability of a puppet master because of Shadow Death!</p> 
 <p>“Those bastards actually dare to come to our Ethereal and cause trouble!!!” Yun Tianhe clenched his fist, looking as if he could not wait to eat Shadow Death alive.</p> 
 <p>“As far as I know, they never stir up trouble alone. If I’m not wrong, they have cooperated with someone inside Ethereal, and that person is the one who created the human puppets,” Bai Xiaofei said, his expression a little hesitant.</p> 
 <p>Obviously, this letter was directing him to go to the imperial city for a final battle. However, it could not be excluded that the other party was only provoking him so that he would leave the border area, thus no longer disturbing their actions here.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai, what’s wrong?” Yun Tianhe was nervous to see Bai Xiaofei lost in thought.</p> 
 <p>“I’m just a little… indecisive. It’s definitely necessary to go to the imperial capital, but I’m worried about the situation here. If we leave, they can do whatever they want here. We’d be fulfilling their wishes then,” Bai Xiaofei said.</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe was also troubled. “But even if we stay here, we can’t find anything useful.”</p> 
 <p>This struck Bai Xiaofei with realization. He laughed sheepishly. “That’s true. Even if we stay here, they can just go somewhere else. The Ethereal border is so huge that we can’t watch over it all. Might as well go to the imperial capital and meet them formally!” Clapping his hands, Bai Xiaofei made up his mind.</p> 
 <p>“It will take at least half a month to reach the imperial capital from here. From their current progress, I don’t think they have developed to an extent that we cannot curb,” Yun Tianhe was optimistic. However, he fell apart a little when thinking of the fact that he just came and had to leave like that. Aside from Bai Xiaofei, it could be said that he did not find anything useful…</p> 
 <p>However, the appearance of Shadow Death at least gave him something to report.</p> 
 <p>“The imperial capital, huh? Maybe I will even meet some acquaintances there.” Bai Xiaofei chortled. If he remembered correctly, Shi Kui had once said that he would seek apprenticeship in the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain after he graduated.</p> 
 <p><em>I wonder how that brat is doing now…</em></p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, Brother Bai, you have already met the most popular man in the imperial city.” Yun Tianhe patted his chest proudly. He was very confident about his status in Ethereal’s imperial city.</p> 
 <p>The five words ‘Yun clan First young master’ was no laughing matter!</p>
