 <p>Chapter 830: Class Still?</p> 
 <p>“Lan Qiushuang?” Hearing this name, Bai Xiaofei instantly recalled another person –</p> 
 <p><em>Lan He!</em></p> 
 <p>The academy’s grand celebration might have ended differently if it weren’t for this Ethereal veteran persevering for such a long time. Moreover, he regarded Bai Xiaofei very highly.</p> 
 <p>“Well, you should remember Lan He. She is his daughter. However, he’s even more sensitive about the name Bai Longfei than I am. Do not mention it unless you can talk to Lan Qiushuang in private,” Luo Xi said very seriously.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei gulped as he suddenly had a bad feeling. It looked like this was only the beginning of his father’s ‘plot’ against his son!</p> 
 <p>“Did my old man go to Ethereal right after his graduation?” Bai Xiaofei was very interested in his father’s affairs.</p> 
 <p>“No, he disappeared for five years before suddenly appearing in the Ethereal Empire, and then there was his puppet master legend. You will be able to hear his story bit by bit. What I have told you is only the most boring part of his life,” said Luo Xi with a rare genuine smile.</p> 
 <p>Using her whole life waiting for a person, she had never regretted it. This smile was proof.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you, Aunt Luo, I understand.” Bai Xiaofei knew that he could not ask any more questions. Now that he had found a direction, the only thing left to do was act.</p> 
 <p>However, as soon as Bai Xiaofei got up from his seat, Luo Xi stopped him.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s talk about something else.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei froze. <em>Something else?! What else do we have to talk about?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Luo Han. How long are you going to keep her waiting?” Luo Xi picked up her teacup and gently took a sip, but kept her eyes on Bai Xiaofei. The look was so sharp that he shuddered.</p> 
 <p>She was completely different! She had been Aunt Luo, but now, she was his future mother-in-law!</p> 
 <p>“I will return as soon as possible, I swear! I will never be like my dad!” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly vowed, but Luo Xi’s next words stunned him.</p> 
 <p>“How many people have you promised this to? Have you ever wondered how long they will have to wait for you to fulfill those promises one by one? Indeed, the average longevity of puppet masters is higher than that of ordinary people, and the rate of aging is much slower. Maybe your fifty years old is only equivalent to a normal person’s twenty. However, the flow rate of time is fair to everyone. Do you know how painful waiting is?”</p> 
 <p>Those series of questions were like knives to Bai Xiaofei’s heart. Despite his smart mouth, he did not know what to say.</p> 
 <p>There was really nothing more terrifying than soul-interrogating questions from one’s mother-in-law…</p> 
 <p>“As long as there are people waiting for me, I will fulfill my promises one by one. No promise will be forgotten. This is the only guarantee I can make.” This was Bai Xiaofei’s answer after a long silence. It was his true thoughts and his plan going forward.</p> 
 <p>However, Luo Xi shook her head.</p> 
 <p>“Silly child, if you will listen to me, remember to try hard not to provoke more women. Love debts are the hardest things to pay back in this world, and they are also the most torturous thing. When one day you find that there is a debt you can’t pay back, you won’t feel well for the rest of your life,” she said then waved her hand. “You can go, I believe that one day you will understand this, but I also hope that day will never come. Even if it does, I hope it’s at least not because of Luo Han.”</p> 
 <p>With that, Luo Xi turned away. Bai Xiaofei looked at her back, wanting to say something. However, he swallowed it in the end.</p> 
 <p>At a time like this, words were redundant…</p> 
 <p>Quietly withdrawing from Luo Xi’s office, Bai Xiaofei left the office area and walked in a daze to the square. Along the way, memories played like a move in his head. Reviewing all his experiences in the past four years, Bai Xiaofei laughed, cried, shook his head helplessly, and clenched his fists in anger.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, Bai Xiaofei pictured the faces he desperately wanted to see and the faces that he would not be able to see for a long time to come after graduation.</p> 
 <p><em>No wonder they all say it’s impossible to sleep the night before graduation. So it feels like this!</em></p> 
 <p>The square was full of people saying goodbye to each other. There were lovers snuggling up to each other and crying, there were groups of students who were drunk as mud.</p> 
 <p>As his thoughts wandered, Bai Xiaofei’s eyes suddenly lit up. His footsteps suddenly had a clear direction. He walked through the layers of buildings all the way to the place where he had started.</p> 
 <p>To his surprise, the place was already full of people.</p> 
 <p>“Class Monitor, you are late!”</p> 
 <p>Qi Wei, who was sitting at the door, looked at Bai Xiaofei with a teasing smile.</p> 
 <p>Everyone in the room burst out laughing, but unknowingly, as they laughed, their noses tingled and tears uncontrollably filled their eyes…</p> 
 <p>“Since Teacher is not here, tonight I will give you the last lesson!” Stopping his tears, Bai Xiaofei went up to the podium.</p> 
 <p>At the word ‘teacher,’ everyone’s heart was pricked.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei told them Xue Ying sacrificed her life during the Starnet attack because he did not want them to have to grieve in another way. There were some things he had to shoulder alone as the leader, right…?</p> 
 <p>“Today’s class is called ‘initial dream!’” Bai Xiaofei wrote down the title in big letters on the blackboard.</p> 
 <p>Seeing these two words, everyone pictured a childish youth. It was themselves four years ago.</p> 
 <p>“Very good, I can tell from your eyes that you understand the meaning of this class. I have a talent for lectures, it seems.” Bai Xiaofei tried to act relaxed, but this was the only time that no one in the class gave him support.</p> 
 <p>“Monitor, we all understand the class, but we have a question.” Fang Ye, who had appeared as a rich young master at their first meeting, stood up. Unlike his past self, he could now handle big things.</p> 
 <p>“Say it.” Bai Xiaofei looked at the determined Fang Ye, and then at all the persistent eyes in the room.</p> 
 <p>“Can we still have more classes in the future?”</p>
