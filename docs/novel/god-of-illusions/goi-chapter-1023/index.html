 <p>Chapter 1023: Alive</p> 
 <p>“Die!!!” Suddenly rushing toward the Fourth Elder, the Third Elder punched at his head.</p> 
 <p>Without even a chance to leave his last words, a legendary figure of Barbaric Godism became history. After the death of the Fourth Elder, the dying Fifth Elder revealed a tragic look.</p> 
 <p>“You will regret it!” he said as he stared at the Third Elder, having realized something at that moment.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, the Third Elder did not understand what he meant. “There’s no such thing as ‘regret’ in my dictionary,” he declared coldly as he felt the power in his body surge. Raising his foot, he stomped down at the Fifth Elder…</p> 
 <p>“Clean this place up. The event in two days must not be delayed,” the Third Elder said to Bai Xiaofei as he called it a day. Having killed the other four elders in a row, his strength had climbed to a peak, giving him the belief that he could be a match for the awakened Qiu Muxue!</p> 
 <p>To his surprise, however, his dear ‘son’ flashed him an eerie smile.</p> 
 <p>“Indeed it needs cleaning up,” murmured Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The Third Elder instantly became tense and looked at Bai Xiaofei warily. Under his gaze, the latter’s body slowly distorted and turned into a husky with a sleazy smile.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, a huge crowd rushed out and surrounded the Third Elder, who immediately noticed that they were the Guard Team that he used to be so proud of!</p> 
 <p>“The Third Elder murdered his own kin, a sin to be punished by execution! Guards, I order you to kill him on the spot!” Qiu Muxue appeared out of nowhere with an order that sent the horrified Third Elder into utter disbelief.</p> 
 <p>However, he quickly regained his composure.</p> 
 <p>“Burning the bridge after you cross the river, huh? But too bad for you, you failed to consider the power I’d gain after killing them!” he said coldly as he glared at Qiu Muxue, his eyes full of murderous intent.</p> 
 <p>“You worry too much. Of course, I’ve considered it, otherwise, why do you think I was so active to help you? It’s almost time, you should have started to feel it,” replied Qiu Muxue with a smile.</p> 
 <p>Right at that moment, the Third Elder’s body froze before he suddenly spat out a mouthful of dark purple blood.</p> 
 <p>“You gave me…” His face full of fear and unwillingness to die, the Third Elder felt his newly gained strength rapidly leaving his body!</p> 
 <p>“Of course, there was something else in that pill. As for the one I ate, it’s the same as yours, but I spat it out later,” Qiu Muxue answered his doubts as a familiar pill appeared in her hand. Then, her voice grew icy, “He’s a spent force now. Why aren’t you getting to work? Waiting for him to recover?”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the Guard Team immediately rushed at the Third Elder with their weapons.</p> 
 <p>“Qiu Muxue!! I want you dead!!!” The Third Elder who was under siege tried his best to resist. Although his vitality was being drained every moment, his strength was real and compared to him, the guards were like moths rushing into a flame.</p> 
 <p>However, the Guard Team had an absolute advantage in numbers, giving the Third Elder no chance to approach Qiu Muxue. Ignoring his roar, she turned to leave. Behind her was the ceaseless sound of fighting as the Third Elder’s roars became softer and softer…</p> 
 <p>In the dead of night, on the tower at the center of the Barbaric Godism base, Qiu Muxue was staring up at the night sky, her eyes vacant.</p> 
 <p>“I thought you’d find a place where you could jump around in happiness. Why are you here all upset? You’re now the sole ruler of the Sacks,“ Bai Xiaofei’s voice rang out from behind.</p> 
 <p>Qiu Muxue turned around with a bitter expression. “I once thought that everything I did was to avenge my family, but now, for some reason, I can’t feel the pleasure of having my revenge at all.”</p> 
 <p>“Because there is nothing to be happy about revenge, but you already have a new goal, don’t you?” said Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Qiu Muxue smiled. “Nothing can be hidden from you, really. However, I don’t think you will be able to help this time.” She sighed helplessly.</p> 
 <p>“Not necessarily. If what you want is to restore the Sacks to what they used to be, I may just be able to.” Bai Xiaofei chuckled.</p> 
 <p>Qiu Muxue was dumbstruck for two seconds before she grabbed Bai Xiaofei. “Really?!”</p> 
 <p>Since she didn’t control her force, Bai Xiaofei was nearly choked.</p> 
 <p>“If you strangle me to death, it’d be ‘not really,’” he hurriedly reminded her once he realized that struggling was futile.</p> 
 <p>Qiu Muxue awkwardly loosened her grip. “Sorry, I was too excited.”</p> 
 <p>Seeing her all chipper again, Bai Xiaofei decided to let it slide.</p> 
 <p>“I’ve been quite idle these days, so I went to check out that stone idol. Since the change started from it, we naturally need to seek the answer from it as well. And guess what I found?” He revealed a mysterious smile.</p> 
 <p>“What did you find?” asked Qiu Muxue nervously. She didn’t even dare breathe loudly for fear of missing any words.</p> 
 <p>“The idol is alive.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei used his most nonchalant tone possible, but those four words were like thunder in Qiu Muxue’s ears.</p> 
 <p><em>The idol… is alive?!!!</em></p> 
 <p>“What… what do you mean…?” Her mind had gone blank. If the idol was really alive, then how strong did it have to be to endow an entire clan with such perverse abilities?!</p> 
 <p><em>And what is its motive?!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Don’t be afraid, it’s not as serious as you think because it hasn’t fully grown yet.” Bai Xiaofei scratched his nose.</p> 
 <p>At that moment, an impatient voice suddenly rang out in his mind, “Smelly boy, cut the act, won’t you?! Like you’d know heck if it weren’t for this lord being well-informed! Hurry up. If you dare to break your promise again this time, this lord will never help you again!!”</p>
