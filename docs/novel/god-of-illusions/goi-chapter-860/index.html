 <p>Chapter 860: Moon Beck Pavilion!</p> 
 <p>After taking care of the assassin, Bai Xiaofei strolled alone around the city as if nothing had happened.</p> 
 <p>Unlike the cities he had been to before, Ethereal’s capital could no longer be described as just prosperous. To make it short, there was nothing that one could not find.</p> 
 <p>From food and clothing for ordinary people to cultivation materials for puppet masters, the featured products of almost all places on the continent were gathered in this city. No matter where one came from, they could find a taste of their hometown here.</p> 
 <p>“It’s really a great place. No wonder that they all say to go out and experience the world. It’s really different outside,” commented Bai Xiaofei, who stretched his body after feeling tired from all the walking.</p> 
 <p>Beside him, Golden Feather tried to hide a smile. “From what I see, you’re not just simply taking a walk. Why so careful this time?”</p> 
 <p>She hit the nail on the head. Bai Xiaofei laughed sheepishly.</p> 
 <p>“I’ve learned my lesson after Windlove. It’s always good to be careful,” he said and walked towards the high-end shopping area in the inner ring of the city. “Time to rest. Let’s go, we shouldn’t keep Brother Yun waiting. After all, I need to rely on him later.”</p> 
 <p>Thinking of Yun Tianhe, Bai Xiaofei was excited. Originally, he thought he could only approach Lan Qiushuang through Lan He, but Yun Tianhe’s appearance gave him a more convenient way. Moreover, the two had such a good start.</p> 
 <p>“Moon Beck Pavilion deserves its reputation…” Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but exclaim as he strained to look up at the towering building in front of him.</p> 
 <p>Ethereal’s Moon Beck Pavilion, one of the most famous money squandering dens in Starnet Continent. However, it could not be taken for a brothel. On the contrary, it was famous for its elegance.</p> 
 <p>In Moon Beck Pavilion, there was a Performer List, in which all of the women listed had both talent and looks. Every month, a performer would be elected as the top card, and anyone who she favored would be able to enjoy the full moon of the month with her. If she was willing, it was even possible to spend the night together.</p> 
 <p>However, spending the night with a performer meant taking full responsibility for her and redeeming her from the Moon Beck Pavilion, where only virgins were allowed to be its performers.</p> 
 <p>However, this did not mean that the Moon Beck Pavilion would break all ties with its members after they left. If a former performer was treated badly by her redeemer, the pavilion would step out to back her. Historically, some redeemers had made such a mistake, and their result was… miserable!</p> 
 <p>It was this special characteristic of the Moon Beck Pavilion that made countless self-proclaimed elegant men flock to it. To win the favor of top card had become a kind of deed to brag about for Ethereal men.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, every month, the competition for the Performer List was extremely fierce.</p> 
 <p>In addition to the Performer List as a source of income, the Moon Beck Pavilion was also a good place to stay for its excellent environment and thoughtful service, making it a top-class existence in the imperial city.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Yun really introduced me to an excellent place. Staying here for a day or two is enough to bankrupt ordinary people,” Bai Xiaofei sincerely praised.</p> 
 <p>Even Golden Feather revealed an expression of approval. “Indeed, it gathers all the spirit of heaven and earth. But since ancient times, scholars have been known for mischief. I’m afraid this place is not as peaceful as imagined.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing her evaluation, Bai Xiaofei felt that it would have nothing to do with him anyway. “Whatever, I’m just looking for a place to stay. I’m not going to get involved in any messy things like the Performer List.”</p> 
 <p>The thought of women made Bai Xiaofei’s scalp tingle. At the same time, he remembered Tan Xin. <em>Where did the little girl go?</em></p> 
 <p>“There is something in this world called ‘in spite of oneself.’” Looking at the self-assured Bai Xiaofei, Golden Feather couldn’t help an ill-will smile. Although she could not make predictions, she had been around him long enough to reach a conclusion – his ‘luck’ with women was unusually abundant…</p> 
 <p>“Aunt Gold, please don’t mention this, I’m panicking already…” Bai Xiaofei smiled bitterly.</p> 
 <p><em>If it really happens again… No, no, no, I must not think about it!</em></p> 
 <p>“I’m going back into the puppet space. It’s not very convenient for me out here.” Golden Feather slowly disappeared.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei strode toward the entrance of the Moon Beck Pavilion.</p> 
 <p>“Mister Bai?”</p> 
 <p>Two sisters in pure-white long dresses greeted him as soon as he approached the door. Just from this, he already felt how special the Moon Beck Pavilion was. Their welcome alone already gave off a vibe of unique grace.</p> 
 <p>“It is I,” replied Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The two girls’ smiles immediately deepened. “Please come with us, Mister Bai. Mister Yun has already made arrangements for you. We were sent by Sister Mu. She especially told us to treat you with the utmost care.”</p> 
 <p>Along the way, the two sisters carefully explained to Bai Xiaofei about the pavilion as well as the precautions to be taken during one’s stay.</p> 
 <p>There was no male staff in the Moon Beck Pavilion, and every member must be a young woman between the ages of twenty and thirty. There were different work fields that divided them into the upper three divisions and the lower three divisions. The former were Darling Star, Forlorn Sun, and Becking Moon, while the latter were Cold Shadow, Shy Flower, and Worshipping Stella.</p> 
 <p>One must become a member of the upper three divisions to be on the Performer List. Once someone in the upper divisions exceeded the age limit or was redeemed, the top ranker of Worshipping Stella would be promoted to the upper divisions.</p> 
 <p>The daily chores and reception work were the responsibilities of the lower divisions, while the upper divisions’ members, regardless of their rank, were only responsible for receiving VIPs.</p> 
 <p>Sister Mu, who had just been mentioned by two sisters, was one of the 236 members of the upper divisions and also the leading candidate for the top card.</p> 
 <p>And Yun Tianhe was her most loyal VIP.</p> 
 <p>“We have arrived, Mister Bai. Please ring the bell if you need anything. Tonight’s performance is over. If you have time tomorrow night, we will come and take you there,” said a sister as they reached Bai Xiaofei’s room.</p> 
 <p>With that, the two sisters retreated.</p> 
 <p>“No wonder it’s a famous gold squandering den. This is clearly a hunger-marketing version of brothels. The seemingly elegant front is but an excuse to shut out incapable guests. I bet those who can afford to come here are wealthy aristocrats.”</p> 
 <p>Lying in bed, Bai Xiaofei quickly figured out the core nature of the Moon Beck Pavilion. After Feng Wuhen and Lu Lingyun, this place taught Bai Xiaofei a good business lesson.</p> 
 <p>“Ah, forget it. Who likes it, likes it. None of my business. I just pray that this place won’t give me any troubles…” mumbling to himself, Bai Xiaofei slowly closed his eyes.</p> 
 <p>However, sometimes, what one dreads is what one will most likely get…</p>
