 <p>Chapter 975: Terrifying Second Personality!</p> 
 <p>“What the… What’s going on?!”</p> 
 <p>Looking at Ye Qingcheng who had shot through the building’s roof and floated high up in the sky, ‘dumbfounded’ was no longer enough to describe Bai Xiaofei’s expression.</p> 
 <p>This was definitely not simple fury, because he clearly felt that her whole bearing had changed. She seemed like she had turned into a completely different person and her aura was entirely full of murderous intent!</p> 
 <p>“Go to hell!” Ye Qingcheng’s ice-cold voice echoed in the air.</p> 
 <p>The next second, pure and violent energy spread from her, crushing everything in its wake!</p> 
 <p>“Not good!”</p> 
 <p>After witnessing the terror the energy brought about, Bai Xiaofei’s first reaction was not to escape but to teleport to the secret chamber earlier. He stood in front of the ice bed and shielded Nie Qing just before the energy wave reached her.</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, his Endless State was immune to this energy.</p> 
 <p>However, he also attracted Ye Qingcheng’s attention as the only living being standing within the radius of one kilometer.</p> 
 <p>“Men! Must! Die!” Ye Qingcheng spoke, the content short and precise as she appeared in front of Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The power she exuded was frightening, but Bai Xiaofei could not run. “Blackie!” he shouted.</p> 
 <p>Summoning Blackie, he immediately moved the ice bed. During this period, he was grabbed and lifted up by Ye Qingcheng with one hand.</p> 
 <p>It was fortunate for Bai Xiaofei that she had never been to the border to train. Although the violent energy constantly assailed him, it did not go past the absorption limit of the Endless State.</p> 
 <p>“Demonic fire of resentment!” Bai Xiaofei growled.</p> 
 <p>An ice-blue flame flared from his whole body and forced Ye Qingcheng to retreat. As she did, her wrist that was burned by the flame recovered at the speed visible to the naked eye.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know what your situation is, so I can only offend you!” Bai Xiaofei charged at her.</p> 
 <p>Glaring resentfully at him, she also charged forward while enveloping herself in a brilliant light. The two clashed fiercely as if they were mortal enemies. Upon colliding, an explosion sent them both flying and they spat out a mouthful of blood.</p> 
 <p>This round of exchange shocked Bai Xiaofei. After only the first contact, Ye Qingcheng actually found the weakness of the Endless State and made a successful attempt to break through it!</p> 
 <p>The Endless State absorbed energy without a blind spot, and the limit of absorption was equal at every point. Just now, Ye Qingcheng had concentrated her attack on only one point and forcefully penetrated through.</p> 
 <p><em>What the hell is her perverse ability to adapt?!</em></p> 
 <p>As much as Bai Xiaofei was astonished, the blow did no substantial damage to him. His recovery ability kept him alive and kicking even after spitting out blood.</p> 
 <p>However, it was the same for Ye Qingcheng.</p> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei had first met Revelation, the old man had told him that in this world, the only thing that could help his situation besides Lunisolar Brilliance was Moonlight’s Moon God Technique.</p> 
 <p>And the most proficient person in this technique at present, Ye Qingcheng, had a recovery ability that was far above that of Bai Xiaofei. After all, the latter hadn’t cultivated his technique to the godly rank. If it weren’t for the Nirvana Pearl and the reconstruction of his body while in Ethereal, he would have lost miserably!</p> 
 <p>“Interesting trash!” Ye Qingcheng commented as the exchange with Bai Xiaofei had roused her fighting spirit. Leaving him no time to catch his breath, she charged forth again.</p> 
 <p>Just like that, two streaks of lights kept colliding above the emperor’s quarters at an increasing speed, causing impacts that shook the whole palace!</p> 
 <p>When the other three royal sisters arrived, they all had the same reaction upon seeing the show in the air.</p> 
 <p>“Who is that?! They can actually be a match for Big Sister in her current state?!”</p> 
 <p>The three gulped as they tried to guess the identity of Ye Qingcheng’s opponent while worrying about what would come next.</p> 
 <p>In her current state, Ye Qingcheng would only grow stronger with every passing minute. In the past, they could jointly use the Moon God Technique to control her right away. This time, however, Ye Qingcheng’s power had grown to a point that they couldn’t even get close to her.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, once that opponent was defeated by Ye Qingcheng, she would likely continue to destroy everything. Moonlight would be doomed…</p> 
 <p>“That person… isn’t Fickle Bai, right?” Ye Tong made a guess that even she found hard to believe. <em>Did Fickle Bai have such power?!</em></p> 
 <p>Normally, Ye Qingcheng was already at Exquisite Rank. After going berserk, her strength would infinitely approach the Legend Rank…</p> 
 <p>“It’s hard to believe indeed, but except for him, there isn’t any other person we know in this city to be capable of this. Looks like Fickle Bai has been hiding his real self very deeply,” Ye Xi commented, then sighed. “I just hope he didn’t come to Moonlight with ulterior motives.”</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Ye Qingtong wasn’t worried about this at all. “It’s not your first day knowing this person, is it? Believe in our intuition, we won’t collectively be wrong about a person,” she reassured.</p> 
 <p>The three then stood there and just enjoyed the show. By this point, the battle had reached its peak where the speed and power of both fighters had reached an extreme. What the spectators saw were only two blurry lights.</p> 
 <p>“I refuse to believe that you have endless energy! Devouring the Heaven and Earth!” roared Bai Xiaofei as he felt his body approaching the verge of collapse. He ignored the incoming attack and let Ye Qingcheng’s hand hit his chest, then used the opportunity to hold her firmly on the spot and activated Devouring the Heaven and Earth!</p> 
 <p>This was a gamble but his only choice. Ye Qingcheng had grown too strong for him to deal with!</p> 
 <p>In the end, luck was on his side. Bai Xiaofei won the bet.</p> 
 <p>High-intensity combat required high-intensity consumption. The little energy left in Ye Qingcheng’s body was sucked dry by Bai Xiaofei. However, the latter also fell unconscious due to his serious injuries. The two fell straight down from the air…</p>
