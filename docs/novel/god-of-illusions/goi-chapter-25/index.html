 <p>“The slow one will be eaten by magic beasts!!!” After they secretly snuck out of the academy, Bai Xiaofei was like a wild horse that had returned to nature, and he’d already vanished in the dense forest in an instant.</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Fei, wait for me! I haven’t told you where that river is!” Wu Chi deserved being a Martial Artist, and it seemed entirely effortless for him to follow Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>Shi Kui was still alright, even though he was slightly slow, it wasn’t to the extent of being left too far behind by Bai Xiaofei and Wu Chu. But, it was out of the question for Mo Ka….</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Fei! Brother Shi! Big Idiot Wu! All of you, wait for me! I can’t run anymore!!!” Mo Ka’s voice already carried a trace of being on the verge of tears because the pitch black surroundings seemed to be filled with danger to him.</p>
 <p>“Shi Kui, run quickly! There’re wild wolves behind there!” Shi Kui originally intended to wait for Mo Ka yet Bai Xiaofei’s voice sounded out from far ahead, and Shi Kui chose to follow up to Bai Xiaofei after pondering for a moment.</p>
 <p>“Wild wolves?!” Mo Ka nervously turned around to take a look, and he felt as if he’d heard the sound of leaves rustling.</p>
 <p>“My god!!! I’m going to die!!!” As he screamed like a ghost, Mo Ka seemed as if his butt was on fire, and his speed had at least risen violently by three times as he pursued after Bai Xiaofei and the others like a gust of wind.</p>
 <p>“Woohoo!” At the instant he saw the river, Bai Xiaofei seemed as if he’d seen his own mother, and he stripped swiftly before leaping right into the river.</p>
 <p>Not long after, Wu Chi had arrived here as well. After all, it was he who was shouting and giving Bai Xiaofei directions.</p>
 <p>“There’s a blue colored porcelain bottle in my clothes. Pour out some powder from it and spread it on your body, and you’ll be able to wash away the smell.” Bai Xiaofei stuck his head out of the water and started fiercely rubbing his body.</p>
 <p>The stinkweed bombs were almost perfect but the side effect of using it was slightly abnormal.</p>
 <p>Right when Bai Xiaofei had almost finished washing himself, Mo Ka and Shi Kui had finally ran all the way here, and Mo Ka who’d caught up with Shi Kui with great difficulty was already dead tired.</p>
 <p>“You should really temper and tougher yourself, otherwise, it’s easy for you to be played to death by Big Brother Fei….” Even though Shi Kui was slightly naïve, yet he’d already predicted his future life after coming into contact with Bai Xiaofei for a few hours.</p>
 <p>To be in Bai Xiaofei’s company was tantamount to living with a tiger!</p>
 <p>“It… isn’t…. your business. Have… you… seen any… Alchemist that… goes running around… for fun?” Mo Ka collapsed onto the ground and spoke while gasping for breath.</p>
 <p>“Alright, good luck to you.” Shi Kui spread out his hands before he took off his clothes and jumped into the water. But, unlike Bai Xiaofei and Wu Chi, he didn’t swim towards the center of the river.</p>
 <p>Not everyone could enjoy some pleasures….</p>
 <p>“Woof! Woof!!!” Bai Xiaofei had just finished bathing when Huskie suddenly barked wildly from the side of the river, and for a time, the hearts of Mo Ka and the others had risen to their throats along with this.</p>
 <p><i>It wouldn’t be that there’s a magical beast approaching, right?!</i></p>
 <p>“What is it Huskie?” Bai Xiaofei wasn’t nervous because Huskie didn’t display this state when he’d encountered danger.</p>
 <p>“Woof! Woof!” Huskie barked twice, and then he made a circle before wagging his tail.</p>
 <p>“There’s something good?” Bai Xiaofei’s eyes lit up as he swam hastily towards the side of the river.</p>
 <p>“Where is it? What is it?” Bai Xiaofei held Huskie up while the expression of someone that loved wealth was displayed vividly.</p>
 <p>Huskie seemed to be extremely excited as well, and he raised his paw and pointed upstream in an extremely human manner.</p>
 <p>“There’s something good up there? Do all of you want to go have a look?” Bai Xiaofei turned around and asked Mo Ka and the others. Under the bright and clear moonlight, Mo Ka and the others felt as if they saw a devil beckoning at them.</p>
 <p>“I haven’t finished bathing.” Shi Kui was the first to make his stand clear because he already had a bad premonition.</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Fei, please let me off. My leg is still soft until now.” Mo Ka spoke weakly. This reason of his was fairly persuasive as well, and it was because the cry of there being wolves earlier had already allowed him to see Bai Xiaofei clearly.</p>
 <p>“Err…. I… I want….” Being glared at by Bai Xiaofei caused Wu Chi to be unable to give an excuse after trying for a long time, and under his helplessness, he could only shoot a pleading gaze to Mo Ka and Shi Kui.</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Fei, the big idiot has to stay back and protect us. What if wild wolves really do come, then you’ll lose two committed henchmen.” Even though his physical condition was slightly bad, but Mo Ka’s mind was capable.</p>
 <p>“Three pussies. Forget it, all of you wait here for me.” Bai Xiaofei waved his hands helplessly before dashing off towards the area upstream with Huskie in his hand because the word ‘fear’ had already been wiped off from Bai Xiaofei’s dictionary….</p>
 <p>Under Huskie’s lead, Bai Xiaofei had quickly approached his destination, and Bai Xiaofei was already able to smell the fragrance of a natural treasure of the heavens and the earth from afar.</p>
 <p>“Good boy, I really didn’t keep you for nothing!” Bai Xiaofei silently looked over towards the open space before him while hiding behind a large rock.</p>
 <p>Almost all natural treasures of the heavens and the earth had something guarding in its surroundings, so being careful was necessary.</p>
 <p>As he held excitement in his heart, Bai Xiaofei had already made the preparations to see a variety of abnormal things. After all, Huskie had already tricked him more than just once or twice.</p>
 <p>However, never had Bai Xiaofei imagined that he would actually see such a scene….</p>
 <p>At the center of the river and under the silvery moonlight was a slender young woman that was lightly rubbing her body, and her supple skin seemed to even be slightly brighter than the moonlight.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, Bai Xiaofei could faintly see that the young woman’s appearance wasn’t inferior to Lin Li who he’d met in the morning, and the wild beauty she possessed was even something that Lin Li didn’t possess.</p>
 <p>“It’s her?” Suddenly, Bai Xiaofei matched the figure he’d seen the other day with the young woman before his eyes.</p>
 <p>During the entire process, Bai Xiaofei was completely in a state of utmost concentration, and it was even to the extent that he didn’t even know that he’d gulped down a mouthful of saliva.</p>
 <p>“Who is it!?” Even though the sound of him gulping down his saliva was very soft, Bai Xiaofei had still exposed himself in this sort of silent environment.</p>
 <p>“It’s no one!” He was clever all his life yet was stupid this once. Being shocked by the young woman caused Bai Xiaofei to actually stand up on the spot, and even though he regretted this stupid action extremely, it was already too late.</p>
 <p>In the next moment, a sharp water arrow was shot out by the young woman and struck extremely precisely onto Bai Xiaofei’s chest, and its enormous force blasted Bai Xiaofei out far away.</p>
 <p>But, he was lucky that the young woman had attacked in a moment of anxiousness and hadn’t exerted her entire strength, so even though Bai Xiaofei had been blasted away, there was no danger to his life.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei forcefully endured the intense pain as he struggled to crawl up, and he’d already started to think of a way to deal with the situation.</p>
 <p><i>Based on the situation, I’m surely unable to defeat her, yet I might not be able to outrun her as well….</i></p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei hadn’t thought of anything yet when the young woman who’d draped her clothes over her body had already drifted down to his side, and her pair of alluring and foxy eyes flickered with boundless fury.</p>
 <p>“Die!” The young woman held the intention of silencing Bai Xiaofei with death, and a ball of dazzling violet light appeared on her palm yet she suddenly withdrew her attack right at the moment her palm was about to strike onto Bai Xiaofei’s forehead.</p>
 <p>“It’s you?!!”</p>
 <p>A voice of surprise and bewilderment started a rough and bumpy story….</p>
