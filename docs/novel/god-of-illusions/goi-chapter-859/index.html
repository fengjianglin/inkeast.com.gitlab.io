 <p>Chapter 859: What Just Happened?</p> 
 <p>“Oh? Really? Then you can go ahead. Let us see if these many people are all blind!” Hai Jun said coldly, oblivious to what would happen next.</p> 
 <p>“As you wish!” Bai Xiaofei suddenly moved.</p> 
 <p>Hai Jun had thought that Bai Xiaofei was only trying to scare him and so was caught completely unprepared. By the time he reacted, his face had kissed the ground. His first reaction was to release his puppet and fight back. Unfortunately, a golden thread had firmly tied him up, and the other end of the thread was a smiling Golden Feather.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll make sure you enjoy it.” Bai Xiaofei cracked his knuckles as he walked toward Hai Jun with an evil smirk.</p> 
 <p>Then, a long series of tragic screams echoed…</p> 
 <p>By the time Bai Xiaofei felt refreshed from beating the poor guy, Hai Jun’s face was swollen all over. At the same time, Blackie deactivated Virtual Reality. Everyone only saw Bai Xiaofei and Hai Jun quarreling and then Hai Jun fell face-first onto the ground and turned into a pig-head.</p> 
 <p>“Woah, my first time seeing someone getting so angry from a quarrel! What are you guys still doing? If you carry him back now, his face can still be saved.” Bai Xiaofei looked at the guards.</p> 
 <p>They hurriedly ran over to Hai Jun and lifted him up. As for what had just happened, they had no idea.</p> 
 <p>“Hai Jun is down. Do you still want to make it hard for us?” Yun Tianhe became the highest-ranked officer after Hai Jun left the scene.</p> 
 <p>The remaining guards immediately made a way for them. Just like that, Bai Xiaofei swaggered into the city with Yun Tianhe.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai, how did you do it? It feels too good!” Yun Tianhe let his joy show after making sure there was no one around.</p> 
 <p>“Visualize a new scene and use Mimicry to create a fake body for both me and him. In other words, what you just saw was fake,” Bai Xiaofei replied.</p> 
 <p>He made it sound simple, but Yun Tianhe couldn’t even count how many things he had to do during that short period.</p> 
 <p><em>Confusing so many people with illusions just like that?! Is that still the Illusion Stream anymore?! Is the Illusion Stream so formidable already?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai, you have me truly convinced. You also helped me let out a big belly of pent-up resentment today! I’ve long wanted to teach that Hai family’s brat a lesson. You did me a big favor! When there’s a chance, I’ll treat you to a grand meal!” When needed, Yun Tianhe was more formal than anyone, but when he relaxed, he could be more indecorous than anyone.</p> 
 <p>“Are you sure?” Bai Xiaofei flashed him a meaningful smirk.</p> 
 <p>Almost immediately, Yun Tianhe recalled that whole table of food. If he remembered correctly, Bai Xiaofei had said that it was only an appetizer!</p> 
 <p>“Er… Brother Bai, my mouth slipped. Let me repay you another way, another way…” Yun Tianhe hurriedly said.</p> 
 <p>The two then burst out laughing at the same time.</p> 
 <p>“I know you have business to do, so I won’t bother you. I will take a good stroll in this imperial city to see if there is anything fun,” said Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Do you want Tianhai to accompany you?” asked Yun Tianhe. However, seeing Bai Xiaofei’s smile, the answer was obvious. He said, “Well, then, I’ll come find you after I finish reporting the situation. It would be great if you choose the Moon Beck Pavilion. You only need to report my name and they’ll prepare for your stay.”</p> 
 <p>With that, Yun Tianhe and Bai Xiaofei parted ways.</p> 
 <p>“Well, now that there’s no one else, we should get down to business.” Bai Xiaofei scoffed as his eyes flashed with a cruel glint. <em>After letting you lot tail me for so long, it’s time to pull you out!</em></p> 
 <p>“Report, he seems to have discovered me!”</p> 
 <p>The assassin who was tailing Bai Xiaofei immediately felt that something was wrong. Unfortunately, it was already too late.</p> 
 <p>“You invited me here, why are you so afraid of me? Didn’t you say this place would be my graveyard?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s voice rang in the Shadow Death assassin’s ear as a golden thread unknowingly wrapped around the latter.</p> 
 <p>Pulling out all the stops, Bai Xiaofei had used Spiritualization right from the get-go!</p> 
 <p>“I know you won’t say anything, so just go to hell.” The golden thread flared into a flame and turned the assassin into a pile of ashes. Watching the ashes scatter, he mumbled, “Now, don’t get scared from being killed by me. I don’t mind adding a few more like you to the death list.”</p> 
 <p>At the same time, in a dark space, a person stood silently and impassively as he watched the last scene through the Shadow Death assassin right before he died.</p> 
 <p>“This person is yours to handle. I don’t want him to ruin my plan,” a slightly old voice rang out from the dark, where a figure covered in a black robe was hidden.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, he won’t be able to trace it back to you in a short time. And even if he does, what can he do? You old crafty fox can’t be exposed so easily.” The first man smiled, his tone relaxed.</p> 
 <p>“You think I will buy that? Isn’t the meaning of your existence to help me handle all possible threats? He is currently the biggest threat,” the old voice rang out again.</p> 
 <p>The first man couldn’t help but sigh. “That’s why I don’t like dealing with old antiques like you. Can’t take a joke at all.” Pausing a little, his expression grew serious. “Don’t worry, we will pull the net soon. He won’t be able to move for much longer.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing the man’s frosty voice, the old voice did not say anything further. He knew very well what that tone represented.</p> 
 <p>“But then again, what’s with your progress?! All we’ve seen so far are useless small fry. If you don’t come up with some results, I won’t be able to explain it to the boss.” Upon mentioning the topic that he cared about most, the first person grew even more serious.</p> 
 <p>“You think human puppets are toys? It’s already not easy to complete the preliminary certification in such a short time. If it’s someone else other than me, you may still only be seeing corpses now!” The old voice was full of dissatisfaction. His ability being questioned obviously had touched his bottom line.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t use your so-called professionalism to fool me. You’ve made little progress, but your baby daughter is making good progress! If I find out that you are playing tricks with us, hmph!”</p> 
 <p>“Shut your mouth, I know what to do!”</p> 
 <p>The unpleasant conversation ended with the fury of the old voice. After his figure disappeared into the dark, the other person snorted.</p> 
 <p>“Old geezer, you’ll regret this one day!”</p>
