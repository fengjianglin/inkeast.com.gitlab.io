<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>The small incident at the entrance didn’t make them late, and their faces were covered in anticipation when they finished the theory classes for the morning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Ying had already notified the principal, and unless something unexpected occurred, then they would hear from Qin Lingyan soon. After that, it would be the time to test the outcome of their month long training!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Class Monitor, do you think there’ll be someone of the Grandmaster Rank amongst those that come?” As she moved over to Bai Xiaofei’s side, the glittery eyed and garrulous Qi Wei looked at him with her large eyes. In the entire Savage Class, only Bai Xiaofei and Xu Chen were capable of controlling her, and the rest of them were no match for her mouth….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We still have a chance at winning even if there’s someone at the Grandmaster Rank, and it mostly depends on how seriously they take us.” During the past month of time, the first half of the month was mostly training to improve their foundations, whereas, practically every few days during the second month was a spar with Xue Ying at full power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From being unable to resist in the slightest at the beginning, they were able to resist for a while later on, and then they were able to occasionally gain the upper hand. In their opinion, the Grandmaster Rank wasn’t an existence far beyond their ability any longer!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The exact method of the fight hasn’t been set, right?” Qi Wei’s gaze carried a trace of curiosity as she spoke, and this was the true question she came over to ask.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If nothing unexpected happens, then it will be determined by us.” Bai Xiaofei grinned as his words made all of them relax because if it was really Bai Xiaofei who determined it, then the chances of victory would increase by 30% at least!</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them chatted amongst themselves, whereas, Lin Li just sat there quietly by Bai Xiaofei’s side. Mo Ka and the others improved in strength during this month, whereas, Lin Li enriched her expressions instead. At the very least, she didn’t look as stiff as she did in the beginning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, it was also during this month that her reliance on Bai Xiaofei grew deeper and deeper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lunch is back!” Fang Ye who’d entirely become the manager of the Savage Class ran over excitedly with Wang Hang, Ming One, and Ming Two behind him while carrying a large pile of things. The person that was the happiest from the plundering they did at the entrance was actually Fang Ye because he would have to sell Starnet Stones if it wasn’t for that sum of money….</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the food boxes were opened, vegetables that were of a variety of color appeared before their eyes, and they couldn’t help but drool.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Magical Beast meat was good, anyone would get sick of it after consuming it repeatedly for an entire month, &nbsp;so vegetables were the most precious to the members of the Savage class!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Food for over 30 people was distributed and cleaned up in the blink of an eye. All of them were split up into a few waves that cried as they ate, and they seemed like beggars that had never tasted food….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We haven’t seen each other for a month, yet I never expected that you still eat like this!” Bai Xiaofei was eating happily when Qin Lingyan’s icy cold voice sounded out, and for a time, everyone stopped moving the chopsticks in their hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, I was wondering who it was. If it isn’t Senior Sister Lingyan. Shi Kui quickly bring a chair for her!” Bai Xiaofei wiped his mouth as he stood up hastily as if their relationship was really good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no need. Our relationship isn’t good to the point that we can sit together and speak. I only came to tell you to get ready because we’ll put an end to everything tonight!” Qin Lingyan put away her disdain as a slight firm expression appeared on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Sister, can’t you give us another two days to make proper preparations?” Bai Xiaofei revealed a troubled expression as if he wished for nothing more than for the end Qin Lingyan spoke of to never come.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve already allowed you to prepare for a month, what else do you want? Or do you want to go on the Bounty Rankings again?” Qin Lingyan grunted coldly as she displayed her disdain towards Bai Xiaofei once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s the location? Are than any special requirements? Senior Sister, you wouldn’t have arranged everything and are waiting for me to go seek my own doom, right?” Bai Xiaofei had a slightly wronged expression while he spoke as if he was the victim.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What arrangements do I need to deal with you? Besides that the time is set at six tonight, everything else is up to you. But, don’t think of playing any tricks, or it’ll only many you suffer a more horrible beating!” Qin Lingyan was warning him in speech, yet she was afraid in her heart. She was afraid Bai Xiaofei really had some sort of trick she was unable to see through because she’d intentionally paid attention to Bai Xiaofei during this period of time, and she found out that Bai Xiaofei had never suffered a loss in all the information she received.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once or twice might be a coincidence, but three or four times meant something was wrong!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can we really not delay it anymore?” Bai Xiaofei controlled the delight at the bottom of his heart while revealed a troubled expression as he asked this question, and the reply he got was a disdainful roll of the eyes from Qin Lingyan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ll never prevail with your ability!” Qin Lingyan turned and left after she said this, and she didn’t waste her breath with Bai Xiaofei, whereas, the members of the Savage Class were instantly in an uproar when she left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some cursed at Qin Lingyan for being arrogant, some laughed at her for being stupid, and there were even some that started to prepare how they would celebrate their triumphant victory tonight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As far as they were concerned, Qin Lingyan had made an enormous mistake — She’d underestimated Bai Xiaofei!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, quiet down. We have to prepare everything before we go for classes in the afternoon because she hasn’t left much time to us!” Bai Xiaofei revealed confidence in winning as he asked everyone to stop, and then he distributed assignment after assignment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Practically none of them had the mood to listen to the class in the afternoon because all their thoughts were filled with anticipation towards the battle tonight. But, Bai Xiaofei was extremely relaxed instead, and he was continuously interacting with the teacher because he was unable to learn these theoretical things at the Gorge of Heroes!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hand of time moved bit by bit, and it wasn’t long before the bell that indicated the end of the last class resounded out, and after the spectacled teacher that taught warfare announced the end of class, all of them rose and bowed before rushing out of the class while only Bai Xiaofei and Lin Li remained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long after, Xue Ying who’d been at leisure somewhere all this time waked in unhurriedly, and she felt slightly more at ease when she saw Bai Xiaofei who had a smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is everything ready?” It wasn't a form of question but a form of care.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“More or less, no one is able to cover every aspect, right?” Bai Xiaofei grinned, and he was slightly at a loss for what expression he should use to face Xue Ying at this moment. After all, Lin Li was still here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the month they were in the Infinite Mountain Range, the two of them had met by themselves on countless occasions. But, it was mostly for sparring or strolling and chatting in the forest, whereas, 'special circumstances’ like the one that occurred that night didn't occur again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, even the two of them were unable to explain exactly what sort of state they were in. In any case, it was impossible for their relationship to be a pure relationship between teacher and student….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The principal will be watching, so don't go too far.” Xue Ying reminded carefully. She wasn't worried that Bai Xiaofei would suffer a loss because even she had blind confidence towards Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That isn't up to me because if I don't go too far, then I might be the one that gets beaten up instead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Plans were eternally incapable of catching up to the changes in a situation. Not to mention the intention to hold back had never crossed Bai Xiaofei's mind….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I've already investigated, and Qin Lingyan is the eldest daughter of the Violethorn Empire’s Cloudrise Marquis. You better restrain yourself because you won't be staying in Starnet Academy all your life, and you have to consider the influence of the various powers once you leave the academy.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei didn't say anything in reply to Xue Ying’s reminder, and he walked slowly to stand in front of her instead before staring right at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll commit it to memory.” Xue Ying couldn't help but be stunned when his gentle voice resounded out, and then her valiant face blushed slightly….</span></p>
