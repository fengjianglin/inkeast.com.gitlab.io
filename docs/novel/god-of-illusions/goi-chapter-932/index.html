 <p>Chapter 932: In The End…</p> 
 <p>“My dear disciple, I’m glad that you are reading this letter. At least it shows that you are still alive and the storm has passed. As for me, I should already be gone, but definitely to the place I should belong to. After all, I owe too many debts that can’t be repaid even with my death.</p> 
 <p>I’m sure you already know that Ran’er is a human puppet, but I believe you won’t mind. Once she grows to the blackgold grade and passes the adaptation period, she will be no different from a normal person. However, it is very likely that she won’t be able to be reborn soon. But I believe that you can definitely return her to your side.</p> 
 <p>Shadow Death has gotten what they want. According to their style, they will stop pestering Ethereal or you and Ran’er, so you can rest assured. As for the debts of blood I owe, I won’t ask anyone for forgiveness. I only hope that you can protect Ran’er.</p> 
 <p>Once a godsmith of Ethereal,<br> Pinocchio…”</p> 
 <p>At the end of the letter was the method to bring Yan Ran’er back to life. The blackgold heart left by the Corpse Eater Worm was the core material to repair her.</p> 
 <p>Pinocchio had made a perfect prediction about what would happen. He satisfied Shadow Death’s demands while also giving Yan Ran’er a chance to live. He had even factored in his own death…</p> 
 <p>Thus, the human puppet matter completely ended, leaving nothing but devastating scars on Ethereal: the destruction of the Holy Puppetsmith Mountain, namely the Heavenly Nonaburn Formation, and the large casualties of puppetsmiths. With their forte suffering a severe blow, Ethereal entered the lowest point in its history.</p> 
 <p>The envoys of the various countries left contentedly, while Ling Yue made plans for Ethereal to recuperate.</p> 
 <p>He did not pursue Pinocchio’s mistake, as the old man had made an indelible contribution to Ethereal. Without his support, the Holy Puppetsmith Mountain couldn’t have been integrated.</p> 
 <p>“What are you going to do next?” Bai Xiaofei asked Ling Yue, who had struggled to set aside some free time in his busy schedule.</p> 
 <p>“Pinocchio donated all of his blueprints. Although there is no more Holy Puppetsmith Mountain, Ethereal is still Ethereal. As long as puppetsmiths and the technology remain, we will still be the holy place of puppet-forging on the continent.” Ling Yue smiled, not at a dead end as Bai Xiaofei had thought.</p> 
 <p>“It’s for the best that you have this mindset.” Bai Xiaofei laughed, then looked hesitant to say something.</p> 
 <p>“Lil’ Bro, just say what you want. Ethereal couldn’t have been able to survive this disaster without you.” Although Ling Yue hadn’t thoroughly understood Bai Xiaofei, he knew that the latter wouldn’t visit unless there was some business.</p> 
 <p>“Heh, I knew I couldn’t hide it from you, brother. I really have a favor to ask.” Bai Xiaofei smiled sleazily.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Ling Yue wryly shook his head. “It’s about the little girl, isn’t it?” He had guessed it before Bai Xiaofei even spoke.</p> 
 <p>“I only have a few good brothers. Ran’er is Shi Kui’s mental pillar, and I believe that he will not do anything taboo. If you give him enough time, he will certainly make Ethereal proud.” Bai Xiaofei looked at Ling Yue carefully.</p> 
 <p>Ling Yue laughed. “I believe in your judgment, and I am also looking forward to that day. As for younger sister Ran’er, not many people know about her. I have already made arrangements. Now in Ethereal, there’s no longer a single human puppet.” This answer was obviously prepared in advance.</p> 
 <p>“You have my thanks, Big Brother!” Bai Xiaofei stood up and sincerely bowed to Ling Yue.</p> 
 <p>Although Pinocchio made reparations for what he had done, in the view of the majority, it was what he deserved. Therefore, it couldn’t be deemed enough to ask for protection for Yan Ran’er, while Bai Xiaofei still had to ensure her safety as she now meant everything to Shi Kui!</p> 
 <p>Furthermore, she was also the opportunity for Shi Kui to advance in his smithing skill!</p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai, if you have finished asking your questions, I also have something to ask you.” Ling Yue struck while the iron was hot.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei distinguished between different matters clearly. He said, “I will definitely go.” His gratitude would not keep him in Ethereal.</p> 
 <p>“Why? Isn’t Ethereal worth your stay, Lil’ Brother? I promise you can choose any area in Ethereal to be your residence!” Ling Yue threw out a bait that no ordinary person could refuse.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, Bai Xiaofei was not interested.</p> 
 <p>“It’s not about worth, it’s that I have something to do. But I guarantee that no matter where I am, I will offer my help whenever you need it. And I believe that if I’m in trouble, you won’t sit idly by either.” These were not words of courtesy. Bai Xiaofei stated it as a fact.</p> 
 <p>“I promise as the emperor of Ethereal that wherever our empire reaches, there will be a place for you, Brother Bai,” Ling Yue solemnly promised while looking Bai Xiaofei in the eyes. Then, he took out a crystal clear topaz stone and handed it to Bai Xiaofei. “From now on, Brother Bai, you are the lifelong Imperial Preceptor of Ethereal. There has been no one in this position before and there will be no one else in the future.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei received the topaz and looked at the impressive calligraphy ‘Fei’ on it. A smile bloomed on his face.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t forget to pay me salary!”</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>Bidding farewell to Ling Yue, Bai Xiaofei left the imperial city. Tan Xin jumped out of nowhere with a candy toy in her hand and looked at him curiously.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter, not happy? You look preoccupied.”</p> 
 <p>She was as keen as ever. After this period of time, she had become more and more knowledgeable about Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“We have stayed in Ethereal for almost half a year,” said Bai Xiaofei absent-mindedly as he gazed at the bustling streets.</p> 
 <p>“Oh! I see. You are sad to have to part, huh? Why, because you can’t take advantage of my carelessness and hook up with another girl anymore?” Tan Xin never asked about Xue Ying’s departure, but occasionally used it to taunt Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Maybe. Even though I’m curious about the future and the road ahead, the thought of parting is somehow a bit heavy. Maybe I am a nostalgic person.”</p> 
 <p>With a wry smile, Bai Xiaofei reorganized his mood and looked in the distance.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go, there are many things waiting for us!”</p>
