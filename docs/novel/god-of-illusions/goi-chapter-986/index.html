 <p>Chapter 986: Pursuit? Ambush?</p> 
 <p>“Retreat! Retreat immediately!”</p> 
 <p>Looking at Ahetu’s group who were as agile as monkeys, Bai Xiaofei decisively ordered an immediate retreat. Adding a bitter smile on his face was that the huge team took off from the cliffs at such a speed that made him think that they had long been ready to run.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t be surprised, think about who you are leading. Compared to fighting, this is what they are best at,” commented Ye Qingtong indifferently.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but feel embarrassed. After all, for bandits and battlefield cannon fodder, escaping was the most compulsory skill for survival!</p> 
 <p>In less than five minutes, the 10,000-odd men were nowhere to be seen, leaving only 2000 thousand stripped-clean and tied-up prisoners when Ahetu appeared on the cliff with his people.</p> 
 <p>“Where are they?” asked Ahetu coldly,</p> 
 <p>The captain of the captured group stumbled over and replied in a trembling voice, “Reporting to Chief, they… they ran away…”</p> 
 <p>Originally, he truly looked forward to the arrival of friendly forces, but after seeing Ahetu, this expectation turned into fear.</p> 
 <p>“So many of our brothers died, yet you lot survived as prisoners. Our face is all lost by you!” Without many words, Ahetu waved his machete.</p> 
 <p>“Chief! It’s to gather information! They… They are not Moonlight’s regular troops, but a group of cannon fodder and bandits. There are more than 10,000 people in total, and they don’t even have decent equipment!” The captain made his final struggle with the best excuse he could come up with.</p> 
 <p>“You mean I’ve been stalled here by a group of trash and fed them the lives of tens of thousands of soldiers?!” Ahetu snorted.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the team captain’s face turned ash-pale.</p> 
 <p>“The Sacks only have sacrificed brave fighters, no prisoners!”</p> 
 <p>As Ahetu’s icy declaration echoed, the elite team executed his order without any hesitation, cutting down the captured group. Captives were a disgrace to real soldiers!</p> 
 <p>With the departure of Bai Xiaofei’s group, the road ahead of the Sacks became obstacle-free. However, the devastated valley filled with rubble gave Ahetu’s army a headache.</p> 
 <p>“Send thirty thousand people to pursue! That group of people cannot be let off!” ordered Ahetu, who could not swallow his fury. Although he cut down the team captain earlier, he had still listened to his words. No soldier of Sacks would lie about such a thing.</p> 
 <p>The selected squad of 30,000 immediately put down the supplies they carried and assembled. While they spent a long time passing through the valley on horseback, the lost time would easily be covered as Bai Xiaofei’s group was only on foot.</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>“Hold on!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei suddenly stopped his group mid-run through a forest. Looking at the towering trees around, the gears in his brain quickly turned.</p> 
 <p>“Sister Qingtong, you take them and leave first. Xin’er and I will stay here,” he said.</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingtong frowned. “Are you worried that they will come after us?” she asked.</p> 
 <p>“I’m not worried, I’m sure of it. Those prisoners will surely report our situation to their commander. Do you think he will let this slide?” Bai Xiaofei smiled wryly, obviously having imagined a furious Ahetu’s reaction.</p> 
 <p>“Then I’ll leave it to you two. Try to kill as many as possible!” Ye Qingtong was quick to agree. Having seen the two’s abilities, she would never worry about them again.</p> 
 <p>While their hands would be tied if they got into a head-on confrontation with the Sacks, digging holes and setting traps were another thing as Bai Xiaofei could go against tens of thousands of troops using this method!</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, even if I can’t get rid of them all, I’ll make them sick to the stomach.” Bai Xiaofei chortled.</p> 
 <p>With that, he watched Ye Qingtong leave with the huge team.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s get started. Go all out with your imagination. There is only one purpose, and you already know it.” Bai Xiaofei didn’t give Tan Xin a clear plan this time.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin laughed. “Why do I feel that we’re being too much with this?” she commented, but her hand already shone with the light representing the ability of creation.</p> 
 <p>“Too much? I don’t think so at all,” replied Bai Xiaofei as he took out Mind Sunder. Next to him, Blackie was eager to give it a try as well…</p> 
 <p>With their joint efforts, in just over three hours, the only road through the forest had become a ready slaughterhouse!</p> 
 <p>“Wait. What if the first people who come here aren’t the Sacks? We will be killing innocent people.” Tan Xin was suddenly struck with a thought. She didn’t know what Bai Xiaofei had prepared, but she knew what she had arranged. Once any of her traps were triggered, the other party would be handicapped for life, if not killed.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I checked and noticed that there weren’t any footprints around here even though this is an official road for transportation. In this kind of situation, will anyone else besides the Sacks run any transportation?” Bai Xiaofei dispelled her concerns before looking expectantly in the direction they had come from. “I hope you didn’t send too few people, or you may not be able to finish this road.”</p> 
 <p>After expressing his ‘concern’ for the Sacks, Bai Xiaofei left the forest with Tan Xin without looking back.</p> 
 <p>Different from the settings in the valley, the traps in the forest were the type that triggered upon touch and did not need human control. The only pity was that they couldn’t stay to see Ahetu’s fear and anger.</p> 
 <p>Not long after Bai Xiaofei left, the pursuers sent by Ahetu raced over. Bai Xiaofei’s advantage of setting out nearly ten hours in advance had been shortened to only three hours by them!</p> 
 <p>“Captain, from the marks they left, they should have left less than four hours ago. The marks are very messy, not like that of a regular army at all.”</p> 
 <p>The pursuers were fortunate to have stopped once they entered the forest, but were unfortunate that the report from the scouts sent the squad captain into exhilaration.</p> 
 <p>“For provoking us mighty Sacks, today is the day they die!” declared the squad captain with a snort as he got back on his horse. Then, he shouted at the troops behind him. “Focus! We will catch up with them in another hour. Before sunset, we must annihilate those trash and avenge our dead comrades! Forward, my brothers!”</p>
