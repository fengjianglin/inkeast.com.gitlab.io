 <p>Chapter 254: Bai Xiaofei's Persistence</p> 
 <p>After leaving the office, Bai Xiaofei headed towards the square, because he knew that the students there were waiting for him.</p> 
 <p>Step by step, he arrived in the middle of the square. As the situation was too solemn, no one cheered for him. The whole square was quiet as if all these people were not present.</p> 
 <p>“I don't know if there are more like Di Jiang in Starnet, but I hope that from now on, you will not yield when encountering similar situations because yielding will only result in a life worse than death. Standing straight is the fundamental of being a human! This will not change anywhere!”</p> 
 <p>The words echoed around the square. With the help of Chu Liuyun, Bai Xiaofei's voice reached everyone's ears loud and clear.</p> 
 <p>“As for the current unfinished business, I will give you a satisfactory answer, one that they cannot make!”</p> 
 <p>With that final promise, Bai Xiaofei started walking in the direction toward the Demon of Illusions.</p> 
 <p>The scattered members of the Savage Class wanted to catch up with him, but they all chose to stop in unison after a look at him.</p> 
 <p><em>This is Brother Fei?</em></p> 
 <p>From Bai Xiaofei, they felt a hint of distance, the kind of feeling that Bai Xiaofei was still Bai Xiaofei, but also not the Bai Xiaofei they knew… At the same time, a kind of intuition welled up in their hearts. Perhaps, before they could understand the Bai Xiaofei right now, they wouldn’t be able to stand beside him…</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei’s own heart was also in turmoil.</p> 
 <p>In the Gorge of Heroes, he had heard plenty about the injustice in the world. In those stories, the small and the weak never seemed to have fair results, or to be more exact, there never seemed to be any justice in the world. Listening to these stories, Bai Xiaofei tried to sync with the heart of the storytellers. For some reason, however, a little something was always missing.</p> 
 <p>But now he knew why.</p> 
 <p>Hearsay would always be hearsay. Only after one had experienced it for themselves could they understand the feeling – the feeling that they had to pretend to accept something with agony in their heart.</p> 
 <p>This kind of feeling… was truly indescribable.</p> 
 <p>“Are you really going to let him off?” Chu Liuyun suddenly asked as they walked. Bai Xiaofei immediately stopped and turned around. In that instant, Chu Liuyun saw a look that she would never be able to forget in her lifetime.</p> 
 <p>“If I let him off, my surname is not Bai!”</p> 
 <p>After returning to the Demon of Illusions, Bai Xiaofei locked himself in his room. For a whole afternoon, he never took a step out, while Chu Liuyun and the others were thoughtful enough not to bother him. However, waiting was always something that made people anxious.</p> 
 <p>“Xiaofei is not going to take it too hard, right?”</p> 
 <p>Yun Sheng was as pessimistic as ever. With him, you would always know what the worst result would be…</p> 
 <p>“If you don't want your mouth sewn up, shut up!” Chu Liuyun threw a cold glare at Yun Sheng before looking in the direction of Bai Xiaofei’s room, an action that she couldn’t remember how many times she had done that afternoon.</p> 
 <p>“Sister Lei!”</p> 
 <p>Just as they were waiting for Bai Xiaofei, Lei Min, who had not returned all afternoon, finally showed up. Chu Liuyun’s face revealed a hint of delight. What she cared about was the news brought back by Lei Min.</p> 
 <p>From everyone’s expression, Lei Min already understood what was happening. Her tone was laced with a hint of helplessness. “He hasn't been out, has he?”</p> 
 <p>“No.” Chu Liuyun slowly shook her head.</p> 
 <p>“If he comes out, tell him that Lei Shan has made a decision. Jing Cheng and Chu Qingtian will personally deliver Di Jiang out of Starnet three days later until he arrives at a safe place. He’s currently receiving treatment in the Furnace of Agarwood and is completely isolated. No one can approach without Lei Shan's permission.”</p> 
 <p>It was clear about Lei Min's attitude from how she referred to Lei Shan by his name. The old man’s decision this time had once again lengthened the distance that they had tried so hard to close. However, Lei Shan might not feel that he had done anything wrong. Everyone had their own reasons to consider. Just like how Bai Xiaofei didn't want anything bad to happen to the members of the Savage Class, Lei Shan didn't want to see his men end up in eternal damnation.</p> 
 <p>At the end of the day, it all came down to ‘sentiment.’</p> 
 <p>This was the most complicated, most difficult concept to explain in human beings. You’d never know what unexpected situations would happen because of that word.</p> 
 <p>“Xiaofei…”</p> 
 <p>Before Chu Liuyun could agree to deliver the message, Yun Sheng suddenly let out a small yelp. Bai Xiaofei, who had made no movement at all since morning, had come out.</p> 
 <p>“Don't hold grudges against the old man because of this. He has his difficulties. It’s all good as long as we persist.” To everyone’s surprise, Bai Xiaofei didn’t complain about Lei Shan and even advised Lei Min instead.</p> 
 <p>“Then what are you going to do?” Lei Min didn’t comment on Bai Xiaofei's advice. She was more concerned about his state at the moment.</p> 
 <p>“Do what I have to do.” Bai Xiaofei's answer was so simple he might as well not have answered at all.</p> 
 <p>“Can we help you?” Lei Min might be the only one at the director level and above who wasn’t satisfied with Lei Shan's handling method. In her opinion, Di Jiang should die!</p> 
 <p>“The fewer people involved in this muddy water, the less likely it is to disturb the fish inside. I’ll leave the Demon of Illusions for a few days. You guys can just tell others that you can't find me,” saying this, Bai Xiaofei headed out.</p> 
 <p>“Wait!”</p> 
 <p>Chu Liuyun, who had been silent, couldn't refrain from shouting. However, when Bai Xiao turned back, she didn’t know what to say.</p> 
 <p>“We will be waiting for you!” she finally stressed these few words with stubbornness on her face. A trace of stubbornness that no one knew where it came from.</p> 
 <p>“I'll be fine. Rest assured, I’ll definitely come back to do what I promised you guys. The Demon of Illusions must continue.” With a shallow smile, Bai Xiaofei turned to leave again. This time, no one stopped him.</p> 
 <p><em>Idiot, that's not what I care about! You must come back safely!</em> Chu Liuyun looked at his departing back with a complicated expression.</p> 
 <p>Exiting the Demon of Illusions, Bai Xiaofei headed straight for the Blossom Pavilion. With the help of Huskie, he changed into another face.</p> 
 <p>This was Huskie’s new ability. After swallowing the golden wolf’s magic core, Huskie didn’t inherit any of the wolf’s abilities but had directly jumped from blue to red grade. And although there was still a long way to go until the violet level, Huskie had gained the ability to combine with Bai Xiaofei. In other words, Bai Xiaofei could become anyone he wanted!</p> 
 <p>As for the fact that gaining a new ability after upgrading was a never-before-heard thing on the mainland, Bai Xiaofei didn’t care. As he had said, Huskie’s peculiarity was unexplainable.</p>
