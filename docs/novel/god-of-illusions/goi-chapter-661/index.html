 <p>Chapter 661: Approval; Information on the Falling Flower Formation!</p> 
 <p>All kinds of lights struck Bai Xiaofei as Cang Lan used his Legend Rank power.</p> 
 <p>However, the old man had actually gone easy on Bai Xiaofei. Firstly, he still used Energy Stream puppets despite the fact that Bai Xiaofei could absorb energy attacks in the Endless State. Secondly, he only let all of those puppets carry out the most common attacks.</p> 
 <p>In Cang Lan’s opinion, this was enough of a concession. Whether Bai Xiaofei could survive it would be his own problem!</p> 
 <p>However, for some reason Cang Lan couldn’t figure out, he actually looked forward to seeing Bai Xiaofei pull through.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei’s concentration was its highest. He could see that Cang Lan had gone easy on him, so he chose to tackle this series of attacks head-on instead of relying on his second Starnet Brilliance.</p> 
 <p>The origin energy in his entire body was activated. Bai Xiaofei first used brute force to open a gap in the encirclement of puppets that used purely physical attacks. Then, he submerged himself into the next sea of fire. The Legend Rank attack was too high above his limit and his energy absorption quickly reached saturation. Just before the flames damaged him, he bombarded the physical puppets hidden in the sea of fire with his accumulated energy, sending them flying…</p> 
 <p>Although Cang Lan only launched one wave, the attacks of more than 20 puppets still lasted for nearly 30 seconds. The horrifying explosions woke up the triplets, who hadn’t yet fallen into deep sleep. The moment they rushed out, they saw only smoke and dust all over the area and Cang Lan floating in midair.</p> 
 <p>The three gulped with their eyes wide in disbelief. <em>What’s happening?!</em></p> 
 <p>As the smoke gradually cleared, they quickly found the answer.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei, who didn’t have a single clean spot on his body, stood there quietly. Blood slowly trickling down his face, he smiled, looking quite tragic.</p> 
 <p>“I… survived, and I didn’t use… this!”</p> 
 <p>Showing two rows of white teeth, Bai Xiaofei dangled the Starnet Brilliance. Once again, this seemingly ordinary boy deeply shocked Cang Lan.</p> 
 <p>“Grandpa!!! What did you do?!!”</p> 
 <p>Leng Liuying instantly rushed out. The other two had the same reaction as they glared at Cang Lan in an interrogative manner.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, we had a fun… duel… I am fine…”</p> 
 <p>Before he could finish, he staggered and fell. However, he didn’t hit the ground as Cang Lan slightly raised his hand and made his body float in the air.</p> 
 <p>The Leng triplets quickly approached Bai Xiaofei, their still-swollen eyes growing red again.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, he won’t die. He’s just drained and only suffered some minor injuries. He’ll recover in a day or two.”</p> 
 <p>Cang Lan indifferently blocked the words the three girls’ were about to say. He knew his three baby granddaughters very well. If he didn’t explain first, they might just break off all relations with him.</p> 
 <p>“Even if you don’t want to teach him, there’s no need to do this! He just wants to be better able to protect us! What did he do wrong?!” Leng Liuli loudly questioned.</p> 
 <p>Cang Lan descended from the air without answering and started walking away.</p> 
 <p>“Be prepared. When he wakes up, I’ll teach you four God Control. I am going to prepare some materials first,” said Cang Lan calmly. The next second, he had turned into a flash that disappeared into the trees.</p> 
 <p>After he left, the triplets stood there stunned for half a day, until Bai Xiaofei’s coughs jolted them from their daze.</p> 
 <p>Cang Lan said ‘recover in a day or two,’ but that was for normal people. Bai Xiaofei was not a normal person. Those injuries didn’t even count as serious to him!</p> 
 <p>“Where’s the smelly old man?” His first sentence after waking up almost choked the triplets to death.</p> 
 <p>No wonder he got beaten up. This guy must be the first person to call Cang Lan so. Even if he died, the triplets would think he deserved it. That would be the price for treating Cang Lan like he treated Lei Shan and Revelation.</p> 
 <p>“Are you all right?” asked Leng Liuli with concern as she suppressed the urge to complain.</p> 
 <p>Compared to Cang Lan’s feelings, the triplets obviously cared more about Bai Xiaofei’s condition.</p> 
 <p>“Of course I’m fine. His little attacks are like tickles,” Bai Xiaofei said proudly, as if it wasn’t him who had just been knocked unconscious.</p> 
 <p>“Then you can continue to sleep outside!”</p> 
 <p>His pride didn’t last two seconds as Leng Liuying pulled Leng Liuli up. Bai Xiaofei, having lost her support, fell face-first on the ground.</p> 
 <p>“No! I was just joking! In fact, I am seriously injured!” he shouted.</p> 
 <p>Leng Liushuang hesitantly looked back. A glimmer of hope rose in Bai Xiaofei’s heart to see this, but Leng Liuying then firmly pulled her back.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t have pity for him. If he’s really hurt, he might as well die!” Leng Liuying said coldly.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s heart sank to the bottom. <em>I’m so done, my motive was thoroughly seen through…</em></p> 
 <p>Looking at the sun slowly climbing up the hill, Bai Xiaofei sighed helplessly, and then took out the black bead he had collected in the Falling Flower Formation.</p> 
 <p>In fact, Cang Lan was so mindful of Bai Xiaofei because of what had happened when they had first met. After all, Bai Xiaofei did not look like a good puppet master at all, because what kind of good puppet master drew energy from corpses? That was clearly an evil practice!</p> 
 <p>However, even if Bai Xiaofei knew that he would be suspected by Cang Lan, he would still take the black bead with him. For nothing else, just because it was one of the important cores of the Falling Flower Formation.</p> 
 <p>The formation was composed of three smaller-layered formations. Even separately, each of them was worthy of being called ‘high-quality goods.’ The Falling Flower Formation skillfully blended them and made them a whole that enhanced each other!</p> 
 <p>The outermost formation was the first layer. If one’s spirit was insufficient or they didn’t have a strong ability to solve formations, this layer was enough to keep the opponent out.</p> 
 <p>The second layer was a killing formation with the black bead as the core. It used hatred and grievance to deal damage with illusions. The attacks Bai Xiaofei had faced there were actually real, they only lacked manual control, or else the formation would be invincible!</p> 
 <p>As for the third layer, it was a space for condensing energy. The energy of those who were killed in the second layer would be absorbed into the third layer, and this layer could also absorb energy from the outside world. Therefore, the speed of absorbing energy would greatly increase there. The energy in this layer was also used to support the operations of the first two formations.</p> 
 <p>In other words, as long as one succeeded in setting up the Falling Flower Formation, they would not need to pay any energy to maintain it! Of course, it was another matter if someone solved the formation.</p> 
 <p>However, no matter what, Bai Xiaofei had struck gold with his blood!</p>
