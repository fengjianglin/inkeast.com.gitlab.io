 <p>Chapter 1011: Barbaric Godism!</p> 
 <p>“What’s wrong? The mighty Bai Xiaofei don’t even dare to sit now?” Bringing Bai Xiaofei all the way back to the main keep, Qiu Muxue looked at him amusedly.</p> 
 <p>“It’s natural to bow your head when you’re under someone else’s roof. After all, my life is still in your hands, no?” Bai Xiaofei laughed sheepishly, then his eyes fell on the girl beside her. “If I didn’t remember wrong, you are Senior Sister Lan Shuang.”</p> 
 <p>This successfully changed the topic and stunned the two women at the same time.</p> 
 <p>If Qiu Muxue kept a low profile, then Lan Shuang was next to invisible. She had no obvious feature that made her memorable.</p> 
 <p>“No need to be surprised. When I helped with the Blossom Pavilion, I looked through everyone’s profile since I didn’t know who would be on the list. You two were very close then and so I remembered you both. Originally, I and Senior Jingshuang even planned to debut you two as a pair,” Bai Xiaofei explained when he noticed their doubts.</p> 
 <p>Although he looked like he had gradually adapted to his situation, he was, in fact, quite nervous inside. He actually still hadn’t figured out what Qiu Muxue wanted to use him for, so being extremely careful was the only thing he could do.</p> 
 <p>“No need to probe, I really don’t mean any harm. On the contrary, I need your help.” Qiu Muxue’s voice was low, her expression despondent.</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t hear that wrong, did I? You are the Saintess who, on her own, integrated the entire Sacks race and even helped them capture seven of Moonlight’s fortresses in just a month. What can I even help you with? I’m just a humble character.” Bai Xiaofei smiled self-deprecatingly as he expressed his stand – <em>We are still enemies!</em></p> 
 <p>“You seem to be quite hostile to the Sacks. Then again, it’s understandable. After all, you see from the viewpoint of Moonlight.” Qiu Muxue sighed and said, “Are you interested in hearing an old tale?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was stunned. <em>A tale? What are you on about?!</em></p> 
 <p>“I love stories, but I hope to hear a happy ending.” He assumed an ‘I’m all ears’ posture.</p> 
 <p>Qiu Muxue took a deep breath and began her tale, “In fact, the continent deeply misunderstands the Sacks. From a long time ago, we are no longer what they think of us.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s interest was piqued. Both he and Ye Qingcheng had been wondering about this. The Sacks weren’t like what all the books about them described as.</p> 
 <p>“Once, the Sacks were an out-and-out nomadic clan, and every tribe stayed out of each other’s way. Life was difficult and they often didn’t have a full meal, but since ancient times, there had been no problems with maintaining the population. However, all this changed twenty years ago. A strange stone statue suddenly fell into our territory and changed the entire clan.”</p> 
 <p>“At first, everyone was in awe of that alien artifact, but soon we realized how special it was when great changes took place in our bodies. Men, women, children, everyone’s physical quality got better day by day, and many chronic diseases that had been bothering us for years suddenly disappeared. Then one day, we accidentally discovered that we had the ability to stop people’s energy flow.”</p> 
 <p>“Despite this formidable ability, the peaceful Sacks didn’t even think of exploiting it. We simply enjoyed the benefits brought by that stone idol. However, gradually, those seemingly harmless benefits brought upon us a calamity!”</p> 
 <p>“As a nomadic clan, we rely on the grasslands for survival, but since our physical quality kept getting better, our population kept increasing and so did the amount of food needed. The grasslands were used more and more frequently, but even so, it was impossible to meet the soaring demands of the booming population.”</p> 
 <p>“And so, wars broke out. All the tribes started to fight for the limited food resources. During this, we made new discoveries: Whoever won and survived would see their ability greatly strengthened. Therefore, besides survival, we made war for a new purpose: power!”</p> 
 <p>Listening to this point, Bai Xiaofei’s expression went from nonchalant to a frown. He couldn’t see her lying at all unless her acting had reached absolute perfection. If that was the case, then she would be a terrifying enemy to have.</p> 
 <p>“Soon, among the tribes, there were born many powerful clansmen whose strength far exceeded the rest. In order to consolidate their status, those people gathered together and set up a brand-new organization called Barbaric Godism! Barbaric Godism worshipped the stone idol as their Barbaric God and called themselves the god’s representatives, declaring that they aimed to benefit all Sacks with good changes and evolution.”</p> 
 <p>“Everyone thought that the establishment of this organization would bring good changes, but in the end, it turned out otherwise – they only made a more brutal new tribe. Ridiculously, though, under their brutal exploitation, the population was back under control again, giving the Sacks time to recover. Barbaric Godism also grew day by day. If it weren’t for the fact that they hated to distribute the benefits to more people and used strict screening conditions to control the number of members, I’m afraid the whole Sacks would have become their believers by now.”</p> 
 <p>“However, this false peace soon came to an end. Since seven years ago, the grasslands on which the Sacks have lived for generations have started turning into desertland! The already scarce food resources have become a limited product that determines our life and death, and we once again entered a civil war!”</p> 
 <p>Qiu Muxue was trembling when she mentioned this.</p> 
 <p>“It was in that war that I lost my family…” she murmured, her eyes reddened.</p> 
 <p>Lan Shuang immediately held her hand and softly comforted her.</p> 
 <p>“So, you went all the way to Starnet in order to find a way to fix the Sacks, right?” Bai Xiaofei helped her change the subject.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, and now it looks like I did the right thing. If I hadn’t met you, I would have led the Sacks to wage a full-scale war with Moonlight, forcing them to destroy the whole Sacks clan so that we can rebuild it from the ground up. Now, that is no longer necessary.” Qiu Muxue stared intently at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Under her gaze, Bai Xiaofei smiled bitterly. <em>So everyone knows of me as a nosy person now? Troubles come looking for me all the time and not the other way around, alright?!</em></p> 
 <p>“You think I’d agree to help you? You’re gambling with your life!” he said helplessly.</p> 
 <p>Unexpectedly, Qiu Muxue had already prepared the answer to this question.</p> 
 <p>“First of all, I am your senior sister. Although you seemed to have been causing trouble for Starnet all the time back then, in fact, you are very sentimental and what happened at the bicentennial celebration made you attach great importance to your schoolmates.”</p> 
 <p>“Secondly, you are on the side of Moonlight, so I know you don’t want to see a war in full swing because not only will Moonlight suffer heavy casualties but you will also risk your life protecting your own people.”</p> 
 <p>“Thirdly, you like challenges. Your personality alone won’t let you refuse my request.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei, as the audience, suddenly had the premonition that this matter was destined to be entrusted in his hands. He had to admit that Qiu Muxue had understood him to quite a deep degree.</p> 
 <p>“Since you know me so well, you should also know that I won’t do anything without benefits!” Bai Xiaofei chose to accept his fate in the end, but not for nothing.</p> 
 <p>“Of course. First of all, as long as you agree to help me, I can always find a reason to withdraw my troops and spare Moonlight from war, making you the common benefactor of both Moonlight and the Sacks. You should know what this means. Secondly, Barbaric Godism has two divine items. As long as you handle them, those two items will be all yours! Finally…”</p> 
 <p>After triumphantly stating the first two benefits, Qiu Muxue lowered her head.</p> 
 <p>“Finally, I will also be yours!” She bit the bullet and declared.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei stared blankly in shock.</p> 
 <p><em>What the hell?!! What bastard is spreading false rumors about me?! When did this lord become a sex maniac who eats women wherever I go?! To the point that they think they can use women as rewards for my labor?! The heavens know I’m not that kind of person!!!</em></p> 
 <p>“If that’s not enough for you, me too!” Lan Shuang hurriedly added after a long time without getting any reaction from Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Stop! Stop right there!” Bai Xiaofei quickly stopped them. He felt obliged to clear his own name. “I’m really not that kind of person!”</p>
