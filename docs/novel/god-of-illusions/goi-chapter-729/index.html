 <p>Chapter 729: I Won’t Let You Down!</p> 
 <p>After being forced to a dead end step by step by Bai Xiaofei, Leng Hen finally took him seriously. The emperor originally thought that Bai Xiaofei had only been pushed out as a shield, but now it seemed that he was the main attacker!</p> 
 <p>“I think you may have some misunderstandings. If you don’t mind, how about we talk somewhere else?” There were too many people in the hall. Leng Hen was afraid that if their conversation dragged on, his face as an emperor would all be lost.</p> 
 <p>“Do we all go together?” Wen Xiaoyao was extremely sensitive. He had seen his fair share of ‘divide and conquer.’ As long as their group got separated, they might be captured by Leng Hen’s people within seconds.</p> 
 <p>However, before Leng Hen could answer, a smiling Bai Xiaofei suddenly opened his mouth.</p> 
 <p>“You guys wait for me. I want to talk to His Majesty alone.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, even Leng Hen was stunned. <em>Is this kid out of his mind? Isn’t he scared that I’ll take the opportunity to deal with him?</em></p> 
 <p>Despite his surprise, Leng Hen showed no emotions on his face. Wen Xiaoyao and the others wanted to tell Bai Xiaofei to take back what he just said, but they were stopped by Cang Lan.</p> 
 <p>“Let him go. We’re not here to start a fight, why bring so many people?” Cang Lan then turned to Leng Hen. “If anything happens to this smelly boy, you would be provoking all of the three legends at the same time.”</p> 
 <p>Cang Lan’s words were full of threat, but it wasn’t an empty threat.</p> 
 <p>Revelation was Bai Xiaofei’s master. Cang Lan had been Bai Xiaofei’s teacher for a while. Lin Nishang had just been saved by Bai Xiaofei and now owed him one right after repaying Revelation’s favor. If Bai Xiaofei died in the Snow Kingdom, the three legends might unprecedentedly come together. No one could bear such consequences.</p> 
 <p>“Master Cang Lan is too worried. I, Leng Hen, am not that kind of sinister little man,” Leng Hen solemnly replied.</p> 
 <p>Cang Lan nodded and continued, “Also, we are all tired from the long trip. We need a good place to rest with good wine and good food. If your reception is not up to par, don’t blame me for being rude.”</p> 
 <p>Cang Lan really left Leng Hen no face as he talked from the position of someone high above. But to Bai Xiaofei’s ear, that was not the case.</p> 
 <p><em>You smelly old man! You followed me for a comfortable vacation, didn’t you?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Didn’t you hear Master Cang Lan? Go and welcome our distinguished guests!” Leng Hen shouted.</p> 
 <p>Immediately, palace servants appeared and received Cang Lan’s group. Except for the triplets who worriedly watched as Bai Xiaofei disappeared with their father around the corner, the rest had started putting their hearts on the upcoming wine and food.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go. Don’t worry, smelly boy and Leng Hen would have such a day sooner or later. It’s better that it comes earlier than later. Do you want it to drag on for the rest of your lives?” Cang Lan saw it very thoroughly and easily persuaded the triplets.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei followed Leng Hen to the royal study. Leng Hen dismissed his attendants, leaving only the two of them in the spacious room.</p> 
 <p>Sitting down on a gold-plated chair, Leng Han started to observe Bai Xiaofei closely.</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t expect Starnet to produce such a talent.”</p> 
 <p>It was unexpected praise that started the conversation. Bai Xiaofei chose silence as his reply.</p> 
 <p>“Your real purpose of coming here is not to demand an explanation for Orton’s actions, is it?” Leng Hen asked after some thought. His question hit the main topic this time.</p> 
 <p>“It is. It’s just not my only purpose.” Bai Xiaofei indirectly confirmed Leng Hen’s guess.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Leng Hen smiled and leaned back in his chair.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s talk about your second purpose first. Let me guess, it concerns my three daughters?”</p> 
 <p>Leng Hen was not a fool, and he was not blind. His daughters had been looking at Bai Xiaofei like they wanted to melt him with their gazes. And given how desperate Leng Liushuang had been when she asked him to send reinforcements to the Holy Snow Mountain, if he really believed that Bai Xiaofei was only her schoolmate as she had said, he might as well stop being an emperor.</p> 
 <p>“Your guess is correct, it does. I want to marry them.” Bai Xiaofei respectfully bowed to Leng Hen and his tone was full of sincerity.</p> 
 <p>Leng Hen threw back his head and laughed out loud. His laughter was very piercing in Bai Xiaofei’s ears.</p> 
 <p>“I can see that my three daughters have tied their hearts to you, but this time, I may have to disappoint you lovebirds. It is not that I look down on you, but that you have not the strength to marry them yet.”</p> 
 <p>Leng Hen paused a little. Before Bai Xiaofei could say anything, he continued.</p> 
 <p>“Except for the three of them, I don’t have any other descendants. Therefore, whoever marries them will ascend the throne of the Snow Kingdom. There are too many people that have their eyes on them. I have blocked a lot for many years, and I will try to block more in the future. However, if I easily promise my daughters to an unknown boy, the kingdom will be in chaos.”</p> 
 <p>Having said that, Leng Hen leaned forward slightly and stared Bai Xiaofei in the eyes.</p> 
 <p>“So, you should know what I mean. Their marriage is not just a simple marriage. It concerns the fate of the whole kingdom!”</p> 
 <p>Leng Hen’s sharp eyes did not leave Bai Xiaofei’s face for a moment, as if trying to dig out information from the latter’s reaction.</p> 
 <p>“Then, what if one day… you can no longer block them?” Bai Xiaofei looked straight back without showing any negative emotions.</p> 
 <p>“If there is such a day, I will be left with no choice but to prioritize the future of the kingdom and choose the most suitable groom for them, in spite of the possibility that he may not be who they like. I also want to see my daughters perfectly satisfied, but as daughters of an emperor, there are matters that they are destined to have no choice.”</p> 
 <p>Leng Hen’s words were cruel, but Bai Xiaofei could hear the helplessness in his voice.</p> 
 <p>“If there is such a day, I will come to block all those people. No one can make them make a choice that they don’t want to make!” Bai Xiaofei stared Leng Hen in the eyes as he stressed every word.</p> 
 <p>A long silence of locking gazes ensued until Leng Hen burst out laughing again.</p> 
 <p>“Then you have to hurry, because I can feel that such a day is not far. If you fail to stand in front of me at that time, I will look down on you.” Leng Hen smiled as a strange glint flashed in his eyes.</p> 
 <p>“I won’t let you down!”</p> 
 <p>Finally, Bai Xiaofei revealed his first smile since entering the study…</p>
