 <p>Chapter 1037: Illusion Sword!</p> 
 <p>“Then let us commence our plan!” Sweeping his eyes over everyone in the room, Bai Xiaofei solemnly stood up.</p> 
 <p>The battle had officially started!</p> 
 <p>“Take me to see them.” Bai Xiaofei walked toward Fang Ye after everyone had set out on their respective missions.</p> 
 <p>“They can’t wait either. After all, I told them your story as a model example. When they heard that they could finally meet you, they were mad happy.” Although Fang Ye didn’t look too pleased, it wasn’t hard to tell from his tone that he had trust and confidence in those people.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I won’t disappoint them.” Bai Xiaofei flashed Fang Ye a smile and followed him out.</p> 
 <p>“Brothers, our boss is here!” shouted Fang Ye as the two arrived at the original garrison camp.</p> 
 <p>The next second, a large group of people rushed out. In a flurry, they assembled in front of Bai Xiaofei, each with shining eyes. The word ‘chaotic’ was tailor-made to describe this collective.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t stand in my way, let me see the boss!!”</p> 
 <p>“Who stepped on my foot?!”</p> 
 <p>“Don’t squeeze, don't squeeze, if you keep squeezing, I’ll get pregnant!”</p> 
 <p>There were voices of both men and women. Judging from the tones, they were all unrestrained people.</p> 
 <p>“They are just too excited. Normally they aren’t like this.” Fang Ye tried to explain with a bitter expression, but no matter how one looked at it, this group of people didn’t look like they were normal.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, you will have a long time to get to know me. Now, it’s time that I got to know you,” Bai Xiaofei assured, his voice loud and clear in the ears of every person.</p> 
 <p>“Whatever you say, Boss! Tell us what to do!”</p> 
 <p>Those who had squeezed themselves to the front looked at Bai Xiaofei with fanatic expressions, rubbing their hands in anticipation.</p> 
 <p>“Six cities in just one day!” Bai Xiaofei declared.</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye’s eyes widened. “Big Brother Fei! Just now, you didn’t…”</p> 
 <p>“Is this the first day you’ve known me?” Bai Xiaofei cut him off.</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye was speechless. Indeed, if Bai Xiaofei acted according to everyone’s common sense, then he wouldn’t be Bai Xiaofei. Moreover, Fang Ye knew that he never went wrong.</p> 
 <p>“I can’t guarantee that they are capable of such a feat.” Fang Ye gulped, trying to leave some wiggle room for his people.</p> 
 <p>“That’s not up to you. Only they can decide whether they are capable or not,” Bai Xiaofei said and turned back to the seemingly ‘mentally unstable’ group.</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye also looked over, and what he saw stunned him. He felt as if this was the first day that he had known this group of people. In those several thousand pairs of eyes were nothing but eagerness to try!</p> 
 <p>“Does the countdown start from now?” one of them asked.</p> 
 <p>The rest instantly calmed down and straightened their expressions. Seeing this instant mood change upon hearing about a mission, Bai Xiaofei revealed a pleased look.</p> 
 <p>“Here are the coordinates of the six cities and their general defensive layouts. You all have ten minutes to read them before you set out,” he said and handed them a strategic map compiled by Fang Lei. Although Bai Xiaofei had a lot of copies, he only took out one.</p> 
 <p>One map was certainly not enough for six thousand people to circulate and read. As the first person received the map, Bai Xiaofei immediately got a satisfactory answer. The group of six thousand spread out in an orderly manner, making way for ten people to gather and read the map together.</p> 
 <p>Five minutes later, they finished their discussion, and in the next five minutes, they each chose 599 people to lead.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, we are ready. There is less than one minute left. Do you have any instructions?”</p> 
 <p>The ten leaders stood in a row in front of Bai Xiaofei. There was no longer fanaticism in their eyes, only sheer determination!</p> 
 <p>“My last order: zero casualties!” Bai Xiaofei said.</p> 
 <p>The ten leaders immediately cupped their hands and bowed to him, “We will not disappoint!”</p> 
 <p>With that, the 6000 elites summoned their first collective puppets, a set of one big and two small flying swords.</p> 
 <p>Watching them fly into the horizon on the flying swords, Fang Ye’s lips curled up.</p> 
 <p>“Flying Excalibur, a flying puppet, the big one is responsible for defense and the two small ones for attacks. Their speed is top-tier among violet-grade puppets, pricy to customize.”</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye felt that the only thing he could do to help Bai Xiaofei was to introduce the equipment. Only today did he realize that he had used the method given by Bai Xiaofei to cultivate a group of monsters!</p> 
 <p>“Don’t look like you’ve been tricked. It’s all thanks to you that they’ve matured to that state. All I did was give you an idea. You just underestimated them too much, so I helped you realize their potential in order for you to lead them better in the future,” Bai Xiaofei said.</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye was astonished. “What do you mean? You’re back. Why do I still have to be in charge of those guys?!” He revealed a look of ‘I don’t want to be tortured anymore.’</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei smiled. “Even if I really want them, can you bear to give them to me?” his voice faintly echoed as he took off with Purple Luan and disappeared.</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye could only watch before shaking his head with a wry smile. “Ah, still too transparent with your emotions. It seems that I still have a lot to teach you brats!” mumbling to himself, Fang Ye’s hand shone as Into Oblivion appeared in it shaped like a tin can. Then, his origin energy surged. Two lights lit up at his back and rocketed him into the sky.</p> 
 <p>Before long, Fang Ye caught up with Bai Xiaofei, who was floating high above in the sky. On his shoulder was Blackie whose eyes shone and projected ten mini-screens, each streaming a different team of elites from earlier.</p> 
 <p>“How are you doing this?!” Fang Ye was shocked by this never-before-seen ability of Bai Xiaofei. He thought that he had already progressed very fast but always ended up feeling like a frog at the bottom of a well every time he saw Bai Xiaofei display his talent.</p> 
 <p>“Both Blackie and Huskie have advanced. Blackie’s new ability is Imaging, which lets her perceive the scene within a certain range and display it. Using Huskie’s ability to leave marks, I left some energy on them and then found a suitable distance to monitor. As long as I can sense my energy, I can monitor the surroundings of the marks remotely,” explained Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye could vaguely understand the concept. He gulped. “Damn! Formidable!”</p> 
 <p>“The formidable ones are these guys. If I remember correctly, they are all homeless children or orphans that you adopted over the years. ”Bai Xiaofei’s attention returned to the screens.</p> 
 <p>“They used to be, but now, they all have a home,” Fang Ye paused a little and proudly introduced, “Their home is called Illusion Sword!”</p>
