 <p>Chapter 635: Killing using Someone Else’s Hand!</p> 
 <p>The sun rose and Bai Xiaofei proceeded with his day as usual, guiding An Yue and A’Tao. Everything seemed normal until a flustered An Bang Ting found Bai Xiaofei. After clarifying the situation, the man’s turbid eyes were filled with expectation.</p> 
 <p>His eldest son was lost. How could he, a father, not be anxious?</p> 
 <p>“You said the First Prince went out last night? About what time?” Bai Xiaofei plausibly asked. An Bang Ting, who never even thought of doubting him, poured all his hope on him.</p> 
 <p>“Very early in the morning, before dawn. The soldiers guarding the entrance and his attending maids and eunuchs all said so. This is definitely the right information,” An Bang Ting recounted everything for fear of any omission.</p> 
 <p>“The people in his palace didn’t know who was looking for him?” Bai Xiaofei frowned and wore a contemplating expression.</p> 
 <p>“No, they said they only heard a loud scream, and then Ming’er ran out in a hurry.”</p> 
 <p>“What about Liu Rushi?” asked Bai Xiaofei. This instantly put anger on An Bang Ting’s face.</p> 
 <p>“He is gone as well! And Ming’er’s people said that when Ming’er left, he kept mumbling something about his master!” An Bang Ting clenched his fists. “If something happens to Ming’er because of him, he will not get away with it!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help a sigh. <em>That’s not gonna happen. After all, he’s already dead. But hey, it’s actually possible to satisfy your thirst for revenge.</em></p> 
 <p>“I can only do my best, but I can’t be certain that I’ll be able to find him,” Bai Xiaofei said and squatted down to face Huskie. “Huskie, do you remember the First Prince’s smell?”</p> 
 <p><em>Finally!</em> Huskie, who had taken another Crystal’s Longing from Bai Xiaofei last night, had already memorized his script. When Bai Xiaofei asked, he immediately nodded and barked twice.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately donned a delighted expression and looked up at An Bang Ting. “Can I mobilize the royal guards?”</p> 
 <p>“This is my token. You can command the royal guards with it!” An Bang Ting took out a glittering token.</p> 
 <p>Receiving it, Bai Xiaofei’s heart jumped a little. It seemed that An Bang Ting’s abdication was really just talk. The strongest force in the whole imperial city had never left his control!</p> 
 <p>However, now wasn’t the time to be pondering about this. What Bai Xiaofei needed to do was finish his own play.</p> 
 <p>First, he ordered a lockdown at the city gates that had just been opened in the morning. Then, he led a team of royal guards after Huskie and almost circled the whole city. Finally, he found An Ming’s body in a dry well.</p> 
 <p>It didn’t stop there. They sent An Ming’s body back to the palace before Bai Xiaofei continued the search with the guards. This time they were looking for the killer.</p> 
 <p>“Master Bai, are you sure the culprit is here?” The newly-promoted royal guard commander respectfully asked Bai Xiaofei, but the suspicion on his face was obvious. For nothing else, the house in front of them was too delipidated.</p> 
 <p>“You can just go in and see.” Bai Xiaofei made a ‘go ahead’ gesture.</p> 
 <p>The commander waved his hand and a group of guards rushed into the house from the doors and windows. However, there wasn’t even a shadow inside.</p> 
 <p>“Woof woof!” As the commander was about to report to Bai Xiaofei, Huskie suddenly ran to a corner and barked.</p> 
 <p>The commander’s eyes lit up. He hurriedly went over, and after careful inspection, was delighted.</p> 
 <p>“Break it open!”</p> 
 <p>The guards immediately acted. It didn’t take long for the area to be cleared as a tunnel appeared in front of everyone.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei touched the extinguished light source on the tunnel wall and said, “They shouldn’t have gone far. The rest depends on you, Commander.” He cupped his hands slightly.</p> 
 <p>The commander shot Bai Xiaofei a grateful look. If Bai Xiaofei didn’t make a move, the credit would all be his. Helping the emperor take revenge was a deed enough to let him enjoy a lifetime of prosperity.</p> 
 <p>“Give chase!” he ordered. After cupping his hands towards Bai Xiaofei, he was about to go in but was stopped.</p> 
 <p>“Commander, remember, those who don’t brag can enjoy their credit. Your mouth isn’t the only one that needs to be tight-lipped,” Bai Xiaofei kindly reminded. The commander froze and the gratitude on his face deepened.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, Master Bai, I understand!”</p> 
 <p>Watching the guards disappear into the tunnel, Bai Xiaofei smiled.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go, Huskie, our task is finished. Time for delicious food.”</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>The royal guard commander did not disappoint. After chasing for nearly two hours, he successfully caught A’Da.</p> 
 <p>However, because A’Da’s ‘resisted’ too fiercely, the commander accidentally killed him. With Bai Xiaofei’s confirmation, An Bang Ting generously rewarded the commander.</p> 
 <p>Before long, A’Da’s identity was investigated: An out-and-out trafficker specializing in selling ‘high-quality goods.’ This high-quality referred to the identity or special traits of the people being sold. It was also because of this that the only possible doubt about Bai Xiaofei’s play was erased. In addition, the space prop belonging to An Ming was found on A’Da, strengthening the belief that he was the one who murdered An Ming.</p> 
 <p>There was still one thing that vexed An Bang Ting though – the disappearance of Liu Rushi. In the end, the pain of losing his child was all blamed upon that missing person. A national letter was sent to the Violethorn Empire with the sole demand that Liu Rushi be sent back to Tranquil!</p> 
 <p>It was also this action of An Bang Ting that Bai Xiaofei became more and more suspicious of him.</p> 
 <p>He said he would abdicate, but not only did he retain control over the royal guards but he also started meddling in the kingdom’s affairs again. It seemed that his determination for abdication was not very firm!</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei didn’t dwell on this. The agreed one-month period would end soon. No matter what tricks An Bang Ting was trying to play, he would have to reveal his cards then.</p> 
 <p>“Master, what’s wrong?”</p> 
 <p>On the roof of the inn, Bai Xiaofei was looking at the night sky when A’Tao climbed up and sat next to him.</p> 
 <p>“Nothing, I just remembered something that I shouldn’t think about,” said Bai Xiaofei slowly, with a trace of melancholy on his face. Then, he changed the topic with a smile, “You should have already fully adapted to the strength of the Martial Master Rank.”</p> 
 <p>“Yes! I’ve basically mastered it. Now A’Tao can help Master share his worries!” A’Tao grinned and also looked at the night sky. “Master, do you think my father and sister have become stars?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was stunned by the boy’s question. A familiar scene appeared in his mind.</p> 
 <p>“Certainly. They should be happy about your progress. You must live happily so that they won’t be disappointed.” Stroking A’Tao’s head, Bai Xiaofei’s heart softened.</p> 
 <p>The two then chatted about this and that until A’Tao fell asleep in Bai Xiaofei’s arms…</p>
