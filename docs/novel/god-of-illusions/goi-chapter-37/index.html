 <p>When they heard Lin Li’s voice, the first to react wasn’t Bai Xiaofei, nor was it Fei Gou and Chu Gan who were already very sensitive to this name, it was Huskie that hid behind Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>After jumping around for a little while, Huskie leaped up directly onto Lin Li’s bed, and he wagged his tail while barking happily.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, the stunned Fei Gou and Chu Gan looked at Huskie who was on the bed before looking at Bai Xiaofei who was similarly stunned, and then they gulped down a mouthful of saliva.</p>
 <p>“Husky….”</p>
 <p>“Bai Xiaofei?”</p>
 <p>Both of them asked with a voice that carried slight disbelief, and just when Bai Xiaofei intended to make excuses, a nursing staff in the infirmary pushed open the door while holding some medicine.</p>
 <p>“Senior Sister, I’ll do it myself. Sorry for troubling you.” Bai Xiaofei carried a kind grin as he hurriedly moved forward to receive the medicine before walking over swiftly to Lin Li’s side, and he seemed as if he’d forgotten Fei Gou and Chu Gan’s questions.</p>
 <p>“One of the Senior Sisters from before said that you’ll be fine after eating some medicine, so don’t complain about it being bitter.” After he helped Lin Li up, Bai Xiaofei held up the bowl of medicine and blew extremely gently on the spoon that was filled with red colored medicinal soup before sending it towards Lin Li’s mouth.</p>
 <p>However, Lin Li didn’t open her mouth at the first possible moment but just stared fixedly at Bai Xiaofei with an expressionless face while her large eyes that hid two deep pools of clear springs seemed to be about to overflow at any moment.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong? Eat your medicine, it’s already cold.” Bai Xiaofei was slightly stunned because Lin Li’s reaction had entirely exceeded the limits of his understanding.</p>
 <p>“Thank you….” A slight smile was squeezed out onto her stiff face with great difficulty, but even then, Bai Xiaofei still had the misconception of seeing a hundred flowers blooming in unison from such a stiff expression….</p>
 <p>“What’s there to thank me for? If you like it, then I’ll feed you anytime in the future.” As he spoke, Bai Xiaofei slapped himself.</p>
 <p>“Ptooey! Ptooey! You’ll be healthy and well in the future and won’t have to eat medicine for no reason. Don’t worry.” Lin Li couldn’t help but smile once again as she looked at Bai Xiaofei’s silly actions, and this time, it was even slightly livelier than before.</p>
 <p>Just like this, Bai Xiaofei fed and Lin Li ate, and not only did she not say it was bitter a single time, she even carried a smile that Bai Xiaofei was unable to understand all throughout the process.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Fei Gou and Chu Gan originally intended to question Bai Xiaofei’s identity yet they didn’t know how to open their mouths when faced with such a scene.</p>
 <p>In the end, they were truly unable to endure this torturous scene, and they simply walked out directly.</p>
 <p>“Fat Dog, that Junior Sister called him Bai Xiaofei earlier, right?” After they arrived outside, Chu Gan couldn’t help but gulp down a mouthful of saliva while excitement was already inscribed all over his face.</p>
 <p>Teaching Bai Xiaofei a lesson a single time was worth five Starnet Stones and repeating it ten times was 50 Starnet Stones. Even if it was the two of them, this was absolutely an enormous sum.</p>
 <p>“That’s for sure! Didn’t you see him intentionally avoiding us!?” Fei Gou’s eyes were filled with a firm expression, and he’d already started thinking about how to deal with Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“But, if he really has a relationship with that Qin Lingyan….” Chu Gan was still worried in his heart. There was nothing to fear about Bai Xiaofei, but he had to consider Qin Lingyan properly.</p>
 <p>“What’re you afraid of? Even if they really have a relationship, what we just saw is already sufficient to split them apart. At that time, perhaps our reward will be even greater!” Fei Gou instantly convinced Chu Gan with an extremely realistic argument.</p>
 <p>So, the two of them started the long wait of waiting for the hare to fall into their laps….</p>
 <p>However, time flowed by gradually but Bai Xiaofei and Lin Li didn’t show any intention of wanting to come out, and Chu Gan lay close to the door and listened for a long time yet didn’t heard a single sound.</p>
 <p>“What’s the situation like?” Fei Gou asked with a light voice as he was deeply afraid of alerting Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“There’s no sound! Could it be that they’ve fallen asleep?” Chu Gan had just finished speaking when Fei Gou slapped him on the head before looking at Chu Gan as if he was looking at an idiot.</p>
 <p>“Sleeping my ass! Do you think everyone is stupid like you!? Go in!” Fei Gou directly pushed open the door and barged in as he spoke, and both of them were stunned on the spot right away.</p>
 <p>The entire room was already empty since an unknown moment in time, and a window in the room was flickering up and down under the cool breeze from outside.</p>
 <p>“F*ck! That kid did that on purpose! We’ve been tricked!” Chu Gan exclaimed with shock and was an idiot that only got wise after something happened, and the saying ‘it was f*cking useless’ was prepared just for him….</p>
 <p>“Give chase! He couldn’t have gotten far!” Fei Gou gestured with his hand as he spoke, causing a puppet mouse to burrow out from a light blue colored circle of light, and it sniffed around the room for a moment before directly leaping out of the window.</p>
 <p>A puppet space was a special space that any puppet master that had attained the Master Rank could upon up with their Origin Energy.</p>
 <p>Fei Gou’s puppet mouse was originally utilized for locating medicinal materials, but it was proven to be effective in finding people as well.</p>
 <p>Both of them followed closely behind the puppet mouse with a speed that formed an enormous contrast with their body sizes. At the very least, Bai Xiaofei and Lin Li were surely inferior to the two of them.</p>
 <p>In less than 15 minutes, the both of them were already able to see Bai Xiaofei and Lin Li who were dashing madly ahead.</p>
 <p>“Bai Xiaofei, stop! Both of us won’t harm you!” After shouting out something that even he himself didn’t quite believe, Chu Gan summoned his own puppet — A crystalline and translucent arrow.</p>
 <p>The first puppet of Alchemists were usually various types of medicine cauldrons because puppets that were connected to the heart of the puppet master were conducive to increasing the success rate of refinement, whereas, Alchemists would usually select some offensive type puppets that possessed an explosive might as their remaining puppets to protect themselves.</p>
 <p>Chu Gan was a conventional Alchemist, and this crystalline arrow was the weapon that protected his life. The yellow-grade puppet, Windbreaker Arrow!</p>
 <p>“Don’t hit his vital points, we can’t bear the responsibility if he dies.” Fei Gou reminded and didn’t stop Chu Gan’s actions.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, I’m not an idiot.” As he spoke, Chu Gan poured his Origin Energy into the Windbreaker Arrow. After pouring Origin Energy into it continuously for a short moment, the crystalline arrow shot out explosively, and it pierced directly towards Bai Xiaofei’s thigh.</p>
 <p>However, right when both of them thought would connect for sure, a figure descended from the skies while a violet colored light stopped the Windbreaker Arrow with extreme accuracy at the same time.</p>
 <p>“What gall! Looks like the lesson I gave both of you earlier wasn’t enough!”</p>
 <p>The person that had arrived was precisely Xue Ying that wore the white colored cloak of a teacher!</p>
 <p>On the other hand, the violet colored light that stopped the Windbreaker Arrow was one of Xue Ying’s puppets, a violet-grade dagger, Whirlwind!</p>
 <p>After they saw the face of the person that had arrived clearly, a strand of coldness crept up the backs of Fei Gou and Chu Gan at the same time, and the thought of fleeing gushed into their hearts at the first possible moment.</p>
 <p>But, fleeing before Xue Ying that was at the Grandmaster Rank was easier said than done!</p>
 <p>Xue Ying lightly clenched her fists as she walked over slowly towards Chu Gan and Fei Gou who’d started trembling from head to toe, and the cracking sounds that resounded out directly terrified both of them to the point of squatting down while holding their heads and begging for mercy.</p>
 <p>“Teacher, spare us!”</p>
 <p>“Teacher, spare us!”</p>
 <p>“It was a misunderstanding! We and Brother Bai are….”</p>
 <p>Fei Gou hadn’t finished speaking when a strong gust of wind had already assaulted his face, and in the next second, Xue Ying’s leg swept out and directly kicked Fei Gou flying almost five meters away.</p>
 <p>“I didn’t hear it quite clearly. What did both of you call me earlier?” Xue Ying spoke in a cold voice while she looked at Chu Gan who was still squatting on the ground, and then she stepped on him to the point he fell flat on the ground. At this moment, Xue Ying had completely forgotten about the rule that teachers couldn’t beat up students!</p>
