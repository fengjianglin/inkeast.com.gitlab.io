 <p>Chapter 258: The Dust Settles; Explaining the Setup!</p> 
 <p>Seeing Bai Xiaofei before them, the two vice principals’ first reaction was shock, but it was replaced with a ‘we should have expected this’ feeling, but then followed by a strong sense of bewilderment. All kinds of emotions came together, reflecting an extremely complicated expression on their faces.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had expected this kind of response. Smiling faintly, he took out five pieces of Crystal's Longing from his storage ring and casually tossed one each to Jing Cheng and Chu Qingtian. Huskie and Blackie also received the same.</p> 
 <p>“It's too late to go back now anyway. Since I'm in a good mood, you can ask any questions,” said Bai Xiaofei as he chomped a mouthful of Crystal's Longing. The sweet taste deepened the smile on his face.</p> 
 <p>Jing Cheng and Chu Qingtian exchanged glances and both saw disbelief and helplessness in the other’s eyes. As Bai Xiaofei had just said, it was too late for them to do anything now.</p> 
 <p>“How did you do it?” Chu Qingtian turned to look at Bai Xiaofei. He really couldn’t help it, his curiosity had been piqued. Moreover, he didn’t dislike how this had turned out.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei managed this with his ability, so what could they say to it? They had done everything Lei Shan told them to do anyway.</p> 
 <p>“What part do you mean? I have done a lot of things, although you haven’t seen much of them.” Still smiling, Bai Xiaofei teased.</p> 
 <p>“Start from scratch. We have a lot of time anyway, don't we?” Chu Qingtian said with a gentle wave of his hand. In a flash of light on his storage ring, three luxurious sofas appeared, complete with a small tea table.</p> 
 <p>Those who knew how to enjoy life could get comfortable wherever they went, indeed.</p> 
 <p>“Then it would be a long story.” Bai Xiaofei sat down on the sofa and bounced twice, having no intention to act courteously at all. “Mmm, nice sofa. Doesn’t disappoint my Crystal's Longing.”</p> 
 <p>As he spoke, Bai Xiaofei took another bite of the crystal and looked up at the two vice principals who were sitting opposite him. They were looking at Bai Xiaofei with a full face of expectation. The meaning was obvious – ‘You can start now!’</p> 
 <p>And that was exactly what Bai Xiaofei did.</p> 
 <p>“First, when Sister Lei told me that the old said he’d send Di Jiang away three days later, I immediately knew it was only a diversion. The actual time to send Di Jiang away would not be fixed, but depended on when he was cured, so I had someone ask around in the Furnace of Agarwood. However, the Furnace of Agarwood is so good at keeping its privacy that no one knew anything about Di Jiang except Director Ran Qiu and Deputy Director Aisha. That confirmed my guess.” Bai Xiaofei had the hint of a proud smile on his face, and this was indeed worth being proud of.</p> 
 <p>“Wait, where were you these two days? Who did you go to for help?” As Bai Xiaofei was still smug, Chu Qingtian interrupted him.</p> 
 <p>“At first I stayed at the Demon of Illusions, but I went to the Blossom Pavilion after coming up with a plan. After all, your old man has the ability to peep at the whole of Starnet. I had to make sure to find a place that could hide me. For a short time afterward, I was actually in the Furnace of Agarwood.”</p> 
 <p>At this, Chu Qingtian gulped as a clear map plan was visualized in his mind. However, there were still many gaps in this plan.</p> 
 <p>“As for who helped me, it was quite simple. There were no students who sympathized with Di Jiang. Everyone <em>wished</em> for him to die tragically. Since the Blossom Ranking proves to be an omnipotent resource, it practically gave the answers to all of my questions. So, you guys were right for not letting the students contact Di Jiang, or else I wouldn't have to make so many plans.”</p> 
 <p>Listening to Bai Xiaofei's explanation, Chu Qingtian gulped involuntarily. Before he met Bai Xiaofei, he really didn't believe that anyone could lead a group of puppet masters that far surpassed himself by their noses, but now he had no choice but to believe it. Because he was one of those being led around…</p> 
 <p>“The next part is the key point. I knew I couldn’t stop you guys from taking Di Jiang away, and that you’d certainly use all kinds of methods to prevent me from nearing Di Jiang, so I had to think of a way to approach him first.”</p> 
 <p>“Yun Jingshuang’s suicide was to help you create that condition?!” Chu Qingtian's face suddenly took on an expression of incredulity.</p> 
 <p>“Vice Principal Chu, you are very smart. That's right. When Yun Jingshuang was delivered into the emergency room, everything Sister Qianye said to Ran Qiu said was true. When I put forward this idea, Yun Jingshuang had no hesitation. He had people find a poison that had a 90% chance of killing.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei's expression instantly turned solemn to display his admiration for Yun Jingshuang. A selfish person could never make such a decision, and the people in high positions were generally selfish. However, Bai Xiaofei didn’t see any such undesirable characteristics in Yun Jingshuang.</p> 
 <p><em>Although… he is a little bit unique indeed.</em></p> 
 <p>“But, even though he went in, it doesn’t mean you’d have the chance to replace him!” Chu Qingtian had been completely led by the nose by Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Then you are wrong. If I can't get in there, then I'm really hopeless. Do you remember those who came to visit Yun Jingshuang?” Bai Xiaofei gave them a little hint, but Chu Qingtian and Jing Cheng were still confused.</p> 
 <p><em>Wasn’t it just a bunch of female students, what does that have to do with you getting in?</em></p> 
 <p>“Oh well, you guys have really aged, but one thing you have to admit, those female students diverted your attention, didn’t they? Both men and women should be instinctively attracted when they see beautiful women. And even if they’re not attracted, they will subconsciously relax their vigilance for reasons such as embarrassment, just like how you two made excuses to go to the toilet back then. Of course, this is for normal people, and fortunately, you’re all normal.”</p> 
 <p>Chu Qingtian and Jing Cheng both revealed an embarrassed expression. Bai Xiaofei was right, they were indeed affected…</p> 
 <p>“The Blossom Pavilion never lacks beautiful girls – you can just grab a handful at random. I was among them and always remained in the Furnace of Agarwood. Although Ran Qiu and Aisha almost never left, they are also human. It’s impossible for humans not to solve their three daily urgent needs. If there is only one person left, plus a little unexpected incident, it wouldn’t be a problem for me to get in. You know the ability of my puppet.”</p> 
 <p>Along with those words, Blackie’s eyes lit up, and the tea table in front of the three became a medical facility.</p> 
 <p>“The rest is simple. After entering Di Jiang's room, I changed into his appearance, while he became a piece of furniture that I put away. He couldn’t move anyway.” Mentioning Di Jiang, the temperature of Bai Xiaofei's tone sharply dropped.</p> 
 <p>“I have a question. Since you got in, why didn’t you just kill him and performed such a play instead?”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Chu Qingtian said this, Bai Xiaofei's face instantly turned frosty. When he looked up at Chu Qingtian, his eyes held an obvious trace of malice!</p>
