 <p>Chapter 651: Peach Blossom Forest, Natural Formation!</p> 
 <p>Leng Liushuang’s cooking speed was nothing to joke about. In less than three hours, all kinds of delicacies had filled up the stone table. Despite the food trays being lidded, it couldn’t stop the aroma from overflowing.</p> 
 <p>“Do not touch! This is not for you!” Leng Liuying slapped away Bai Xiaofei’s hand with an eye-roll of disdain. “You are always nowhere to be seen during the cooking but the most active to eat!”</p> 
 <p>At her words, Bai Xiaofei inwardly complained. <em>It’s you who never helps with the cooking, alright?!</em></p> 
 <p>“The food’s gonna get cold. And are we just gonna sit here and wait? Are you sure Cang Lan will really return here? Maybe he has already left. The dust on the table was almost the thickness of a finger joint!” Bai Xiaofei tried to justify while pitifully sniffing the aroma.</p> 
 <p>This time, however, even Leng Liuli didn’t help him.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, we wait. The three of us will go get some sleep, and you should familiarize yourself with this place. After all, you may not be able to leave for quite some time.”</p> 
 <p>After Leng Liuli finished her words, the triplets stretched almost in unison. Three graceful bodies being displayed in front of Bai Xiaofei made his throat dry.</p> 
 <p>“Since I’ll have plenty of time in the future, I’ll go to sleep now as well!” He stepped forward, but was smacked back by Leng Liuying.</p> 
 <p>“If you want to live, keep a distance from us during this time, or no one will be able to save you!” warned Leng Liuying with a rarely-seen seriousness.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei thought she was trying to scare him, but then he saw Leng Liushuang silently nod in approval. In the end, he with a face full of doubts, had to watch the triplets enter the cottage and close the door. Looking back at the stone table full of food and smelling the rich fragrance of the wine, he couldn’t help a drawn-out sigh.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, let’s get familiar with the area. I really can’t stay here any longer…”</p> 
 <p>After leaving the heart-breaking place, Bai Xiaofei walked towards the peach blossom forest nearby. After all, it was the only place in this area that couldn’t be seen through at a glance.</p> 
 <p>Upon approaching the forest, Bai Xiaofei’s expression froze and he stared at it for half a day without blinking.</p> 
 <p>“A natural illusion formation?!” He gulped in surprise.</p> 
 <p>Lei Min had once said in class that nature was the most powerful formation mage in this world whose uncanny workmanship was far beyond anyone’s imagination. None of the naturally formed formations were simple, and some even claimed that the godly formation in Starnet Square was a natural formation!</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei had never seen an example of such up close. All of his knowledge had stopped with Lei Min’s dictations, until now.</p> 
 <p>If it wasn’t an illusion formation, Bai Xiaofei absolutely wouldn’t be able to tell. He was lucky enough to be a puppet master of the Illusion Stream as well as having a super-strong spirit.</p> 
 <p>However, all he got was a vague sensation, which was why he didn’t walk in right away. He wasn’t sure if he would be able to make it out…</p> 
 <p>“Big Sis Lei wasn’t wrong. This illusion formation looks like quite an unusual one!” he muttered to himself as his eyes sparkled with zeal.</p> 
 <p><em>Unusual, huh? If you aren’t, this lord wouldn’t want to explore you!</em></p> 
 <p>With this thought, Bai Xiaofei slowly walked into the peach blossom forest. The moment he set foot inside, he completely disappeared from the sight of the outside world. However, Bai Xiaofei himself didn’t know this because in his eyes, the path he came from was still there as well as the scenery outside!</p> 
 <p>After walking in a direction for a long time, Bai Xiaofei started to sweat.</p> 
 <p>Despite trying his hardest to maintain the clarity of his five senses, he still hadn’t found anything out of place, and therefore knew that he had fallen into the formation’s effect. Those that were caught in an illusion could never find that illusion using their five senses.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei stopped and reluctantly shook his head with a long sigh.</p> 
 <p>“It seems I underestimated this place!”</p> 
 <p>With a wry smile, he simply gave up on straining his five senses and started wandering aimlessly around the peach blossom forest. His whole state changed after he relaxed himself.</p> 
 <p>In fact, once he forgot that he was in an illusion, he immediately found the scenery of this forest a wonder of the world. Falling petals slowly danced with the wind and small animals occasionally ran past without any fear of strangers at all. Bai Xiaofei felt as if he had become a part of this forest as he swayed together with the wind…</p> 
 <p>“My silly master, you’ve circled along this path twice.”</p> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei had lost track of time, Huskie lost patience and emerged from his arms.</p> 
 <p>“You can see through this formation?!” Bai Xiaofei immediately pulled the dog out of his arms and stared at him in disbelief.</p> 
 <p>“I can’t,” replied Huskie so frankly that Bai Xiaofei almost threw him away…</p> 
 <p>“How do you know I’m circling then?” Bai Xiaofei snorted and acted as if he wanted to put Huskie back into the puppet storage.</p> 
 <p>“But I can guess!” said Huskie halfway through Bai Xiaofei’s action.</p> 
 <p>“Are you sure your nose is still working?” Bai Xiaofei pulled him out again. Most illusions affected the five senses, so he suspected that Huskie’s sense of smell might also be affected.</p> 
 <p>“Tch, do you think this mighty dog is as useless as his stupid master? When has my nose ever failed?” Huskie said with his head held high and his rolling eyes full of contempt for Bai Xiaofei. This kind of expression was magnified on the face of a husky…</p> 
 <p>If one were Bai Xiaofei right now, they would definitely have hung Huskie on a tree for a beating!</p> 
 <p>Resisting the impulse to kill the dog, Bai Xiaofei took out a Crystal’s Longing from his storage ring.</p> 
 <p>“Want this?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s question was unnecessary. Huskie threw his tongue out as soon as the crystal greeted the air.</p> 
 <p>“I suddenly want to take a nice walk in this peach blossom forest, but I can’t even get out. What should I do?” Bai Xiaofei put away the crystal, his eyes drifting around.</p> 
 <p>“You have me! I will show you the way!” Huskie emotionally raised his paw for fear that Bai Xiaofei could not see him. Blackie on Bai Xiaofei’s shoulder once again expressed her deep contempt for the dog.</p> 
 <p><em>Each time this thing ranks up, all of the skills he gains end up being used in scheming. Nothing else improves at all.</em></p> 
 <p>Just like that, Bai Xiaofei successfully hired himself a laborer. Following Huskie, he walked toward the depths of the peach blossom forest…</p>
