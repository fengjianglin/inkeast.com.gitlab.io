 <p>Chapter 313: Fourth Level, Defending a Ruined City!</p> 
 <p>As a colorful light flowed through, the surrounding scenery once again changed, but the constant was that Bai Xiaofei was still on a wall.</p> 
 <p>There was just a little difference, that was, the current wall was much more dilapidated than the earlier one.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei and his 500 troops stood crowdedly on the wall. Although those who passed the last level had grown stronger after, their faces were currently very serious, even Tie Zhu was no exception.</p> 
 <p>Fourth level – Defending the ruined city: Protect the city under your feet, ensure it remains unbreached for one day and one night. If more than half the civilians die or flee, it will be regarded as failure. Upon success, 1 troop point will be rewarded for each remaining civilian. Current number of civilians: 21,466.</p> 
 <p>Enemy troop setup: unknown. Commanders: 3 Martial Masters and 2 Master Rank puppet masters.</p> 
 <p>Unlike the people watching outside, Bai Xiaofei didn’t know that this level was called a ‘welfare’ level, so there was a lot more he had to consider.</p> 
 <p>Looking around, this ruined city was almost the same size as that of the previous county town, except that all of its walls were damaged to varying degrees, and the artillery was even less than half. At the base of the walls, the civilians were all kneeling, seemingly waiting for Bai Xiaofei’s decision.</p> 
 <p>After thinking for a long time, Bai Xiaofei promoted all the surviving soldiers up a rank. The initial reward for entering the fourth level was a full 1,000 points, plus what he earned at the last level was more than enough for this.</p> 
 <p>As for the remaining troop points, he didn’t exchange for new soldiers but used them to repair the city wall and resupply the artillery. Unlike soldiers, these things couldn’t be carried to the next level, so these troop points were as good as going down the drain.</p> 
 <p>However, it wasn’t meaningless. When the city walls became complete and brand-new artillery appeared on the wall, the soldiers in front of Bai Xiaofei visibly transformed.</p> 
 <p>Morale!</p> 
 <p>This was one of the things that he had learned after the first three levels. The gap between the two forces and what Bai Xiaofei did would affect the morale of the soldiers under him. The higher the morale, the stronger their fighting capacity would be, given the same circumstances. Although there was still a certain gap with reality, it wasn’t easy for the Illusionary Sandboard to achieve this.</p> 
 <p>Moreover, it wasn’t only Bai Xiaofei's soldiers who changed. When Bai Xiaofei chose to start the level, the civilians under the city wall suddenly burst into cries of shock and happiness, shouting ‘Heaven-sent’ and ‘heavenly soldiers’ and things along those lines as if they were already out of danger.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Bai Xiaofei’s heart tightened.</p> 
 <p><em>If I didn’t repair the city wall, would the people below be in a different state now?</em></p> 
 <p>Indeed!</p> 
 <p>The challengers who didn’t repair the city wall would first have to face the problem of calming the civilians, and if they couldn’t do a good job, many civilians would run away before the enemy even arrived.</p> 
 <p>“General, you must save us! The duke has run away, you are our last hope!”</p> 
 <p>“That’s right, General, we really don't want to leave this place. I’ve lived here for over 60 years!”</p> 
 <p>Under the leadership of several elders, countless civilians began to ask Bai Xiaofei for help. The heaven-sent Bai Xiaofei had become their last lifeline.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was delighted upon witnessing this scene.</p> 
 <p><em>Asking me for help? Okay! I was worried about how I should make you say ask!</em></p> 
 <p>Despite thinking this, Bai Xiaofei kept a serious face as he slowly walked to the edge of the wall, his voice echoed solemnly, “Rest assured, as long as I, Bai Xiaofei, still have breath left in me, I will never allow an enemy through our gates! This I swear on my life and the lives of all my soldiers!”</p> 
 <p>“With my life!”</p> 
 <p>“With my life!”</p> 
 <p>The soldiers behind Bai Xiaofei roared in perfect unison, frightening an unprepared Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p><em>Your mother! How did you all do it so precisely!?</em></p> 
 <p>“Then we’ll be depending on you, General. And please tell us if there is any place where you can use us. We can't fight, but we are still good as coolies!” said the old man who led the civilians, making Bai Xiaofei elated.</p> 
 <p><em>Damn, is this old man a worm in my stomach or something? How does he know to say just what I want him to?</em></p> 
 <p>“Elder, I do have something I need your help with.” The excited Bai Xiaofei directly jumped down from the wall. Standing in a high, commanding spot was a little inappropriate to ask for help. “I need as many combustible materials as you have, such as fire oil<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span> and strong liquor. If possible, please carry large stones up to the four walls. Seal the gates and block them, preferably with boulders. After that, you guys can hide and leave the rest to us!”</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei spoke, the old man nodded like a chicken pecking rice. He looked quite funny.</p> 
 <p>“I see, General, leave it to us!”</p> 
 <p>The old man turned around with a smile. As long as Bai Xiaofei didn't make them do any fighting, they were willing to run any kind of errands. It wasn’t like they could be tired to death anyway.</p> 
 <p>“Everyone, listen to me, General needs our help. Women and children, go find all the jars you can and fill them with all fire oil and liquor our city has, then carry them to the wall. Men, go and hammer down those buildings! The stones will be used to block the city gates first, and the rest are to be moved onto the city wall.”</p> 
 <p>Once the old man opened his mouth, his sonorous voice seriously did not match his small figure. To Bai Xiaofei's surprise, the old man seemed to hold great prestige in the city. As soon as he spoke, everyone moved accordingly. Moreover, Bai Xiaofei hadn’t told him exactly how to go about it, but the old man organized it like a professional.</p> 
 <p>“Elder… before, you were…?” Gulping, Bai Xiaofei slowly and earnestly asked.</p> 
 <p>“I was a garrison commander for several years, nothing much to show off.” The old man stroked his beard, his air and face practically shouting ‘proud.’</p> 
 <p><em>Oookay, but you don’t look like it’s ‘nothing much to show off’…</em></p> 
 <p>Holding back the urge to mock, Bai Xiaofei squeezed out a big smile. “If we succeed in defending the city, your contribution will be considered absolutely invaluable! Thank you, Elder.”</p> 
 <p>Flattery always worked great everywhere…</p> 
 <p>After sending the old man away, Bai Xiaofei heaved a long sigh of relief and climbed up the wall again.</p> 
 <p>Next, it was time to arrange the troops!</p> 
 <p>Tie Zhu was standing in front of the army. Now a class four senior soldier after upgrading, his strength had risen to the Martial Warrior rank in addition to his shiny equipment.</p> 
 <p>And as long as Bai Xiaofei passed this level, he would have at least twenty soldiers at Tie Zhu’s current level!</p>
