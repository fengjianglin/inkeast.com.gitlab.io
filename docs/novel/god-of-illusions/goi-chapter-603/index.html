 <p>Chapter 603: Expected and Unexpected!</p> 
 <p>“How long are we going to stand like this?” With an embarrassed smile, Lu Lingyun broke the silence.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, the three started laughing like fools.</p> 
 <p>“Sit, let’s sit!” Bai Xiaofei pulled Feng Wuhen and Lu Lingyun to sit, excitement written all over his face.</p> 
 <p>During the past few months, he had gradually escaped the shadow of the grand celebration. Therefore, he overlooked Feng Wuhen’s and Lu Lingyun’s feelings as he was too happy about their return. Fortunately, the two men weren’t the kind to let it bother them and quickly adjusted.</p> 
 <p>“There are too many things I want to say, I don’t know where to start.” Bai Xiaofei shyly rubbed his own head.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Feng Wuhen and Lu Lingyun exchanged a smile.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s start with Illusion Demon,” Feng eased Bai Xiaofei’s embarrassed state by finding a topic for him, then looked at Lu Lingyun. “Since you didn’t come back last time, I’ll leave the talking to you.”</p> 
 <p>With the ball being kicked to Lu Lingyun, Bai Xiaofei’s eyes shifted to him. Whatever he was going to say would be extremely valuable information for him.</p> 
 <p>“Alright then, allow me,” Lu Lingyun agreed with a smile and quickly organized his speech. “At present, we have acquired 24 small merchant groups distributed in and around the Violethorn Empire. The trainees we recruited for internship have been a great help. All of our businesses are basically on the right track. However, there is still a long way to go before integration. In terms of progress, we can only be regarded as having a successful launch.”</p> 
 <p>Lu Lingyun briefed the situation in a light tone, but only he and Feng Wuhen knew how much effort they had made during this period. Summing it up in four words, it had been difficult!</p> 
 <p>However, he had no intention to bring it up as it was meaningless. They didn’t need it to claim credit from Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“But recently, we have encountered a very critical opportunity, after which we are confident that Illusion Demon will be able to rank at least among the upper-middle level!” said Lu Lingyun with confidence.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s eyes lit up. Lu Lingyun never talked big. If he dared to say so, it meant that they were that completely sure of success. But Bai Xiaofei didn’t know what this opportunity was.</p> 
 <p>“What opportunity?” he gulped and asked.</p> 
 <p>“The fall of the Globe Merchant Group!”</p> 
 <p>Those few words stunned Bai Xiaofei a little, but he wasn’t surprised.</p> 
 <p>The grand celebration had brought a crisis upon both Starnet and the Globe Merchant Group. But while Starnet survived after a series of activities, the Globe Merchant Group didn’t fare so well. After all, Ling Tianxia violated taboos and enraged a good number of forces!</p> 
 <p>“Where’s Ling Tianxia? He didn’t stand up for the Globe Merchant Group? If he just takes all the responsibility onto himself and withdraws from the Globe Merchant Group, it will have a chance to recover. After all, he was the only member of the group who came to Starnet. He can claim that it’s a personal act.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei frowned. He refused to believe that Ling Tianxia would fail to come up with this solution. Moreover, Ling Tianxia cared deeply about the Globe Merchant Group. He wouldn’t just watch it collapse.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know. After the incident, he has never shown up again. The Globe Merchant Group escaped the initial storm by turtling itself, but it was unable to withstand the joint condemnation of several major forces in the end,” explained Lu Lingyun.</p> 
 <p>“First, its branches collapsed one by one under the suppression of the major businesses and organizations, and then all of the empires issued orders for its expulsion. The behemoth became history overnight and its executives took the property and ran away. The continent all watched the Globe Merchant Group become a thing of the past,” Feng Wuhen added and shook his head.</p> 
 <p>Everyone thought that Ling Tianxia would do something, but he did nothing, so many people were caught off guard and missed the first good opportunity to net benefits out of it.</p> 
 <p>“After the fall of the Globe Merchant Group, a huge market space is now empty and all major merchant groups have come in to take a slice of this big cake. Since we happened to be on the rise and had enough funds on hand, we secured places in many important cities of the Violethorn Empire. We have already bought out the officials, there is only one last step – to settle in. After we do, our business in Violethorn will weave a tight network for us, and then we will have the spare capacity to develop more paths,” exclaimed Lu Lingyun eagerly.</p> 
 <p>This was too important for Illusion Demon. There were only so many business opportunities, no one would be able to get in if the Globe Merchant Group didn’t make space. After this, the growing process of Illusion Demon should be shortened by at least ten years!</p> 
 <p>“However, there’s something very strange,” Feng Wuhen suddenly said solemnly as Bai Xiaofei’s excitement was at its peak.</p> 
 <p>“What is it?” Bai Xiaofei creased his brows and his heart tensed.</p> 
 <p>“In the face of something like the fall of a major merchant group, everyone normally will be presented with equal opportunities. However, Unify Business seemed to have anticipated that Ling Tianxia wouldn’t show up. After the executives of the Globe Merchant Group ran away, they immediately took over its main stores in the empires and emerged as the biggest beneficiary. Something is very off about this, but I don’t know where the problem lies. Still, I think it must be related to the incident with Starnet, so I want to know if you have found anything,” Feng Wuhen said and quietly looked at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>After pondering for a moment, Bai Xiaofei’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p> 
 <p>“I would have forgotten if you didn’t mention it. Talking about being suspicious, there is really something!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei grew serious and his eyes flashed with a hint of ruthlessness.</p> 
 <p>“In the batch of new students admitted before the celebration, a person named Wu Xizhao claimed to be the young master of Unify Business, but he then attacked our people as a Shadow Death assassin. He was later killed in a battle.”</p> 
 <p>“Our academy originally wanted to talk to Unify Business, but unexpectedly after the incident ended, Unify Business took the initiative to come to our doorsteps and demanded justice for their young master.”</p> 
 <p>“In the end, after a series of verifications, both sides came to the conclusion that Wu Xizhao had been switched before entering Starnet, and this matter was cut off just like that.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Feng Wuhen and Lu Lingyun were lost in thought.</p> 
 <p>After a long time, Feng Wuhen raised his head and his face was heavy.</p> 
 <p>“Seems like this Unify Business is more complicated than everyone thinks!”</p>
