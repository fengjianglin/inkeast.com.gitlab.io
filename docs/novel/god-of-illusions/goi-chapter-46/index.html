<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>Under the surprised expression of the senior that had been restrained, Xue Ying used slight force and accompanying a muffled bang, the pitiable senior had already made a large 180-degree spin and was smashed heavily on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the remaining, the remaining three lackeys that realized something was wrong charged forward at the same time, and they’d completed the summoning of their puppets within this short distance of two steps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Xue Ying wouldn’t give them the chance to utilize their puppets, and she’d already flashed past the three of them like a ghost before they could even bring forth the ability of their puppets. In merely an instant, all three of them were already squatting on the ground while holding their stomachs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What Xue Ying taught everyone from the Savage Class was perfectly displayed on her, and in the blink of an eye, four Master Rank puppet masters had already lost their ability to do battle, whereas, only the senior with a dark expression remained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re probably their leader, right? I don’t care who you are, but you’ve infuriated me today!” Xue Ying clenched her fists and moved once more. Practically at the exact same moment, a violet colored flow appeared on the body of the senior with a dark expression, and his figure instantly vanished from the chair. When Xue Ying reacted to what had happened, he’d already appeared by Bai Xiaofei’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Violet-grade puppet! Teleportation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even though you’re extremely strong, as a teacher, you’ve already violated the rules of the academy by making a move against students. Based on your age, you’ve probably just entered the academy not too long ago, and I think you’ll be able to pack your bags and leave your position very soon.” After he restrained Bai Xiaofei, the senior instantly had the confidence to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let him go and you’ll be able to stand as you leave this place. Otherwise, you can get prepared to leave the academy!” Xue Ying turned around and completely disregarded the warning of the senior, and she emitted material killing intent instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can go ahead and try. Let’s see if I’m faster or you are. You’d probably hate for anything to happen to this kid from the Mimicry Stream, right?” As he grinned slightly, a trace of gloominess appeared on his dark expression, and Xue Ying noticed a trace of envy, deep envy on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps he didn’t come here for the sake of the Bounty Rankings but purely because Bai Xiaofei possesses a Mimicry Stream puppet!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Ying’s heart couldn’t help but sink after she realized this because if it really was like this, then he absolutely might do as he said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, have you heard of a special worm that lives in the Infinite Mountain Range?” While the senior and Xue Ying were in confrontation, the capture Bai Xiaofei spoke abruptly, and his voice was calm as if he didn’t realize he was in a precarious situation at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, you don’t have the qualifications to speak now. So long as I make a slight move, you can dream of condensing Origin Energy in your entire lifetime!” The senior didn’t have any intention of listening to Bai Xiaofei’s nonsense, and his attention was already completely placed onto Xue Ying now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, no at all. I think you should listen to what I have to say because this type of worm is called the Devourer Worm.” Bai Xiaofei grinned as he spoke, and a trace of shock instantly appeared on the senior’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Devourer Worm was a worm that was fine like a string of flesh and difficult to see with the eye, and it fed on Origin Energy. After it infested the host’s body, it would madly feed on the Origin Energy within the host’s body. But, this process wasn’t obvious. It only became obvious after the Devourer Worm grew to maturity, and it quickly released its eggs that hatched into even more Devourer Worms that added into the ranks of feeding on the host’s Origin Energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once that happened, it would already be too late!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The reproduction period for a Devourer Worm is roughly around three days, whereas, a Devourer Worm that has been trained can greatly shorten this period to… half an hour for example! I placed one of them on you at the instant you touched me.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei’s words hadn’t finished resounding in the air when the expression of the senior had turned from astonishment to horror.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t utilize your Origin Energy to inspect yourself, that would only speed up the process.” Bai Xiaofei’s words caused the restless Origin Energy in the senior’s body to instantly calm down. The pain of being devoured by a Devourer Worm was recorded in books, and it could be described simply with five words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Living was worse than death!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think I’m an idiot!? Can you even train a Devourer Worm?” His tone carried a trace of distrust, but this trace of distrust was obviously the final struggle this senior could make.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s fine if you don’t believe me. You can continue this deadlock if you don’t believe me, and you can even cripple me. But, there ought to be no need for me to tell you what will happen to you, right?” Bai Xiaofei sneered as he grabbed the right hand of the senior that was pressed onto his neck, and it caused the latter to instinctively grab harder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can continue, and I’ll absolutely not struggle.” As soon as he finished speaking, the senior stopped because Bai Xiaofei was too composed, and he was composed to the point the senior was unable to find any flaw in it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The place my hand is pressed onto now is one of the places of convergence of your Origin Energy, and the Devour Worm I place on you is right here. You can try feeling the area if you don’t believe me.” According to what Bai Xiaofei said, he placed his attention into internally viewing himself, and his horror instantly dispelled the final trace of doubt he had towards Bai Xiaofei. Because the speed his Origin Energy gathered towards this point had actually become faster!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t deceive you, right?” Bai Xiaofei chucked as he felt the force exerted on his neck became stronger once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take it out!!!” The senior practically roared these words out. No matter how formidable one’s strength was, it was a joke before the Devourer Worm because it was only nourishment to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let… let go of me!” Bai Xiaofei was suffocated to the point his face turned dark red, and he spat out a few words with great difficulty and entirely had no intention of giving in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Along with the passage of time, it became more and more difficult for Bai Xiaofei to breathe. Xue Ying who stood right opposite of them was already prepared to do whatever it took, but right at this moment, the senior with a dark expression collapsed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He slowly removed a trace of strength he placed on Bai Xiaofei’s neck, and he spoke with a deep and low voice. “Take it out, otherwise, you’re dead!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His threats had already gone too far but Bai Xiaofei had paid utterly no attention to his rage. Because Bai Xiaofei knew that the senior with a dark expression had no other choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sure enough, after a short while, he let Bai Xiaofei go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take it out!” He stretched his hand out towards Bai Xiaofei as he repeated the words he spoke earlier, but Bai Xiaofei had utterly no intention to make a move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right, Senior, I still don’t know your name.” When facing Bai Xiaofei who’d changed the topic of conversation, the senior wished for nothing more than to directly tear Bai Xiaofei into pieces. But, he could only endure it because he was afraid of the Devourer Worm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He Meng.” He gritted his teeth as he spat two words out, and He Meng had already made the preparations to drag Bai Xiaofei down along with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, Senior He Meng, don’t worry, I’ll surely take out that Devourer Worm. After all, I, Bai Xiaofei, and a trustworthy person.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>He Meng instantly relaxed slightly once Bai Xiaofei spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But, it isn’t now. Before that, there’s a procedure that has to be carried out.” Bai Xiaofei grinned as he moved aside and made room for Xue Ying who was standing behind him while clenching her fists, whereas, He Meng practically instantly had a bad premonition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Remember not to resist because utilizing your Origin Energy will speed up the process.” As Bai Xiaofei spoke and He Meng hadn’t completely reacted to what he said, Xue Ying had already swung up her fist that had subdued countless people….</span></p>
 <p><span style>If one doesn’t take revenge for an enmity, one is no man…. Err, one is no woman!</span></p>
