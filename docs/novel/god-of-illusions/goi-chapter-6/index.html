 <p>If time could be turned back, Bai Xiaofei would surely choose to escape, and even if he was unable to flee, he would try to struggle. At the very least, he wouldn’t cultivate this bullshit incomplete technique!</p>
 <p><i>This cultivation technique is utterly not something a person can cultivate!</i></p>
 <p>He was indeed able to sense the existence of Origin Energy after circulating his energy according to the method on the scroll, and it was even an amount of Origin Energy that surged like the ocean!</p>
 <p>But, just like the ocean, this Origin Energy carried violent waves along!</p>
 <p>Since the moment he started circulating the cultivation technique, burning pain surged endlessly throughout his body, and worst part of it all was that he was unable to stop the circulation no matter what!</p>
 <p>So, bracing himself and enduring was his only choice!</p>
 <p>But it was truly too painful!!!</p>
 <p>Huskie who stood nearby seemed to be in extreme pain as well, and he let out miserable howls without end.</p>
 <p>“Maintain consciousness! Endure through it and you’ll be halfway there!” The geezer still had a heart and constantly stood on guard while reminding Bai Xiaofei when he saw that Bai Xiaofei’s condition wasn’t well.</p>
 <p>But, besides this, he wasn’t unable to offer any assistance for now….</p>
 <p>Of course, even if the geezer didn’t say anything, Bai Xiaofei would persist on. After all, he didn’t want to die young!</p>
 <p>Time slowly flowed by bit by bit, and even the geezer felt slightly tormented, let alone Bai Xiaofei who felt like seconds took years to pass by.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, he was rewarded for his persistence in the end.</p>
 <p>It might have been because Bai Xiaofei had already gone numb to the pain, but in any case, he was gradually unable to feel the burning pain and replacing it was the comfortable feeling of his meridians being repaired and the feeling of his Origin Energy flowing that grew clearer and clearer.</p>
 <p>As the saying goes, once a certain limit is reached, a change in the opposite direction is imminent. Bai Xiaofei hadn’t felt his Origin Energy for over 10 years, so it was extraordinarily clear when he regained this feeling now, and it was clear to the point that it caused astonishment in his heart.</p>
 <p><i>This is….</i></p>
 <p><i>Internal sight?!</i></p>
 <p><i>Isn’t that something only Master Rank puppet masters are capable of coming in contact with?! Could it be that I’ve directly advanced into the Master Rank?! </i></p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s aura couldn’t help but rise and fall along with the happiness he felt in his heart.</p>
 <p>“Calm your heart! You’re at the most critical moment, follow along with my guidance!” As a voice that caused him to be suddenly filled with enlightenment resounded out by his ears, a strand of extremely gentle energy following along his shoulders to bore into his body, and it took the role of a leader.</p>
 <p>The geezer’s assistance caused Bai Xiaofei to feel at ease, and he instantly led the surging Origin Energy in his body to circulate according to the guidance of the geezer.</p>
 <p>After once again entering into an endless process that was like a long run, the Origin Energy in Bai Xiaofei’s body was drawn bit by bit into his Dantian. In the beginning, they were in a gaseous state yet turned into a liquid state once his Dantian was completely filled, and in the end, the liquid Origin Energy condensed into a golden ball that revolved and enlarged endlessly within Bai Xiaofei’s Dantian.Huskie that was howling miserably at the side fell into a deep slumber along with this.</p>
 <p>The geezer let out a long breath of air as he withdrew his right hand.</p>
 <p>Even though there were some hiccups along the way, Bai Xiaofei had succeeded in the end, and the outcome was exactly as how the geezer had imagined.</p>
 <p>But, he never expected that the Origin Energy in Bai Xiaofei’s body was actually so abundant as this showed that the fruit Bai Xiaofei consumed all those years ago was absolutely not something simple.</p>
 <p>Right, exactly, it wasn’t simple, and this was quickly proven!</p>
 <p>The process of Origin Energy condensation that was already reaching the end encountered a hiccup one more, and the calm Bai Xiaofei suddenly let out a cry of pain and almost fell to the ground.</p>
 <p>Within Bai Xiaofei’s internal vision, strands of pink colored gaseous energy were gushing out from the place Origin Energy was previously stored in his body, and Bai Xiaofei instinctively thought that this was some remaining Origin Energy, so he continued to condense them towards the Origin Core within his Dantian according to the method from before….</p>
 <p>Astonishment was written all over the nearby geezer’s face because such a situation wasn’t within his expectations!</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s body gradually became hotter, and in the blink of an eye, his skin that was exposed in the air had already turned completely red as if it had been cooked.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the geezer was completely in panic, and he hastily placed his hand onto Bai Xiaofei’s shoulder once more yet before he could even circulate his Origin Energy, the pink colored energy in Bai Xiaofei’s body had already come looking for him.</p>
 <p>He removed his hand reflexively yet a trace of the pink colored energy still entered into the geezer’s body, and it was precisely this strand of energy that allowed the geezer to understand exactly what was wrong with Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p><i>“How could this be possible!? This cultivation technique is absolutely not a violent cultivation technique, so why does he possess such a strong aphrodisiac effect!?”</i> Merely a trace of the energy caused the geezer to exhaust a great deal of effort to suppress it, so Bai Xiaofei’s current condition was obvious!</p>
 <p>“Shit, shit! Where do I find a woman in this deserted wilderness?!!! If I knew this would happen, I wouldn’t have….”</p>
 <p>“Ptooey! Ptooey! Ptooey! What am I thinking, how can I allow my disciple to suffer such injustice?” As he slapped himself, a flash of inspiration arose in the geezer’s mind, but a trace of hesitation arose on his face right after this.</p>
 <p>“F*ck! So what if I die, who asked this to be a sin I committed!” The geezer instantly made up his mind and roused his Heavenly Secret Disk once more, and then he forcefully endured the extremely strong backlash and suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood as the Heavenly Secret Disc started to revolve.</p>
 <p>Three seconds later, the sound emitted by the Heavenly Secret Disk gradually stopped along with it ceasing to revolve, and a trace of pleasant surprise arose in the geezer’s eyes.</p>
 <p>“What a kid! Your luck is truly good!” As he spoke, the geezer walked over to Bai Xiaofei’s side, and his expression was extraordinarily serious.</p>
 <p>“Kid, hold on, Master will help you resolve it right away!” His voice hadn’t finished resounding out in the air when an absurdly large golden arrow flew out from the geezer’s ring. After he leaped up lightly onto it, it vanished in midair while accompanied by the ear piercing sound of the sky being torn apart.</p>
 <p>But, the pitiable Bai Xiaofei had utterly not heard the words of his ‘cute’ master as his consciousness was already on the verge of collapse now.</p>
 <p>Moreover, there was only a final thought in his mind before it collapsed.</p>
 <p><i>“Old fellow, you f*cking tricked me to death!!!!”</i></p>
 <p>Not long after Bai Xiaofei had completely lost consciousness, the geezer that stood on the arrow had already returned with a young woman that he’d grabbed from somewhere in his hand, and he didn’t waste a single word before throwing her by Bai Xiaofei’s side.</p>
 <p>At the same time, a special light barrier descended from the sky and completely isolated the two of them from the outside world.</p>
 <p>What happened next went without saying. Bai Xiaofei who only had his instinct remaining pounced over, whereas, the young woman who originally intended to resist was instantly devoured by the pink colored energy within Bai Xiaofei’s body as soon as she came in contact with him, and she became an existence that was just like Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>Thus….</p>
 <p>Time ran at full speed this time, and night had suddenly arrived.</p>
 <p>Of course, night had suddenly arrived to Bai Xiaofei, yet to the geezer that didn’t dare go too far, this afternoon was simply boundless torture!</p>
 <p>He originally thought that the young women he grabbed would be unable to endure it, yet never had he imagined that after continuing without rest for an entire afternoon, the young woman’s attractive voice had never stopped resounding out, and her voice even became more and more exuberant….</p>
 <p>So, when the both of them quieted down, the geezer suddenly had a feeling of release.</p>
 <p>At the same time, within the light barrier, Bai Xiaofei was experiencing a trial of life and death!</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei lay naked on the floor like a dead animal and without the slightest reaction, whereas, a young woman was curled up by his side.</p>
 <p>The young woman’s entire body was like a work of art, but the thing that would shock the geezer outside to death was that the young woman had revealed her original appearance after experiencing the ‘battle’ from before….</p>
 <p>Simply speaking, this young woman wasn’t a human!</p>
 <p>Furry ears and a fluffy light violet colored tail both indicated her true form.</p>
 <p>A fox type Magical Beast!</p>
 <p>But, this wasn’t the main point now. The main point was the great waves that surged in the young woman’s heart at this moment!</p>
 <p>After her consciousness that was seized by the pink colored energy had recovered, the young woman’s first reaction was to kill this fellow that had destroyed her chastity before committing suicide.</p>
 <p>Her sharp nails suddenly grew longer, yet she hesitated a second before she struck.</p>
 <p>This hesitation saved Bai Xiaofei’s life….</p>
