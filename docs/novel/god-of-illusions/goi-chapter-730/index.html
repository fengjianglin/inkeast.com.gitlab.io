 <p>Chapter 730: Fated to Meet and Part!</p> 
 <p>“Now back to your first purpose. What kind of settlement do you want?” Leng Hen’s expression and voice suddenly became icy.</p> 
 <p>Anyone else would have panicked at the moment, but Bai Xiaofei did not. He even smiled, because he knew that Leng Hen’s anger was not directed at him.</p> 
 <p>“As merciless as possible, of course,” replied Bai Xiaofei. He knew that Leng Hen wanted a reason from him. A reason to handle Orton!</p> 
 <p>Leng Hen was not a fool. Orton’s actions at the Holy Snow Mountain were definitely not on a whim. If he really cared about Leng Hen and the Snow Kingdom, he wouldn’t have done all that. Since he did, it only meant one thing: Orton’s priority was no longer the Snow Kingdom, but himself.</p> 
 <p>Leng Hen could not have neglected this kind of change that could not have happened overnight, not to mention that Orton had not made any effort to hide it at all. As early as Leng Hen’s daughters were born, Orton no longer had any need to!</p> 
 <p>“Orton and his son have offended two of the three legends and a group of mysterious Exquisite Rank experts. Although the Snow Kingdom is strong, wasn’t our party able to fight all the way to the palace today? Orton has been ignoring the safety of the kingdom and its future. Everything he has done is enough to put the kingdom in a dangerous situation. If this is not dealt with, the Snow Kingdom will become chaotic.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei commented from an overall perspective with the whole kingdom as the big picture. He didn’t even mention Leng Hen. From the triplets, he had learned that Leng Hen and Orton had been through life-and-death battles together.</p> 
 <p>“Then, how do you suggest I handle this?” Leng Hen threw out a difficult problem.</p> 
 <p>If Bai Xiaofei suggested something too cruel, Leng Hen would definitely be unhappy since he was obviously concerned about the relationship between him and Orton, otherwise, he wouldn’t have allowed things to get to this state. However, if Bai Xiaofei suggested something too light, the punishment would be pointless and only make Orton more careful in the future, and he would likely become extreme.</p> 
 <p>In fact, Leng Hen couldn’t think of an answer himself. Since Bai Xiaofei was here, he suddenly had a whim to ask Bai Xiaofei this question.</p> 
 <p>To his surprise, however, Bai Xiaofei not only understood his intentions but also provided a perfect answer!</p> 
 <p>“First, seek him out in private and tell him that you must provide a settlement under the pressure of the three legends and Starnet Academy or else the Snow Kingdom will be in trouble. But, don’t tell him the specifics of the settlement. Should he ask, tell him that it will depend on what kind of result they want. Then, when Orton’s condemnation is publicly announced, send him to an area you have complete control over to retire for a while. During this period, place the Snow Lion Corps in Bryne’s charge.”</p> 
 <p>Having said that, Bai Xiaofei’s eyes grew sharp as he stared at Leng Hen.</p> 
 <p>“You can’t bring yourself to work on the senior, but surely you can manage the junior?”</p> 
 <p>Leng Hen’s face was filled with shock as he stared intently at Bai Xiaofei, feeling like he had gotten to know Bai Xiaofei all over again.</p> 
 <p>“Didn’t anyone tell you that being too smart is not necessarily a good thing sometimes?” It was indiscernible what kind of thoughts Leng Hen had when he asked this question.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei only smiled.</p> 
 <p>“The person who would ask such a thing should not be smart enough, because if they are smart enough to ensure control over everything, then being smart is not a bad thing at all.”</p> 
 <p>The answer stunned Leng Hen. This time, Bai Xiaofei truly surprised him…</p> 
 <p>After that, the two began to chat about all kinds of topics. Only until Orton’s army arrived at the capital did they finally leave the study.</p> 
 <p>Everything that followed played out according to Bai Xiaofei’s script. Orton did not ask Leng Hen what his punishment was because he thought that Leng Hen would protect him. However, when Leng Hen announced that Orton was going to be retired for a while so as to quell the anger of Cang Lan and the others, he was blue in the face.</p> 
 <p>However, after learning that the Snow Lion Corps would be handed over to Bryne during his departure, Orton was put at ease. Since his troops wouldn’t be under an outsider and he would come back in the future, a short leave was nothing if it could appease Leng Hen.</p> 
 <p>This was Orton’s thoughts. After all, he never intended to acquire the Snow Kingdom by force. He only needed to make Bryne qualified to marry the Leng sisters. Unfortunately, he had no idea that Leng Hen had promised another request from Bai Xiaofei…</p> 
 <p>“Ladies and gentlemen, I don’t know when we will be able to gather like this again, and while we haven’t been together for a long time, I, Bai Xiaofei, will remember every second that we fought hard together!”</p> 
 <p>Facing everyone, Bai Xiaofei and the triplets were smiling brightly.</p> 
 <p>They all say that partings are bitter, but who considers the sweetness of reunion? What kind of life a person lives depends entirely on what they decide to see. If one only remembers beautiful things, then their memories are nothing but sweet, but if one only uses their time to complain and hate, their memories would be the saddest thing in the world.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei could now do the former.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, we won’t forget you! Just don’t beat us up the next time we meet!” joked Jiao He.</p> 
 <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Fan Xingyu chuckled.</p> 
 <p>“Certainly not!” Bai Xiaofei laughed.</p> 
 <p>Everyone joined and laughed as well until they all grew solemn.</p> 
 <p>“Take care!” Jiao He patted Bai Xiaofei’s shoulder, then turned around and disappeared in a flash of light.</p> 
 <p>Then, the rest bid farewell to Bai Xiaofei in a similar fashion, except Cang Lan and Lin Nishang who gave Bai Xiaofei some advice as seniors.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei wanted to talk to Lin Nishang about Lin Li but swallowed it back in the end. He was scared that Lin Nishang would erupt in fury…</p> 
 <p>The last to leave was the ‘A’ group. Unlike the others, their faces were filled with joy, but not because they were leaving Bai Xiaofei. On the contrary, they had sold themselves.</p> 
 <p>“Boss Bai, are you sure we can take this to find the merchant group called Illusion Demon?” A’First caressed his normal ‘Fei’ token over and over again as if it was some priceless treasure.</p> 
 <p>“Rest assured, I will never lie to you about this. When you get there, find a brother named Feng Wuhen, and he will arrange for you guys.”</p> 
 <p>With a positive reply from Bai Xiaofei, the five immediately set off for the south.</p> 
 <p>After seeing everyone off, Bai Xiaofei turned to the triplets who were clad in snow outfits.</p> 
 <p>“Let us set out as well!”</p>
