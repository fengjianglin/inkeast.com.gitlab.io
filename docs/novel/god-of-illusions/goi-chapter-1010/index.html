 <p>Chapter 1010: Bai Xiaofei’s Decision!</p> 
 <p>“Boss, it’s been three days. Our range of activity has become very limited. If this continues, we’ll have no place to hide.”</p> 
 <p>In a dark warehouse, Zhuang Shuo was reporting the situation with a serious expression. Bai Xiaofei listened carefully, and his response greatly surprised Zhuang Shuo.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I will definitely get you guys out of here,” he said with a smile. No sign of anxiety could be seen on his face at all.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, you already have a plan?” Zhuang Shuo was delighted.</p> 
 <p>“Do you think your boss would make empty promises? If I can’t even handle such a small matter, why would I bring you guys out in the first place?” Bai Xiaofei patted his shoulder, then got up and walked outside. “Xin’er, come here. I need to discuss something with you. The rest of you wait here.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Tan Xin immediately came over. She was as nervous as everyone else about their current situation.</p> 
 <p>“Do you really have a plan? But you said you never expected this situation…” she asked while following him.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei turned around to look at her. The moment Tan Xin saw his face, she swallowed all of her questions. She had never, ever seen him this serious!</p> 
 <p>“What I’m going to tell you now, keep it to yourself only. And, you are not allowed to object!” he said solemnly.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin was dumbstruck, but Bai Xiaofei didn’t give her time to respond.</p> 
 <p>“You’re right. I really didn’t think of this situation. According to my calculations, the Moonlight army should have already done what I asked of Ye Qingtong. From our situation, it’s obvious that the Sacks are insisting on keeping us imprisoned here despite the pressure, and we have no external force to rely on.” He took a deep breath and smiled weakly. “People fear being famous like pigs fear being fat indeed. I haven’t even announced my real name yet but have already received such ‘warm’ attention. The old Heavens must have something against me.”</p> 
 <p>Pausing a little, he shook his head and repeated, “We only have ourselves to rely on now. Since we’re running out of time, you have to do as I say!”</p> 
 <p>Being stared at intently by Bai Xiaofei, Tan Xin suddenly had a bad feeling. However, she knew that whatever he said next, she could not refuse.</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>“Reporting to Saintess, the search is complete, and this warehouse area is their last possible refuge. Unless they can bypass the protective formation and earthwalk, they can’t escape!”</p> 
 <p>The Sacks troops had tightly surrounded the last warehouse area and their archers were ready to shoot their arrows. Although they knew that the opponent only had a few hundred people, no one dared to take it lightly!</p> 
 <p>“Give me three minutes,” said the Saintess before she walked toward the warehouse area alone. “I know you’re in there. If you don’t want your people to die, surrender.”</p> 
 <p>As her voice echoed, the surroundings fell into a long silence, until the door of one of the warehouses slowly opened.</p> 
 <p>“Archers ready!” ordered a Sacks commander nervously.</p> 
 <p>The arrows immediately pointed toward that door. However, the order to fire was never said after, because only one person walked out.</p> 
 <p>“If you want me, then congratulations, you’ve succeeded. If you want my army, then I’m sorry, they have already left,” declared Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The Sacks soldiers were astonished to hear this. <em>Left? How?! When?!!</em></p> 
 <p>Suddenly, there were sounds of fighting coming from the east of the fortress.</p> 
 <p>“Do not move!” shouted the Saintess just as the Sacks soldiers wanted to go to aid, stopping them at once.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei smiled. “You are really careful!” he commented.</p> 
 <p>The Saintess laughed. “You’re nothing to be afraid of when you’re standing here, but that may not be the case when you’re forced to despair. I don’t care if your people escape. Besides, the east is not their real escape route, is it? If my troops go there, it’ll be a vain trip and we’ll even lose you, am I right?”</p> 
 <p>Sure enough, before long, sounds of fighting echoed from the north of the fortress, and unlike just now, it ended abnormally fast.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, since I’ve achieved everything I need…” said Bai Xiaofei as he unsheathed Mind Sunder and pointed it at the Saintess.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t tell me you want to fight a hundred thousand of my soldiers alone. You’ll really die,” the Saintess warned.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei grinned. “So you want to keep me alive? I’m still useful?” he asked and walked slowly towards her.</p> 
 <p>“On guard!” shouted the general standing next to the Saintess.</p> 
 <p>All the melee soldiers immediately stepped forward and put up their shields.</p> 
 <p>“Stand back!” the Saintess growled, startling her soldiers.</p> 
 <p>Her next move was even more shocking – She also started walking toward Bai Xiaofei! In less than two minutes, they were standing face to face.</p> 
 <p>“Junior brother, still remember me?” the Saint smiled smugly.</p> 
 <p>“It’s you?!” Bai Xiaofei was surprised when he recognized who she was. Then, he revealed a wry smile.</p> 
 <p>“You actually remember a little character like me? It seems that I’m still noticeable to some extent.” Her smile widened.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei put away Mind Sunder and said, “Number 59 on the Blossom Ranking, Unbeaten Warrior Qiu Muxue.”</p> 
 <p>“I can’t believe you remember that so clearly. Tell me, what else do you remember about me besides that? If you say it all correctly, maybe I will let you go out of delight.” Qiu Muxue laughed.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei shook his head. “In order to capture me, you can even forsake Colorful Star Fortress. You think I’d believe that? However, I can tell you that I remember a lot about you.”</p> 
 <p>Qiu Muxue immediately revealed a curious expression. “Oh? Tell me, what do you remember?” she asked in amusement, seemingly enjoying the feeling of playing with her prey.</p> 
 <p>“Back then in Starnet, you were very low-key, but in the Body of Steel, no one in your year was your opponent. You were born with super strength and excellent physical quality, but you never provoked any puppet masters. When you were in the Blossom Pavilion, you were a special case as you were only interested in people with backgrounds and weren’t keen on ranking and popularity. Yun Jingshuang once told me that if you were serious, you wouldn’t just be ranked 59th. That actually got me wondering why, and now I finally understand. You just didn’t want to expose your identity as a Sacks person.”</p> 
 <p>After Bai Xiaofei said what he knew about Qiu Muxue, she applauded.</p> 
 <p>“Mhm, you got everything right. As expected of the leader of the miracle generation. Moreover, I have to praise you for your plans. If I weren’t willing to keep you at all costs, I’m afraid you would already have run away the day when the Moonlight army started to march toward Colorful Star. Unfortunately, I chose to stick to my decision. Otherwise, not only would those small forts I set up be lost but you would also get away with it. Now that we have you, those forts no longer matter.”</p> 
 <p>Finishing her speech, Qiu Muxue looked at Bai Xiaofei ponderingly.</p> 
 <p>“So, do you want to guess what I will do to you next?” she said.</p> 
 <p>“I have no idea, but whatever it is, it’s not bad news for me.” Bai Xiaofei laughed.</p> 
 <p>“Oh? What makes you think that?” Qiu Muxue asked.</p> 
 <p>“Because I’m still useful to you, so I won’t die.” He looked her straight in the eyes and hit the nail on the head.</p> 
 <p>Qiu Muxue burst out laughing, then stared at him intently. “Well, as expected of Bai Xiaofei. So, do you want to know where I need you?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei slightly nodded and placed his right hand on his chest. “And I’m willing to lend you a hand, Saintess.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Qiu Muxue waved her hand. “Stand down, he is no longer our enemy.”</p> 
 <p>As her voice echoed loudly and clearly, the Sacks all put down their weapons despite their expressions of disbelief. Then, under everyone’s gaze, Qiu Muxue turned to leave. Following her, Bai Xiaofei safely walked through the one hundred thousand Sacks troops!</p> 
 <p>While Bai Xiaofei savored this unexpected experience, Zhu Chunyang, who had completed his mission to create a distraction, had reunited with Tan Xin’s group. Looking back at Colorful Star Fortress, they collectively fell into a long silence.</p> 
 <p>“Come on, we have work to do!” Tan Xin broke the silence and was the first to turn to leave.</p> 
 <p>One by one, the Fickle soldiers followed her. Although no one said anything, their fists were tightly clenched.</p> 
 <p><em>We will definitely come back for you!</em></p>
