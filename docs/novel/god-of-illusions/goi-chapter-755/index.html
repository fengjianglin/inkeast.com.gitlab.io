 <p>Chapter 755: Caught in One’s Own Trap!</p> 
 <p>“Boss, Starflame City is up ahead.“</p> 
 <p>On the main road to Starflame City, a Blackscale-Horse carriage was moving forward at a leisurely pace. Except for the coachman, there was only a middle-aged man with a mustache in it.</p> 
 <p>“Heartless, what do you think of this matter?” the mustached man suddenly asked the coachman.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t think it can really be so eventful. Most likely that Old Song was blinded by money and has fallen into a scheme.” Heartless hit the nail on the head.</p> 
 <p>The mustached man burst out laughing. “Heartless, oh, Heartless, you have not followed me in vain all these years. Well, you know what to do after we arrive.”</p> 
 <p>“Rest assured, Boss. I will not make any mistakes,” Heartless replied.</p> 
 <p>The conversation came to an end, and the carriage soon arrived at the main entrance of Starflame City.</p> 
 <p>Qin San had taken the money and fled according to his agreement with Bai Xiaofei. The captain replacing him was more morally upright. After making sure that there was no problem, he let Heartless and his master enter.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, in Hu Xian’er’s room within the Fragrant House, two small heads stuck out from the floor.</p> 
 <p>“Sister Xian’er, there are two powerful humans entering the city,” Xiaoluo’s baby voice rang out.</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er, who was immersed in cultivation, opened her eyes.</p> 
 <p>“Alright. You two have worked hard,” she replied with a beautiful smile.</p> 
 <p>After dismissing the two Earth Infants, Hu Xian’er went to Bai Xiaofei’s room, where Bai Xiaofei was discussing the next step with Fang Ye.</p> 
 <p>“Some people have come, both the timing and their strength are consistent. Without any surprise, it should be them, but it is strange that there are only two people,” Hu Xian’er reported the information she got from Xiaoluo and Xiaobu and added her own assessment.</p> 
 <p>“Most often, the level of the opponents has nothing to do with their numbers. It is very likely that these two are formidable characters,” Bai Xiaofei commented with a hint of excitement in his eyes. Challenging difficulties was one of his hobbies!</p> 
 <p>“So, what are we going to do?” Fang Ye was the most nervous of the three, but with Bai Xiaofei around, he did not have to work his brains.</p> 
 <p>“What else? We wait, of course, and respond according to the situation.” Bai Xiaofei chuckled, then suddenly became serious. “Tell Wu Chi’s group to achieve their goal no matter what, and as for the rest, they must not expose their identity as puppet masters unless worse comes to worst.”</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye immediately understood. He got up and left the room.</p> 
 <p>“Actually, I don’t think it’s a good idea to hide our identity like this. Some things cannot be concealed,” Hu Xian’er voiced the concern that she had for a long time.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t intend to hide it all the way. When we no longer need to hide, this cover will naturally be revealed,” said Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>How could he not have thought about this problem? He just didn’t have a second option. It took so many teachers so long to acquire barely any information. Finding a breakthrough using normal methods was extremely difficult.</p> 
 <p>“It seems that time will come a little too early.” Hu Xian’er was definitely the one who knew Bai Xiaofei best among all the people around him, including his way of doing things.</p> 
 <p>“Throwing a long line to catch the big fish, right? Don’t forget, this is our graduation mission. We have a whole year to complete it!” Bai Xiaofei finally revealed his intention.</p> 
 <p>Even though Hu Xian’er had expected this, she was still slightly stunned. <em>How long will this line be?</em></p> 
 <p>…</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei’s group prepared for battle, Heartless and his boss had arrived at the inn where Old Song’s group was staying. Having received the news of his boss, Old Song was already waiting downstairs.</p> 
 <p>“Boss Tong!” Old Song gathered 100% of his focus upon seeing his superior.</p> 
 <p>“Talk inside.” Boss Tong seemed to have no interest in Old Song. He didn’t even give him a glance as he walked straight into the inn.</p> 
 <p><em>What the f*ck is that attitude? When I get enough money, I will never have to look at your face again!</em> Cursing in his heart, Old Song glared at the back of Boss Tong before putting on a smile the next second and hurriedly following him.</p> 
 <p>“Brief me on the situation.”</p> 
 <p>In Old Song’s room, Boss Tong sat down while Heartless stood ramrod straight behind him like a wooden stake.</p> 
 <p>“Err… Boss, you mean…” Old Song was confused. He had explained everything that should be said in his earlier communication!</p> 
 <p>“You really think that Starnet has not taken any action so far? You really think that Liu Heng’s death was only an accident?” Boss Tong’s face was covered in frost.</p> 
 <p>This time, Old Song was completely stupefied. <em>What the hell is going on? I saw everything with my own eyes! You’re saying I’m blind?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Boss, this little one is too stupid to understand what you mean.” Old Song rubbed his hands in embarrassment.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, it’s no use even if I explain it to you. I’ll deal with it personally.” Boss Tong sneered and turned his body away.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Old Song suddenly had a bad feeling.</p> 
 <p>The next instant, Heartless vanished. When Old Song finally reacted, his body was no longer under his control.</p> 
 <p>“Boss! Even if I have done something wrong, please tell me. There is no need for Master Heartless to do this!” With his life under threat, Old Song didn’t consider his words at all.</p> 
 <p>“Didn’t you say that you belong to the organization and will die as a member of the organization? I’m going to make use of your little life. If you perform well, you might be able to keep it,” Boss Tong said lightly.</p> 
 <p>Upon Boss Tong’s words, Heartless moved. His right hand swiftly swung over Old Song’s body, and the latter collapsed without visible reason.</p> 
 <p>“Prepare well. We are going to meet our rich branch president next!”</p> 
 <p>With that, Boss Tong left. Behind him, tragic screams rang out from the room.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, all handled.” Heartless came out not long after the shrieks ceased and reported to Boss Tong, who was waiting in contemplation.</p> 
 <p>“Go invite this Bai Sicheng guy. I shall see what kind of character he is!” Boss Tong’s eyes flashed with a fervent glint.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei looked forward to this game, and so did Boss Tong. After all, special entertainment was needed to pass a boring life!</p>
