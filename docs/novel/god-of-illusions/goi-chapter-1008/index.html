 <p>Chapter 1008: The Sacks’ Stalemate!</p> 
 <p>“Is everything ready?”</p> 
 <p>After approaching the targeted granary, Zhuang Shuo’s group immediately found a place to hide where they could observe it from.</p> 
 <p>“We’ve pinpointed all the secret posts around and have all the open posts monitored. We can act now,” Lil’ Six reported.</p> 
 <p>Zhuang Shuo’s expression grew serious.</p> 
 <p>“Once we start, you are responsible for containing the opponent while I sneak in with a few people. Immediately run after that, do not engage in combat. If any brother of ours is hurt, I’ll hold you responsible!” Zhuang Shuo’s tone was harsh as he stared at Lil’ Six.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, Boss Zhuang! If we don’t run, wouldn’t our two weeks of suffering go down the drain? But boss Zhuang, you must be careful after you set the fire!” Lil’ Six said.</p> 
 <p>The rest also looked at Zhuang Shuo worriedly.</p> 
 <p>“You think I need you to worry about me? I still haven’t gotten to enjoy life yet, how can I die? Stop nagging and get ready!”</p> 
 <p>The group of people immediately started moving. Lil’ Six brought a team and swaggered to the granary, which the guards hiding in the area didn’t take long to notice.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t you know this is a restricted area?! What tribe are you from?!” shouted a guard as he grabbed his weapon.</p> 
 <p>Lil’ Six hurriedly waved his hand to indicate that he was one of their own. “Brothers, it’s fine. We were sent by the Saintess. We heard that someone was going to attack this place and came to check on the situation,” he replied.</p> 
 <p>The guards immediately revealed puzzled expressions.</p> 
 <p>“The Saintess would always send someone to inform us first, why is it different this time? Do you have her token?” The guards didn’t relax their vigilance at all.</p> 
 <p>“Of course. Let me show you,” said Lil’ Six calmly as he reached into his chest pocket.</p> 
 <p>That was the secret signal to act. As the guards all focused on Lil’ Six, the rest suddenly raised their hands. Spring-loaded arrows shot out and took down a group of Sacks soldiers. At the same time, the Fickle soldiers ambushing the open and secret posts rushed out, taking down their opponents in a heartbeat.</p> 
 <p>Only then did the remaining Sacks finally react. They charged at Lil’ Six’s group while sounding the alarm.</p> 
 <p>“Moonlight attack!!!”</p> 
 <p>As the alarms echoed in the area, more and more Sacks rushed out. However, as Zhuang Shuo had investigated before, this secret granary didn’t have many guards. At least, not enough to surround and kill Lil’ Six’s group!</p> 
 <p>Although the Fickle Army gained the upper hand in the first wave of attacks, they had no intention to engage in a prolonged fight and kept retreating. It didn’t take long for the fight to be inadvertently pulled away from the granary.</p> 
 <p>“Reinforcements are coming! Withdraw!” Lil’ Six shouted.</p> 
 <p>The group immediately scattered. Having memorized the surrounding routes by heart, the 100-odd people quickly disappeared.</p> 
 <p>The Sacks reinforcements immediately searched the surrounding area, while the granary guards hurriedly returned to their posts.</p> 
 <p>Due to this surprise attack, the already jittery fortress was put under even stricter monitoring as the Saintess ordered a lockdown. No one was allowed to act at will, even the patrols. At this point, only the Saintess’s exclusive troops were qualified to move freely in the fortress. The granaries also welcomed additional personnel for defense.</p> 
 <p>Little did they know that the people they were looking for all over the city had already infiltrated their most heavily guarded places…</p> 
 <p>“It’s time.” Inside the granary, Zhuang Shuo took a deep breath.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the dozen Fickle soldiers gathered nervously.</p> 
 <p>“The oil’s poured. We can start,” said a soldier as he handed Zhuang Shuo a torch.</p> 
 <p>Receiving it, Zhuang Shuo sneered. “Sacks scum, you can eat dirt and drink air during this period!” he cursed as he threw the torch into the hill of grain. With the help of oil, the fire spread instantly!</p> 
 <p>At the same time, fires also spread in the other three granaries. Before long, the smoke rising from them shocked the guards silly.</p> 
 <p>“The granary is on fire!”</p> 
 <p>The same exclamations rang out everywhere in the fortress as the quickly spreading fires demanded the attention of the majority of the manpower in the fortress.</p> 
 <p>Upon receiving the news, the Saintess was startled. After contemplating for a moment, she gave an order that no one could understand: Give up on the granaries and focus on the fortress gates!</p> 
 <p>“Why do you want to do this?” Even the girl beside the Saintless couldn’t understand her intent.</p> 
 <p>“Since we can be sure that the leader of this small force is him, then our only mission is to capture him, even if the price is our granaries. They chose the granaries because they know that their strength is not enough to compete with us in a fair and square way. Therefore, they want to cut off our food supplies while also attracting our personnel into putting out the fires so that they can fish in troubled waters,” the Saintess calmly analyzed. “No matter what they do, they can’t fight against the entire fortress with just several hundred troops. Therefore, they have to get out of the fortress. So, as long as we keep a tight watch on the gates, catching them is only a matter of time!”</p> 
 <p>“You mean you’re going to capture him at all costs!” The girl gulped.</p> 
 <p>“Even if it costs us Colorful Light Fortress to capture him, I don’t mind! If he escapes, even ten fortresses can’t stop him from wreaking havoc.” The Saintess’s eyes flashed with a ruthless glint. “Simply because he is Bai Xiaofei!”</p> 
 <p>While the Saintess adjusted the fortress’s defensive force, Bai Xiaofei, who had taken advantage of the chaos to sneak out of the granary, had assembled the Fickle Army. According to his prior arrangements, he didn’t go for the gates like the Saintess thought but went to the barracks inside the fortress.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, on the way here, we saw the Sacks turning back. It seems that they don’t intend to save the granaries,” reported a panting Zhuang Shuo with concern. His way back to Bai Xiaofei hadn’t been easy.</p> 
 <p>“This Saintess knows me quite well, but no matter. Since she doesn’t want us to go, we might as well satisfy her. I’d like to see if Colorful Star Fortress is hospitable enough for us Fickles!” Bai Xiaofei said as he looked in the direction of the barracks. “Kill our way in and leave nothing along the way, destroy everything that can be destroyed!”</p> 
 <p>At his command, the Fickle Army immediately moved.</p> 
 <p>Since the majority of the Sacks troops had been mobilized to the gates, there were only less than a thousand in the barracks, all being logistics personnel with relatively low combat abilities. In the face of an enemy attack, they failed to put up any effective resistance at all except sounding the alarm, which threw the fortress into a dilemma again.</p> 
 <p><em>Do we go to aid the barracks or wait for the Saintess’s instructions?!</em></p> 
 <p>The junior officers made different choices. Some decided to stick to their posts and wait for instructions from the Saintess while others took their people back to aid the barracks.</p> 
 <p>No one could have expected that the Fickle Army didn’t leave the barracks after their attack but turned it into their main battlefield! After cleaning up the left-behind personnel, Bai Xiaofei and Tan Xin started transforming the barracks into a trap-filled zone, ready to meet the Sacks reinforcements.</p> 
 <p>“We retreat after this wave!” shouted Bai Xiaofei as he cut down the leader of the last squad.</p> 
 <p>The Fickle army immediately started the final slaughter like madmen.</p> 
 <p>Before long, more reinforcements came under the instructions of the Saintess. However, they only arrived to find their comrades’ corpses all over the ground.</p> 
 <p>“Where are those motherf*ckers?!!”</p> 
 <p>Once again having made a wasted trip, the mentality of the Sacks soldiers was on the verge of explosion. Little did they know that this was only the beginning!</p> 
 <p>After retreating from the barracks, the Fickle Army started using guerrilla warfare all around the fortress. They captured any scattered Sacks groups they encountered and set traps right around them, reaping the lives of a wave of reinforcements, and then they left the scene of the crime to find new targets.</p> 
 <p>In this manner, a series of casualty reports were delivered to the Saintess. She who thought victory was in her grasp could no longer remain calm.</p> 
 <p>“Stop searching! Tell everyone to withdraw to the gates!” The Saintess’s expression was clouded. She naturally knew what Bai Xiaofei’s goal was, but she never thought he’d use this method to achieve it. If this continued, her side would be the eventual loser.</p> 
 <p>The Saintless was extremely unwilling to let Bai Xiaofei escape, but if she didn’t, she had no way to deal with the crafty and slippery Fickle Army.</p> 
 <p>“Tell me you’re not going to keep this up. You should have noticed that no one is their match in small-scale battles, and there’s nothing we can do to them in this city terrain,” said the girl.</p> 
 <p>“Qingcheng<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>!” the Saintess scolded with a frown.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p><span id="fn1">1. Not the same as Ye Qingcheng's name. Qing here means clear, while Qing in Ye Qingcheng means sway (as in her beauty can sway a city) </span><a href="#fnre1">↩</a></p>
