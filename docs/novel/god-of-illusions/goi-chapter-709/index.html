 <p>Chapter 709: Triple Angering Jackdaw!</p> 
 <p>As soon as Bai Xiaofei’s voice dropped, the people behind him immediately stepped forward. The Hellfire brigade also started charging their guns and Ferret was ready to open his Hell Realm at any time.</p> 
 <p>The momentum of five hundred people getting into combat mode at the same time instantly overwhelmed Jackdaw’s group. Regarding overall strength, Bai Xiaofei’s group of over five hundred people were at least a few levels above Jackdaw’s. After all, each member was purposely sought out by Yue Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Captain? Why aren’t you saying anything now?” Bai Xiaofei smiled.</p> 
 <p>Looking at his smug expression, Jackdaw just wanted to throw him to the ground and give him a good beating. Unfortunately, the captain didn’t have the guts…</p> 
 <p>Not only Jackdaw, but anyone who stood in the aim of more than 60 heavy gun puppets would not have the courage. Of course, except for eccentric people like Fan Xingyu…</p> 
 <p>“Boy, what did you say your name was?” Jackdaw stressed each word as he stared dead straight at Bai Xiaofei, the murderous intent in his eyes about to overflow.</p> 
 <p>“You indeed tend to forget things, Captain, forgetting what I said just a while ago. It’s all good though. There aren’t many good things about me, but respecting my seniors is one of them.”</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei deliberately stressed the word ‘senior,’ everyone could hear Jackdaw’s face being slapped.</p> 
 <p>“Student of the 199th generation of Starnet Academy, the Demon of Illusions, Bai Xiaofei, currently the holder of two Starnet Brilliances.”</p> 
 <p>With a hint of pride, Bai Xiaofei finished his terrifying introduction. Now the guy couldn’t forget it even if he tried. What was the meaning of holding two Starnet Brilliances? That was equivalent to doing two deeds great enough that they were permanently recorded and remembered in Starnet!</p> 
 <p><em>How is this something a single person is capable of?!</em></p> 
 <p>At that moment, Qiu Feng stared at Bai Xiaofei for a moment before nervously moving closer to Jackdaw and whispered something in his ear. After hearing what Qiu Feng said, Jackdaw’s expression became ugly.</p> 
 <p>It seemed that his revenge would not be easy to take, at least not until Bai Xiaofei graduated. Those who held a Starnet Brilliance were too sensitive. With Lei Shan’s reputation, few dared to be reckless enough to offend him. Moreover, there were few places on this continent where the density of Exquisite Rank experts exceeded Starnet!</p> 
 <p>“Then, I’ll give Principal Lei face but I’ll remember what happened today!” Choked for a long while, Jackdaw finally found an excuse to back out. Indeed, it was not embarrassing to say so. Giving Lei Shan face was something to brag about anywhere.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, Bai Xiaofei was not the kind to give people face.</p> 
 <p>“Oh? Gramps’ face is so useful? Then I have to grasp this opportunity well.” Bai Xiaofei snapped his fingers. The Blood-Eye Fox jumped out and stood next to him. “When I passed a small inn before, I found Snow and her three children trapped. A soft-hearted person like me could not bear to watch, so I freed them.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Jackdaw’s face twisted in anger. If he had still had the Blood-Eye Fox, he would have been granted the privilege from the Snow Kingdom and taken the absolute lead, not being kept in check with the other several major forces like this!</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei had no intention to finish yet.</p> 
 <p>“I only learned later that they were captured by your group. Today, I sincerely ask for a favor in Snow’s stead and hope that you, magnanimous Captain Jackdaw, can let them off. What do you say?” inquired Bai Xiaofei with a smile.</p> 
 <p>His expression really looked like he was only making a request from Jackdaw, but after considering what he said, it was an obviously blatant provocation!</p> 
 <p><em>You want face? I’ll give you a chance! Who told you to keep pestering me? Easier to summon the devil than to send him away, that’s my lesson for you today!</em></p> 
 <p>“They mean nothing to me now. It’s only one Enlightened Rank fox and three little cubs, it doesn’t bother me.” Resisting the impulse to erupt, Jackdaw chose to play dumb. He had no other choice. If they really fought, he would likely end up with nothing.</p> 
 <p>The people behind Bai Xiaofei weren’t anything to him, but that was not the case with Jackdaw. His underlings were his official members, the foundation of his mercenary group!</p> 
 <p>“No wonder they say a magnanimous person can support even a boat with their stomach. I admire your stomach!” Bai Xiaofei cupped his hands, then continued before Jackdaw could catch his breath, “In that case, I will tell you just one more thing so we can let bygones be bygones once and for all!”</p> 
 <p>Another veiled flattery smashed down on Jackdaw. Unfortunately, it was made of solid cement and hurt badly.<br> <em>Damn you motherf*cker, what else?! Can’t you finish it in one breath?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Say it!” Two words were squeezed out through Jackdaw’s gnashing teeth. He had completely lost his calm.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Qiu Feng realized Bai Xiaofei’s intention, but there was nothing he could do but sigh. Bystanders saw more clearly, but it was also inconvenient for them to intervene.</p> 
 <p>“A few days ago in the trading area, I saw an uncle selling a formation base. It was really my first time seeing something like that but I felt that it was destined to be mine. Unfortunately, your people were surrounding the uncle, so I had no choice but to use an underhanded trick.” Bai Xiaofei donned a sheepish expression as if he had done something terribly wrong. “They all say a person of noble character will not take away someone else’s treasure, so you certainly can understand my feelings, right?”</p> 
 <p>Hearing Bai Xiaofei’s emotional voice, Jackdaw only felt like something had hit him in the head. His blood surged to his throat.</p> 
 <p>“Captain…” Qiu Feng interfered right before Jackdaw lost control. A gentle energy stream poured into Jackdaw’s body and pulled him back from the verge of going berserk.</p> 
 <p>If he lost his composure, he would really lose all face.</p> 
 <p>“Good! Good! Very good!” Jackdaw regained his senses, but the anger on his face hadn’t waned at all. He burst out laughing. “Demon of Illusions! Starnet student! Bai Xiaofei! I, Jackdaw, will remember it!”</p> 
 <p>Jackdaw finished with a cold snort and a murderous intent that was deeply engraved in his heart.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go!”</p> 
 <p>With that, he waved his hand and left with his group.</p> 
 <p>During the whole process, Bai Xiaofei’s expression had not changed at all, with the same faint smile never leaving his face. Only now did the rest of his group start to realize how terrifying he was…</p>
