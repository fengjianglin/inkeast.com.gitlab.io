 <p><span style>Feng Wuhen nodded lightly as soon as Fang Ye finished speaking, and he displayed affirmation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s Nan Wusheng?” Bai Xiaofei asked another question, and Xue Ying was already unable to raise her head….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough…. Cough…. Big Brother Fei, that Nan Wusheng is the divine smith that invented rifle puppets, and he’s absolutely the person that understands rifle puppets the best.” Mo Ka patted Bai Xiaofei’s shoulder and didn’t trouble Feng Wuhen again because this common knowledge was too basic….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Feng, you’re really capable. You were actually able to obtain the puppets from so many divine smiths!” Bai Xiaofei laughed to conceal his embarrassment, and then turned around to praise Feng Wuhen. But, what he said was the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A manager was able to come into contact with so many divine smiths, and this meant that Feng Wuhen’s status in the Ethereal Pavilion was absolutely not low!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can I not know a few people while dawdling through my days?” Feng Wuhen laughed as he chose to skip this topic. At the same time, he opened up the final red cloth, and a very uniform rounded polygon was shockingly laying on the tree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A Charging Stone, an auxiliary puppet made specially for heavy rifle puppets. It can be charged every five seconds, and after it’s charged, the Charging Stone can provide Origin Energy for a rifle puppet to complete three successive attacks!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as he finished speaking, everyone present here stared their eyes wide open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The might of Fang Ye’s rifle puppet was really strong, yet it possessed a fatal weakness, the time between attacks was too long! Under normal circumstances and with Fang Ye’s standard of Origin Energy, he at least needed 10 seconds to completely a single activation of his puppet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, if this Charging Stone was really so miraculous, then Fang Ye would become a freak in terms of output!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just imagine if Fang Ye directly shot four times as soon as he entered the battlefield, which puppet master beneath the Grandmaster Rank could resist it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>In any case, Xue Ying felt she was unable to achieve it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, if Fang Ye really made the Charging Stone his second puppet, then he would lose the opportunity to choose maneuverability. Being a puppet master that utilized a rifle puppet, he would absolutely be the target of all his opponents, and if the Charging Stone were to be exposed, Fang Ye would probably be pursued by the entire enemy forces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Fang Ye didn’t hesitate in the slightest and directly walked over before putting the Charging Stone away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe that my teammates will protect me properly, so if they don’t fall, I’ll absolutely be able to shoot without any worry!” Fang Ye’s face revealed a trace of persistence, and his gaze swept past all his classmates before finally stopping on Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck! Don’t look at me! I won’t be a meat shield for you, but I think Shi Kui is suitable for this job!” Sure enough, Bai Xiaofei didn’t ‘disappoint’ the others as usual….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right, Little Brother, I’m very curious, why did the three of you not come select puppets from me?” Feng Wuhen looked at Bai Xiaofei and the others as he spoke because he didn’t intend to let go this final opportunity to earn money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“About this… Wu Chi is a Martial Artist, I’ve always thought I wouldn’t be able to control a second puppet, and Lin Li was waiting for me instead.” Bai Xiaofei explained the situation in a few short words, and Feng Wuhen revealed a smile instead.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s fine so long as all of you aren’t against buying a puppet!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“If it’s a Martial Artist, it isn’t impossible to buy some equipment.” Feng Wuhen smiled and looked towards a nearby young woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bring out ‘Windslash’ from within the storehouse.” The young woman agreed before leaving with the other young women, whereas, Wu Chi who originally thought he’d only come to watch the show moved over with delight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s something I can use?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t that Martial Artists don’t possess Origin Energy, and they’re just unable to form an agreement with a puppet, whereas, my Ethereal Pavilion has recently researched a method to fix an ability onto a weapon. Even though it carries great limitations, but it’s much more outstanding than ordinary weapons.” Feng Wuhen had just finished speaking when the young woman who’d just left had returned, and she didn’t bring in a tray this time but the storage ring on her hand flashed, causing a claymore that was more than half a person’s height to piece into the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This claymore, Windslash, is completely constructed from the hardest refined metals in the continent. It’s 40kgs in weight and carries the ability — sharpness. After Origin Energy is poured into it, the sharpness of the sword will increase greatly. But, the amount of Origin Energy consumed was slightly too huge, so it must be used cautiously.” What Feng Wuhen said at the end was completely disregarded by Wu Chi. What a joke, why would a possessor of the Heavenly Origin Physique worry about possessing insufficient Origin Energy!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he held the claymore, Wu Chi tried swinging it about, and the 40kg sword was swung about vigorously and energetically by him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, Wu Chi who was so fond of it that he couldn’t bear to part with it looked eagerly at Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t look at me like that, I don’t play with men. Go ask Fang Ye because he manages the money.” As soon as Bai Xiaofei finished speaking, Wu Chi used the same gaze to look at Fang Ye, and his attitude seemed as if he would sleep with Fang Ye if Fang Ye didn’t agree….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s sufficient money, there is! Big Brother Wu, don’t look at me like that, I don’t play with men as well!” Fang Ye who wanted to cry yet had no tears caused everyone to roar with laughter. Wu Chi on the other hand was completely immune to everyone’s reactions, and he embraced Windslash like he was embracing his wife and hid at the corner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Brother, what about the two of you?” After he obtained another sum of wealth, Feng Wuhen looked at Bai Xiaofei once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m an Illusion Stream puppet master, so I hope that my second puppet is of the same stream, whereas, Lin Li is of the Energy….” Bai Xiaofei hadn’t finished speaking when Feng Wuhen had instantly stared his eyes wide open at Lin Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin Li?! You’re that Lin Li that everyone’s talking about?! The Angelic Maiden’s daughter?!” Feng Wuhen who’d always been calm had instantly become excited, and if it wasn’t for his considerations towards his manners, he would have absolutely pounced over at this moment. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But, Bai Xiaofei was able to discern that Feng Wuhen didn’t carry those thoughts that he shouldn’t possess, and it was pure excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.” Lin Li replied in a light voice, and then she looked at Feng Wuhen with a slightly bewildered expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you let me see your Divine Phoenix Feather Dress?” Feng Wuhen probed with a gaze that carried a trace of anticipation. Lin Li looked at Bai Xiaofei instead, and she only mobilized her Origin Energy after Bai Xiaofei lightly nodded towards her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Along with a flash of golden light, the Divine Phoenix Feather Dress replaced Lin Li’s clothes. Even though it wasn’t the first time Bai Xiaofei and the others had seen it, they couldn’t help but be stunned for a few seconds every single time they saw Lin Li transform.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How could there be such a perfect appearance in the world?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It really… really is… the Divine Phoenix Feather Dress!” Feng Wuhen muttered, and he only recovered from his shock after Lin Li withdrew her puppet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Miss Lin, please wait a moment!” Feng Wuhen suddenly said this without reason or rhyme, and then he charged out before returning again after around two minutes passed. Moreover, there was an beautiful antique box in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“13 years ago, I received orders to escort a bath of precious puppets. But, someone leaked the information of this, causing an entire branch of the Heavenbreaker Bandit Group’s forces to lay in ambush when we passed the boundaries of a kingdom. Our forces were quickly killed to the point only a few remained, but right at this moment, the Angelic Maiden descended from the heavens and killed everyone from the bandit group in the blink of an eye!” As Feng Wuhen spoke, his voice carried a trace of excitement, and he seemed as if he’d returned to that time all those years ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I originally intended to thank her on the spot, but the Angelic Maiden didn’t give me a chance at all. But, I remembered it in my heart. At that time, I saw a young girl around the age of three or four by her side, so I requested Divine Smith Huo Qianxing to prepare this as soon as I returned.” As soon as he finished speaking, Feng Wuhen opened up the beautiful box….</span></p>
