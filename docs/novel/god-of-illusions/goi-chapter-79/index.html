<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>“Senior, can we have a chat somewhere quiet? There are too many people here after all.” As soon as he finished speaking, Yun Jingshuang couldn’t help but frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it couldn’t be done in public, then it was surely something shady, and Yun Jingshuang hated shady things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph! What is there that you can’t speak about frankly? If you can’t speak of it, then you can turn around right now! The door is right behind you!” His attitude took an entire 180 degree spin, and Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but curse in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Motherf*cker! I poked a hornet’s nest!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the critical moment, Bai Xiaofei looked at Han Qianye who was playing with Huskie, and the intention to seek for help was vividly displayed on his face. On the other hand, Han Qianye’s intelligence didn’t let Bai Xiaofei down, and she understood him in the first possible moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, Han Qianye stuck out a finger instead before pointing at Huskie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei practically didn’t hesitate to send over a gaze of agreement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, the period Huskie was sold away had been prolonged for another day….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Yun, isn’t there a room within? There are so many bad women here, so it won’t be comfortable for you to speak here as well.” Han Qianye’s words were rather effective, and the expression of Yun Jingshuang who’d asked them to leave had instantly eased up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The matter both of you want to tell me better not be a bad thing, otherwise, both of you can dream of remaining in the academy. Believe me, I have the ability!” As he spoke with a cold voice, Yun Jingshuang turned around and led the way, whereas, Han Qianye who followed behind him turned towards Bai Xiaofei and revealed a complacent smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei instantly replied with a smile, yet his smile instantly turned to contempt as soon as Han Qianye turned around.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just you f*cking wait little girl!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“We can speak here, right?!” Under Yun Jingshuang’s lead, Bai Xiaofei and Fang Ye arrived at a partitioned room, and it was much quieter when compared with the area outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, I want to state beforehand that I don’t have any other intentions with what I’m about to say, and I just purely want to ask about some circumstances.” Bai Xiaofei gave Yun Jingshuang some preventive medicine and took a deep breath after obtaining Yun Jingshuang’s confirmation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, do you require a lot of funds to maintain the &nbsp;Blossom Pavilion?” As soon as Bai Xiaofei finished speaking, Yun Jingshuang was instantly shocked momentarily, and it was precisely this momentary shock that caused Bai Xiaofei to relax.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s fine so long as you’re having trouble, I was only afraid that you’re a tycoon!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“So what if I do? Could it be that you can assist me unconditionally?” Yun Jingshuang intentionally placed emphasis on the word ‘unconditionally’ because there’d been countless people on the Wealth Rankings that had mentioned wanting to assist him since he took over the Blossom Rankings and Blossom Pavilion. But, every single one of them was refused by him solely because they harbored ill intent!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, the high rental expenses in the academy was slightly beyond his endurance. Even though he was from wealthy origins, the money his clan gave him wasn’t unlimited. So, he didn’t deny it at the first possible moment when Bai Xiaofei asked this question, and he probed Bai Xiaofei instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whether it’s unconditional or not depends on your perception. But, I guarantee that the method I suggest is good for you and the senior sister on the Blossom Rankings, and it will absolutely not have any harmful effects.” Bai Xiaofei spoke with a serious expression, and Yun Jingshuang couldn’t help but reveal a trace of interest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was afraid that someone would harass the people on the Blossom Rankings through him, and it would cause him to lose all reputation and standing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go on.” Yun Jingshuang’s attitude had obviously eased up slightly because if Bai Xiaofei wasn’t deceiving him, then it would really solve the most pressing matter to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Next, I’ll allow my classmate to speak because he’s a professional.” As he spoke, Bai Xiaofei pushed Fang Ye forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Ye who was stared at by Yung Jingshuang smiled shyly and nervously before he took a deep breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A first year student came looking for us today because Senior Sister Qin Lingyan raised a condition to pursue her, and it was to obtain the approval of our Class Monitor. As for why it’s our Class Monitor, the reason is a slightly long store, and we can talk about it another time. But, after this occurred, we thought of a method to earn money.” Fang Ye’s eyes lit up as he spoke, whereas, Yun Jingshuang was slightly stunned when he heard Qin Lingyan’s name, and then his expression changed once more when Fang Ye spoke about a way to make money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What method?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw Yun Jingshuang was interested, Fang Ye couldn’t help but become slightly more confident, and a trace of confidence appeared on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We fell that someone who wants to pursue a senior sister on the Blossom Rankings must at least satisfy three conditions — wealth, strength, and influence. So, we thought of three tests that revolve around these three factors and are beneficial to us while saving a lot of trouble for the senior sisters.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yun Jingshuang had been pulled completely into Fang Ye’s rhythm, and he didn’t have the slightest intention to interrupt Fang Ye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The first test is very simple — paying a fee. Moreover, it’s divided into three levels of fees. 10 Starnet Stones is required to attain the lowest level, 100 Starnet Stones for the intermediate level, and 1,000 Starnet Stones for the high level. The different levels of fees paid activates different subsequent assignments that provide different types of acknowledgment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The second test is a proof of strength. They have to complete an assignment on the Starnet Rankings that we assign and hand in the materials required by the assignment. These materials will naturally become ours in the end. The three different levels of payment from before will complete different assignments, and our gains will vary based upon this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The third test is a test of influence, and this test is the most profitable amongst the three tests. We’ll designate the goods of a certain store, and the person being tested must mobilize his connections to accumulate a certain amount of people that purchased goods from that store and state his name. After the amount of people is sufficient, the test is considered to have been passed. On the other hand, we’ll join up with the stores in the academy to obtain a certain portion of the profits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the end, people that pass through all the tests will be able to utilize the approval they obtained to have candlelight dinner with the beauty on the Blossom Rankings that they want to pursue. As for whether that person will be able to succeed, it has nothing to do with us because we only have to provide the opportunity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Ye looked silently at Yun Jingshuang after he finished speaking, whereas, at this moment, Yun Jingshuang had fallen into deep contemplation. Obviously, he was moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To make a generalization of Fang Ye’s plan, so long as one possessed sufficient money, then all these assignments wouldn’t be a problem. But, after it was announced to the public, it wouldn’t draw reproach because every test could be justified.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, Yun Jingshuang was sure that so long as Fang Ye’s plan was announced, it would be like a fiery storm at the first possible moment because there were too many people that wanted such a chance!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Ye spoke once more when he saw Yun Jingshuang keeping quiet. “But, for this plan to work, there’s something we need senior’s help with — Obtain the agreement of the senior sisters on the Blossom Rankings!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he finished speaking, Fang Ye and Bai Xiaofei stared fixedly at Yun Jingshuang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The success of this plan lay completely within his hands!</span></p>
