 <p>Chapter 251: Schemes within Schemes</p> 
 <p>“Bastard, do you know what death looks like?”</p> 
 <p>When Di Hang leaned over, Di Jiang suddenly uttered a simple sentence that rendered him speechless.</p> 
 <p>The next second, Di Jiang’s right foot suddenly raised and stomped heavily on Di Hang’s rod of life. And then, as Di Hang was still rolling on the ground, Di Jiang slowly stood up, his appearance changing in the process.</p> 
 <p>“It’s… it's you!”</p> 
 <p>Di Hang's eyes protruded from their sockets the moment he recognized Bai Xiaofei. The first thought that came to mind was to destroy him, but the sharp pain from his lower body rendered him unable to mobilize any origin energy at all.</p> 
 <p>Given the power of a Martial Master’s kick, the little one should now be a mass of liquid and meat paste…</p> 
 <p>“Trash, were it not because I don’t want you to die too easily, I would have killed you right here and now!”</p> 
 <p>Walking to Di Hang, Bai Xiaofei spun his right leg again, and under the horrified gaze of Di Hang, he heavily kicked the guy’s head.</p> 
 <p><em>Who gives a shit if you are Master-level, this lord don't believe you can crawl up again!</em></p> 
 <p>Grabbing Di Hang like a dead pig, Bai Xiaofei walked back to the window where he had escaped last time and opened it, then threw him through without caring how high it was.</p> 
 <p>Yun Sheng, who had been waiting below, was startled by the heavy thud of Di Hang’s landing when he saw Bai Xiaofei stepping down from the window.</p> 
 <p>“You took care of it by yourself?” Yun Sheng said asked with surprise after Bai Xiaofei descended.</p> 
 <p>He had followed for fear that Bai Xiaofei wasn’t a match for Di Hang, but now it seemed that his worry was for naught.</p> 
 <p>“He's definitely lacking a brain. I would just kill myself if I couldn't handle him,” said Bai Xiaofei, his tone full of disdain as he casually picked up the half-dead Di Hang. “Let's go, it's time to pull in the net!”</p> 
 <p>While this was an event worthy of delight, he didn’t feel happy at all.</p> 
 <p>If it could, he would rather none of this had happened and none of those girls had to experience what they had.</p> 
 <p>However, life didn’t have so many ifs. So, all he could do was step out at this time.</p> 
 <p>Whether it was to uphold justice or simply take his revenge, Bai Xiaofei would not allow such people to continue living in the same world as him!</p> 
 <p>With a hint of urgency, Bai Xiaofei and Yun Sheng ran to the square as fast as they could. Meanwhile, the square was already in chaos.</p> 
 <p>The illusions of Bai Xiaofei and Yun Sheng had been seen through, so Teacher Guan and others couldn’t wait one bit to report back. However, the onlookers refused to leave, while the rest of the Fist of the Beast students had started a fight with Chu Liuyun’s group of four. Although they didn't go full-force, they still had Chu Liuyun’s group in quite a fluster.</p> 
 <p>The Savage Class members also joined in the scuffle, and many students from the New Student Mutual Aid Community also volunteered to help, but it unfortunately didn’t have much of an effect. After all, the students that Teacher Guan brought over were second and third-years.</p> 
 <p>The only thing worthy of celebration was that no one dared to kill, otherwise this place would have been full of corpses already…</p> 
 <p>“STOP AT ONCE!!!”</p> 
 <p>Just as Bai Xiaofei and Yun Sheng fretted over how they could make their way in, a voice louder than anything else echoed through the square. At the same time, a terrifying pressure spread out, freezing the flow of energy origin in everyone’s body for a second.</p> 
 <p>Looking up, they saw Jing Cheng in mid-air, with two wings behind his back, looking down at the crowd with fury on his face.</p> 
 <p>Exquisite-rank Transformation Stream puppet master, High Sky Eagle, Jing Cheng!</p> 
 <p>Everyone stopped.</p> 
 <p>Acting rash in front of Jing Cheng was no different from seeking death, not to mention that Jing Cheng was obviously very angry now.</p> 
 <p>“Chu Liuyun, Guan Xinghe, Bai Xiaofei, you three, step out!”</p> 
 <p>The emotionlessly cold voice echoed again. The three who were called out were startled, but they quickly stood up.</p> 
 <p>“The three of you, follow me to the principal's office. And the rest of you, disperse as fast as you can!”</p> 
 <p>The three instantly obeyed when those words were said. The onlookers behind them, on the other hand, had no intent to do the same.</p> 
 <p>“Principal, we want an explanation for this!”</p> 
 <p>“That’s right! Give us an explanation!”</p> 
 <p>Like a stone kicking up thousands of waves, the crowd broke into a hubbub. In the air, Jing Cheng's mouth twitched as he didn’t know what to do.</p> 
 <p>“Let them wait. Bring those here!”</p> 
 <p>Just as Jing Cheng was at a loss, Lei Shan's voice echoed out of thin air. Although his presence wasn’t found anywhere on the scene, it wasn’t difficult to guess his expression from his helpless tone.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei slowly revealed a smile after hearing this.</p> 
 <p><em>Goal!</em></p> 
 <p>Even Lei Shan couldn’t ignore the voice of the masses. The crowd being gathered in the square was precisely to force Lei Shan to make a choice that he couldn’t make on his own!</p> 
 <p>This was also a crucial step in Bai Xiaofei's plan; without it, he might not be able to accomplish the mission given to him by Yun Jingshuang.</p> 
 <p>If so, he would live in self-blame for the rest of his life…</p> 
 <p>Jing Cheng nodded slightly in the direction of the principal's office, indicating that he understood. Then he looked over to the three.</p> 
 <p>“Don't let us wait too long!”</p> 
 <p>As his voice fell, Jing Cheng’s figure disappeared, leaving only a gust of wind.</p> 
 <p>“Boss Bai, we believe you are innocent!”</p> 
 <p>“That’s right! Viva Mighty Boss Bai! “</p> 
 <p>“Boss Bai, drive those two scums out of Starnet!”</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>The crowd automatically opened a path as Bai Xiaofei slowly passed through amidst wave after wave of chatter. When Bai Xiaofei reached the center of the square and turned around, the hubbub instantly hushed.</p> 
 <p>“Even though my time in Starnet hasn’t been long, I promise that I won't let anyone stain the reputation of this place! At the same time, I also believe that Starnet will provide us a satisfactory answer!”</p> 
 <p>As his firm voice spread out, Bai Xiaofei looked at Chu Liuyun and Guan Xinghe who were in a confrontation.</p> 
 <p>“Let's go. It's rare to experience a big play in person, let’s cherish this opportunity.”</p> 
 <p>Saying this, Bai Xiaofei walked forth while carrying the half-dead Di Hang. Chu Liuyun rolled her eyes at Guan Xinghe before quickly following Bai Xiaofei with light steps. The somewhat dazed Guan Xinghe looked around. Receiving the glares of the students, he was so scared that he hurried to catch up.</p> 
 <p><em>Compared to the principal, this group of students is much more terrifying!</em></p> 
 <p>The road to the principal’s office wasn’t long, but Bai Xiaofei walked slowly and leisurely for nearly 20 minutes.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei wasn’t deliberately delaying. He was contemplating the different situations that could possibly happen. He now had at least 99% certainty of taking down Di Jiang completely, but he couldn’t account for that 1% or that Di Jiang might act out when driven to desperation.</p> 
 <p>And the only time he had to ponder was the time walking on this road.</p> 
 <p>Don't ask why he didn’t think it over before. Had Bai Xiaofei ever had any idle time?</p> 
 <p>At the end of the day, Bai Xiaofei still stood at the door of Lei Shan's office. He didn't have to open the door because it was already open, with everybody inside already waiting for him!</p> 
 <p>“Hi guys!”</p>
