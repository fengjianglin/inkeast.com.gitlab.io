 <p>Chapter 1042: Acting President Fang Ye!</p> 
 <p>“Brazen brat!” shouted the city lord in fury. Two of his puppets separated from him and appeared in front of Fang Ye in a flash.</p> 
 <p>However, the moment they neared Fang Ye, the city lord’s expression abruptly changed and he made them retreat before they could attack.</p> 
 <p>“Spiritual Attachment?!” The city lord looked at the stones floating in front of Fang Ye like a mouse seeing cats.</p> 
 <p>“As expected of the Nine Dragons city lord, you actually recognized it from just a glance. But unfortunately, you’ve already missed your only chance!” Fang Ye commented as the stones suddenly shot out.</p> 
 <p>Without any hesitation, the city lord retreated, but the stones seemed to have eyes as they kept coming after him at a faster and faster speed. During this, Fang Ye once again raised Into Oblivion and aimed it at the city lord.</p> 
 <p>Upon noticing a low, heavy sound of a gunshot, the city lord immediately pulled a puppet to his front. This puppet that could handle a full power blow from a same-rank puppet master, lost its light the moment the bullet penetrated it and was no longer usable. As its master, the city lord vomited a mouthful of blood as his body staggered.</p> 
 <p>Taking advantage of this, Fang Ye’s stones accurately hit the city lord’s other puppets. Although the stones couldn’t compare to the bullet just now, the lights on the puppets still dimmed visibly.</p> 
 <p>“It seems I didn’t attach enough energy to them,” commented Fang Ye with a faint smile before another row of stones flew up. “Now you know why I didn’t do this from the start. Because I feared that I’d scare you into fleeing.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the city lord’s will to fight collapsed and cold sweat streamed down his face. While he was powerful, his strength was based on his ability to split up his spirit, and the bane of this ability happened to be the Spiritual Attachment Physique!</p> 
 <p>Splitting up one’s spirit meant separating out a part of one’s soul and spirit and then using it to control one’s puppet. This was why the Nine Dragons city lords’ puppets all had an independent consciousness while being able to communicate with the master without hindrance.</p> 
 <p>However, the separated souls were not reusable, meaning once damaged, one would lose control of the puppet and would suffer a backlash. Therefore, even though the remaining puppets didn’t die, the city lord was still injured badly as the characteristic of Spiritual Attachment was directly attacking the opponent’s spirit!</p> 
 <p>“Even if you have Spiritual Attachment, it’s not at all simple to achieve the level you’re showing. Who are you?” The injured city lord decided to stall.</p> 
 <p>“As I already said, I’m the acting president of the Illusion Demon Merchant Group. As for how I was able to achieve that, I’ll tell you after I kill you!” Beating a dog while it was down was a ‘virtue’ of the Savage Class. Wasting time talking was impossible!</p> 
 <p>Once again, the stones shot out at the city lord, while Fang Ye raised Into Oblivion, waiting for a chance to shoot.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, the city lord decisively put away all his puppets, who not only couldn’t provide him any help but had also been made into his weakness.</p> 
 <p>After recalling the puppets into his space, the city lord began an embarrassing escape journey. Without his puppets, the threat he posed sunk to the bottom and this was a signal for the rest of Illusion Sword to join the fight.</p> 
 <p>Being targeted whether he summoned or didn’t summon his puppets, the city lord was in a dilemma. While he tried to make a decision, he was hit again and again by the stones. Still, he was a nine-aperture Exquisite Rank. Despite not using a puppet, his shield formed of origin energy allowed him to run for over ten minutes, but this slowly whittled down his energy to a fatally low level.</p> 
 <p>However, the city lord revealed a ruthless smile.</p> 
 <p>“Boy, you have no chance.” He stared intently at Fang Ye. The next second, the whole city was enveloped in a golden light, of which the city lord absorbed to the last bit. When he was done, he was like a newly recharged machine and the energy in his body was even overflowing!</p> 
 <p>“Retreat!!” Fang Ye shouted upon realizing that something was wrong.</p> 
 <p>The Illusion Sword members nearby immediately passed the order while moving to a safe place. Meanwhile, Fang Ye took out his Starnet Brilliance and activated it.</p> 
 <p>“It’s no use! You’ll all die sooner or later!”</p> 
 <p>The city lord’s voice echoed in Fang Ye’s ears, but he was not one bit flustered like the former had expected. Into Oblivion rapidly transformed into full-body armor covering Fang Ye right before the invincible barrier disappeared. Behind his back were two rocket lights that shot him up into the sky.</p> 
 <p>Just like that, Fang Ye disappeared in front of the city lord. It was not teleportation, it was just extreme speed, so fast that the city lord’s all-out attack hit nothing.</p> 
 <p>“I see, so you have a puppet that can accelerate.” With a sneer, the city lord figured out why Fang Ye’s stones could chase after him.</p> 
 <p>“You got it wrong.” Fang Ye chuckled and mobilized his spirit.</p> 
 <p>The city lord found that he could not say a thing. Then, his expression grew ugly – He could not breathe!</p> 
 <p>During the city lord’s stupor, sharp silver spikes emerged from the area Fang Ye had just stood on and pierced through the city lord’s energy armor. The effect of Spiritual Attachment in the spikes heavily impacted the city lord’s soul and he instantly looked languished. Then, his skin began to dry up at a terrifying speed.</p> 
 <p>“Although I don’t know what you just did, it should be limited to only your body and energy. You can’t fix the damage to your spirit.” Fang Ye watched the city lord’s expression turn into that of despair and continued, “But that doesn’t matter. My Dragon Beard Needles are poisoned. Since you don’t have enough spirit to concentrate on resisting, you only have less than 20 seconds to live.”</p> 
 <p>As Fang Ye said, the city lord’s vitality was drained bit by bit until he collapsed like a log of deadwood.</p> 
 <p>“How did you cultivate to Exquisite Rank with that intelligence?” Fang Ye shook his head with pity and inhaled a deep breath. “Clean up Nine Dragons City!”</p>
