 <p>Chapter 1022: Well Written Script!</p> 
 <p>For the Fourth and Fifth Elder, that night was not a normal one.</p> 
 <p>It was impossible for them to sleep. It was already good that they didn’t die from being too nervous.</p> 
 <p>From the rumor that had been circulating all day outside combined with the intel they had currently grasped, both had reached the same conclusion - that they would be the ones who would die!</p> 
 <p>However, for them, who had reached such a high position, they refused to just wait for death. As a result, after repeated mental struggles, they made the same decision – to be the one to make the first move!</p> 
 <p>“They’ve both set out, their targets being each other’s residences. They didn’t bring many people. Looks like they’re both planning a quiet attack.”</p> 
 <p>As the two elders made their move, Qiu Muxue’s ‘eyes’ immediately reported back.</p> 
 <p>“Then we better guide them well, can’t let them miss each other.” Bai Xiaofei smirked, ready to watch a good drama.</p> 
 <p>“Should I make an appearance then?” The Third Elder eagerly asked. After killing the First and Second Elder, his strength had advanced even more than during the past several years. He felt that if he handled the remaining two, he could be a match for an awakened one!</p> 
 <p>Since the Third Elder volunteered himself, Bai Xiaofei had no reason to refuse.</p> 
 <p>“Father, although there is a high probability that they will fight, don’t let your guard down. They aren’t smart but aren’t fools either. If they realize something is wrong, you may have to fight both of them at the same time.” Bai Xiaofei wore a worried expression.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the Third Elder also frowned in apprehension. At that moment, Qiu Muxue piped up.</p> 
 <p>“If you are willing to believe me, eat this. It can improve your strength by at least half once you start engaging in combat.” Qiu Muxue presented a pill.</p> 
 <p>Looking at the pill in her palm, the Third Elder hesitated.</p> 
 <p>“Oh well, I knew you wouldn’t believe me so easily. It’s fortunate that I came prepared.” She took out an identical pill.</p> 
 <p>“These two pills are exactly the same. You choose one, and I’ll eat the other one right here and now.” Qiu Muxue said and blinked innocently.</p> 
 <p>The Third Elder burst out laughing. Then, he appeared as random as possible as he chose the one he thought to be safe.</p> 
 <p>“Honorable Saintess, you are too serious. We are in the same boat now, how can I not trust you?” he said and put away the pill.</p> 
 <p>Qiu Muxue ate the other one without hesitation and said, “You are willing to believe, that’s your tolerance. I, of course, still have to show my sincerity and let you know that you haven’t chosen the wrong partner.”</p> 
 <p>Seeing that she really ate the pill, the Third Elder’s anxious heart settled down.</p> 
 <p>“Well said! However… I still don’t quite understand one thing,” he said and paused.</p> 
 <p>“Elder, feel free to say it.” Qiu Muxue smiled.</p> 
 <p>“You have awakened, so why borrow my hand? At present, no one in our clan is your opponent,” the Third Elder voiced his doubt.</p> 
 <p>As Mamba, Bai Xiaofei could not answer for her. Fortunately, he had already expected this and discussed it with Qiu Muxue.</p> 
 <p>“I want to be perfectly justifiable! I shall not leave behind any stain that hinders my absolute control. Only in this way can I lead the Barbaric Godism and even the whole clan to create a new history!” Qiu Muxue declared, her eyes shining with resolution because it really came from her heart!</p> 
 <p>Her goal was to change the future of the Sacks, just not in the way that the Third Elder imagined.</p> 
 <p>“I understand. Since Honorable Saintess wants her hands to be clean, feel free to leave all the bloody work to us father and son.” The Third Elder laughed and headed out. “Mamba, let’s go!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei hurriedly followed. Watching him leave, Qiu Muxue revealed a worried look.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, he will be fine. Don’t forget, he is Bai Xiaofei.” Lan Shuang patted Qiu Muxue’s shoulder comfortingly.</p> 
 <p>“Tell me, did I find someone I shouldn’t have looked for?” Qiu Muxue smiled wryly, her expression complicated.</p> 
 <p>“From the perspective of the Sacks, you found the most suitable person, but from your own perspective, he is probably not,” replied Lan Shuang. As Qiu Muxue’s best friend from childhood, she knew her too well.</p> 
 <p>“Am I that… bad? Is there really no possibility at all?” The bitterness on Qiu Muxue’s face deepened.</p> 
 <p>“It’s not your fault, there is just no more room in his heart right now. Didn’t you notice that he’s no longer the same Bai Xiaofei back in Starnet?” Lan Shuang asked back with a sigh.</p> 
 <p>This time, Qiu Muxue was silent.</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>“My two brothers, we have been friends for so many years. Is it really worth it?”</p> 
 <p>Bringing Bai Xiaofei to the alley where the Fourth and Fifth Elder were fighting and looking at the dead bodies all over the ground, the Third Elder sighed.</p> 
 <p>The sudden emergence of the Third Elder startled the two exhausted elders. The first thought that came to their mind was that he came here to help the other, but very quickly, they realized…</p> 
 <p>“You!!!”</p> 
 <p>“No need to be so surprised. I originally intended to put on an act, but that’s no longer necessary when you two are already like this. I can even tell you that I killed the First and Second Elder. Now, it will be your turn!” saying this, the Third Elder shot out.</p> 
 <p>However, the two exhausted elders unexpectedly exploded with astonishing power and countered his attack!</p> 
 <p>“Fortunately, we’ve been prepared for the possibility that you’d come and help the other, so we preserved some strength. Otherwise, you old traitor would have really succeeded!” The Fourth and Fifth Elder both revealed tragic smiles.</p> 
 <p>“You two don’t actually think that you can be a match for me just because you teamed up?”</p> 
 <p>Wiping the blood at the corner of his mouth, the Third Elder revealed a ruthless expression. Then, he took out the pill given by Qiu Muxue and ate it without hesitation. The next second, a terrifying force burst forth from his body!</p> 
 <p>“Time to send you two down to accompany them in hell!”</p>
