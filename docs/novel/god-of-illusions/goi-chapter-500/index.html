 <p>Chapter 500: Feng Wuhen Returns!</p> 
 <p>People only knew how comfortable it was under a roof after experiencing rain and storms, even if they had to keep their heads down under this roof.</p> 
 <p>After Bai Xiaofei’s personal ‘guidance,’ the new students had thoroughly realized one thing. They were grasshoppers, while the seniors were a mountain. The grasshoppers could work to death without being able to do anything to the mountain, let alone move it.</p> 
 <p>Wu Xizhao was the one who had the deepest understanding of this.</p> 
 <p>He was very active before, but after this incident, he dipped and didn’t have the slightest idea to cause trouble again.</p> 
 <p>With the butchered Wu Xizhao as a prime example, the rest of the new students became very honest. Everyone would greet the seniors respectfully, their manners even more sincere than last year’s new students.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, however, Wu Xizhao had actually not yet yielded! In the next half month, he spent a great deal of money asking all kinds of people about Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>At first, no one dared to tell him, until Bai Xiaofei knew about it and said, “Only fools refuse money that’s delivered to their door!”</p> 
 <p>After that, Wu Xizhao learned of Bai Xiaofei’s legendary stories since he entered the academy, and it was because of all this that he was in despair… No wonder Bai Xiaofei wasn’t scared of his identity as the first young master of Unify Business. It turned out that the guy wasn’t scared of anyone!</p> 
 <p>Even the Globe Merchant Group lost in a confrontation with Bai Xiaofei, what kind of good treatment would he get? From the looks of things, Bai Xiaofei was already merciful to him that day.</p> 
 <p>Aware of this, Wu Xizhao seemed to have abandoned his plan for revenge and never made a sound again. Even among the new students, he belonged to the completely behaved category, as if he wasn’t a Master Rank puppet master at all.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei didn’t pay attention to all of this. There were too many people who had him on their minds. If he paid attention to every single one of them, he wouldn’t have a peaceful day.</p> 
 <p>To be a big shot, one must have the mindset of a big shot. No one can be perfect, let alone making everyone think that you are perfect. That kind of person may not even exist even in the ideal. It’s already precious enough to be yourself.</p> 
 <p>And Bai Xiaofei had done very well being himself during this time…</p> 
 <p>Apart from spending time to connect with the girls daily, he also finally officially stepped into the classroom, which could only be described as ‘historic and unprecedented.’ At the end of the day, it was still thanks to Ancient Yue.</p> 
 <p>There were reasons that Starnet was respected by the whole continent, so no matter how much Bai Xiaofei disliked classes, there must be something there that he could learn.</p> 
 <p>Out of every three people, there would always be someone that could teach him something, not to mention this Starnet Academy that was full of talents. None of the people here were incompetent. Even Di Jiang, who was handled by Bai Xiaofei, was a top-notch presence.</p> 
 <p>After a period of studying, Bai Xiaofei was not disappointed.</p> 
 <p>Gradually, Bai Xiaofei became more and more settled. This didn’t change his sleazy nature, but compared with his previous state of playing for the sake of playing, he could be said to be reborn.</p> 
 <p>And the first beneficiary of his rebirth was Yun Jingshuang. Bai Xiaofei finally took over the Blossom Pavilion, allowing Yun Jingshuang to freely spend his short remaining period in Starnet.</p> 
 <p>Han Qianye decided to drop out of school. Compared with a graduate certificate from Starnet, being with Yun Jingshuang was something that couldn’t be given up.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei naturally wouldn’t shoulder all the work by himself. After his pestering, the Leng triplets agreed to handle Han Qianye’s part and became his deputies. Although the trio was one year above Bai Xiaofei, he didn’t intend to work until his fourth year anyway. He was confident that he would find a successor within two years. Even if he couldn’t find one, he could train one!</p> 
 <p>What could be happier than being an idle boss, right?</p> 
 <p>As everything progressed steadily, another month passed without knowing. Now, there was less than a month left before the grand celebration.</p> 
 <p>“Get up, you lazy pig!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s door was kicked and Leng Liuying’s cool and clear voice rang out from outside.</p> 
 <p>After getting more and more familiar with the girls, the number of nicknames given to him had gradually increased, and lazy pig was the one exclusively used by Leng Liuying…</p> 
 <p>“There is no class today, my gentle, kind, beautiful, and generous goddess Ying. Please let me sleep in!” There was a hint of pleading in Bai Xiaofei’s voice. This was one of the important reasons why he was unwilling to attend classes.</p> 
 <p>He really desperately didn't want to' leave the bed!</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother Feng Wuhen is back. If you still want to continue sleeping, you don’t have to get up!” Leng Liuying snorted and turned to leave, but she hadn’t gone far when Bai Xiaofei had already dressed and ran out.</p> 
 <p>“Where is Brother Feng?!” His face filled with pleasant surprise, Bai Xiaofei excitedly grabbed Leng Luying’s shoulders.</p> 
 <p>After leaving for the mission, he hadn’t seen Feng Wuhen and Lu Lingyun since, but his heart had always been with them. After all, they set out with all of his savings.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, his reaction was completely understandable.</p> 
 <p>“In the living room. He seems to be…”</p> 
 <p>Before Leng Liuying could finish, Bai Xiaofei had already run off. Only his voice wafted over, “Tell Liushuang to make something, Brother Feng definitely hasn’t eaten!”</p> 
 <p>Leng Liuying helplessly shook her head and sighed. <em>Did I sin in my previous life or what? Why did I meet such a guy like this?</em></p> 
 <p>Despite complaining in her heart, she still went to find Leng Liushuang. Not to mention that Bai Xiaofei was only occasionally unreliable, even if he was a beggar, Leng Liuying could only follow him.</p> 
 <p>Once the people of the Snow Kingdom had determined their other half, they would never change for the rest of their lives, unless the other party betrayed them first…</p> 
 <p>Running like crazy all the way, Bai Xiaofei arrived at the living room at his fastest speed possible, and when he saw a tired Feng Wuhen, his expression was like seeing his closest family.</p> 
 <p>“Sorry, I was going to find you at noon, but I couldn’t help it and came here right away.” Feng Wuhen was as calm as ever, but he underestimated Bai Xiaofei’s excitement…</p> 
 <p>Rushing to Feng Wuhen, Bai Xiaofei gave him a bear hug, so thrilled that he even forgot to control his strength…</p> 
 <p>“Brother Feng! You are back! I missed you to death, you know!”</p> 
 <p>The more excited Bai Xiaofei was, the uglier Feng Wuhen’s face became. For his body to withstand Bai Xiaofei’s force…</p> 
 <p>“Re… re… release quickly…”</p> 
 <p>Hearing his weak gasping voice, Bai Xiaofei finally realized the problem and hurriedly let go of a near-fainting Feng Wuhen.</p> 
 <p>Looking at Feng Wuhen who only recovered after half a day of coughing, Bai Xiaofei’s face was full of embarrassment. He had almost committed murder…</p>
