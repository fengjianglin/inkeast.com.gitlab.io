 <p>Chapter 803: Letting the Wolf into One’s House!</p> 
 <p>The light spot stopped, this time it was a strange face.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s heart leaped in excitement. <em>Sure enough, I didn’t have the wrong person!</em></p> 
 <p>“The president of the All-Around Merchant Group, Zhao Ji. I met him once and it was when he first came to Windlove. At that time, I only found the person a bit strange, but I never imagined that his arrival would change the city.”</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin gritted her teeth. Obviously, she did not like Zhao Ji as well as his merchant group.</p> 
 <p>“Not long after Zhao Ji came with his business, Blood Diamonds quickly spread, and in just two months, Windlove became the largest distribution center of Blood Diamonds on the whole continent. Although the original Windlove is synonymous with ‘chaos,’ the degree of this chaos had been within my control. The fatal attraction that Blood Diamonds pose has invited many people to pour into Windlove and reduced my control to a minimum, to the point that I can hardly intervene now.”</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin clenched her fist. If it weren’t that Zhao Ji had been hiding too deep, she would have brought people to slay him.</p> 
 <p>“So to speak, the Blood Diamonds come from the All-Around Merchant Group?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei could see Tan Xin’s attitude towards Zhao Ji, but it had nothing to do with him, so he would not try to assess the plausibility of her so-called hatred. All he wanted was information.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, but that’s not all,” Tan Xin said and controlled the light spot to move again, sketching out another face.</p> 
 <p>“Zhao Ji is indeed a character, but he had no foundation at first. The All-Around Merchant Group was unnoticeable when it first came here, but he got the help of this person – the president of Unify Business, Sikong Ming!”</p> 
 <p>At the mention of Unify Business, the resentment in Tan Xin’s voice rose to a new level. However, this resentment was partly directed at herself as well.</p> 
 <p>“Let me guess, when Windlove City was just established, you accommodated Unify Business to attract people, but they turned out to be too ambitious and have now spun completely out of your control?” Not to be outdone, Bai Xiaofei poked at her pain with a smile.</p> 
 <p>Shooting a grumpy eye-roll at Bai Xiaofei, Tan Xin selectively ignored this comment.</p> 
 <p>“The assistance that Unify Business has provided the All-Around Merchant Group far exceeds what cooperation between businesses should have. It feels like a big brother supporting his younger brother, completely unconditional. Unify delivers whatever All-Around needs to their door, but shows no interest in the profit at all. This is also the point I’ve never been able to make head or tail of.”</p> 
 <p>With that, Tan Xin had disclosed all the information she got, and indeed, she had answered Bai Xiaofei’s second question, which was about the information related to Blood Diamonds.</p> 
 <p>“What is it that Unify Business delivered to All-Around’s door?” Bai Xiaofei gulped. Although he had a rough guess, he wanted to make sure.</p> 
 <p>“Slaves!” Tan Xin stared straight at him and uttered.</p> 
 <p>“The third question, why did you establish Windlove City?” After getting the answer he wanted, Bai Xiaofei’s tone suddenly changed and he looked at her solemnly.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was very clear about where Min Xizi was from. Previously, even the Snow Kingdom failed to keep him. He crossed the whole continent and came to the Windless Zone to directly become Tan Xin’s underling, so there was only one reason.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin also came from that world!</p> 
 <p>“I thought you weren’t going to ask.” Tan Xin chuckled. She seemed to have been waiting for this question. “A wanderer who suddenly found a place to stop, and then was reluctant to leave but was unwilling to live under another’s roof, so there’s Windlove City.”</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin’s answer was vague, but Bai Xiaofei understood.</p> 
 <p>“That means you’re going to stay in Starnet Continent for a long time?” he asked, but did not get an answer.</p> 
 <p>“I said you can only ask three questions. It’s my turn.” Rendering Bai Xiaofei speechless, Tan Xin’s eyes swirled craftily.</p> 
 <p>“Ask.” Bai Xiaofei felt that no questions from her could trouble him and therefore was very calm. No matter how smart Tan Xin was, this was the first time they met. He refused to believe she could probe out his secrets.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei soon panicked…</p> 
 <p>“If you’re ready, I’ll ask!” Tan Xin cleared her throat, her eyes shining. “Do you mind having one more wife? One who will never grow up?”</p> 
 <p>As soon as her voice fell, Bai Xiaofei was shocked silly.</p> 
 <p><em>What the hell was that?!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Ehh… can we not joke?” Bai Xiaofei swallowed with difficulty. He could not believe that this was her question.</p> 
 <p>“I’m not joking. Although I look like a little girl, I have, in fact, already reached marriageable age. Ordinary people are not worthy of me, while those who are worthy barely come to this place where birds don’t even want to shit. Now that one finally has, of course I have to seize the opportunity.”</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin slowly neared Bai Xiaofei as she spoke. At that instant, Bai Xiaofei keenly felt that she was not a loli at all!</p> 
 <p>“I do mind! I mind very much!” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly stepped back, bean-sized sweat drops flowing down his face.</p> 
 <p>“I knew you would say this, so here’s my second question.” Tan Xin brought out her killer move, “Do you want my help?”</p> 
 <p>What was ‘taking advantage of people in dire need?’ Tan Xin demonstrated this phrase to the fullest.</p> 
 <p>At the very least, Windlove City was her territory. Bai Xiaofei did not know how much power she held, but he was certain that this power was not negligible. He really wanted to borrow this power, but…</p> 
 <p>From Tan Xin’s attitude, if he did not agree to her first question, then he could stop expecting any help from Windlove City altogether!</p> 
 <p>“When I came here, the Windlove force was never in my plans. If you want to use this to tempt me…”</p> 
 <p>“My third question, aren’t you afraid that I will expose you to the All-Around Merchant Group and Unify Business?” Tan Xin cut him off. This time, she switched to threats, naked threats!</p> 
 <p>“Min Xizi and I are friends.” In desperation, Bai Xiaofei used Min Xizi, but unfortunately…</p> 
 <p>“You think Diarrhea that little guy will listen to you or me? Moreover, don’t even try to scare me. You know better than me what your current state is. Only that little fox outside is a bit tricky, but she’s not enough to keep me~”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei suddenly had a feeling of being grabbed by the throat.</p> 
 <p><em>I’m so done, I let the wolf into my own house! A female sex maniac! A loli at that!!</em></p>
