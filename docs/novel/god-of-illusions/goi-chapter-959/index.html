 <p>Chapter 959: Real Eye-Opener!</p> 
 <p>“General!” The guards immediately greeted Ye Xi respectfully as the trio approached the gate.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t call me general, I no longer have anything to do with the war now. I’ve returned to bring someone to the competition,” replied Ye Xi, drawing the guards’ eyes to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“If so, then of course there is no problem. Please.” The guards made way for the three.</p> 
 <p>Behind Ye Xi, Bai Xiaofei softly poked her, reminding her about the arrested Zhu Chunyang. However, before Ye Xi could respond, a guard at the side immediately rushed over.</p> 
 <p>“Outrageous! How dare you disrespect Master Ye Xi?! Drag him to the prison!”</p> 
 <p>A large group of guards immediately rushed over and pointed their weapons at Bai Xiaofei so aggressively that it looked as if he had dug out their ancestral graves.</p> 
 <p>“Stand down! He is my servant, I allowed it!” Ye Xi quickly said. Bai Xiaofei didn’t know, but she knew full well that offending women was a great sin in Moonlight, and being taken to the prison was basically akin to stepping one foot into the gates of hell.</p> 
 <p>“When did he…”</p> 
 <p>“Do you want him to die?!” Ye Xi cut off the angry Tan Xin.</p> 
 <p>“My Lord, you have a special status, please don’t let men taint your nobility,” said the head of the guard group. The guards’ attitude eased after Ye Xi’s words and they all backed down.</p> 
 <p>“Why? Are you worried that I forgot about this?” Ye Xi’s expression grew ugly.</p> 
 <p>The head guard immediately knelt. “This subordinate dares not!”</p> 
 <p>“Get up, I know you’re just doing your duty. Also, you just arrested a man who’s also one of my people. You have not sent him away, have you?” Ye Xi snorted, her tone not improving at all.</p> 
 <p>“You mean that man surnamed Zhu?” The head guard frowned, her expression strange.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, it’s him! He’s just been caught by you!” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly chimed in for fear that Ye Xi didn’t know if it was the right person.</p> 
 <p>Little did he know that his words once again set off the situation.</p> 
 <p>“Outrageous! How dare you interrupt women when they talk?! How can a servant lack discipline?!” shouted a guard.</p> 
 <p>Ye Xi just wanted to strangle Bai Xiaofei on the spot. <em>No one will think you’re dumb if you don’t talk!!</em></p> 
 <p>“I said, he is my servant! Do you want to help me discipline him?!” Ye Xi bit the bullet and roared. She was not the type of person who liked to use her identity to suppress people, but today she had done it twice…</p> 
 <p>“My Lord, this subordinate dares not, it’s just that…”</p> 
 <p>“No need to explain, just go and bring me that man. I don’t have time to waste in this place.” Ye Xi gritted her teeth. Of course, it was mostly because of Bai Xiaofei’s big mouth.</p> 
 <p>“My Lord, do you know the identity of that man?” asked the head guard hesitantly.</p> 
 <p>“You think I’d take in a servant without investigating his background first?!” Ye Xi’s voice had dropped below freezing point.</p> 
 <p>Sensing her anger, the head guard swallowed back the words on the tip of her tongue and said, “This subordinate understands!”</p> 
 <p>Shortly after, Zhu Chunyang was hauled over. Seeing Bai Xiaofei again, the man teared up as he recalled the brief period just now when he had experienced a bit of Moonlight’s true terror. It was simply… inhumane!</p> 
 <p>“If you were any later, I would really have died…” He hugged Bai Xiaofei tightly as bitter tears streamed down his cheeks.</p> 
 <p>“Everything is alright now. Do I look like the kind of person who would run and abandon his friend?” Bai Xiaofei soothed him, then his nose twitched. “Why does something smell like barbecue?”</p> 
 <p>The question made Zhu Chunyang burst into tears as he whispered something to Bai Xiaofei. The latter gulped hard at what he heard.</p> 
 <p>“It’s… fine. Just don’t take off your pants casually in the future, or your image will be ruined…” Bai Xioafei patted Zhu Chunyang on the shoulder as he tried hard not to chuckle.</p> 
 <p>Just now, in order to torture Zhu Chunyang into confessing his identity, the soldiers branded the ‘slave’ word on his butt…</p> 
 <p>Following Ye Xi, the group finally officially entered the imperial city, where Ye Xi’s carriage was waiting. Looking at the carriage large enough to hold a small party, Bai Xiaofei’s understanding of women was raised to a new height.</p> 
 <p>“Although my carriage is a relatively poor one here, it’s still much better than the one we used on the road,” said Ye Xi, almost causing the other three to choke to death.</p> 
 <p><em>If this is poor, to what extent is your ‘good?!’</em></p> 
 <p>Sitting inside the carriage, they barely felt any bumps, and the interior was no different from a room. There was also food, drink, and entertainment… The only thing it didn’t have was probably a bathroom…</p> 
 <p><em>Poverty really limits our imagination!</em></p> 
 <p>“Now that you are in the capital, there are precautions you must exercise. If something like just now happens again, I can’t guarantee that I will be able to save you,” said Ye coldly, spilling all her grievances from just now.</p> 
 <p>“First, men are forbidden from walking around freely, even if they wear masks. In order to go outside, they must be led by a noble above the rank of viscount.”</p> 
 <p>“Second, it is forbidden to talk about topics involving state affairs, women, and it is forbidden to complain about servant-related matters.”</p> 
 <p>“Third, when you see a woman, you must salute. If you don’t, no matter who this woman is, she has the right to send you to any disciplinary place in the capital. And this is a friendly reminder, the capital’s disciplinary department is unparalleled in strictness in Moonlight.”</p> 
 <p>“Fourth, as a contestant, you will be sent to a centralized place where someone will manage you.” Speaking of this, Ye Xi stopped a little. “You know this person, but remember, you can’t disobey her.”</p> 
 <p>Having said that, she ignored the puzzled Bai Xiaofei and looked at Tan Xin.</p> 
 <p>“As the master of a contestant, you will be provided with a special place for accommodation. Unlike the contestants, you are completely free and you can visit him at any time you want. However, I don’t think you would want to go there.”</p> 
 <p>Just as Ye Xi finished, the carriage came to a stop.</p> 
 <p>“My Lord, we have arrived,” the officer driving the carriage softly informed.</p> 
 <p>Ye Xi got off the carriage, followed by a nervous Bai Xiaofei and Zhu Chunyang. And the scene that greeted the two men made them gawk in shock.</p> 
 <p><em>What the hell is this place?!!</em></p> 
 <p>“This…” Bai Xiaofei swallowed with difficulty, not knowing what to say.</p> 
 <p>“That’s right, this is the place where you’ll be staying.”</p>
