 <p>A second before he saw the crowd of people, Bai Xiaofei thought they’d come to give away Starnet Stones, but once he did see the crowd, Bai Xiaofei instantly changed his thoughts.</p>
 <p><i>They’ve come to f*cking take my life!</i></p>
 <p>Xue Ying acted even more straightforwardly and withdrew the cloak that represented her identity as a teacher from her spatial ring and wore with without saying a single word.</p>
 <p>She’d changed her clothes earlier for the sake of it being convenient to make a move and wearing this now was for the sake of not having to make a move….</p>
 <p>But, even with Xue Ying’s identity as a teacher, all of them still had no intention of letting the matter go, and they still surrounded the classroom tightly.</p>
 <p>An entire 30 plus second year students, and every single one of them was at the Master Rank!</p>
 <p>“Teacher, classes are over now, and your job has already ended. Can you consider….” The senior in the lead, Chu Mingyuan, the student president of the Gods Amongst Men for the second years and a figure that was ranked on the Popularity Rankings. He seemed to have a scholarly air yet his words carried thorns. But, what he never expected was that his speech would actually be interrupted.</p>
 <p>Moreover, it was interrupted by fear!</p>
 <p>Xue Ying didn’t say a single word as she stood before Chu Mingyuan, yet the killing intent that was suddenly emitted from her seemed to be material, and it forcefully cut off his speed.</p>
 <p>“Student, pay attention to your status when you speak. If I want, I can take you to have provoked me, and you ought to know what sort of authority a provoked teacher possesses, right!?” A cyclone instantly appeared in her palm. Xue Ying’s concentrated mind gave Chu Mingyuan the misconception that seemed as if only he and Xue Ying remained in the world, and he was unable to hide no matter where he went.</p>
 <p>“President! President!” The force exerted by the lackeys that followed by Chu Mingyuan’s side grew stronger and stronger, and they finally woke Chu Mingyuan up from that special state. At the instant he woke up, Chu Mingyuan’s back was already drenched with cold sweat!</p>
 <p>After recovering his consciousness, Chu Mingyuan’s heart was already filled with astonishment.</p>
 <p>Earlier, Xue Ying had actually caused him to hallucinate by merely relying on her imposing aura! Moreover, it was a hallucination that caused him to lose heart!</p>
 <p>For a time, Chu Mingyuan couldn’t help but fall into a dilemma.</p>
 <p>Making a move was absolutely impossible. He believed that so long as he dared to make a move, Xue Ying would absolutely reciprocate at the first possible moment, and this sort of belief was already branded into his heart like it was part of his instinct.</p>
 <p>But, if he didn’t make a move, then his actions of utilizing his status as President to drag over so many people would have been in vain, and it would surely affect his reputation forever. The words ‘coming back empty handed’ were sufficient to cause him to be unable to raise his head up high in society for a very long time.</p>
 <p>“Senior, here are 200 Starnet Stones. It ought to be enough for you to treat everyone to a meal. The matter between me and Senior Sister Qin Lingyan is purely a misunderstanding, and we’ll naturally take care of it when the time comes. I’m truly sorry for causing trouble for you, Senior.” At the critical moment, Bai Xiaofei walked up abruptly and stopped before Chu Mingyuan, and then he grinned as he gave Chu Mingyuan a way out that was just right.</p>
 <p>Chu Mingyuan relaxed in his heart, and he wished for nothing more than to embrace Bai Xiaofei and shower affection onto Bai Xiaofei. But, his intellect suppressed this impulse in the end, and he revealed a troubled expression.</p>
 <p>“Even if it’s a misunderstanding between the two of you, the efficacy of the Bounty Rankings can’t be challenged.” Chu Mingyuan stared coldly at Bai Xiaofei as he took out his final bit of persistence, and he hoped that Bai Xiaofei was a truly intelligent person that would know what he was thinking.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei really didn’t disappoint him….</p>
 <p>“No, no. Senior, you got it wrong. I don’t intend to challenge the efficacy of the Bounty Rankings. But, teaching me a lesson is only worth 50 Starnet Stones in total. Senior, you’ve called over so many people, so how could it possibly be enough to divide amongst them?</p>
 <p>“Moreover, your arrival has already allowed me to clearly comprehend my mistakes. You’ve obtained even more benefits and attained the objective of teaching me a lesson that’s required on the Bounty Rankings at the same time. Methods of teaching a lesson isn’t limited to physical attacks, right?” After speaking a very long string of words, Bai Xiaofei raised up his jade token once more. This time, Chu Mingyuan went silent for a short moment and didn’t refuse it again.</p>
 <p>“I hope the misunderstanding you spoke of will be cleared up as soon as possible because the assignment was placed on the Bounty Rankings for an entire 10 days.” Chu Mingyuan lowered his voice and sufficiently displayed the required attitude before turning and leaving. The 30 plus people turned and left along with him, and practically all their gazes stopped on Bai Xiaofei and Xue Ying for a moment.</p>
 <p>After successfully sending away another batch of the plague, Bai Xiaofei let out a long sigh of relief, and even Xue Ying patted her chest along with him while revealing a relaxed expression.</p>
 <p>“Not bad, Little Fei’Fei. I thought the matter would escalate for sure.” Xue Ying moved forward before stretching out her hand to raise up Bai Xiaofei’s chin, and she revealed a teasing expression once again as she lightly licked her lips.</p>
 <p>Amitabha….</p>
 <p>If it wasn’t for his inability to defeat Xue Ying, Bai Xiaofei would have already pounced forward at this moment. But, his intellect defeated his desire when faced with reality….</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Xue, where’s Lin Li?” If one wanted to make a woman that was teasing you instantly lose all interest, then asking about another beautiful woman was the most effective and fastest method.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei thanked his Third Father, a veteran in the art of flowers, once again….</p>
 <p>“Hmph! All you know is to ask about Little Li’Li. Boring.” Xue Ying grunted with displeasure and was entirely like a little resentful wife that was acting in a spoiled manner.</p>
 <p>“I asked her to go see the Principal, our academy’s big boss, with Xu Chen.” Xue Ying raised her brows as she spoke, and it seemed as if the little resentful wife from before wasn’t her.</p>
 <p>“Principal?!” Bai Xiaofei exclaimed with shock instead. His understanding of this word had stopped at Vice Principal Luo Xi’s furious face, and if it wasn’t for her, how could he have possibly fallen to the Savage Class?</p>
 <p>Even though Bai Xiaofei was extremely satisfied with this class now, he’d still bound the word principal with ‘excessively mean in conduct’ and ‘an ever-changing attitude’.</p>
 <p>“For what?!” Xue Ying revealed a trace of a smile once again when she saw Bai Xiaofei’s extremely unwilling expression.</p>
 <p>“Do you think I wanted to? You’ve already been put on the Bounty Rankings, so do you think I alone can deal with the wave after wave of people looking for trouble with you if he doesn’t stand out? After all, I’ll be dismissed if I help you bash others too many times. I was only able to assume the position of a teacher in Starnet Academy with great difficulty, and I don’t want to return home so quickly.” Her tone carried a trace of complaint as Xue Ying revealed her true thoughts.</p>
 <p>“He’ll stand out for me? Are you very familiar with the Principal?” The surprise on Bai Xiaofei’s face grew slightly deeper. After all, no matter how he looked at it, a half-baked teacher like Xue Ying who wasn’t even too sure about the exact situation in the academy wasn’t someone with connections.</p>
 <p>“What do you think?! If I was familiar with him, then would I have to be overcautious? I would have directly made a move earlier, alright?! Do you even have a brain?!” Xue Ying knocked Bai Xiaofei heavily on the head, and she looked at him as if she was looking at an idiot.</p>
 <p>“If you’re unfamiliar with him, then why did you go call on him? Would the dignified principal of Starnet Academy care about a nobody like me from the Savage Class?” This was the main point that Bai Xiaofei was bewildered about. After all, the word principal was slightly far away from him.</p>
 <p>“I’m surely unable to move him, but he can!” Xue Ying grinned as she looked down at Huskie who was wagging his tail….</p>
