 <p>Chapter 322: Uh-huh…</p> 
 <p>Glaring at Bai Xiaofei, who was smiling, Xue Ying gritted her teeth as if she wanted to eat him alive.</p> 
 <p>However, if Xue Ying really wanted to ‘eat’ Bai Xiaofei, he might just be very happy…</p> 
 <p>“Mhm, still that same taste.” As if not seeing Xue Ying’s reaction, Bai Xiaofei smacked his lips contentedly, and he was exactly the byword for ‘sleazy’ at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“You say anymore and I will tear your mouth open! Believe me, I can definitely do it!” Before Bai Xiaofei could continue, a flushed Xue Ying pushed him away.</p> 
 <p>“Last time you talked first, how come this time…”</p> 
 <p>“You’re still talking?!”</p> 
 <p>“Okay, okay, I’ll stop! I’m not talking!”</p> 
 <p>Having taken the benefit he wanted, Bai Xiaofei decided to concede as quickly as possible. Although he didn’t voice it out, his satisfied face basically screamed ‘smug.’</p> 
 <p>“It’s your turn. Tell me what you’re upset about,” said Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Seeing Bai Xiaofei keep staring at her in a daze, Xue Ying boiled with anger. However, this anger actually cleared away her previous depression and made her a little more spirited.</p> 
 <p>Perhaps this was the main purpose of Bai Xiaofei’s life-risking behavior earlier… Well, let’s just think of it like that.</p> 
 <p>“I met an acquaintance. He told me to do something troubling. Although I didn’t want to do it, I had to. This kind of feeling makes me feel very lost.”</p> 
 <p>Xue Ying didn’t say it explicitly but she somewhat explained her own struggle. Bai Xiaofei didn’t pry into it because he wasn’t stupid.</p> 
 <p>She had already said she didn’t want to say it. If he asked anymore, what would he be if not stupid!?</p> 
 <p>“No one can keep on doing what they don’t want to do. You may be able to force yourself once or twice, but you can’t force yourself all the time. There will definitely be a day when you won’t have to do things you don’t want to.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s comfort was as abstract as ever, but this kind of abstraction seemed to be a suitable remedy for Xue Ying’s case as the effect was exceptional every single time.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll count on your words, I only hope that I won’t be alone at that time.” A captivating smile completely chased away the previous clouds from Xue Ying’s face. Perhaps it was really gone, perhaps it was only buried deep in her heart. Either way, at least it wouldn’t be able to affect her now.</p> 
 <p>Xue Ying had returned to her normal self.</p> 
 <p>“Come, let your teacher have some.” Xue Ying crooked her finger at Bai Xiaofei, the flowing light in her eyes was like gravity that pulled Bai Xiaofei’s body over regardless of his control.</p> 
 <p>However, the following situation was slightly different from what he imagined.</p> 
 <p>It wasn’t a pair of tender lips that welcomed him, but Xue Ying’s slender arms. Then, those slender arms took him into a super hard 180-degree turn in the air and abandoned him…</p> 
 <p><em>Bang!</em> Bai Xiaofei landed heavily.</p> 
 <p>“Humph! I’ll see if you still dare to take advantage of me after this. This is only a little lesson!” Leaving her final words, Xue Ying disappeared before Bai Xiaofei could crawl back up.</p> 
 <p>She had to run. Who knew if Bai Xiaofei Bai would retaliate if she stayed! Of course, Xue Ying wasn’t afraid that she couldn’t control Bai Xiaofei. She feared that she couldn’t control herself.</p> 
 <p>After all that with Xue Ying, Bai Xiaofei was no longer in the mood to relax, but his original purpose for coming here had been achieved, he had completely forgotten about the Illusionary Sandboard.</p> 
 <p>That was the benefit of having a carefree heart!</p> 
 <p>Quietly sneaking into his own room, Bai Xiaofei quickly fell asleep and slept like a log.</p> 
 <p>“Xiaofei! Are you back?!”</p> 
 <p>The rash Yun Sheng suddenly kicked open the door while Bai Xiaofei was still dreaming. Seeing Bai Xiaofei lying on the bed, Yun Sheng instantly looked like he had seen his salvation.</p> 
 <p>“What the hell! You’re still sleeping when the fire is burning our arses! Get up quickly!”</p> 
 <p>Yun Sheng pulled Bai Xiaofei from the bed with one hand. In his sleepy state, Bai Xiaofei felt like the sky and earth had reversed, and when he was finally awakened and back to his senses, Yun Sheng was already carrying him to the living room.</p> 
 <p>“Woah!? Brother Yun, what’s going on?” Bai Xiaofei exclaimed in alarm, suddenly having a feeling that he was about to be sold.</p> 
 <p>“People from the Student Union are here. They want an explanation from you,” Yun Sheng briefed so quickly that Bai Xiaofei was slightly caught off guard.</p> 
 <p><em>Student Union?! Want an explanation?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Ahh, it must be about the New Student Mutual Aid Community taking all the work.</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei easily guessed the purpose of the Student Union visit after some thought and then revealed a nonchalant expression.</p> 
 <p><em>Nothing to panic about, just get rid of them.</em></p> 
 <p>However, after identifying the problem was the Student Union, Bai Xiaofei had a new question, “Brother Yun, this is not like you. I remember when the people from the Fist of the Beast came, you directly started the fight with them. Why the sudden switch of characters this time?”</p> 
 <p>Yun Sheng involuntarily blushed upon this question, as his eyes drifted to another place.</p> 
 <p>“Cough cough, about that… Well, these guys are from the Student Union? We must give them some face, right? Too much violence isn’t good.”</p> 
 <p>“But you weren’t like this at the merchant house last time.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was referring to the Di Jiang incident. At that time, Yun Sheng had pretty much cared about nothing. If it hadn’t been for Bai Xiaofei, Chu Liuyun and everyone else would have absolutely jumped into a fight.</p> 
 <p>“Because Big Sister Chu was there, alright? Who in this school could be bigger than our Big Sister?” Yun Sheng’s eyes drifted further and further away as if he was talking to someone else and not Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Then I won’t go. You can just tell them that Big Sis Yun doesn’t let me go. You still have the courage to refuse them, right?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately acted on his words and walked back, but before he could take two steps, Yun Sheng reached out and grabbed him.</p> 
 <p>“Okay, you can be my ancestor, alright?! Please, just go! Do you know who came?! If you make me refuse, you might as well just kill me!” Yun Sheng, who was finally unable to hold himself together, resigned and completely abandoned all pretense in front of Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>There was no other choice, Bai Xiaofei didn’t have any shame, but he still did.</p> 
 <p>“Oh? Who is it? “</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei asked with curiosity. Yun Sheng swallowed hard.</p> 
 <p>“Su Yu!”</p> 
 <p>“Su Yu?”</p> 
 <p>Yun Sheng’s expression was serious while Bai Xiaofei’s expression was of complete ignorance.</p> 
 <p>“Who is Su Yu? Never heard of this name.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei said with a frown, and at the same time began to rummage through his brain for this person’s information, especially trying to remember if he had offended a senior surnamed Su. However, after a while of searching, he didn’t find any results.</p> 
 <p>“Even if you haven’t heard of Su Yu, you should know about the Combat Ranking!” Yun Sheng still looked like he was talking about something horrible.</p> 
 <p>“Why, is he big on the Combat Ranking?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei automatically recalled Xiong Cheng who he met in the Ethereal Pavilion. <em>That guy is only so so…</em></p> 
 <p>“Big?! He’s not only big, but he is also the top of the Combat Ranking! Double department, excellent student of both the Gods Amongst Men and the Sword of Assault! Now the president of the Student Union!”</p> 
 <p>Yun Sheng practically roared, but the response he got from Bai Xiaofei was only a single word.</p> 
 <p>“Uh-huh…”</p>
