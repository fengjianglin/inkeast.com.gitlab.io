 <p>Chapter 835: Seeing Revelation!</p> 
 <p>“Smelly boy, you finally come to see me.”</p> 
 <p>Revelation’s familiar voice rang out as soon as Bai Xiaofei approached his door. Unlike other people who only had curiosity and admiration toward the old man, Bai Xiaofei’s impression of him was always his improper manner.</p> 
 <p>“Hey, you are my first stop.” Bai Xiaofei pushed open the door and entered.</p> 
 <p>In the large room, Revelation sat quietly alone as wisps of smoke rose from the incense burner in front of him, looking very otherworldly!</p> 
 <p>“Disciple Bai Xiaofei greets and offers gratitude, Master!” Surprisingly, the first thing that Bai Xiaofei, who just wore a look of ‘despise’ a second ago, did, was kowtow to Revelation.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei used to be inexperienced and knew nothing, but after four years, he had learned one thing: All that he currently had started with the cultivation technique that the old man taught him. On top of that, during the Starnet bicentennial celebration, it was Revelation’s painstaking arrangements that brought about the only possibility of turning the tables.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei kowtowed with utmost sincerity.</p> 
 <p>“You, smelly boy, at least have some conscience. However, I’m afraid you didn’t come here just to see me.” Revelation was definitely a wise old man. There were things that he didn’t even have to guess.</p> 
 <p>“I was originally aimless, but now there are problems I need to solve.” Bai Xiaofei laughed sleazily.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s put aside your matter for now and deal with mine first,” Revelation said and closed his eyes. Before long, three people wearing black uniforms came in.</p> 
 <p>Unlike the other personnel of the Revelation Pavilion, these three people did not give off any sagely vibe at all. On the contrary, each looked crueler than the last!</p> 
 <p>“Investigate what happened at the entrance today and expel all those involved. Also, inform all the disciples after the 8th generation to divine all day for the next half month as an explanation for our guests,” Revelation ordered, having no intention to cover up for his juniors at all. He really didn’t know about this matter before as the possibility never even came to mind, until today when he noticed Bai Xiaofei’s arrival and saw what happened.</p> 
 <p>“Tch, how surprising, it actually has nothing to do with you, smelly old man!” Bai Xiaofei did not forget to mock his master.</p> 
 <p>Revelation glared in anger, wanting to teach Bai Xiaofei a lesson. However, seeing the latter’s sinister look, he forced himself to stop. <em>If I do anything to this brat, he’ll definitely publish my affairs!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Ahem, let’s just turn the page. Next topic!” Revelation coughed. His eyes then fell upon the three girls who stood behind Bai Xiaofei, not daring to even breathe loudly.</p> 
 <p>Each time he looked at one girl, the surprise on his face deepened. After scanning the three again, he turned to Bai Xiaofei with a helpless sigh.</p> 
 <p>“Smelly boy, you really can’t stop making me worry!”</p> 
 <p>In the face of the Revelation’s sudden sentimental remark, Bai Xiaofei was stunned. Then, it suddenly dawned on him and he revealed a bitter expression.</p> 
 <p><em>What can I do?! I’m desperate too!! Teacher, help!!!</em></p> 
 <p>Although Bai Xiaofei did not say it out loud, the begging look he gave Revelation said it all.</p> 
 <p>“No hurry, let’s wait for Heartseer,” Revelation soothed and moved his finger slightly. A tea set flew up, automatically serving tea for everyone.</p> 
 <p>“Where do you plan to go?” Revelation lifted his cup, looking as if he was just making small talk.</p> 
 <p>“Ethereal. Aunt Luo told me I can find out about my father’s past there. I intend to solve this first and provide my parent group an explanation.” Bai Xiaofei’s tone was calm, but everyone could hear the determination in it. He had officially put this matter on his agenda.</p> 
 <p>“All ill-fated love, ah! I hope you can withstand it, boy.” With another helpless sigh, Revelation successfully struck Bai Xiaofei dumb.</p> 
 <p><em>What does my dad’s ill-fated love have to do with me???</em></p> 
 <p>“What do you mean?” asked Bai Xiaofei doubtfully.</p> 
 <p>Revelation only shook his head. “It’s not the time yet, it’s still too early. Ask me again when you can’t find the direction. At that time, I will give you the answer.”</p> 
 <p>When Revelation finished his words, there was the sound of footsteps outside.</p> 
 <p>“4th grand disciple Heartseer seeks attendance!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was happy to hear a familiar voice. However, he suddenly noticed something and was startled. <em>What the?! 4th grand disciple?? Wasn’t he the 18th generation or something?!</em></p> 
 <p>While Bai Xiaofei was still lost in thought, Revelation called Heartseer in and motioned him to sit behind Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“After Heartseer returned from your place, I accepted him as my disciple. However, in order to make it convenient for him to address you, I gave him the identity of the 4th disciple,” explained Revelation as he saw through Bai Xiaofei’s doubts.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Heartseer was in high spirits. Just like Revelation had promised him at the beginning, the trip to Starnet was indeed an opportunity for him to rise!</p> 
 <p>“Hehe, Granduncle, long time no see!” Heartseer, who was quite different from before, could not suppress his excitement.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t look at me with that expression, I’m not interested in men.” Scared by the man’s sleazy smile, Bai Xiaofei instinctively shuddered and moved away from him.</p> 
 <p>“If you two keep talking, the best time of the day will be over soon.” Revelation pulled their attention back to the matter at hand.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei did not understand what he meant, while Heartseer’s eyes glowed.</p> 
 <p>“Ladies, are you willing to let this old man give you a divination?” Revelation asked.</p> 
 <p>Upon being addressed, the three girls were stunned, then hurriedly nodded.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei realized why they had waited for Heartseer. Divination was mysterious, and Revelation stood at the top of the continent in this. This was an extremely rare opportunity for Heartseer to observe and learn. After all, Revelation did not do divinations every day.</p> 
 <p>“This lady, can I borrow a strand of your hair?” Revelation chose Gu Lingyue to be the first one.</p> 
 <p>Gu Lingyue froze a little, then plucked off a strand of her hair and handed it to Revelation.</p> 
 <p>As Revelation received it, his energy fluctuated and the strand of hair floated like a water snake. When he finally retracted his energy, the hair had broken into pieces and fallen to the floor. Staring at the arrangement of the pieces of hair for a moment, Revelation’s eyes lit up.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, Heartseer widened his eyes. <em>I’ll be damned! What kind of luck is this!!?</em></p> 
 <p>“What does it say?” Not missing a single expression on Revelation’s face, Bai Xiaofei was even more nervous than Gu Lingyue…</p>
