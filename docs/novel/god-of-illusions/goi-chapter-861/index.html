 <p>Chapter 861: Bai Xing, Bai Yue!</p> 
 <p>After the best sleep in quite a while, Bai Xiaofei finally opened his eyes at lunchtime.</p> 
 <p>He once again had to admit that the Moon Beck Pavilion was indeed worthy of its reputation as a place to squander money. He had just gotten out of bed when the two sisters from yesterday knocked on the door.</p> 
 <p>“Mister Bai, are you awake?” one of them asked gently.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was startled. If it weren’t that the two girls standing outside the door were only ordinary people, he would think that he was being monitored.</p> 
 <p>Returning to his senses, he hurriedly replied, “Yes, I’m up.”</p> 
 <p>The next second, the two sisters opened the door and came in carrying a luxurious meal.</p> 
 <p>Putting his lunch on the table, they then brought in hot water and a series of washing necessities. After everything was ready, they helped Bai Xiaofei get dressed.</p> 
 <p>“Is this the first time you are served like this, Mister Bai? I can feel that you are a little stiff. Just relax, we definitely will not make you uncomfortable,” one sister said as she noticed Bai Xiaofei’s embarrassment right away.</p> 
 <p>“Mister Bai, the two of us will serve you during your stay here. My name is Bai Xing and her name is Bai Yue.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xing, Bai Yue, the names that only the first and second ranker of the Worshipping Stella could have<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>. In other words, these two sisters were the highest-status staff for this job!</p> 
 <p>Or, to be more precise, they did not have to do this kind of job anymore. By convention, those ranked in the top five in Worshipping Stella could already start preparing for future performance competitions.</p> 
 <p>“Is this arranged by Brother Yun?” Bai Xiaofei gradually relaxed and then thought of Yun Tianhe.</p> 
 <p>“Although Mister Yun is our top VIP, he still does not have the right to appoint anyone. We admire Mister Bai and so applied for this job.” Bai Xing smiled captivatingly.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei gulped. “Er… that’s way overboard for a joke. If I remember correctly, this is my first time here. Moreover, I’m not even a normal guest, I’m just invited by someone else,” he said shyly as his heart started to drum in alert.</p> 
 <p>“Mister Bai is too modest. I wonder if you still remember the Blossom Ranking?” Bai Yue smiled, but the smile was obviously a little… evil.</p> 
 <p>“Blos… Blossom Ranking?! You guys… are you guys… senior sisters?!” Bai Xiaofei instantly gawked in shock. As soon as he finished his question, a finger blocked his lips.</p> 
 <p>“Shhh… In this place, there are only Bai Xing and Bai Yue, no senior sisters. Also, there are some things that you only need to keep to yourself, Mister Bai.”</p> 
 <p>After helping Bai Xiaofei get dressed, the two stood in front of him and stared at him for half a day. Bai Xiaofei started to panic under their intense stares.</p> 
 <p>“Er… senior… Bai Xing and Bai Yue sister…”</p> 
 <p>“If others hear you call me like this, Xing’er will lose my job. Just call us Xing’er and Yue’er,” Bai Xing interrupted.</p> 
 <p><em>Ugh, fine, do as the locals do it is!</em></p> 
 <p>“Xing’er, are you two still unfinished? Should I continue to stand here or do something?” Bai Xiaofei scratched his head awkwardly.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xing and Bai Yue covered their mouth and snickered.</p> 
 <p>“There is nothing else. Xing’er and Yue’er just want to have a close look at Mister Bai.”</p> 
 <p>With that, the two began to help him wash his face. After everything was done, he was brought to the table.</p> 
 <p>“Although there are not many dishes, they are all made by us. Have a taste of our craftsmanship, Mister Bai,” said Bai Xing. Then the two sisters looked at Bai Xiaofei expectantly, seemingly looking forward to a positive answer.</p> 
 <p>As the lids of the four dishes were lifted, their combined aroma drilled into Bai Xiaofei’s nose. Each dish was more delicate than the last, just their appearances alone suggested that they took a long time to set up.</p> 
 <p>Looks and fragrance: full marks! Now it was only the taste.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei, who couldn’t wait, tasted every dish at once, before flashing a satisfied smile.</p> 
 <p>“With your skills, you can open a restaurant that can rival Thousand Aroma and Hundred Flavor. Moreover, with good marketing of you two beautiful chefs, you guys can definitely crush them!” said Bai Xiaofei firmly.</p> 
 <p>The two sisters immediately smiled.</p> 
 <p>“It’s no wonder that Mister Bai is so attractive to girls. Just a casual compliment from you is already so delightful to hear.” Although Bai Yue was happy, there seemed to be a trace of jealousy in her words.</p> 
 <p>“By the way, Xing’er, Yue’er, why are you guys here? With your means, survival should not be difficult,” Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but ask. Why would they, as Starnet graduates and also former rankers of the Blossom Ranking, actually be willing to start from the bottom at a place like the Moon Beck Pavilion?</p> 
 <p><em>Could it be that I really underestimated this place?</em></p> 
 <p>“Perhaps you don’t know, Mister Bai, although we are only seen as servants and performers here, we in fact live better than most people think. We can find other ways outside, but they may not be as good as being here,” said Bai Xing.</p> 
 <p>“Moreover, while there are top-class female experts on this continent, the numbers are few. Most girls like us still want to find a reliable man. Here, as long as you become the top card, you can find a good husband among many promising men,” added Bai Yue.</p> 
 <p>This was very realistic and Bai Xiaofei had nothing to refute. After all, the original purpose of the Blossom Ranking was the same as this place.</p> 
 <p>“Even if we fail, we will only be 30 years old when we leave, which is still young for a puppet master and it won’t affect our future at all. Therefore, this seemingly ordinary performer identity is actually a position that many women can’t even ask for.” Bai Xing laughed.</p> 
 <p>Obviously, the two felt no burden from their current identity.</p> 
 <p>“Mister Bai, maybe you don’t know yet. Here in the Moon Beck Pavilion, there are many daughters of rich families and even noble families. Therefore, you must be careful. If you are targeted by one, you may receive the imperial decree to marry her tomorrow,” Bai Yue teased.</p> 
 <p>Although this sounded half-joking, Bai Xiaofei still froze a little.</p> 
 <p>First, he was stunned by the status of this pavilion. Its background was definitely beyond the imagination of most people to be able to do this.</p> 
 <p>Second, what if… <em>What if that really happens to me… It can’t be, right…?</em></p>
