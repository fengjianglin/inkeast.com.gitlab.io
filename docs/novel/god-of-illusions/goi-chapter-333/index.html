 <p>Chapter 333: The Estrangement Between Grandfather and Child!</p> 
 <p>“Big Sis Lei, please don't tease me, okay? I’ve only tricked others a little, I always back away when it gets real.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei's first thought was to refuse. It was never a good thing to know your boss’s secrets as it might even lead to death by association!</p> 
 <p>“Don't you want to know more about Bai Longfei? I’ve heard a lot about this person from Aunt Luo.”</p> 
 <p>Lei Min’s words had Bai Xiaofei wide-eyed.</p> 
 <p>“You do?!”</p> 
 <p>“How can I not know what he doesn’t know, especially when you got into my department? Don't worry, I didn't tell Aunt Luo.”</p> 
 <p>The ‘he’ Lei Min just mentioned must be Lei Shan﻿<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>. From such an address for a close senior family member, one could somewhat guess Lei Min's attitude towards him.</p> 
 <p>Upon hearing this, Bai Xiaofei inwardly sighed. There were some things that if one person knew, there would be a second and third. It was Revelation who had told him to hide from others, yet now, the source of this news disclosure was actually also that same old man!</p> 
 <p>“Let's talk about your problem first. If I can help, I will try my best,” said Bai Xiaofei helplessly. He had no choice but to resign himself, who told him to want to know about his father?</p> 
 <p>And he couldn’t ask Luo Xi! Who knew how he would die if he did!?</p> 
 <p>“26 years ago, our academy encountered an ordeal. The magical beasts in the Infinite Mountain Range suddenly went berserk and launched an attack on Starnet. In order to stop them and maintain Starnet, all of our students and teachers put their lives on the line.”</p> 
 <p>As Lei Min began telling the story, her expression grew emotional.</p> 
 <p>“My parents were among them, but because I was a child at that time, I had to wait in a safe area. I don't know the specifics of that battle, I only know that it lasted for a very, very long time. Later, the beast tide was stopped. He resisted the joint attack of six Emperor Rank beasts all by himself, but in the end, he chose to negotiate with them because he didn't want to see Starnet continue to suffer!”</p> 
 <p>At this, the expression on Lei Min's face turned into anger.</p> 
 <p>“Only then did we know the intent of the beasts – they wanted my parents!”</p> 
 <p>“Your parents?! Why?!” Bai Xiaofei was shocked. It was a common thing for humans to be interested in magical beasts, but this was the first time he heard about magical beasts being interested in humans.</p> 
 <p>“My parents were born with the Illusion Demon Physique, which is rarer than any other physique. Besides being able to manifest illusions without relying on puppets, the blood of the bearer of this physique has a great auxiliary effect on magical beasts’ transformation!”</p> 
 <p>It was no wonder. For something that could help with transformation, even an Emperor Rank magical beast wouldn’t be able to resist the temptation.</p> 
 <p>“But since it’s that kind of special physique, most people will certainly try to hide it. How did the beasts know about it?” Bai Xiaofei asked gently and slowly for fear that he’d trigger Lei Min.</p> 
 <p>“Because of him! He once had my parents go to the Infinite Mountain Range to hunt down a traitor of the academy! That was when my parents’ physiques were revealed!” Lei Min's expression was near hysterical and her voice was heavy with fury.</p> 
 <p>“Sister Lei, calm down!” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly calmed her down, or else he really didn't know what would happen next. After a short pause, he asked softly, “May I ask you a few questions, Sister Lei?”</p> 
 <p>“Ask!” Although Lei Min had tried her best to suppress her emotions, some weren’t so easily controlled.</p> 
 <p>“Under normal circumstances, you should have left Starnet since you hate the old man so much, but why are you still guarding the Demon of Illusions? Also, knowing him, I'm sure he won’t importune others with his ideas, even if they were his own son and daughter-in-law. So, do you know what your parents were thinking at that time?”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Lei Min gradually calmed down, and her expression softened.</p> 
 <p>“Because it’s their last wish. Before they left, they told me that the Demon of Illusions could not fall. They also hoped that when I grew up, I would bring the Demon of Illusions back to its former glory and they made me promise not to abandon it. As for the other question, I can't answer. All I know is that if it weren't for him, my parents wouldn't have been in such danger!”</p> 
 <p>Lei Min deliberately avoided the problem. Someone had said the same words to her, but it had been useless as well.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, then let's change the topic.” As if he had anticipated her reaction, Bai Xiaofei quickly changed tack. “A life for a life, if you were given the chance to kill the old man and avenge your parents, would you do it?”</p> 
 <p>Lei Min instantly froze.</p> 
 <p>“No, he is the principal of Starnet. Starnet can’t be without him.” Lei Min was very satisfied with her reason, which was a good way to evade the issue.</p> 
 <p>“If I say that Starnet doesn’t need him? You don't have to consider other reasons and use them as your excuse. Just tell me, do you want the old man to die?” When Bai Xiaofei asked again this time, he blocked all of her retreats.</p> 
 <p>Lei Min was silent, unable to answer him at all, but the struggle on her face already gave her away.</p> 
 <p>“If you don't want to say, then I'll answer for you. No matter what the situation is, you don’t want to see the old man die, and you don’t want to take his life. It's not because of any other objective reason. There is only one reason that really makes you unable to decide!”</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei paused, Lei Min couldn't help but look up at him, her eyes blank.</p> 
 <p>“He is your last relative in this world!”</p> 
 <p>“No! That's not true!”</p> 
 <p>The moment Bai Xiaofei’s words dropped, Lei Min immediately shouted back in denial.</p> 
 <p>“Don't be in such a hurry to deny it. I haven't finished yet. If you deny it after I finish speaking, I will definitely stop advising you.”</p> 
 <p>Completely cutting off Lei Min's chance to speak, Bai Xiaofei's eyes flashed. He had seen the same situation in the Gorge of Heroes. In fact, the starting point and ending point of family quarrels was only one reason ––</p> 
 <p>Love!</p> 
 <p>It was just that when the distribution of love was uneven or hindered by something, people would become desperate to find that feeling again, which, however, would often backfire!</p> 
 <p>Thank the Gorge of Heroes and all kinds of people there that allowed Bai Xiaofei, who had never gone through such an experience before, to understand this. Otherwise, he really wouldn't know what to do to persuade Lei Min.</p> 
 <p>“Fine, say it!” Lei Min took a deep breath with a look of resignation.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei completely entered his zone with a smile.</p> 
 <p><em>Old man, be ready to treat me to a big meal!</em></p>
