 <p>Chapter 796: Continue!</p> 
 <p>“Li Li, how is it?” Fang Ye immediately came up to Lin Li upon seeing her team return in a hurry.</p> 
 <p>However, Lin Li’s answer was not what he expected.</p> 
 <p>“The people of Devil Forest may be overly scared from the previous battle, they can’t lay any lower than this. And they all curl up together, even approaching them is a problem now.” Lin Li helplessly sighed, then asked worriedly, “What about Wang Hang’s team? Haven’t they come back yet?”</p> 
 <p>In the past few days, there was no doubt that Wang Hang’s group had been making the biggest noise. The whole city lord mansion could now be described as turbulent. Although Wang Hang’s group did not go as far as killing anyone, currently, none of the soldiers there could move.</p> 
 <p>The mysterious Windlove Army did not fare much better. After several confrontations with Wang Hang, there was not a time that they weren’t at a disadvantage. For this reason, Wang Hang’s team had been labeled ‘mysterious and formidable’ by Windlove City.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, they are fine. With those two perverts Wang Hang and Wu Chi, they have absolutely no problems escaping safely.”</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye was quite confident in his friends, and his confidence was not groundless.</p> 
 <p>“Boss Xian’er!” Shi Kui suddenly shouted.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the rest turned around and saw Hu Xian’er’s team also returning in a hurry. However, unlike the previous team, their faces were lit with joy.</p> 
 <p>“Good news?” Xu Chen, who had learned to read expressions, could not wait for some good news.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, but this is not a good place to talk. Let’s see Xiaofei first,” Hu Xian’er reminded everyone of their original purpose.</p> 
 <p>Since the end of his rampage, Bai Xiaofei had been in a coma for three days and did not look like he was waking anytime soon. Moreover, his energy fluctuation was extremely abnormal. If it weren’t that signs of his vitality were stable, his harem would have refused to leave his side at all.</p> 
 <p>A group of people swarmed in and crowded Bai Xiaofei’s room. Inside, Rui Mengqi was wiping his face with a wet towel. In the past few days, she had assumed the role of a maid to the fullest. If it weren’t for her, Bai Xiaofei would have been stinky.</p> 
 <p>Aside from Rui Mengqi, Luo Han had been staying in the room as well. After all, only with the best healer of the group guarding Bai Xiaofei would the rest feel assured enough to leave for their missions.</p> 
 <p>“How is he?” Hu Xian’er and Lin Li asked almost at the same time with the same tension on their faces.</p> 
 <p>“That strange energy has completely retracted. If there’s no accident…”</p> 
 <p>“Why are there so many people piling up here? Don’t you guys have work to do?”</p> 
 <p>A voice that everyone both hated and loved to hear suddenly rang out and interrupted Luo Han. A pleasant surprise immediately covered everyone’s face. Without giving Bai Xiaofei any chance to react, they surrounded his bed.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Fei, you’re finally awake!”</p> 
 <p>“Boss! And here I thought I’d never see you stand up again!”</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>Everyone competed to vent out their pent-up emotions accumulated in the last several days. Bai Xiaofei listened quietly, without any impatience. Nothing felt happier than having so many caring about him…</p> 
 <p>“Alright, alright, aren’t I alive and kicking now? Let’s flip the page.” After listening to their concerns, Bai Xiaofei waved his hand and his smiling expression became serious. “You guys have not just been guarding my room these days, have you?”</p> 
 <p>As soon as the question was dropped, the crowd fell silent. Although they had not sat idly by, the result was not that different, except for Hu Xian’er’s team, whose eyes were shining.</p> 
 <p>“It seems that only my good Xian’er has some gains.” Bai Xiaofei chuckled, his expression so sleazy that it made people want to slap him.</p> 
 <p>“We have started to contact the All-Around Merchant Group from their outermost business line to their executives little by little and found a problem. Although they appear to trade a variety of things, they in fact only do business in two categories.”</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er paused. All ears were strained.</p> 
 <p>“Buying slaves, and selling Blood Diamonds. The rest are all cover-ups!”</p> 
 <p>The information stunned everyone.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei sank into thought. No organization could buy slaves without limits. Therefore, there was another reason for the All-Around Merchant Group to buy slaves in large quantities. It was not hard to conclude that the slave buying was related to the production of Blood Diamonds.</p> 
 <p>Coupled with what had happened to the man who appeared in Starnet begging for help, a shuddering fact was revealed to everyone: the All-Round Merchant Group was using living humans to make Blood Diamonds and then sell them!</p> 
 <p>They were exchanging people’s lives for money!</p> 
 <p>At this thought, Bai Xiaofei gritted his teeth.</p> 
 <p>“Fang Ye, what about Tong Fei?” Bai Xiaofei turned to Fang Ye.</p> 
 <p>“It’s as if he’s gone missing. If I didn’t guess it wrong, it has something to do with our actions after the auction,” replied Fang Ye with a sigh.</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er added, “I think so too. They’ve laid low after that and have even stopped buying slaves for the last two days.” She finished with a frown. The investigation progress of her team had been greatly slowed because of this reason.</p> 
 <p>“You can stop here. Now, your team will follow me,” Bai Xiaofei said as he looked at Hu Xian’er, who nodded in response.</p> 
 <p>“Fang Ye, you continue to track Tong Fei. I believe he’ll still come back even if he has guessed our identity. However, be extremely cautious this time. Unless something is wrong with his brain, he will definitely not be back to continue the cooperation.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s implication was obvious. Tong Fei would definitely bring people to handle them!</p> 
 <p>“Li Li, continue with Devil Forest. Although it’s very likely that they have nothing to do with the production of Blood Diamonds, they must have some deep knowledge of these stones that we don’t know about. Moreover, dragging them in will muddy the waters for us.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s lips curled up into a familiar smile. Seeing this smile, the group silently mourned in advance for the Devil Forest Mercenary Group.</p> 
 <p><em>Poor thing, to be targeted by the number one pervert of Starnet!</em></p> 
 <p>“What are we going to do next?”</p> 
 <p>Rui Mengqi blinked her big eyes in confusion. ‘Cutely foolish’ had become her synonym, but this time everyone sympathized with her because they had no idea what Bai Xiaofei was planning either.</p> 
 <p>“Unify Business. I haven’t figured it out yet!”</p> 
 <p>His eyes sharp, Bai Xiaofei once again got involved with a big monster!</p>
