 <p><span style>“Who! Who’s speaking!?” The young woman was shocked to the point her entire body trembled when she suddenly heard the voice of a man, and she almost tossed the trash in her hand onto Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who else could it be? It’s the trash can before you.” As Bai Xiaofei spoke, the young woman’s gaze moved over along with his voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’re you cheating? Can a trash can speak? Tell me where exactly you’re hiding? There’s no good outcome for a male student that trespasses into the female dormitory. Trust me, I’ll call the aunty over!” The aunty the young woman spoke of was the Great Barrier God in the eyes of the male student, that aunty that almost bashed up Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I’m really the trash can before you. You’ve heard that everything in the world has a soul, right? I’m just a bit special.” The young woman walked over slowly under Bai Xiaofei’s deception, and she assumed the posture of wanting to touch Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s best that you don’t touch me. My consciousness is very weak while your Yin attribute qi is too strong, it’s very likely that you’ll make my consciousness disperse. I exhausted a great deal of effort to condense this little bit of consciousness.” Bai Xiaofei cried out to make the young woman stop, but it didn’t dispel her misgivings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Strange, why does your voice sound slightly familiar?” The young woman scratched her head as she spoke, and a million f*cks surged through Bai Xiaofei’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Motherf*cker! Am I f*cking famous to such a f*cking extent!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“This means that there’s fate between us, so can I ask you for help?” As he forcefully made up an excuse, Bai Xiaofei intended to lead the topic to the main point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go on, I can consider it so long as it’s not very difficult.” The young woman was still partially doubtful. But, he was lucky that the young woman was kind because if it was a young woman like Qi Wei, Bai Xiaofei would have probably been dragged off to be dissected now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A very long time ago, my consciousness was almost crushed, and it was a Transformation Stream beauty that took the form of a fox that saved my life. But, I haven’t seen her for a very long time. I wonder if you can help me find her. I know she’s in this building….” Bai Xiaofei hadn’t finished with his nonsense when the young woman suddenly revealed an enlightened expression!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah! I know who you are now!!! You’re Bai Xiaofei, right, right!? You’re looking for Big Sister Xian’er! I was wondering why your voice is so familiar!” As the young woman spoke, her voice carried a trace of ridicule.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei’s heart was filled with bitterness instead.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’m finished, I’m finished, I f*cked it up!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Err…. That….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re really audacious! And you actually dared to sneak into the female dormitory to look for someone. But, don’t worry, leave this matter to me. But, you have to repay me after I do this for you!” Once the young woman firmly believed that the trash can was Bai Xiaofei, there was a trace of excitement on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, Bai Xiaofei didn’t care about this young woman’s request because there was only pleasant surprise in his heart right now!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, alright, alright! So long as you’re willing to help me and guarantee not to spread news of this, then I’ll agree to any request of yours!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha! I was right! You really are Bai Xiaofei!” The young woman exclaimed once more with surprise, and it turned out that she was just probing him earlier….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei wished for nothing more than to give himself a fierce slap. </span><i><span style>I was wise at all times, but why did I do such a foolish thing!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Err…. Fellow Student, you said you would help me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, don’t worry. Boss Bai &nbsp;even risked your own life to come in here, and I’ve received your care as well no matter how you look at it. So, I have to help you with this little task.” The young woman chuckled while revealing an expression that Bai Xiaofei usually saw on Qi Wei.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’m finished, the prying soul of this girl has been lit!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>But, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t care about all this now, and he only hoped that this girl would keep to her word and help him with this ‘small task’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Bai, wait here. I’ll go bring Big Sister Xian’er here for you! The young woman smiled as if she’d found the most amusing thing in the world, and she skipped along back towards the dormitory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei heaved a long sigh of relief while he waited with a perturbed feeling in his heart. He kept having the feeling that this young woman wasn’t so simple, and he would probably have to experience some sort of terrifying thing in a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he thought like this, Bai Xiaofei had already started to anticipate various situations because preparedness averts peril!</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, just as Bai Xiaofei had imagined, after the young woman returned to the dormitory, she really didn’t look for Hu Xian’er at the first possible moment, and she ran back to her own dorm room with extreme excitement instead before exaggerating about the matter of Bai Xiaofei being downstairs to everyone within her dorm room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, everyone in the room were lit up by the prying flames of the young woman, and then all of them charged out excitedly to spread the news to all their other friends….</span></p>
 <p><span style>How enormous was the network of relationships possessed by women? Thus, in less than 10 minutes, various versions of ‘Bai Xiaofei chasing after Hu Xian’er without letting up’ became a matter than was known to all within this entire building.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the young woman could be considered to have completed her mission because Hu Xian’er received this news as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a trace of bewilderment in her heart, Hu Xian’er wore he clothes with slight hesitation before walking down the dorm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, at this moment, Bai Xiaofei felt his head was on the verge of exploding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’d indeed anticipated numerous situations, but this situation was really not within his expectations! An entire 100 plus chattering female students had encircled him like they were visiting the zoo while various questions emerged endlessly, causing Bai Xiaofei to not dare make a single sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he were to make a sound now, then he would be courting death!!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>God damn it! The words of a woman really can’t be trusted! Especially when she says she’ll absolutely not spread news of something!!!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Bai, you just spoke with me earlier, but it’s troublesome for me if you don’t speak now!” The young woman that he spoke to earlier moved over to stand before him, and her face carried a trace of anxiety because if Bai Xiaofei didn’t speak, then it would seem like she was spreading a rumor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Bai Xiaofei still didn’t make any reaction.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>You f*cker! You f*cking trapped me like this and you expect me to answer you?!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s best if you’re abandoned by everyone!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, Bai Xiaofei had thought of the matter in a way that was too simple. The methods of torture that a young woman possessed was much more than a man. Not to mention Bai Xiaofei was in her territory now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aunty is just outside, so if we don’t cover for you, then do you think she’ll be able to see through your disguise if she’s standing right in front of you?” A single sentence caused Bai Xiaofei to instantly concede….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want me to say!?” Bai Xiaofei practically gnashed his teeth as he spoke, whereas, just a simple sentence like this caused an explosive reaction in the surrounding girls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow! It really spoke!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Based on the voice, it really is like that Bai Xiaofei!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow! How romantic! He actually pursued her all the way to the female dormitory!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Various voices sounded out in a clamorous wave while Bai Xiaofei even had the heart to kill himself now. There was no need for him to think about it because he would absolutely become famous by tomorrow morning….</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, right when Bai Xiaofei was in despair, Hu Xian’er walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he looked at the slim and graceful Hu Xian’er, Bai Xiaofei suddenly had a feeling of relief, and he forgot all adverse impacts this would cause as he directly removed Blackie’s simulation….</span></p>
