 <p>Chapter 749: Cooperation!</p> 
 <p>“You bet right, Brother Bai, we indeed supply Blood Diamonds, and we currently have a batch of good Blood Diamonds in store,” Old Song lowered his voice and said what Bai Xiaofei wanted to hear.</p> 
 <p>The fish had taken the bait!</p> 
 <p>“A batch? Not enough.” Bai Xiaofei frowned. What he wanted was not Blood Diamonds, but a clue that could lead to the origin of Blood Diamonds!</p> 
 <p>“Of course there won’t be only one batch. It’s just a stepping stone for us to start our business. Once you have enough power and credibility, we can begin a fruitful cooperation. The area of Starnet Academy is a free zone with only a few small countries that don’t have the strength to cooperate with us at all. Therefore, trading of Blood Diamonds here has not yet been fully exploited, and what we lack is a powerful partner like you.”</p> 
 <p>Old Song said it earnestly, but what he thought was another thing. The mission given to him was to take root in this area and monitor the movement of Starnet. Making money was only secondary. However, where would he get the capital to eat and play if he didn’t make any money?</p> 
 <p>“You don’t have to worry about our strength. I just fear that you can’t provide us with enough goods. Moreover, the goal of our merchant group is not just this area. We also have branches in Ethereal, Violethorn, and several other kingdoms and dukedoms,” Bai Xiaofei paused as his eyes grew sharp. “Are you capable of this level of cooperation?”</p> 
 <p>Old Song gulped with difficulty. If what Bai Xiaofei said was true, then he had hit the jackpot this time!</p> 
 <p>“Illusion Demon Merchant Group? The one that suddenly became famous recently?” asked Liu Heng in surprise as he suddenly remembered something.</p> 
 <p>“You know Brother Bai’s merchant group?” Old Song turned to look at Liu Heng.</p> 
 <p>“If it’s that Illusion Demon group that I heard of, then Brother Bai did not exaggerate. It had been operating quietly, and when it came out, its branches already appeared in half of the northern border area and occupied a big market.” Liu Heng nodded and looked at Bai Xiaofei, waiting for his confirmation.</p> 
 <p>“There is only one Illusion Demon,” Bai Xiaofei confirmed.</p> 
 <p>With that, Old Song and Liu Heng completely put down their guard. <em>As long as he’s not from Starnet!</em></p> 
 <p>“Brother, the batch in our hands can be given to you at any time, but if you want to take our cooperation to the next level, we need to report to the higher-ups first. It will take some time, but please rest assured that we will do our best!” promised Old Song urgently as if he feared their god of wealth would run away. After all, he and Liu Heng weren’t the only ones in charge of opening up the Blood Diamond market.</p> 
 <p>“It’s fine, I have plenty of time. I brought my whole family out on this trip for a vacation, doing business is only one of the goals.” Bai Xiaofei dispelled Old Song’s concern with a smile before continuing, “But there is one thing I have to tell you. If you’re familiar with the methods of our group – we have to know who we are working with. If possible, I need to meet your boss, at least someone at the rank of branch president.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei began to gradually lead to his ultimate goal. Although he was very careful, the expressions of Old Song and Liu Heng still changed.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai, is this really necessary?” asked Old Song hesitantly.</p> 
 <p>“Our group has started to see suppression from the eight major merchant groups. Not long ago, we were even schemed against by the Amethyst Merchant House. Do you think it is necessary or not?” Bai Xiaofei refused to budge, rendering Old Song speechless.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, we will report it to our higher-ups, but as I’ve said, it will take time,” Old Song gave himself some leeway. Bai Xiaofei wanted to investigate them, and they also needed time to check up on him.</p> 
 <p>“We will be staying at the Fragrant House for about a month. I wish for our desired cooperation.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei extended his hand and Old Song hurriedly shook it.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, Brother Bai. The two of us will do our best!”</p> 
 <p>“I await good news from you.”</p> 
 <p>With that, Bai Xiaofei’s group left the teahouse and headed back to the Fragrant House.</p> 
 <p>“Wang Hang, bring one million gold coins to the Babel Merchant House casino and ask the manager earlier to do something for us.” Bai Xiaofei then whispered something in Wang Hang’s ear.</p> 
 <p>Wang Hang nodded seriously before disappearing in a flash.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, is there anything for me to do?” asked Wu Chi, his face full of excitement.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei glared at him. “Know your place. I will let you know when I have any need for you. Don’t forget who you are now.” His voice was icy as he quickly glanced sideways.</p> 
 <p>“Wu Chi knows my mistakes. Please don’t be angry, boss!” Although Wu Chi was a bit slow, he was not so stupid as to miss Bai Xiaofei’s warning.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei snorted before resuming his pace. From the moment they stepped into Starflame City, their motto was ‘act with caution.’</p> 
 <p>Arriving at the Fragrant House, the duo saw Ming One and Ming Two waiting at the door and were led to the third floor of the inn.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, we have booked the whole floor. We will take turns to keep guard 24 hours a day. Not even a fly will be able to pass us!” reported Shi Kui who was standing guard at the entrance to the third floor.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei nodded with satisfaction. “Good job,” he said lightly, completely immersed in the role of a boss.</p> 
 <p>Then, Wu Chi stayed outside while Bai Xiaofei was guided to his room by the Ming brothers. Before long, Fang Ye also arrived.</p> 
 <p>“How’s your investigation?” Bai Xiaofei asked.</p> 
 <p>“We checked all the places that can be visited. There’s only one suspicious group of sixty to seventy people. We saw eight puppet masters among them, all under Grandmaster Rank. They’ve booked an entire small inn. It’s heavily guarded, impossible to get close.”</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye’s reliability was not just all talk. He had basically figured out the situation in Starflame City.</p> 
 <p>“Looks like we were right to be careful. I have also come into contact with the target. If I’m right, their mission should be the same as what we expected.” Bai Xiaofei smiled and sank into contemplation.</p> 
 <p><em>Now, how should I educate those fellows?</em></p>
