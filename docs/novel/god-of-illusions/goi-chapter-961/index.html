 <p>Chapter 961: Push the Boat along the Current!</p> 
 <p>“Are you Fickle Bai?”</p> 
 <p>As soon as the door was opened, a burly man with a bare upper body came up enthusiastically and greeted Bai Xiaofei, obviously looking forward to seeing him.</p> 
 <p>“Er… I am…” subconsciously replied a startled Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Fickle Bai! He is Fickle Bai!!” shouted the man who was ecstatic to hear the answer, igniting the rest of the people inside the warehouse.</p> 
 <p>Only at that time did Bai Xiaofei notice that the big warehouse was full of muscular men!</p> 
 <p>Imagining over four hundred big men crowding a room… And not only so, but they all also rushed toward Bai Xiaofei with great anticipation.</p> 
 <p>“Brother, are you really Fickle Bai?”</p> 
 <p>“Oh, please don’t lie to us!”</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>The men chirped one after another like fans meeting their idol. Facing their enthusiasm, Bai Xiaofei didn’t feel proud at all and instead got goosebumps all over his body.</p> 
 <p>“I am him. However, I don’t think we know each other…” He gulped.</p> 
 <p>Getting his confirmation, the crowd of men all laughed wildly in utter joy. Then, the most muscular among them stood up, and the rest automatically moved to make space around him. Obviously, this man had established his status before Bai Xiaofei arrived.</p> 
 <p>“Brother, we’ve been waiting for you. I’ll give you ten seconds to prepare so you can’t complain that we bullied you,” said the man as he cracked the knuckles of his hands that were as big as a small pot.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei finally figured out what was going on. Without surprise, this group was gathered by Ye Tong to teach him a lesson.</p> 
 <p>“What did Ye Tong promise you?” asked Bai Xiaofei nonchalantly.</p> 
 <p>“So you already know! That makes this much easier. Her Royal Highness Ye Tong said that whoever can beat you up will be able to move out from this birdsh*t of a place to the best area – the Southern District, and have the best food. So don’t blame us, brother, it’s nothing personal,” said the leader after a slight surprise. He had thought that Bai Xiaofei would turn around and run.</p> 
 <p>“Never mind being a servant, but you’re actually willing to be a lapdog? You can’t care less about your dignity anymore, huh?” Bai Xiaofei snorted as his attitude took a 180-degree turn.</p> 
 <p>The leader paused, but he wasn’t angry. He only stared at Bai Xiaofei with a confused frown. Meanwhile, the rest of the room already started cursing and some started charging at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“My brothers, come on! Our opportunity is right here!” one man shouted.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, the leader backed up a step and swung his arm, motioning them to go.</p> 
 <p>This action drew a slight curve from Bai Xiaofei’s lips. <em>No wonder he could become their temporary leader so quickly. This one is a good seed!</em></p> 
 <p>Despite all the thoughts going through his head, Bai Xiaofei’s movements weren’t slow at all. In any case, the first thing he needed to do was to beat them until they yielded!</p> 
 <p>“You can handle ten, right?” Bai Xiaofei threw Zhu Chunyang a question as he rushed out.</p> 
 <p>“What do you mean, ten?” asked a confused Zhu Chunyang as he also rushed at the crowd of muscular men from another direction.</p> 
 <p>“Leave the rest to me!” By the time Bai Xiaofei finished saying this, he had collided with the man at the very front.</p> 
 <p>What happened next was a scene of extreme disparity: the smaller Bai Xiaofei erupted and sent the man flying, who smashed into a large number of people behind in his flight. Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei kept shooting forward into the crowd without slowing at all!</p> 
 <p>The dull sounds of flesh being smacked rang out nonstop as muscular men were sent flying one after another. They gradually began to back down in fear. However, Bai Xiaofei showed no intention to stop until the whole house was knocked down, which was nearly an hour after. He was like a perpetual motion machine, leaving every single one of the over four hundred muscular men lying weak on the ground, wincing and groaning in pain.</p> 
 <p>“Can you scream later? I have something for you to do.” Bai Xiaofei squatted in front of the leader and squinted at him with a smile.</p> 
 <p>“You… What do you want?!” the man’s voice trembled in terror. He inwardly regretted agreeing to Ye Tong’s condition.</p> 
 <p>“We need to gather in the central area in 20 minutes, so I’ll give you five minutes to organize all these people and help them get up. Will that be a problem?” Bai Xiaofei slowly stressed the last question.</p> 
 <p>This was obviously not a request. The man nodded his head repeatedly like a chicken pecking rice.</p> 
 <p>Having done with this, Bai Xiaofei walked to Zhu Chunyang, who was panting heavily.</p> 
 <p>“Not bad at all,” he complimented upon seeing how many men Zhu Chunyang had taken down.</p> 
 <p>“I’d like to be lazy, but they kept coming at me after realizing that they couldn’t handle you. If I didn’t have some talent at this, I’d probably be lying on the ground like them now,” Zhu Chunyang grumbled, but his eyes shone. “So what are you going to do with this group of people? Seeing how hard you beat them up, you must have some other reason, right?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was pleased to hear this. It seemed Zhu Chunyang still had some insight after all.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t forget our purpose. Do you think we can handle the border affairs just by ourselves?”</p> 
 <p>This immediately had Zhu Chunyang exclaim in realization. When he looked over at the group of muscular men again, his eyes had completely changed. <em>They will make qualified soldiers!</em></p> 
 <p>“Boss, everyone is up!” said the muscular leader.</p> 
 <p>Within five minutes, all the men had assembled. Although not in formation, at least their reaction speed was laudable.</p> 
 <p>“So, gentlemen, did it hurt?” asked Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The group of men was terrified. <em>What do you mean by this? Have you not finished with us yet?!</em></p>
