 <p>Chapter 642: What a Grand Scheme! What a Great Play!</p> 
 <p>“So, the tears I saw from your people just now were real, and the sorrow was not because their revenge was taken, but because of those two’s self-sacrifice, was it?” Bai Xiaofei asked with his eyes glaring.</p> 
 <p>An Bang Ting gave him an affirmative nod.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei reluctantly shook his head and smiled wryly. No wonder he couldn’t see anything out of place, because the grief was real. He just didn’t know who they were grieving for.</p> 
 <p>“Go on, let me see how far you guys have gone to achieve your goal!” The confusion in Bai Xiaofei’s eyes was replaced by resolution as he gritted his teeth. However, he couldn’t feel much anger.</p> 
 <p>He had lost this game and he had lost thoroughly. There was nothing to whine about…</p> 
 <p>“The Downwind Boat is not mine. Lin Rui and Lin Xiu brought it back from their travels. When they had just returned, they happened to see you entering Tranquil territory. After some investigation and finding out that you were going to the Kingdom of Snow, they rushed back without sleeping, knowing that you would definitely pass through Tranquil City to reach the Kingdom of Snow.”</p> 
 <p>As the scheme behind their encounter was revealed by An Bang Ting, the whole story began to become clear.</p> 
 <p>“They just wanted me to take this opportunity to keep and befriend you, but when they knew about Consort Rui, they came up with a bold idea.” The pain of An Bang Ting’s face deepened. There was no pride, because this victory was so tragic that he would rather it had never happened.</p> 
 <p>“So, that Blood Pill thing is real and effective?” Bai Xiaofei instantly understood that look of agony. A sharp glint flashed in his eyes.</p> 
 <p>“Yes,” uttered An Bang Ting, earning nothing but fury from Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Its refining method is also true?! To use such an inhuman thing to save people, you really think you are saving your Consort Rui?” Bai Xiaofei almost used up all his strength to shout.</p> 
 <p>An Bang Ting’s response was beyond his expectation. He didn’t justify himself, but covered his face and wept bitterly.</p> 
 <p>“When I first heard their proposal, I had the same reaction. Not to mention how immoral that pill is, your identity alone is enough to get us all into trouble. I might even put the whole Tranquil Kingdom at risk by offending Starnet.” An Bang Ting took a deep breath. “However, after I refused, they came to me with a refined Blood Pill seven days later.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was stunned. An Bang Ting didn’t need to lie at this point. Therefore, the refining of the Blood Pill might have really not been his intention.</p> 
 <p>“Master Lin Rui and Lin Xiu hid from His Majesty when they spread the news that the Blood Pill could cure Consort Rui with the requirements to refine it. That night, those who met the conditions signed up and they gathered enough people,” A’Tao explained as he went into a daze. “My sister was one of them.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei once again revealed a bitter, helpless smile. He never thought that a person’s prestige could be as great as this. From A’Tao’s tone, those who volunteered didn’t seem to be heading for death but were sacrificing for something glorious.</p> 
 <p>Seeing how emotional An Bang Ting was, it actually seemed he was worthy of this.</p> 
 <p>“The Blood Pill was refined, and she did react after eating it. The disease was then under control. However, a powerful person’s blood energy is needed to fully exert the pill’s effect. I wavered, because the hardest step for me was already completed. So, I decided to gamble!”</p> 
 <p>An Bang Ting grew resolute.</p> 
 <p>“I prepared following Lin Rui’s and Lin Xiu’s plan step by step, from Doyle City’s discussion on Tranquil City’s coordination and intercepting Grandmaster Rank puppet masters, so that when you came here, everything looked real, because we know it is extremely difficult to deceive you. And our plan proved to work. Even with so many smoke bombs distracting you and next to zero flaws, you still forced me to take you to see Consort Rui. For this, we truly admire you.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t know what expression he should make to this compliment. It only sounded ironic in his ears.</p> 
 <p>“There’s still something I don’t understand. Even if your prestige is very high, even if your people can understand you, you really think you’re doing the right thing by going through so much trouble for a woman, by putting your whole country at risk?!” asked Bai Xiaofei. However, his question failed to faze An Bang Ting.</p> 
 <p>“You regard me too highly. You think everyone is doing this for me? No, it is Consort Rui that they are so willing to sacrifice for,” An Bang Ting said slowly, shocking Bai Xiaofei again.</p> 
 <p><em>How does this concern her now?!</em></p> 
 <p>“You should still remember about that battle to defend the imperial city that Yue’er mentioned in his speech. In fact, he omitted a part of it. At that time, the citizen’s sacrifices only let us last for a while. In the last few days, we were able to hold thanks to a group of people. An Exquisite Rank, three Grandmasters, four Masters. The eight of them self-exploded, one by one, to defend the city. One of them was Consort Rui’s father and the other seven were her brothers!”</p> 
 <p>Upon finishing, An Bang Ting looked at Bai Xiaofei. At this point, there was no need for him to say more.</p> 
 <p>Tranquil could exist instead of becoming history thanks to Consort Rui’s family, and now the people were just returning their lives to her… The country never forgot the sacrifices one made for it. When one needed, the whole country would sing and sacrifice for one.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei now completely understood everything. Just like before, he couldn’t bring himself to feel any hatred. There was nothing to resent about this group of pitiful people. Everyone who had a part in this hadn’t done anything wrong, or at least in Bai Xiaofei’s view, they were right.</p> 
 <p>He actually even admired these people who were willing to sacrifice for love and righteousness. In order to lure him into this big net, Tranquil made such a great sacrifice that he took this loss sincerely convinced.</p> 
 <p><em>What a grand scheme! What a great play!!!</em></p> 
 <p>“If I can guarantee that the three of them will not disclose what happened here, will you let them go?” Looking at An Bang Ting, Bai Xiaofei asked his last question.</p>
