 <p>Chapter 610: I’ll Help!</p> 
 <p>“You all step out.”</p> 
 <p>After draining the first glass of wine with Bai Xiaofei, the emperor seemed to be in a good mood as he dismissed his attendants, keeping only three people.</p> 
 <p>These three people carried the same Grandmaster Rank badge as Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The emperor got up and went to sit down on the main seat. The three Grandmaster puppet masters settled on the three small tables opposite Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“I heard that my royal guard leader – Commander Tie – has offended you, Little Brother. I’ve already let him retire to his hometown, I hope this calms your anger.” The first thing the emperor said after sitting down once again shocked Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The pace was too fast, he couldn’t keep up. <em>An important position like the royal guard commander and you just fired him like that?!</em></p> 
 <p>The emperor raised his glass to Bai Xiaofei again.</p> 
 <p>“This one is my apology to Little Brother. I will issue a royal order tomorrow to make sure that a similar situation will never occur again in the future. You will have complete rights to enter and exit anywhere in this Tranquil City,” the emperor spoke lightly as if this was something to be taken for granted.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you for your kindness, Your Majesty. But we are just passing by and have no intention to stay here for a long time. When we finish our work and return, we will definitely repay your kindness!” Bai Xiaofei cupped his hands as the gears in his brain rapidly turned, trying to redefine this unpredictable emperor.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, Bai Xiaofei had never been exposed to a similar character, not even in the Gorge of Heroes that was filled with weirdos.</p> 
 <p>“My friend, don’t be in a hurry to say such a thing. You must have a purpose for your trip, yes? It’ll work out well long as His Majesty can help you achieve it, right? Even if it’s not within his capability, His Majesty has a Downwind Boat, which travels much faster than Blackscale Horses,” said a mustached Grandmaster Rank right after Bai Xiaofei finished speaking, obviously trying to help the emperor retain him. This person didn’t look like a native of Tranquil.</p> 
 <p>“And this gentleman is…?” Bai Xiaofei turned to the mustached man. For some reason, he found the guy not very pleasing to the eye.</p> 
 <p>“Liu Rufeng, an Honorable Guest Member of the Violetgold Merchant House of the Violethorn Empire,” announced the mustached man proudly.</p> 
 <p>But after hearing this introduction, Bai Xiaofei frowned. <em>When does the Amethyst Merchant House need the suffix of Violethorn Empire? Is the Violethorn Empire standing behind the Amethyst Merchant House?</em></p> 
 <p>“He is talking about the Violetgold Merchant House. The Violetgold Merchant House is a business supported by the Violethorn Empire and has nothing to do with the Amethyst Merchant House<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>,” Leng Liuli explained upon noticing Bai Xiaofei’s confusion.</p> 
 <p>“Oh, so it’s a friend from the Violethorn Empire. I have quite a good relationship with Marquis Cloudrise. Maybe we can have a get-together in the imperial capital in the future.” Bai Xiaofei smiled.</p> 
 <p>Liu Rufeng’s mouth twitched. Marquis Cloudrise was a super noble in the imperial city, not someone a small honorable guest member like him could compare!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s boast about having a good relationship with Marquis Cloudrise was not completely fake, because this marquis was Qin Sheng, Qin Lingyan’s father…</p> 
 <p>“Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. This little one is Bai Xiaofei, a second-year student of Starnet Academy.” Cupping his hands to everyone, Bai Xiaofei ‘inadvertently’ flashed the Starnet Brilliance on his chest to the three puppet masters. It was an excellent prop to scare people no matter where.</p> 
 <p>“Ahem, no wonder Brother Bai is so handsome and refined, so you are a talent of Starnet. I have been rude!” Seeing that Liu Rufeng didn’t know what to say, the emperor quickly saved the conversation and raised his glass again.</p> 
 <p>Wine was truly useful stuff. When the conversation got stuck, you could just change the subject abruptly with it.</p> 
 <p>“Look at me and my forgetfulness. I’ve had three drinks, but still haven’t remembered to introduce myself to Brother Bai. How muddle-headed.” The emperor patted his own head in an unrestrained manner, which was in sharp contrast to his aged and experienced appearance.</p> 
 <p>“An Bang Ting. If Brother Bai doesn’t dislike me, just call me Big Brother An.”</p> 
 <p>At An Bang Ting’s words, not only Bai Xiaofei, but the three Grandmaster Ranks were also stunned. They had never experienced this kind of brother-commensurate treatment from the emperor.</p> 
 <p>However, that was not what Bai Xiaofei was surprised about. What bothered him was that he still couldn’t figure out what this emperor was up to.</p> 
 <p>With just a word, the guy had his long-time old eunuch<span id="fnre2"><a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a></span> executed and fired his royal guard commander. After a few drinks, he was now acquainting himself as a brother. Bai Xiaofei refused to believe that this guy wasn’t scheming something.</p> 
 <p>“Calling you Big Brother An is not a problem, but Your Majesty should first tell me what you especially called me here for, right? Or else I really can’t be reckless with addressing you.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei finally found an opening to coerce An Bang Ting. Since he had already phrased it like this, it was impossible for the emperor not to answer.</p> 
 <p>“Ahhh, it’s actually nothing big.”</p> 
 <p>An Bang Ting started with a long sigh.</p> 
 <p>“Because of a hidden illness, my body is becoming worse and worse every day, so I need to single out a qualified heir from my four adult sons. However, their mindsets haven’t matured, therefore I want to find a suitable teacher for each of them. Whoever makes the greatest progress at the end will inherit the throne.”</p> 
 <p>An Bang Ting smiled wryly.</p> 
 <p>“Although it sounds ridiculous, this is the best method I can think of. Let’s just say I’d try anything in desperation. But the problem is, there are no outstanding puppet masters in my small country, so I can only place my hope on those passing by Tranquil City. If I don’t keep you, Brother Bai, I’m afraid I won’t make it to the next Grandmaster Rank puppet master.”</p> 
 <p>An Bang Ting suddenly coughed. That mouthful of blood flew quite far.</p> 
 <p>The hall maids hurriedly rushed up. Cleaning up, wiping, caring… all kinds of skilled techniques showed that this wasn’t the first time they had dealt with this situation.</p> 
 <p>After hearing An Bang Ting’s explanation, Bai Xiaofei frowned deeply. This reason wasn’t too flawed, but as An Bang Ting had said himself, the method was a bit ridiculous.</p> 
 <p>But just like how he had pressed An Bang Ting just now, An Bang Ting’s response put the same pressure on him to answer.</p> 
 <p>“How long does Your Majesty need us to guide the princes?” asked Bai Xiaofei softly as he sighed in his heart. Since the guy already vomited blood, it was difficult to say no directly.</p> 
 <p>“One month, the physician said that I can hold on for at most one month. After one month, I will have to choose my successor. When that time comes, I will give you my Downwind Boat and will not delay your journey further!” Seeing Bai Xiaofei loosen up, An Bang Ting immediately caught onto this lifeline. His excitement didn’t seem fake at all.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei fell into a long silence.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, I’ll help Big Brother An with this!”</p>
