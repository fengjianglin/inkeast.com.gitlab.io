 <p>Chapter 874: Continual Shocks!</p> 
 <p>Urged on by Yun Tianhe, two soon arrived at the Yun residence, the domineering degree of which far exceeded Pinocchio’s small palace. Just the terrific wall length put it on par with the imperial palace of a small kingdom.</p> 
 <p>“Bro, your house is a little big…” Bai Xiaofei gulped.</p> 
 <p>“No time for jokes, my brother. My mother will kill me if she doesn’t see you now.” Yun Tianhe seemed like he might break into tears at any moment and Bai Xiaofei was his last lifeline.</p> 
 <p>Rushing through the residence, the duo arrived at a secluded building.</p> 
 <p>“This is it, Brother. I won’t go in with you, I have something to do!” Dishing out an excuse, Yun Tianhe ran off, leaving Bai Xiaofei dumbfounded.</p> 
 <p><em>What the heck?! You ran?!! What about me??!</em></p> 
 <p>“Come in, or are you going to just stand out there?”</p> 
 <p>A mature female voice rang out from the building as Bai Xiaofei stood frozen in conflict. He hurriedly fixed his expression. The person he was going to see might be his father’s old ‘friend!’</p> 
 <p>Walking to the door, Bai Xiaofei gently pushed it open with a pounding heart.</p> 
 <p>In the room sat a typical noble lady, her eyes intently fixed on him as if trying to dig out information from his appearance.</p> 
 <p>“Hello aun… aunty…” the normally articulate Bai Xiaofei stuttered under the woman’s stare. For some reason, he was panicking just by looking at her.</p> 
 <p>“Close the door and sit down,” said Lan Qiushuang lightly.</p> 
 <p>Like a robot, Bai Xiaofei carried out her orders. Now he knew why Yun Tianhe was so afraid of his own mother. Her aura alone could frighten people to death!</p> 
 <p>“To be honest, I really don’t see any resemblance between you and him.”</p> 
 <p>That was her first sentence as soon as Bai Xiaofei seated himself.</p> 
 <p>The ‘he’ must be his father, but he had never even seen his father before except from the image left in the Gorge of Heroes. How was he supposed to know about his resemblance or whatever?</p> 
 <p>“No need to wonder why I know your identity. Not long after you arrived here, I received a letter from Vice Principal Luo. She told me everything that could be said. To be able to make that woman take the initiative to contact me, it seems there is still something special about you,” Lan Qiushuang answered the doubt that Bai Xiaofei did not voice. Despite her praise, her ice-cold expression did not change at all, and there was even a hint of disappointment in it.</p> 
 <p>“Can I call you Aunt Lan?” After her continuous ‘attacks,’ Bai Xiaofei tried to regain his wits, especially at the mention of Luo Xi. Since Luo Xi had gone to such lengths to help him, he could not let her down!</p> 
 <p>“Considering our relationship, you should address me as such,” replied Lan Qiushuang.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was dumbstruck. <em>Our relationship?! What does that even mean?!</em></p> 
 <p>“How much do you know about your father? Tell me everything, including how he was killed,” Lan Qiushuang ignored Bai Xiaofei as she followed with a question. This time, her voice trembled, and Bai Xiaofei could hear the murderous intent in the last sentence!</p> 
 <p><em>Okay, what’s going on here?! She… has feelings for my father?! Still?!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Actually, I am not very clear about my father’s affairs, because I have never met him. When I was a baby, he was seriously injured and sent me to the Gorge of Heroes before he passed away. According to my foster parents, he was being chased and attacked. As for who was chasing him, they don’t know.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s answer put disappointment on Lan Qiushuang’s face. Her red eyes became watery, but she resisted tears.</p> 
 <p>After a long silence, she adjusted her mood and looked at Bai Xiaofei again with the same composed expression from before.</p> 
 <p>“I know you have come with questions. Ask away, I will tell you everything I know. However, you must find out everything about your father and tell me the whole story!” said Lan Qiushuang solemnly. The underlying fury in her tone made his heart tighten.</p> 
 <p><em>Oh wow, she really takes that old pop of mine seriously!</em></p> 
 <p>“Thank you, Aunt Lan, I will go ahead then.” Bai Xiaofei mentally sorted out all the questions he had about his father and looked at Lan Qiushuang. “Aunt Lan, before coming to Ethereal, my father disappeared for five years. Do you know where he went in those five years?”</p> 
 <p>This question drew a long sigh from Lan Qiushuang. Her eyes glazed over as she sank into her memories.</p> 
 <p>“When Longfei graduated from Starnet, his unique character and terrifying talent made him the most dazzling existence among all the graduates. During everyone’s expectations that he would make great achievements and his name would resound across the continent, he actually disappeared. No one knew why. When he reappeared in Ethereal, I asked.”</p> 
 <p>“For the sake of a woman, he lived incognito for five years, making no progress as he only lived the simplest life with her. Only after that woman left without saying goodbye did your father come to Ethereal.”</p> 
 <p>“His stubbornness provoked my father, and from that conflict, I got to know him and was deeply attracted to him. Behind my father’s back, I provided him the help he needed. Three years later, his puppet master ability advanced by leaps and bounds and he steadily entered the Exquisite Rank, even decorating himself with seven powerful gold-grade puppets.”</p> 
 <p>“But he is like a piece of wood. My three years of hard work did not even earn me a place in his heart. Every time I talked to him, the only thing I ever heard from his mouth was that woman. Moreover, Ethereal no longer had anything to help him with after he became an Exquisite Rank puppet master, so he decided to leave.”</p> 
 <p>“Before he left, I prepared a banquet for him, where I schemed against him and got pregnant with his child. Although he was not aware of it, it was enough for me.”</p> 
 <p>“My father later learned about this and cut off all my ways to get information from the outside, especially about your father. The last bit I got was that he went to the Moonlight Empire to train his spirit.”</p> 
 <p>“After that, I married into the Yun family to strengthen the relationship between the two clans, and this is now the Mrs. Yun you’re seeing.”</p> 
 <p>The story was not long, but the amount of information in it nearly made Bai Xiaofei’s brain crash and burn.</p> 
 <p>“Wait… Aunt Lan, you just said that when my father left, you…” At a loss for words, he swallowed with difficulty. After all, this particular matter was quite shocking.</p> 
 <p>“That’s right, and I didn’t abort that child. Therefore, if you are really the child of Longfei and that woman, then Tianhe is your half-brother. Apart from my father and me, you are the only one who knows this matter.”</p> 
 <p>Lan Qiushuang was calm. For some reason, she decided not to hide any information from Bai Xiaofei, while in fact, she could have avoided mentioning a sensitive matter such as this.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei could no longer maintain his calm. For a long time, he thought he was an only child, and everyone in the Gorge of Heroes was all the family he had. However, he still had an older brother!</p> 
 <p>Surprise, horror, delight… Bai Xiaofei couldn’t even describe his mood at the moment, but his bright eyes already told Lan Qiushuang everything. It was this that put a slight smile on her ever-icy face.</p> 
 <p>“I hope that you can keep this matter from Tianhe. His position in the capital is already very sensitive and can’t withstand any storms,” she said.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately nodded his head. “I understand! I will never make trouble for him, I promise!”</p> 
 <p>He still hadn’t recovered from the surprise. He didn’t know how to cherish Yun Tianhe, a sudden family member. Moreover, he now looked at Lan Qiushuang in a different light.</p> 
 <p><em>She’s not an aunt, but my side-mother! No wonder she made a fuss in the Yun family after the news of my death came out and even lost her temper with Yun Tianhe. She was caring for me!</em></p> 
 <p>Thinking to this point, Bai Xiaofei already didn’t know how to express his feelings. Although his foster parents in the Gorge of Heroes took care of him in every possible way, that kind of affection was still different from this, which was only something he could dream of once upon a time. He never thought that he could have it one day.</p> 
 <p>“Looking at your current state, I really can’t believe your promise,” Lan Qiushuang shook her head.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately made a serious face. He must not let his side-mother look down on him!</p> 
 <p>“Side-mom, you can rest assured. I, Bai Xiaofei, guarantee with my entire integrity that there will never be any problems!” Bai Xiaofei vowed.</p> 
 <p>This time, Lan Qiushuang didn’t embarrass him again. “I heard that you and Lin Nishang’s daughter are very close?” She suddenly changed the topic.</p> 
 <p>Stunned, Bai Xiaofei’s mind flashed countless thoughts.</p> 
 <p><em>Is this the so-called ‘paternalistic concern?’</em></p> 
 <p>Hesitantly, Bai Xiaofei nodded. The next sentence he heard made his mind go blank.</p> 
 <p>“I advise you to keep a good distance from her. In the five years Longfei disappeared, the woman he was with was Lin Nishang!”</p> 
 <p>Seeing Lan Qiushuang’s clear eyes and the way she stressed every word, it was most likely not a joke…</p>
