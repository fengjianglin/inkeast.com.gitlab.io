 <p>Chapter 387: Conversation with the President of the Bright Road Merchant House!</p> 
 <p>“Master! Master! This is urgent! Starnet… they…”</p> 
 <p>In an antique study, Shang Youdao, the president of The Bright Road Merchant House, was writing calligraphy with the brush in his hand dancing when his old steward suddenly rushed in. The brush missed a stroke and the whole paper became wasted.</p> 
 <p>“Uncle Fu, you are too old to get this excited,” Shang Youdao said slowly, not at all displeased towards Uncle Fu despite that his work was ruined. If there was a person who Shang Youdao put his absolute trust in his merchant group, that would be Uncle Fu in front of him.</p> 
 <p>“Lei Shan! Starnet’s Lei Shan came!!” the bewilderment in Uncle Fu’s voice was the same, but this time, Shang Youdao’s brush fell to the table…</p> 
 <p>“Lei Shan? Thunder Emperor Lei Shan?! You are not mistaken?!” asking three questions in a row, Shang Youdao’s expression became the same as that of Uncle Fu.</p> 
 <p>“Absolutely! I saw with my own eyes, definitely not fake!” Uncle Fu swore as his face was filled with pleasant surprise. If Lei Shan was willing to act in person, their merchant group’s plan would be foolproof this time.</p> 
 <p>“Take me to him!” Shang Youdao instantly moved. What he had first said became bullshit. Who could remain calm at a time like this?</p> 
 <p>Two old men with white beards moved at an abnormal speed towards the place where Bai Xiaofei’s group was located. When they stopped, these two Master Rank puppet masters were out of breath.</p> 
 <p>“Take a break… take a break first. We can’t afford to offend the Thunder Emperor.” Shang Youdao panted heavily. As the two old men supported each other, a smile bloomed on their faces. They were about to see Lei Shan! The legendary Lei Shan!</p> 
 <p>“Since you two gentlemen are here, come in.”</p> 
 <p>Before the two could calm their breathing, a deep and vigorous voice rang out from the room. Their faces instantly grew tense and they hurriedly calmed their emotions. Shang Youdao took a deep breath before raising his hand. Performing an informing knock on the door, he suddenly felt like he was facing a huge test in his life.</p> 
 <p>Then, the two men gently pushed the door open and bypassed the small hall. When they saw the person inside, their anxiety was put to rest.</p> 
 <p><em>It’s really Lei Shan!</em></p> 
 <p>“This humble one is Shang Youdao. Please forgive me for not knowing of your coming to welcome you sooner!” Shang Youdao was about to salute as he said this, but before he did, Bai Xiaofei’s words shocked him.</p> 
 <p>“The old man didn’t come, there is nothing to forgive. On the contrary, please forgive this little brat for tricking you, President Shang.”</p> 
 <p>Under the stunned gaze of Shang Youdao, Bai Xiaofei’s original appearance was restored and Huskie jumped down from his arms.</p> 
 <p>“Let me formally introduce myself. I am Bai Xiaofei, a puppet master of the Illusion Stream. My main puppet is capable of Mimicry. I know my actions are offensive, but it can’t be helped.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei stood up, cupped his fists and bowed to Shang Youdao. His attitude was very sincere.</p> 
 <p>“It’s me who expected too much, but since it’s come to this, you must have something to tell me after expending such an effort to lure me here, little friend.”</p> 
 <p>After helpless self-mockery, Shang Youdao returned to his immovable, nonchalant state of mind and sat down on the chair that Chu Yue moved over for him, then started to observe Bai Xiaofei. And it gave him a fright as he looked carefully.</p> 
 <p>The Starnet Brilliance on Bai Xiaofei’s chest created a ripple in Shang Youdao’s heart.</p> 
 <p>“Starnet Brilliance?” Shang Youdao expressed his respect for this item with a light exclamation. In a sense, the Starnet Brilliance was proof that its wearer was a talent, a genius.</p> 
 <p>“It’s just a coincidence that I got it, there’s no need to be too surprised. We should get to business. After all, your time is definitely limited.” Bai Xiaofei smiled as he retained a hint of mystery while leading Shang Youdao into the main topic.</p> 
 <p>“Aiii, it seems that I’m really old now, and I can’t keep up with the rhythm of young people,” said Shang Youdao slowly with a relaxed smile. The interest that had just risen in his heart was instantly suppressed. When getting down to business, emotions became redundant, and the only thing that one needed was perfect grasp over their own thoughts and actions. In Shang Youdao’s case, this ability had been well-tempered after decades.</p> 
 <p>“President Shang, I hope that my next words will only be told to you.”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Bai Xiaofei said this, Shang Youdao creased his brows and displeasure surfaced in his eyes.</p> 
 <p>“Uncle Fu is my absolute confidant. He doesn’t need to leave.” Shang Youdao’s tone was particularly positive. From it, Bai Xiaofei could hear a sliver of resistance towards himself.</p> 
 <p>“What if what I’m about to say concerns your plan to transport tomorrow?”</p> 
 <p>These words widened Shang Youdao and Uncle Fu’s eyes. All of their dissatisfaction turned into surprise.</p> 
 <p>“President, I will wait outside,” Uncle Fu whispered to Shang Youdao. It wasn’t without a reason that this wise old man became Shang Youdao’s trusted confidant. He knew that he needed to step out at this moment instead of letting his boss struggle over this.</p> 
 <p>Shang Youdao didn’t say anything this time and let Uncle Fu leave. At the same time, Qin Lingyan and the others also withdrew at Bai Xiaofei’s signal.</p> 
 <p>“Now it’s just the two of us. What do you mean by what you just said?” Shang Youdao’s voice was firm as if he wanted to oppose Bai Xiaofei, but Bai Xiaofei used <a href="http://www.chinese-word.com/data/0093-25.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">softness to conquer toughness</a>.</p> 
 <p>“It doesn’t mean anything, only a piece of advice. Tomorrow is not a good time for delivery. You would want to think it over if that’s really your plan.”</p> 
 <p>Silence ensued. The emotions in Shang Youdao’s eyes changed again and again. He seemed to be struggling over a tough decision.</p> 
 <p>“President Shang, the Starnet Brilliance on my chest is not a fake. At the same time, I can assure you that I’m your only hope of stopping the Thunderstorm Bandits!” Bai Xiaofei’s eyes shone brightly as they fixed on Shang Youdao. His words were like a heavy hammer at Shang Youdao’s heart, urging him to make his decision.</p> 
 <p>“How do you know I scheduled the transportation for tomorrow? I didn’t even tell Uncle Fu about this.” With a low voice, Shang Youdao showed his hand.</p> 
 <p>“President Shang, are you certain that there is a spy in your merchant group, and that this person’s status isn’t low, yet you can’t find them no matter how you investigate?”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Shang Youdao’s expression changed again.</p> 
 <p>Indeed, his current situation was exactly the same as what Bai Xiaofei said. He had gone above and beyond in order to find this mole.</p> 
 <p>“What do you mean?”</p> 
 <p>When asking this question again, Shang Youdao no longer underestimated Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“What I mean is, there may be no such spy in your merchant group!”</p>
