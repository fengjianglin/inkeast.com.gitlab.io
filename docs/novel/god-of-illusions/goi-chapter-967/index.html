 <p>Chapter 967: Godly Speed Zhu Chunyang!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s smiling face instantly made Ye Tong lose her mind.No one had ever dared to provoke her like this!</p> 
 <p>“DIE, FICKLE BAI, DIE!!!” Ye Tong’s roar echoed as she shot toward Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Right at that moment, invisible ropes stopped Ye Tong before slowly materializing, resulting in a Ye Tong that was tied up like a cocoon.</p> 
 <p>“Puppet master ability?! How is this possible?!” Ye Tong’s face was full of disbelief.</p> 
 <p>She was not the only one with that expression. The charging soldiers behind her were also stunned, gawking at her in shock. <em>How can someone use puppet master abilities against Her Highness Ye Tong?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Nothing is impossible. Your ability is not everything,” mocked Bai Xiaofei with the same smile, making Ye Tong want to eat him alive before he continued, “Do you really think we scattered just to stall time and wear you out?”</p> 
 <p>Ye Tong creased her brows. Finally, she decided to ask, “Then tell me, what was it for?”</p> 
 <p>“All the traps you experienced were made by my puppet. When I saw that your sealing ability didn’t have any effect on the traps, I concluded that you can’t influence what has already been made. So, I gathered everyone and waited for you to take the bait,” Bai Xiaofei explained and summoned Mind Sunder. “You can restore elemental skills to their original state, but with Mind Sunder, I can change the elemental memory but still keep them in their elemental state, making them work for me without being affected by your sealing ability.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s explanation confused the majority of people as knowledge on the element level was not accessible to anyone. However, they all understood one thing, and that was his ability was formidable!</p> 
 <p>“Well, with that said, do you still want to continue?” He looked at the soldiers. “Just a friendly reminder, the surrounding environment has all been altered by me without a blind spot. Even if you attack me, that won’t change anything.”</p> 
 <p>Facing the confident Bai Xiaofei, the soldiers hesitated. They had gone through deadly battles and desperate situations, but this feeling of being utterly useless despite all the power they had was new to them. It was no longer a battle as they were one-sidedly arranged to fail!</p> 
 <p>“Let me go! I want to fight with you, one on one!” Ye Tong suddenly roared and became the focus of attention.</p> 
 <p>“That’s all good, but you have to agree that we have all passed the test.” Bai Xiaofei squatted in front of Ye Tong and voiced his condition.</p> 
 <p>Ye Tong didn’t have a choice at all, and she didn’t want to choose anything. Now she only had one idea in her mind – to beat up Bai Xiaofei!</p> 
 <p>“Fine! I promise! You have all passed!” she said.</p> 
 <p>The group of muscular men was instantly filled with pleasant surprise. <em>We really passed! We won a battle against official Moonlight soldiers!!</em></p> 
 <p>The pleasant surprise turned into ecstasy at this realization and everyone started cheering. This put a smile on Bai Xiaofei’s face.</p> 
 <p>“Let your people put away their weapons, or I can’t let you go,” he said to Ye Tong.</p> 
 <p>The latter motioned to the soldiers, who put away their weapons and retreated</p> 
 <p>“Reverse.” Bai Xiaofei gently waved Mind Sunder, restoring the surrounding environment to its original state. The rope binding Ye Tong also became an ordinary rope and broke.</p> 
 <p>“You’re dead meat!”</p> 
 <p>Ye Tong instantly rushed toward Bai Xiaofei with her sealing ability fully activated. The energy in his body instantly stopped circulating.</p> 
 <p>However, the men behind Bai Xiaofei silently offered her a moment of condolences. <em>Close quarter against Boss? That’s just seeking death. He alone took down over four hundred of us…</em></p> 
 <p>Sure enough, the reality wasn’t different from what they had expected. In a blink, Bai Xiaofei had lifted Ye Tong like a chicken and watched as she struggled in the air without fazing.</p> 
 <p>“Just throw in the towel, you can’t beat me,” he said with a sleazy smile.</p> 
 <p>However, at that moment, a flash of light zoomed by and snatched Ye Tong from Bai Xiaofei’s grasp. Then, Zhu Chunyang looked at him with unprecedented seriousness.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t bully Tong Tong!”</p> 
 <p>Ye Tong, who had always been extremely disgusted with Zhu Chunyang, swallowed back what she wanted to say upon seeing his serious face. For the first time, she didn’t resist his approach and even let him embrace her. Not only so, she even looked at him with pitiful, teary eyes.</p> 
 <p>Facts proved that no one was truly hard-hearted.</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t intend to bully her, she just couldn’t let me be. If you can manage her, I’ll be more than happy.” Bai Xiaofei awkwardly smiled.</p> 
 <p>Zhu Chunyang then looked down to check Ye Tong in his arms.</p> 
 <p>“Help me beat him up, and I’ll go out with you!” Ye Tong suddenly declared.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei knew it was bad. Nothing could encourage an infatuated man better than this!!</p> 
 <p>“Good! You watch!” Zhu Chunyang immediately put down Ye Tong, then said to Bai Xiaofei, “Sorry, brother!”</p> 
 <p>With that, he had charged forward at a terrifying speed that was entirely on a different level from before!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had yet to react when Zhu Chunyang punched him in the stomach, making him stagger back a few steps. Then just when he steadied himself, Zhu Chunyang’s speed climbed by another level.</p> 
 <p>“Godly Speed Second Realm!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei barely evaded this second blow, but Zhu Chunyang’s speed once again soared!</p> 
 <p>“Godly Speed Third Realm!”</p> 
 <p>“What the hell?! Even faster?!!” Bai Xiaofei gulped as he found himself barely able to keep up with Zhu Chunyang.</p> 
 <p>The sound of the two colliding with each other filled the air, and there was no one in the audience who could capture their movements.</p> 
 <p>“Godly Speed Fourth Realm!”</p> 
 <p>Once again, Zhu Chunyang increased his speed!</p>
