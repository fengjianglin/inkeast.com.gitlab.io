 <p>Chapter 1024: Dragon Saliva Fruit!</p> 
 <p>The successive deaths of the five elders were like a bolt from the blue for Barbaric Godism. Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei, still in disguise as Mamba, became their temporary supreme leader. Having the Guard Team backing him, he took full control over the clan and Qiu Muxue’s takeover was to proceed according to plan.</p> 
 <p>The night before Qiu Muxue would become the new leader of Barbaric Godism, Bai Xiaofei welcomed his last challenge in the Sacks.</p> 
 <p>“Expand the scope of defense to a three-kilometer radius and allow no one to approach! In addition, no matter what happens and what you hear, do not come to check,” Bai Xiaofei instructed the Guard Team.</p> 
 <p>The Guard Team respectfully received the order and quickly started moving. Watching them leave, Bai Xiaofei took a deep breath.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s start!”</p> 
 <p>With a smile, he walked toward the stone idol that was revered by the Sacks as a sacred object - A huge stone statue 100 meters high!</p> 
 <p>“We’ve gotten close enough. Can you make sure that this thing is what you said?” muttered Bai Xiaofei as his appearance changed back into his own.</p> 
 <p>Moments later, a burst of black smoke poured out from his body. It churned for a while before gradually condensing into the face of the Demonic God of Pain.</p> 
 <p>“How can I be wrong? I knew the moment I saw the Sacks people that they were practicing the soul-raising method of my world, and a high-grade one at that. Too bad for them, it’s only a remnant soul judging from the degree of manipulation,” said the Demonic God of Pain as he looked coldly at the stone idol. “You’re lucky that you came here early as this thing should regain consciousness soon. If we’re just a month late, we might both die here.”</p> 
 <p>Then, he scanned the area around the statue and pointed at a place.</p> 
 <p>“Those two things are what you want, aren’t they?”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei shifted his attention away from the stone idol as he also recalled Qiu Muxue’s promise – the two divine items!</p> 
 <p>Alright, I know about the Revival Grass, but what the hell is a Dragon Saliva Flower?</p> 
 <p>With excitement, he slowly approached the stone statue. However, before he could see the two items, a large patch of plants hit his vision and made him gasp.</p> 
 <p><em>Oh dear Heaven!!! These are all… Nightcharms?!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Damn, smelly boy, you’ve struck gold!” Even the Demonic God of Pain couldn’t help but exclaim.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei fully understood how formidable the toxicity of Nightcharms was and he even had some of it in his origin energy, but greatly weakened as it was mixed with other types of energies. <em>However, if I absorb all of these Nightcharms…</em></p> 
 <p>“Smelly boy, I advise you not to do whatever you’re thinking about. As far as your current situation is concerned, you can absorb at most three.” The Demonic God of Pain poured cold water on him as soon as Bai Xiaofei’s impulsive idea took shape. “The energies in your body were forced together by the Nonaburn Formation, and it’s by your pure luck that they achieved a balance. If any of them grows too strong and upsets the balance, dying is already your best result. If your body explodes, this world will probably be buried with you.”</p> 
 <p>This warning caused Bai Xiaofei to sigh and frown. “Fine, three it is. But it doesn’t hurt to stow them all.” His disappointment quickly turned into delight. One couldn’t have too many of such powerful and deadly items.</p> 
 <p>As a man of action, Bai Xiaofei immediately got to work. The toxic plants that everyone wanted to avoid didn’t have any negative impact on him at all and they even made the energy in his body grow active.</p> 
 <p>“A hundred and seven in total, and all of them look better quality than the one I got. Sure enough, you pay and you get something back. All of my blood, sweat, and tears have been worthwhile!” Bai Xiaofei exclaimed after he collected all of the Nightcharms.</p> 
 <p>The Demonic God of Pain just couldn’t listen anymore. <em>You, a crafty fox, are bullying an unconscious remnant soul. Blood, sweat, and tears?! You’re obviously on vacation, alright?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Now, time for the main course!” Bai Xiaofei continued toward the two divine plants.</p> 
 <p>Under the night sky, they emitted a faint light. As soon as he approached, all the cells in his body started to dance excitedly.</p> 
 <p><em>Incomparably pure energy!</em></p> 
 <p>“Revival Grass, with three leaves and one heart. The leaves can bring one back to life, and the heart can condense the soul. When consuming both, one can build a spiritual foundation. Dragon Saliva Flower, by consuming it can one fortify their blood essence and strengthen the body. It seems that this Barbaric God has it all planned up to even after he regains consciousness. Poor soul, it all ends up benefiting you,” the Demonic God of Pain commented with a sigh.</p> 
 <p>Chortling, Bai Xiaofei carefully collected the Revival Grass and felt a weight off his heart. Then, he turned to the Dragon Saliva Flower, and upon seeing the round little fruit hanging on it, he stared blankly in utter disbelief.</p> 
 <p>After a while, he turned to look at the Demonic God of Pain and asked, “This thing is the Dragon Saliva Flower?!”</p> 
 <p>Despite the confusion he felt from Bai Xiaofei’s strange stare, the Demonic God of Pain replied, “How could I have seen it wrongly? It is, and you’re lucky that the fruit is ripe. You can directly eat it.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei gulped hard. He knew it was edible, and he also knew how delicious it was! After all…</p> 
 <p><em>I’ve eaten it before!</em></p> 
 <p>The memory of himself running around naked emerged in his mind. It was because of eating this fruit that he had nearly died and all of his meridians were blocked. That was then he had met Revelation for the first time and gone through that ‘bitter’ experience…</p> 
 <p>That’s right, this fruit was the source of that strange pink energy!</p> 
 <p>“Do you know how this thing comes about?” Bai Xiaofei’s feelings for Dragon Saliva Fruit were quite complicated. If it weren’t for it, his life would have been completely different and he’d probably be much weaker, but it was also because of this fruit that he now had to constantly guard against the pink energy, fearing that it would suddenly act up.</p> 
 <p>“This flower originally belonged to the dragon clan, a kind of companion spiritual plant. Young dragons use it to build the foundation for their growth, while for adult dragons, it has another function.” The Demonic God of Pain smirked.</p> 
 <p>Seeing his expression, Bai Xiaofei burst into a cold sweat.</p> 
 <p><em>I know what that function is…</em></p>
