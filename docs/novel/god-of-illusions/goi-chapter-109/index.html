 <p><span style>“Looks like you’ve chosen the latter! Then I can only let Huskie benefit.” Bai Xiaofei grabbed Huskie up as he spoke while his left hand pressed down upon the opening at the top of the cage, and he didn’t say another word before opening the cage and pushing Huskie in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black cat tried to run out instantly when Bai Xiaofei opened the cage, but the opening on the cage was too small, and it was directly pushed back in by Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Motherf*cker! You actually dared to scratch me! Just see how I deal with you!” As he spoke, the scene inside the cage was in a mess. Within the small space, the black cat scratched Huskie without end, and in the blink of an eye, Huskie was already shivering and forced to a corner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, right at this moment, Bai Xiaofei stretched out his hand and placed it on the black cat while he circulated the Lunisolar Brilliance cultivation technique, causing a strand of Origin Energy that carried the pink colored energy to be extracted from his Origin Core.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei didn’t dare utilize too much and just controlling this strand already exhausted Bai Xiaofei to the point he was drenched in sweat. But, this strand was already sufficient for the black cat’s build!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meow!!! Meow!!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right at the instant when Bai Xiaofei’s Origin Energy was about to invade the black cat’s body, the black cat instantly let out two miserable cries, and then it stopped attacking Bai Xiaofei and Huskie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this meaning of this? You’re submitting? But, what if I don’t have the mood anymore?” As he hurriedly withdrew the energy back into his Origin Core, Bai Xiaofei wiped the beads of sweat that seeped out of his forehead.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Motherf*cker! This energy is really f*cking dangerous!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In merely that instant from before, Bai Xiaofei was already exhausted to the point his mind was slightly dazed….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meow! Meow! Meow!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black cat cried out anxiously, and then it looked at Huskie before raising its claw and placing it on Bai Xiaofei’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Its round eyes were closed tightly, and it seem extremely alike to criminal that was sent to the execution grounds.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>You bastard! I told you that I’d surely be able to deal with you!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Even though he was unable to understand what the black cat meant now, its reaction was sufficient to explain everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he sneered with extreme complacency, Bai Xiaofei gradually calmed down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The process of forming a contract wasn’t as simple as one would imagine. Especially when one formed a contract with an animate puppet because the slightest carelessness would cause one to go mad!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, with the black cat’s cooperation, the entire process was completely rather smoothly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After it was completed successfully, Bai Xiaofei heaved a long sigh of relief, and as he felt the connection that appeared within his mind, he couldn’t help but reveal a slight smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good girl!” As he spoke, Bai Xiaofei grinned as he opened up the cage. In the next second, the black cat shot out from within like a bolt of lightning, and it directly swung its claws at Bai Xiaofei. However, its figure became extremely stiff before it could even approach Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The relationship between a puppet and a puppet master was always one of being controlled and control. This was something that was determined at the instant the contract was formed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Fellow, if you dare do that again, then I guarantee that the incident from before will occur once more. Moreover, I don’t even have to put you in heat now!” Bai Xiaofei spoke fiercely, causing the black cat to instantly become listless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since you’re completely black, I’ll call you Blackie in the future. Don’t hope that I’ll give you a better name because this is already my limit!” As he spoke, the black cat didn’t dare make the slightest sound, causing Blackie to become its name from now on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huskie, you did well. I’ll give you an extra meal when we get back.” Subsequently, Bai Xiaofei carried Huskie out, and a single sentence from him caused the originally upset Huskie to instantly become excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The nearby Blackie couldn’t help but give Huskie a glance of disdain.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Stupid husky, you were bribed with just a single meal!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Come, let me see what ability you’ve given me!” As he spoke, Bai Xiaofei whose tone was filled with anticipation placed his hand on Blackie because all his hopes were placed here!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha!!! The heavens are kind to me!!!” Bai Xiaofei howled towards the sky before holding up Blackie and rubbing it furiously while complacency was written all over his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, a new plan had appeared within Bai Xiaofei’s mind!</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Vice Principal Luo?! What’re you doing here?” The Great Barrier God was patrolling at her post when Luo Xi who appeared abruptly caused her to be slightly shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, when facing her question, ‘Vice Principal Luo’ didn’t reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Principal? Did you come to look for someone?” Along with the Great Barrier God’s approach, a trace of panic obviously appeared on Luo Xi’s face, and such an obvious change in expression was naturally unable to escape the eyes of &nbsp;the great god.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You aren’t Vice Principal Luo!” She decided instantaneously, and then the aunty directly raised up her broom. In the next second, Luo Xi instantly transformed into Bai Xiaofei. At the same time, he assumed the posture of intending to charge into the female dorms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You stinking brat! If I don’t teach you a proper lesson today, then you won’t know how the word death is written!” The aunty raised her broom and struck towards ‘Bai Xiaofei’ to the point ‘Bai Xiaofei’ fled all the way back. But, the aunty didn’t notice that a slight change had unknowingly occurred in the surrounding scenery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For example, there seemed to be an extra tree at a certain direction….</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ability Blackie gave Bai Xiaofei was scenery simulation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within a certain area, Blackie was capable of changing the scenery at will. Moreover, it was capable of causing a portion of the created scenery to become material. At the same time, it could change the outer appearance of some things in the area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, at a corner that the Great Barrier God wasn’t paying attention to, Bai Xiaofei had transformed from a tree into a trash can, and then into a water bucket….</span></p>
 <p><span style>All along the way, Bai Xiaofei made Blackie help him turn into anything that might be there, and every single time the aunty felt something was wrong, Blackie would make the surroundings materialize, causing the aunty that touched a material object to dispel her doubts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like this, Bai Xiaofei snuck all the way into the female dorms!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, fortunately, the division of the female dorms was basically similar to the male forms, and he just had to move towards the area that the new students would be in the male dorms. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Hu Xian’er was the 21</span><span style>st</span><span style> amongst those that were recruited internally, and Bai Xiaofei moved according to the division of the male dorms to quickly lock onto the dorm building that Hu Xian’er lived in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, a new problem followed along with this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t know which floor Hu Xian’er was at! And he was unable to find her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Entering the building to look for her wasn’t realistic because he didn’t dare do that even if Blackie was able to help him accomplish it. Trespassing into the female dorms was already liable for the ‘death penalty’, and if he were to enter the dormitory building, then he would probably have to be dismembered at the very least!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, Bai Xiaofei who’d already turned into a trash can fell into deep contemplation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It just so happened that right at this moment, a female student that wore her pajamas walked out from the dorm building, and she was carrying a bag of trash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh? When was there a trash can here?” The female student muttered to herself, and her tone carried a trace of bewilderment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cheh, who cares!? Isn’t it better that I can walk a few steps less!?” The female student walked over towards Bai Xiaofei as she spoke, and she assumed the posture of intending to toss it over from afar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it’s possible, I hope you don’t toss trash on me.” Bai Xiaofei who was anxious because he didn’t have a way to find Hu Xian’er had a sudden flash of inspiration when he saw the young woman, and a bold plan surfaced within his mind.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Life and death, success and failure, I can only take a gamble!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He was betting that this female student was an idiot!</span></p>
