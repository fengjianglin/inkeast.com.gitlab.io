 <p>Finally, along with the passage of time, the members of the Savage Class completed their morning training assignment one after the other, and at the same time, they fell onto the square one after the other.</p>
 <p>No matter if it was male or female students, sweat had already drenched their clothes countless times yet the faces of this group of people had an unprecedented sense of accomplishment.</p>
 <p>Running five circles around the square of Starnet Academy was an accomplishment that was sufficient to become a qualification for one to boast of!</p>
 <p>It wasn’t just that, in the final period of time, situations of them helping and encouraging each other was present everywhere, and it was even though everyone was already completely exhausted….</p>
 <p>So, when they fell on the ground at this moment, an indescribable feeling was established within this small group.</p>
 <p>Yet this was merely the first day of school….</p>
 <p>As she looked at the 11 people that were laying all over the ground, Xue Ying who’d stopped had finally restrained the cold expression on her face, and she turned back into that big sister next door.</p>
 <p>Moreover, the reason it was 11 people was because Bai Xiaofei and the other four were still running….</p>
 <p>“Congratulations to all of you for obtaining the right to eat. If all of you go over now, then you ought to be able to catch up to the end. But, remember not to eat too much as you might vomit it out in the afternoon.” Xue Ying grinned as she spoke yet all 11 of them on the ground had utterly no intention of moving, and it was similarly because Bai Xiaofei and the others were still running….</p>
 <p>“The two of us will go buy food. All of you just wait here, and we’ll eat together later.” Fang Ye stood up and spoke words that Wang Hang who was by his side wouldn’t believe even if he was bashed to death.</p>
 <p><i>Is this that Young Master Fang Ye?!</i></p>
 <p>“What’re you looking at?! Let’s go!” As he dragged along his exhausted body, Fang Ye pulled Wang Hang who was still in a muddled state up before staggering towards the canteen.</p>
 <p>The others continued to wait on the spot instead, and they secretly cheered Bai Xiaofei and the others on in their hearts.</p>
 <p>Of course, it was only limited to within their hearts because even if they wanted to run and accompany Bai Xiaofei and the others, they had to stand up before they could….</p>
 <p>After Fang Ye and Wang Hang finished buying lunch, Duan Yi’yi who was pulled along by Bai Xiaofei and Wu Chi greeted her ray of light, and she’d completed the extra round she had to run, whereas, Mo Ka was limping as he followed by Shi Kui’s side.</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Xue, they’ll surely remember it, so allow them to stop.” Zhu Nuo who was helped all along the way was finally unable to continue watching, and she was the first to speak out. Moreover, she obtained the support of everyone at the first possible moment.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, Big Sister Xue, allow them to stop. They surely won’t do it again in the future.”</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Xue….”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The 12 people around Xue Ying were practically on the verge of wearing out their lips.</p>
 <p>“I can allow them to stop, but, all of you must agree to a condition of mine.” Finally, Xue Ying had given in amidst the pleading voices of the group, but this condition caused many people to be slightly afraid.</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Xue, go ahead!” Xu Chen was extremely alike to a lady boss, and she stated her position clearly with a serious expression.</p>
 <p>Everyone else quickly dispelled the trace of concern at the bottoms of their hearts, and they looked at Xue Ying with firm expressions at the same time.</p>
 <p>“From today onward, if any one of them make a mistake again, then the punishment will implicate everyone that pleaded on their behalf. But, there’s no need if you withdraw.” At this moment, Xue Ying was extremely alike to the devil that had cast out its temptation, and she’d placed a path of death and life before the 12 of them.</p>
 <p>“I won’t withdraw!” Lin Li whose expression was still slightly sedate raised her hand, and she spoke out three words extremely resolutely.</p>
 <p>“I won’t withdraw!”</p>
 <p>“I won’t withdraw!”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>One after another, in next to no time, the 12 of them had already unified their thoughts, and 12 pairs of firm eyes looked at Xue Ying at the same time.</p>
 <p>Moreover, this scene was practically instantly inscribed into Xue Ying’s mind, and it was branded deeply into her mind.</p>
 <p>The class this morning could be said to be fairly satisfactory!</p>
 <p>“Go tell them to stop. At the same time, congratulations, the class for this morning has ended officially!” After she spoke words that the group of people only understood partially, Xue Ying instantly started beaming with smiles.</p>
 <p>Not long after, after Xu Chen passed this good news into the ears of Bai Xiaofei and the others, the four of them instantly fell limply to the ground….</p>
 <p>The state of Mo Ka’s group of three was obvious, whereas, Bai Xiaofei had even exhausted the energy he accumulated with the World Devourer since long ago, and he was running with his life on the line in the end….</p>
 <p>Just a second ago, all four of them thought that they would absolutely die today.</p>
 <p>“It’s time for food! It’s time for food!” Bai Xiaofei’s group of four staggered along to gather with everyone while Fang Ye brought over the food he bought right away, and when Bai Xiaofei heard the words ‘It’s time to eat’, he practically instantly came back to life and charged to Fang Ye’s side with a large stride.</p>
 <p>As they looked at Bai Xiaofei who seemed like a hungry ghost and under the lead of those who possessed unconstrained characters, the group was instantly filled with laughter.</p>
 <p>But, in next to no time, they were unable to continue laughing.</p>
 <p>Because Bai Xiaofei truly ate too quickly!</p>
 <p>“F*ck! Grab it quickly, otherwise, everything will be eaten by him!!!” Xu Chen enlightened everyone with just a few words, causing all of them to rush forward right away, and they completely pushed away Bai Xiaofei who was weak to the point that even a gust of wind could blow him down to a place where he was unable to reach the lunch boxes.</p>
 <p>For the first time in their lives, everyone in the group felt in unison that eating was actually such a happy thing, and so many things they didn’t want to eat as soon as they saw it in the past was actually so tasty….</p>
 <p>“I’ll repeat it once more since everyone is here. Congratulations for completing this morning’s class satisfactorily.” After she repeated the portion of her words that no one was capable of understanding, Xue Ying’s face was covered with joy.</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Xue, all of us have become like this from running. We can at most be said to have ‘barely’ completed the assignment, right?” As he stuffed himself with food, Bai Xiaofei spoke vaguely, and he utterly didn’t have the awareness that he was one of the key targets of attention.</p>
 <p>“In terms of physical strength, all of you are really too inferior. But, in another aspect, your displays have exceeded my expectations, whereas, this aspect was precisely what I truly wanted to teach all of you this morning.” As she spoke, a trace of brightness appeared in the eyes of everyone at the same time.</p>
 <p><i>Another aspect?</i></p>
 <p>“In real battle, it’s extremely rare to fight one on one, and the situation puppet masters are commonly in are chaotic battles between numerous people!</p>
 <p>“In these battles, the relationship between you and your teammates is the only factor that will be able to boundlessly increase your ability to survive!</p>
 <p>“Today, since all of you were able to choose to help others when you were exhausted and even share the ‘dangers’ of others while under the circumstances that all of you were ‘safe’, such actions are worthy of the word ‘satisfactory.” After she spoke a huge pile of things with a single breath, Xue Ying opened the door to a completely new world for everyone in the Savage Class.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, the 16 young men and young women whose mouths glistened with oil looked at each other, and then they started laughing one after the other.</p>
 <p>“Even though all of you will only be staying for three months in my class, but I hope that all 16 of you can form a type of eternal relationship between yourselves during these three months, a relationship that won’t change because of location and status, a relationship of sharing the good and the bad and never abandoning each other!”</p>
 <p>When facing Xue Ying who’d suddenly become formal once more, the 16 of them hurriedly swallowed the food they were chewing in their mouths before looking at Xue Ying in unison.</p>
 <p>For the first time, the 16 of them felt that this teacher seemed to be slightly interesting….</p>
