 <p>Chapter 1031: The Tragedy of an Old Friend!</p> 
 <p>“When was this?”</p> 
 <p>After a long time, Bai Xiaofei finally opened his mouth to speak, his expression unprecedentedly gloomy.</p> 
 <p>“Half a month ago,” replied Fang Ye with a solemn expression, knowing full well what this news meant for Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“How are they now?” The anger didn’t rob Bai Xiaofei of his mind. What he needed to do now was keep the remaining people safe.</p> 
 <p>Half a month ago, the Great Cloudveil Emperor had suddenly passed away before appointing his heir, causing a struggle for the throne to break out among the princes. Although Yun Jingshuang was superior to his brothers in all aspects, he fell behind in terms of supporters as he had left Cloudveil for a long time to study.</p> 
 <p>The other princes latched on to this disadvantage and joined hands to attack him. That night, Yun Jingshuang died!</p> 
 <p>Because Han Qianye was on Yun Jingshuang’s side, her family was dragged into the conflict. It was also that night that her clan of nearly a thousand members was killed. Only Han Qianye had been able to escape under Yun Sheng’s protection.</p> 
 <p>And the letter Bai Xiaofei had just read was from Han Qianye, who had struggled to get it sent to an Illusion Demon branch.</p> 
 <p>“Senior Sister Qianye and Senior Yun Sheng are still on the run. I have arranged for people to look for them, but there has been no news. Moreover, due to having no shelter from the government, our branch in Cloudveil has been attacked and is currently evacuating.” Fang Ye lowered his head. It was a huge blow to him being unable to find Han Qianye and Yun Sheng after such a long time.</p> 
 <p>Yun Jingshuang was gone. If his younger brother and woman could not be saved, neither Bai Xiaofei nor his Illusion Demon would be able to overcome this knot in their heart. After Yun Jingshuang had returned to his home, he had helped Illusion Demon a great deal and quickened its development for at least two years. To this end, he had even turned against several Cloudveil nobles.</p> 
 <p>Perhaps it was also for this reason that he had been isolated and therefore lacked connections.</p> 
 <p>“Stabilize our people over there. Transfer all of our main forces along with all resources possible to the Cloudveil branch. In half a month, I want to see all our forces in Cloudveil!” Bai Xiaofei gritted his teeth, murderous intent unconsciously overflowing.</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye immediately understood what this meant. Bai Xiaofei wanted to start a massacre in Cloudveil!</p> 
 <p>“Ten days,” Fang Ye vowed as he looked firmly at Bai Xiaofei, whose eyes were bloodshot.</p> 
 <p>“In the name of Illusion Demon, publish a mission to find Senior Qianye and Yun Sheng. A million amethyst coins for providing clues of their whereabouts, ten million amethyst coins for helping them. If anyone brings them back, I will provide for that person until the day they die!” Bai Xiaofei declared and returned to the Windsurfing Ship. “Let’s go. To Cloudveil!”</p> 
 <p>His icy voice stunned Tan Xin and Nie Qing a little before they hurriedly moved.</p> 
 <p>“Nie Qing, you stay here with your family. I’ll return and pick you up after I finish.” Bai Xiaofei suddenly turned around and looked at Nie Qing worriedly.</p> 
 <p>“If it’s really so dangerous that you have to leave me behind, do you think I would agree? Do you want your child to be born without a father and then I have to tell them that I didn’t even know you were so impulsive to seek death?” Nie Qing stared at Bai Xiaofei and retorted. As he was rendered speechless, she continued, “Besides, I thought you’d like every bit of help you can get, so I have already informed my brothers and sisters. They will arrive soon.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei fell silent. Seeing this, Nie Qing struck while the iron was hot.</p> 
 <p>“Or do you think there are safer places in this world than by your side? If the situation is so dangerous that you can’t protect me and my child, do you think I will let you go?”</p> 
 <p>At this point, Bai Xiaofei compromised.</p> 
 <p>“You can follow, but you can’t take part in any battle without my permission!” He gazed at her with a solemn expression.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I will be absolutely obedient!” Nie Qing proudly chuckled. In this world, there were not many people who could make Bai Xiaofei change his mind…</p> 
 <p>It didn’t take long for the Thunderstorm group to arrive. They had seen her once after she had woken up but were still very excited to see her again.</p> 
 <p>“Little sister, you have no idea, Big Brother has been talking about nothing but you! Our ears are already growing calluses,” Yun Mo came up and immediately tattled on Fang Lei.</p> 
 <p>However, Nie Qing’s only response was her rapidly blinking eyes. Everyone looked over and when they saw Bai Xiaofei with a clouded expression, they swallowed back what they wanted to say.</p> 
 <p><em>The atmosphere is a bit wrong…</em></p> 
 <p>“Time to go. As for Moonlight, I will come back and apologize later,” Bai Xiaofei said and boarded the Windsurfing Ship.</p> 
 <p>After everyone got on board, Tan Xin raised the speed to the maximum. Meanwhile, Nie Qing briefed everyone about what had just happened. While the Thunderstorm group didn’t know about the relationship between Yun Jingshuang and Bai Xiaofei, they could tell from Bai Xiaofei’s attitude that Yun Jingshuang was of great importance to him.</p> 
 <p>All of that couldn’t stop them from being ecstatic over Nie Qing’s pregnancy. Just like Bai Xiaofei, they couldn’t wait to find a place to nurse her.</p> 
 <p>Going at full speed, the ship reached the border in just one day.</p> 
 <p>“Why did you stop?” Bai Xiaofei, who was sitting at the bow, stood up as soon as he felt the ship slowing down to a halt.</p> 
 <p>“Someone is coming,” Tan Xin informed.</p> 
 <p>A while later, a group of people in uniforms flew over. They all exuded a strong aura.</p> 
 <p>“This is the border of Violethorn. Please come down for inspection,” said the leader of the group indifferently and straight to the point.</p> 
 <p>They were the Border Guards of the Violethorn Empire!</p> 
 <p>“Friends, if it is a routine inspection, I wonder if this is enough to prove our identity?” Bai Xiaofei took out his Starnet Brilliance.</p> 
 <p>Upon seeing it, the Border Guard captain froze a little.</p> 
 <p>“So it’s a high-flyer of Starnet. However, in Violethorn, certain things are necessary. Even the principal of Starnet will receive the same treatment if he comes here,” said the captain, his attitude neither servile nor overbearing.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei, who had barely been maintaining a calm mood the past day, immediately revealed an unhappy look.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t want to embarrass you, so I’ll let you know this: If I want to pass, no one can stop me!”</p>
