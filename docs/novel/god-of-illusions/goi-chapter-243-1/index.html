 <p>“Fusing with the Saint Rank magic core gave me more than one ability,” said Hu Xian’er as she raised both her hands. Two different energies appeared around her hands. From a close distance, Bai Xiaofei was able to sense how terrifying these two energies were.</p>
 <p>Although the flame covering Hu Xian’er’s right hand was currently dormant, the piercing temperature was far beyond any flame Bai Xiaofei had encountered. As for the dreamlike energy covering Hu Xian’er’s left hand, for some reason, it awed Bai Xiaofei when he set eyes on it. It was an awe one would feel when an inferior life form faced a superior existence.</p>
 <p>“After I absorbed the power from the red fruit, I obtained an ability to control fire. Currently, I can only wrap it around my body to use it in melee combat. I believe that I will be able to do anything fire-elemental puppet masters can do after I fully grasp the flame energy within my body,” Hu Xian’er declared calmly. Bai Xiaofei gulped as he recalled the scene of the golden wolf being defeated with a single slap.</p>
 <p>She currently “could only” wrap it around her body. Only Hu Xian’er would downplay something this powerful like this. The flame surrounding her right hand slowly vanished into her body again, and she slowly lifted her left hand.</p>
 <p>“Apart from helping me reach peak Grandmaster Rank, this ability is my greatest harvest from the magic core.”</p>
 <p>Hu Xian’er then pointed at a tiny tree in front of them. The tree was swaying about in the wind, but the moment Hu Xian’er pointed at it, the tree seemed to have frozen in time.</p>
 <p>“I am not freezing the tree. Rather, I am controlling the flow of time surrounding it. I can freely control this zone of control, but regardless of the zone’s size, I am presently only able to keep it up for no more than two seconds. It is also unrelated to the origin energy within me. The limitation is due to an entirely different type of energy, one that I did not know about before this.”</p>
 <p>Those words completely stunned Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p><em>Time…control?</em></p>
 <p>“I won’t be affected when I’m in the zone where time is slowed. That was why none of you were aware of what had happened,” added Hu Xian’er before Bai Xiaofei could recover from his shock, as if he was not shocked enough. What did that signify exactly? Simply put, one second of a person’s time would remain one second for that person, but the same one second would last forever for Hu Xian’er so long as she was fast enough. Combined with the destructive damage Hu Xian’er was capable of dealing, Bai Xiaofei could already picture how sorry her enemies would be.</p>
 <p>“Never ever tell anyone about this ability!” Bai Xiaofei recovered from his shock and was immediately felt with anxiousness.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. Apart from you, no one else will know this,” said Hu Xian’er with a slight blush on her face.</p>
 <p>“And you can never use this ability in the academy. There are too many eyes watching in the academy,” said Bai Xiaofei as Yun Jingshuang’s perfectly handsome face appeared in his mind. According to Yun Jingshuang, there were at least three other people who were as capable as him in terms of investigating or spying on someone.</p>
 <p>“Um. I will keep that in mind.” Hu Xian’er nodded and held Bai Xiaofei’s hand again. “I will remember everything you have done for me. After I finish what I have set out to do, I will follow you everywhere you go!” Hu Xian’er declared, her eyes solemn.</p>
 <p>“Fool, why are you telling me that? Even if you want to escape me, I will capture you back to my side!” Bai Xiaofei said as he rubbed Hu Xian’er’s head in a pampering manner. The anxiousness in his heart was no longer there, replaced by a sense of longing for the beautiful future.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go. There is still a mess waiting for us at the academy,” said Bai Xiaofei. Although he spoke in an uncaring tone, he was already feeling bitter inwardly. What was waiting for them was truly worthy of the word “mess”. Distance was now completely irrelevant to Bai Xiaofei and Hu Xian’er. So long as Hu Xian’er wanted, they could reach the academy in the time it took to finish a cup of tea. But she did not do that as it was rare for them to be together without others around them. But even with them intentionally slowing down, it still did not take them long to reach the academy.</p>
 <p>After going through the protective barrier, Bai Xiaofei recalled the incident earlier and said, “Don’t return to Fist of the Beast today. I don’t feel comfortable letting you go back just like that.”</p>
 <p>“Ok. I will listen to you. But you need to be careful as well. Di Jiang will not let this matter rest.” Hu Xian’er was extremely intelligent. She naturally understood Bai Xiaofei’s worry.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. He won’t be able to stay smug for long.” Bai Xiaofei smiled, a ruthless glint flickering in his eyes.</p>
 <p><em>Old dog, you dare think of touching my woman? If I don’t f*ck you up real badly, I won’t be surnamed Bai anymore!</em></p>
 <p>After parting ways with Hu Xian’er, Bai Xiaofei did not return to the Demon of Illusions directly even though he knew that Chu Liuyun and the others were most likely going crazy looking for him. He had no other option. His safety was paramount. He had no intention of letting Di Jiang capture and punish him.</p>
 <p>With Huskie in his arms and Blackie in tow, Bai Xiaofei ran madly toward the Blossom Pavilion, dressed in the new student uniform. On his way there, he kept as low a profile as possible. He was successful, as not a single pedestrian was able to get a clear look of his face. Soon, he arrived at the Blossom Pavilion. He was somewhat at ease when he arrived. He had no enemies here. After all, only Yun Jingshuang and Han Qianye would stay here on ordinary days. For some reason, these two had a lot of free time in their hands, as if they had no lessons to attend.</p>
 <p>Before Bai Xiaofei could enter, Yun Jingshuang’s lazy voice sounded, “I was wondering why my eyelid was twitching this morning. So it turns out you would be here today.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Come on, we know each other well. You must have known I was heading this way.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei entered directly as if it was his own home. Yun Jingshuang merely sneered in response.</p>
 <p>“You sure think too highly of yourself. I am not so free to spend my time spying on you. It takes a lot of origin energy to keep the Celestial Eye active. I will generally only use it to scan the surroundings of the Blossom Pavilion,” said Yun Jingshuang uncaringly as he sat down beside Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“Tell me. Why are you here?”</p>
 <p>“Can’t I come just to visit you? I’m not as snobbish as you think.” Bai Xaofei tried explaining himself, but Yun jingshuang merely sneered at him.</p>
 <p>“You? You spend all your free time with your teacher and the two beauties. When have you ever thought of me?” Yun Jingshuang was extremely frank and did not pull any of his punches.</p>
 <p>“Just go straight to the point. What do you plan to do to the Di Jiang father and son pair?”</p>
 <p>The moment those words were spoken, an astonished look covered Bai Xiaofei’s face.</p>
 <p>“You know what happened?”</p>
 <p>“I am not the only one who knows,” said Yun Jingshuang as his storage ring flashed. Then, a tiny notebook flew toward Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“Take a look. This is my collection of all the information related to you that has spread since you left the Fist of the Beast yesterday. It’s all widely known information. Nothing too hidden is recorded.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei swallowed before he slowly opened the notebook.</p>
