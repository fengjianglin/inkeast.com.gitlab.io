 <p>Chapter 775: Devil Forest!</p> 
 <p>A new round of auctions started after a short recess. Because Bai Xiaofei did not participate at all in the ‘Pills’ round, many people had great anticipation as they had especially come to Windlove for the auctioned materials.</p> 
 <p>All kinds of strange materials were praised to the sky by Qing Han. There were some that Bai Xiaofei had never even heard of but were finalized at terrifying prices.</p> 
 <p>“If only Mo Ka and Shi Kui were here, there must be something they like here.” A bored Bai Xiaofei sighed. His knowledge of materials was really next to nothing.</p> 
 <p>“This is very normal. Materials can only show their true value in the right hands.” Qing Ya smiled, finding Bai Xiaofei’s reaction to be commonplace.</p> 
 <p>“By the way, I remember Windlove City is a big distribution center of Blood Diamonds. Your auction house should have peak-grade ones!” Bai Xiaofei’s eyes lit up in great interest.</p> 
 <p>His interest was not an act, but not for a reason that Qing Ya could ever guess.</p> 
 <p>“Young Master Bai is really smart. The finale of the Materials stage is indeed peak-grade Blood Diamonds.”</p> 
 <p>Since Bai Xiaofei guessed it himself and was not told by Qing Ya, it was not a violation of the rules for her to have some flexibility.</p> 
 <p>“Heh, if I only buy this one, it should not be against the agreement with your brother, right?” Bai Xiaofei asked with a sleazy smile.</p> 
 <p>“Of course, as long as you don’t purchase everything, we won’t have a problem,” replied Qing Ya.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei laughed in joy and turned to look at the crowded hall below.</p> 
 <p>It was most difficult for a person to hide their true colors when they got too excited, and auctions were the easiest to work up people’s emotions. Moreover, those who dared to bid on such an occasion were definitely not simple, paying attention to them would be beneficial to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“What kind of status is the person in the opposite private room?”</p> 
 <p>After watching for a while, he found that the opposite room had bought several materials he didn’t know in a row, and each one at an oppressively high price.</p> 
 <p>“I cannot disclose that, but if you’d like, I can send someone to ask them if they are willing to have a meeting with you.”</p> 
 <p>Although Bai Xiaofei had put forward an invitation to Qing Ya and she was tempted to agree, she was still an employee of Unify Business at the moment and had to act with due diligence. This concerned one’s personal ethics. If she really disclosed someone else’s private information, Bai Xiaofei’s high opinion of her would be affected.</p> 
 <p>“No need, I’m just curious. We’ll meet if we’re fated to.” Bai Xiaofei smiled as he temporarily suppressed his curiosity and refocused on the ongoing auction.</p> 
 <p>At that moment, the auction of materials was reaching the finale…</p> 
 <p>“Thank you all for your enthusiasm. It is really my luck to be the host of today’s auction. After all, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to host a grand auction that allows one to directly retire after it’s done.” Qing Han kept the atmosphere lively with a little joke as a staff wheeled up the next item. “Next is the finale of our material auction, and I know that many of you have come here for them. So, what are they…?”</p> 
 <p>His voice laced with suspense, Qing Han slowly reached for the red cloth, and then pulled it down bit by bit under the intense gazes of all and sundry.</p> 
 <p>“Three peak-grade Blood Diamonds!”</p> 
 <p>Although Qing Han tried his best to build up the atmosphere, the majority of the guests were not surprised when the items were revealed. Of course, it was not that they had no interest in Blood Diamonds. They had anticipated this scenario and made full preparations for it!</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei frowned.</p> 
 <p>“While Blood Diamonds are precious, I have seen them before. Even peak-grade ones should not be so worthy of the finale. Is there something special about these three Blood Diamonds?” A bidding war had erupted, but Bai Xiaofei was in no hurry as he asked Qing Ya a question.</p> 
 <p>“Normal peak-grade Blood Diamonds are indeed not worthy, but these three are completely different. If the user does not have a special physique, any one of these three will give them one, and if all three are used together, it’s possible to obtain two or even three special physiques at the same time.”</p> 
 <p>Qing Ya’s tone was indifferent, but her words caused the three experts behind Bai Xiaofei to lose their composure. The enhancement from a special physique to a puppet master was no joke!</p> 
 <p>“Oh, I see.” Bai Xiaofei nodded nonchalantly, but his hand went for the button. “One hundred million!”</p> 
 <p>As his voice echoed in the whole auction hall again, the fear that everyone had almost forgotten washed all over them. At the same time, his price silenced all of the other bidders. They did not even have a hundred million!</p> 
 <p>“Thank you, everyone. Then I won’t be courteous,” said Bai Xiaofei after the gavel fell three times.</p> 
 <p>His ridicule made the whole audience’s teeth itch in fury, and many looked toward his private room with vicious eyes. They wanted to rob him after the auction ended – after all, holding a treasure was a sin in itself.</p> 
 <p>However, the thought of the three Expert Ranks following him directly dismissed this idea. The treasure was tempting, but their lives were much more important!</p> 
 <p>With Bai Xiaofei winning the Blood Diamonds, the Materials stage ended and the auction took a break.</p> 
 <p>To Bai Xiaofei’s surprise, his door was knocked on once again.</p> 
 <p>“Honored guest, the guest next door wants to communicate with you. I wonder if it’s convenient?” a staff’s voice softly rang out outside.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei froze a little before a smile bloomed on his face. <em>Damn it, finally a response after spending so much!</em></p> 
 <p>“Tell them I’m not interested if they don’t show sincerity,” Bai Xiaofei leaned back on the soft sofa and said flatly.</p> 
 <p>Qing Ya helped him deliver his words outside. Before long, the door was knocked on again, but this time it was not a staff member.</p> 
 <p>“My friend, I’m sorry for my offenses just now. This humble one is Zhu Wuxin, the current captain of the Devil Forest Mercenary Group. I would like to talk to you about the Blood Diamonds.” Zhu Wuxin’s tone was polite.</p> 
 <p>Upon the name ‘Devil Forest Mercenary Group,’ Bai Xiaofei was secretly surprised. <em>If possible, the mission assigned to Lin Li’s group may be able to finish ahead of schedule!</em></p> 
 <p>“Open the door,” Bai Xiaofei ordered and sat up straight.</p> 
 <p>Strong Steel immediately went to open the door and welcome Zhu Wuxin in.</p> 
 <p>To come alone without anyone else, this sincerity was enough!</p>
