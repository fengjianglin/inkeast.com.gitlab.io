 <p>Chapter 950: Blind?!</p> 
 <p>After being severely ridiculed by Ye Xi, Bai Xiaofei was finally set free, and the first thing he did was release Huskie and Blackie from the puppet space just as they were about to go crazy from boredom.</p> 
 <p>The patience of the two little fellows truly paled when compared to Golden Feather. After tens of thousands of years of loneliness, a month wasn’t even enough for a nap.</p> 
 <p>“Smelly boy, does your promise still count or not?! You got the puppet core so when are you going to let me out?!” the voice of the Demonic God of Pain resounded in Bai Xiaofei’s consciousness. Recently, this had been all he ever said every time he opened his mouth.</p> 
 <p>As for the puppet core he mentioned, it was from that battle with the little boy in Ethereal. The moment the boy’s fake body was destroyed, it dropped a violetgold puppet core, which since then had been desperately coveted by the Demonic God of Pain.</p> 
 <p>“I only said I’d give you a chance, but I didn’t say when. Of course my word counts! Just wait obediently, at least until I make sure that you won’t cause trouble after I let you out,” replied Bai Xiaofei calmly.</p> 
 <p>The Demonic God of Pain was thunderstruck. He, who had been mighty for tens of thousands of years, had been played by a young brat!!</p> 
 <p>“Feeling very suppressed? Feeling played? I bet your life before was all smooth-sailing thanks to your super strength. But sometimes, brains are much more useful than brawn, and this is a free lesson I’m giving you. I won’t ask you for the tuition fee lest you call me stingy.” Bai Xiaofei burst out laughing.</p> 
 <p>Suddenly, a heavy sensation hit him!</p> 
 <p>His energy was sealed!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei subconsciously tried to find the source of the seal, but before he could, a sharp object punctured his skin, which was followed by a burst of dizziness.</p> 
 <p>“Send him back. We must not let this kind of man exist in Moonlight!”</p> 
 <p>The voice came from a little figure covered in a cloak. Two burly women at her side immediately dragged Bai Xiaofei and disappeared into the alley. The whole process was smooth and neat. Obviously, this was not their first time doing such a thing…</p> 
 <p>A day slowly went by. Ye Xi was already waiting at the assembly site when the contestants and their masters arrived one by one.</p> 
 <p>When the deadline approached, an angry Tan Xin showed up. Seeing her, Ye Xi immediately revealed an unpleasant expression.</p> 
 <p>“Where is Fickle Bai?!”</p> 
 <p>“You’re asking me?! Didn’t you call him away? It’s been a whole day and night, where did you put him?!” Tan Xin was furious. She had thought that Ye Xi was just borrowing Bai Xiaofei for a while, not over a whole day!</p> 
 <p>“Why would I keep him so long? He left in the evening. Didn’t he come back to you?!” Ye Xi was equally furious. She thought that Bai Xiaofei and Tan Xin had gone overboard the previous night and missed the deadline.</p> 
 <p>The two women looked at each other and after making sure that neither of them was lying, the fury on their faces couldn’t be more clear.</p> 
 <p>“That bastard! He must be hitting on women again! I must teach him a lesson!” Tan Xin declared and floated into the air. Her ability of creation fully activated and a huge eye emerged above Elegy City.</p> 
 <p>After scanning the city, her anger instantly turned into horror. <em>He’s not here?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Found him?” asked Ye Xi as soon as she descended.</p> 
 <p>“Nothing. Either he’s not here, or he’s using some method to hide himself from me, but there’s no reason for him to do that. Why would he want to hide from us?” No matter how hard Tan Xin thought, she couldn’t figure out what the hell Bai Xiaofei was doing.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Ye Xi fell silent.</p> 
 <p>“My Lord, we need to hit the road, otherwise we won’t be able to make it in time for Her Majesty’s birthday. A soldier came up to urge Ye Xi as there started to be impatient complaints from the group.</p> 
 <p>“You leave with them first. Since I brought everyone out here, I’ll make sure every single one will get to the destination!” declared Ye Xi.</p> 
 <p>The soldier followed her order and set off with the motorcade.</p> 
 <p>“You know where he is?” Tan Xin wasn’t blind. From Ye Xi’s solemn expression, she could see that she already had an idea.</p> 
 <p>“If he’s not hiding from us, then there is only one possibility, and it is… quite troublesome,” replied Ye Xi.</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>In a dark room, a drowsy Bai Xiaofei slowly opened his eyes to feel a fatigue so bad that his body did not feel like his own.</p> 
 <p>“Already up? Seems that you are quite fit,” a clear voice rang out.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei looked over and saw a young girl about the same height as Tan Xin coming out of the shadows.</p> 
 <p>“Heroic Miss, we don’t know each other, right?” Under someone else’s roof, Bai Xiaofei wisely kept his head down.</p> 
 <p>“Peh! This lady has seen many scum like you! As if I’d be acquainted with rubbish!“ the girl spat coldly.</p> 
 <p>Yet, Bai Xiaofei was relieved to hear this kind of response. <em>As long as she’s not an enemy, there is still saving for me!</em></p> 
 <p>“Since I didn’t provoke you, maybe it was something my master did? If so, I apologize for her carelessness and ask you not to take it personally.” Bai Xiaofei thought of Tan Xin. However…</p> 
 <p>“Save your nonsense. This has nothing to do with anyone or anything else besides the fact that you are a man! A species that shouldn’t exist in this world!” The girl snorted.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei almost laughed out loud. <em>Are you kidding me? If men didn’t exist, you wouldn’t either. Or were you birthed from a stone?</em></p> 
 <p>“Miss, you may misunderstand me. I’m different from those men you know.” Bai Xiaofei kept fighting for his life. No matter what, he had to find out why he was captured.</p> 
 <p>“Oh? Really?” the girl asked doubtfully.</p> 
 <p>“It’s true! I’m a good youngster who does good things! Just like you, Miss, I hate those scum. If I could, I would even kill them all!” Bai Xiaofei put himself and the girl on the same side, his face so righteous that one wouldn’t know he had just made it all up on the spot.</p> 
 <p>“Alright then, let me ask you, how many women do you have affairs with? Have you ever made a woman wait for you in sorrow somewhere?! Have you ever hurt a woman?” The girl immediately threw out three questions in a row. It was obvious that it wasn’t her first time to ask such questions.</p> 
 <p><em>This one is a recidivist!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei inwardly whined. Her questions were not easy to handle…</p> 
 <p>If he answered the first one honestly, he’d be chopped into pieces. If he answered the second question honestly, it would definitely displease her as well, because Chu Liuyun and the others were really waiting for him.</p> 
 <p>“I swear that I have never hurt any woman!” Bai Xiaofei skipped the first two and picked the only question he could answer.</p> 
 <p>“So to speak, you have affairs with many women, and many are waiting for you, heartbreaker?!” The girl’s attention was not on the question he answered.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei, who had thought he could gloss it over, was crying inside. <em>How does her brain turn so fast?!</em></p> 
 <p>“There are people waiting for me, but not in sorrow! Besides, I’m not going to be a heartbreaker!” he hurriedly remedied.</p> 
 <p>“Very good!! How dare a servant do such a thing, huh?! It seems that your master hasn’t disciplined you well enough! I can’t understand why Ye Xi brought someone like you into the Columbarium Hall!” the girl erupted.</p> 
 <p>Dumbstruck, Bai Xiaofei realized one thing – He had fallen into her trap!!</p> 
 <p>“You know Ye Xi?” he tried to divert the girl’s attention.</p> 
 <p>“What about it? You still expect her to come and save you? Let me tell you, not to mention her, even if it’s Big… even if the emperor comes in person, you scum will still die!” she smugly said.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei finally understood. This girl was simply hostile to men. Everything had just been to find an excuse to execute him.</p> 
 <p>Moreover, it was very likely that she didn’t have the courage to do it, otherwise, he would never have the chance to wake up!</p> 
 <p>“But if you kill me, the emperor will be really sad,” said Bai Xiaofei solemnly.</p> 
 <p>The girl immediately looked terrified. “You fart! How can Big Sister be sad because of you!?” Her tongue slipped as she lost her composure.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei was shocked once again. <em>What’s happening? The emperor’s little sister kidnapped me?! What has this lord done to deserve this?!</em></p> 
 <p>Despite his shock, Bai Xiaofei had to go on in order to get out of here alive.</p> 
 <p>“Looks like I have to say this. Why do you think Ye Xi took me to an important place like the Columbarium Hall? I was chosen by the emperor, and this so-called servant contest was just a cover, a reason so that I could be by her side on her birthday.” Bai Xiaofei fabricated a story from all the information he had obtained from various places, and it, therefore, couldn’t sound more believable than this.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the girl was stupefied. She just stood there staring at him for half a day…</p> 
 <p>“Big Sis must be blind! Just you wait here! I don’t believe it!”</p> 
 <p>With that, the girl ran out, leaving Bai Xiaofei whose mind was a mess.</p> 
 <p><em>What do you mean, blind?!</em></p>
