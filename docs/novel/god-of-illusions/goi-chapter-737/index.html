 <p>Chapter 737: Forgotten Person!</p> 
 <p>The collective resignation of the Student Community’s managers shocked the entire academy and was no different from thunder on a beautiful day for those who were familiar with them.</p> 
 <p>Many still held onto the idea that this was a joke to celebrate Bai Xiaofei’s return, but it turned out that he was really not joking. The new pillars of the Student Community recommended by Hu Xian’er and the others quickly came into power while those who retired formed the monitoring group under Bai Xiaofei’s lead.</p> 
 <p>The first major task given to the new Student Community was to organize the graduation!</p> 
 <p>In Lei Shan’s office,</p> 
 <p>“Are you sure there won’t be a problem? Up until you returned, those kids had only been doing chores.” Lei Shan was full of disbelief. He was still secretly waiting for Bai Xiaofei to come to his senses.</p> 
 <p>“I can’t stay in Starnet all my life. And gramps, you should believe in them. It’s only been a short time, but they are extraordinary, being able to get to where they are today,” Bai Xiaofei paused and put on a meaningful smile. “If you refuse to train them, wouldn’t it be messier for you after I graduate? Don’t tell me that you were going to make me stay longer.”</p> 
 <p>Lei Shan’s mouth twitched.</p> 
 <p>Indeed, he was going to wait until Bai Xiaofei graduated and make him stay for a period of time. Who would have thought that this brat already guarded against it in advance?</p> 
 <p>“How could I? Do I look like the type of principal who delays his students?!” denied Lei Shan seriously. He must not admit it even if he died!</p> 
 <p>“Then we’re all good! I’ve given myself more free time and help you train future talents at the same time. We all benefit!” Bai Xiaofei decided to give Lei Shan face and didn’t pursue the matter. At this point, Lei Shan had to concur no matter how much he didn’t want to.</p> 
 <p>“But, have you considered the problem with influence? It will be difficult for a person without enough influence to stand in this position.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing Lei Shan’s concern, Bai Xiaofei calmly smiled.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, gramps, I will definitely give you a Community that’s not inferior to the previous one. All you have to do is sit back and relax.” Bai Xiaofei stood up. “I still have someone to see, so I won’t waste your time.”</p> 
 <p>With that, he walked out of the office without looking back. Lei Shan shook his head helplessly.</p> 
 <p>“You two don’t look similar, but your characters seem to be made from the same mold. Longfei, you have a formidable son!”</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>Exiting Lei Shan’s office, Bai Xiaofei headed toward the Demon of Illusions.</p> 
 <p>In fact, he had met all the people he should meet. What he wanted to do now was to accompany the Leng sisters, who were going to graduate soon. However, on the way, the appearance of an old acquaintance stopped him.</p> 
 <p>“Senior?!” greeted Bai Xiaofei in pleasant surprise. The person in front of him was none other than his old senior, Bai Ye.</p> 
 <p>“You are going back to the Demon of Illusions,” stated Bai Ye lightly, with a hint of ice in his voice.</p> 
 <p>Although Bai Xiaofei didn’t know why, he could see that the senior was in a bad mood and it had something to do with him.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter, senior? Did I do something wrong?” asked Xiaofei dubiously. He racked his brain and recounted everything that had happened after his return, but failed to figure out where he had offended Bai Ye.</p> 
 <p>“There’s someone you haven’t seen since you came back,” said Bai Ye.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately understood who it was.</p> 
 <p>Qin Lingyan!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t forget her, he just didn’t know how to react around her. Back then, she had returned to the Violethorn Empire to ask her father for help, in exchange for which she made a promise, all just to save him.</p> 
 <p>No matter what, Bai Xiaofei owed her one.</p> 
 <p>He also knew her feelings for him, but now that they had come to this embarrassing state, Bai Xiaofei really didn’t know what identity he could use to see her.</p> 
 <p>A junior? But it was not that simple.</p> 
 <p>The same as he was to Hu Xian’er and his girls? But it seemed that they had already missed their chance…</p> 
 <p>Therefore, this was someone that made Bai Xiaofei feel very complicated.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know what you think about her, but I’m sure that what she feels for you is no weaker than anyone around you. If you can, go and see her. After all, who knows if you can ever meet again,” said Bai Ye, his voice still indifferent, but there was something in his expression that Bai Xiaofei couldn’t understand.</p> 
 <p>“To be honest, I don’t know how to face her. She felt like a different person after she returned from Violethorn, sometimes hot and at times cold. Moreover, she doesn’t like that I have so many around me,” said Bai Xiaofei honestly with an awkward smile.</p> 
 <p>It was impossible not to have feelings for an outstanding girl who would go to such lengths for him, but Bai Xiaofei could not give up the girls for Qin Lingyan, so they were destined to be stuck in this embarrassing situation forever.</p> 
 <p>“Just face her like you normally would. If you don’t see her, her academy life may never feel complete.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei could never have unexpected such serious words from Bai Ye.</p> 
 <p>“Senior Sister Lingyan asked you to come?” Bai Xiaofei frowned.</p> 
 <p>“You think that’s possible?” Bai Ye chuckled and looked at Bai Xiaofei like looking at an idiot.</p> 
 <p>Which was reasonable. How could such a headstrong girl ask such a thing of others?</p> 
 <p>“Do you know where she is now?” With a long sigh, Bai Xiaofei accepted his fate. <em>In any case, I owe her a favor, so let’s just consider this as paying it back. As Bai Ye said, who knows when we can meet again.</em></p> 
 <p>“The training field of the Sword of Assault. After you left, that’s been the only place where she passes her time,” replied Bai Ye with sympathy. From his expression, one could tell how tormented Qin Lingyan was.</p> 
 <p>“I will go there now.” Bai Xiaofei made up his mind after a brief silence.</p> 
 <p>Just as he was about to leave, Bai Ye stopped him.</p> 
 <p>“Can I ask you a question?” Bai Ye looked hesitant. It didn’t feel like he was talking to Bai Xiaofei, but more like trying to cheer himself up.</p> 
 <p>“Of course, given our long-standing friendship, I can answer a hundred questions,” with a smile, Bai Xiaofei gave Bai Ye a satisfactory answer.</p> 
 <p>“If, I’m just saying, if…”</p>
