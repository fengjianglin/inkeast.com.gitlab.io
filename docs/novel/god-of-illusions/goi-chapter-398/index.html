 <p>Chapter 398: Grade-Nine Pill!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s request put the garrison commander in a dilemma.</p> 
 <p>He could not afford to offend Bai Xiaofei, who had the approval of Imperial Concubine Qing. Otherwise, one word from Bai Xiaofei and he would be in trouble.</p> 
 <p>If he followed the request, the emperor’s narrow-mindedness was right there. This was no longer about offending whom and whatnot. One careless step and let alone his position, even his head might be gone… He might even drag down his nine future generations!</p> 
 <p>“Rest assured, I will take sole responsibility for whatever may happen. You only need to deliver my words,” Bai Xiaofei encouraged upon seeing the garrison commander’s hesitation, and it worked very well.</p> 
 <p><em>Why didn’t you say so earlier?! I wouldn’t have to freaking struggle if you did!</em></p> 
 <p>“Don’t say that, Brother Bai. Since Her Highness entrusted us with investigating this incident, I must accompany you all the way. How can I let you bear all the risks? Just wait for my good news, I will make sure to deliver your request to Her Highness!”</p> 
 <p>“Then please, as soon as you can, brother.” Bai Xiaofei cupped his fist towards the garrison commander, having no intention to expose the guy’s petty thoughts.</p> 
 <p>“Huh? Brother Bai, your injury?” Seeing Bai Xiaofei raise his hand without any difficulty, the garrison commander opened his eyes wide. How did he hear that Bai Xiaofei’s arm was almost cut off?</p> 
 <p>“Oh, this? Thanks to Her Highness’ pill, it has almost recovered.” Stunned for a second, Bai Xiaofei didn’t evade and instead, he rolled up his sleeve to show the garrison commander. There was no cut mark on the smooth bare skin.</p> 
 <p>If Bai Xiaofei acted evasive at a time like this, it would only make people suspicious. On the contrary, his straightforward display became him showing off Imperial Concubine Qing’s reward for him, so no matter how unimaginable the result was, others would only send him envious looks. The attention was no longer on his recovery as the favor of a high-ranking person was obviously more attention-grabbing.</p> 
 <p>After the garrison commander left, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but heave a long sigh of relief. He really needed to pay attention in the future. His special physique could be considered a trump card, it would not be a good thing if everyone knew of it.</p> 
 <p>Leaving the imperial ground, Bai Xiaofei fully rested for the night before paying a visit to all the nobles that had attended the banquet, trying to get some useful information from them. Unfortunately, they let him down, either from being scared silly or just choosing to keep silent. Those who opened their mouth and persuaded him to get out of this as early as possible were already considered the best results among those people.</p> 
 <p>In the end, Bai Xiaofei could only return to the Bright Road Merchant House and sort out the information he had grasped so far.</p> 
 <p>Soon, Shang Youdao, who was unable to sit still, knocked on his door. Whether it was the uneasy teams or that headache of a banquet, they were tormenting him. If the matter was not ended soon, he felt that his merchant group might crumble.</p> 
 <p>“Come in, President Shang.” Nursing a similar headache, Bai Xiaofei already called out before Shang Youdao could speak.</p> 
 <p>Shang Youdao pushed open the door with a face full of smiles and ingratiation in his words, “Are you a psychic? How do you know it’s me?”</p> 
 <p>“I already told my seniors not to disturb me during this time. I only know you in the Bright Road Merchant House, so who else can it be but you?” Bai Xiaofei felt no joy in the face of Shang Youdao’s ingratiation. He was just not in the mood.</p> 
 <p>“True, true, uh…” Shang Youdao laughed dryly. His face awkward, he looked like he wanted to say but couldn’t bring it up.</p> 
 <p>Seeing him like this, Bai Xiaofei helplessly shook his head. “You don’t have to worry that your merchant group will get into trouble. If the imperial family wants to hold you responsible, you would have been ‘invited to tea’ already instead of standing here being all nervous. If I guess correctly, it must be Imperial Concubine Qing who suppressed the matter. After all, the Bright Road Merchant House isn’t to blame.”</p> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei finished, the pressure on Shang Youdao’s heart was lifted.</p> 
 <p>“Little brother, you know Imperial Concubine Qing from before?” Shang Youdao asked the question he had suspected for a while with a hint of expectation. If he could acquaint himself with Imperial Concubine Qing, his merchant group could rise a level even if the current affair with the item was blown.</p> 
 <p>“No. If I did, I wouldn’t have such a headache now.” Bai Xiaofei ruthlessly burst Shang Youdao’s daydream.</p> 
 <p>Shang Youdao sighed, a hint of struggle appearing on his face. “The delivery…”</p> 
 <p>Before he could finish, Bai Xiaofei’s gaze stuffed the rest of his words back down.</p> 
 <p>“Keep waiting. Your item won’t be able to go on the road until you fully figure out the current situation, or else it will just end up with the Thunderstorm Bandits in the end.” Still coldly staring at Shang Youdao, Bai Xiaofei suddenly remembered something. “President Shang, when are you going to tell me what it is that you want to deliver? The information I can have now is limited. If you still refuse to be straightforward with me, I’m afraid that the delivery deadline will be extended indefinitely.”</p> 
 <p>In a demanding tone, Bai Xiaofei asked the question that Shang Youdao once refused to answer. This time, Shang Youdao didn’t evade but fell into a long silence.</p> 
 <p>In the meantime, Bai Xiaofei didn’t say a word and only quietly looked at Shang Youdao. Time trickled in silence until Shang Youdao finally sighed.</p> 
 <p>“It’s a pill,” answered Shang Youdao slowly.</p> 
 <p>“A pill?” His brows creased in shock, Bai Xiaofei nearly sprang up.</p> 
 <p><em>Motherf*cker, so many people died just for a pill?! Is something wrong with this world?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Yes, but it’s not an ordinary pill. It’s a grade-nine pill, the Skypatch Pill!” Shang Youdao looked up at Bai Xiaofei with shining eyes.</p> 
 <p>“What is a Skypatch Pill?” Bai Xiaofei’s question ruined Shang Youdao’s solemn air. He had thought Bai Xiaofei would be shocked.</p> 
 <p>“You don’t know what a Skypatch Pill is?”</p> 
 <p>“I need to know this thing?”</p> 
 <p>One question from each person ended with Shang Youdao admitting defeat. Bai Xiaofei’s expression obviously showed that he really thought it was normal not to know. There was nothing Shang Youdao could say to this.</p> 
 <p>“The Skypatch Pill’s refining method was lost. One used means one less in this world, and its effect is to give the ability to control elemental energy!” Shang Youdao sounded a little proud.</p> 
 <p>“Become an Energy Stream puppet master?” Bai Xiaofei was dumbfounded. He thought this effect was a bit embarrassing for the title of a grade-nine pill. <em>You can grab an Energy Stream puppet master anywhere in Starnet. Is it really necessary to lose so many lives over it?</em></p> 
 <p>“No, it directly grants the ability to manipulate elements without using puppets! The Skypatch Pill can strengthen the spirit of the person who eats it and becomes compatible with a certain element, thus gaining the ability to control the corresponding elemental energy. And this affinity is greater than puppets below the gold level. In other words, a normal Energy Stream puppet master will become as weak as a child in front of the person who has eaten that pill!”</p> 
 <p>When these words dropped, the surprise that Shang Youdao expected finally appeared on Bai Xiaofei’s face…</p>
