 <p>Chapter 938: A Beating will Do the Job!</p> 
 <p>“Trash plus trash will only amount to a bunch of trash. There are only a hundred spots, so don’t even think about it.”</p> 
 <p>Several puppet masters with good ears immediately threw shade before anyone could reply to Bai Xiaofei’s call. Many of those who wanted to recommend themselves immediately lost heart. They thought those puppet masters were right.</p> 
 <p>No matter what, ordinary people were no match for puppet masters…</p> 
 <p>“You guys must be talking about yourselves. Wanna fight me?” Bai Xiaofei crooked his finger at the puppet master who had been the loudest, his expression fearless.</p> 
 <p>Although he could not expose his puppet master identity, it wasn’t a problem for him to handle these Master Rank puppet masters with his fighting ability alone.</p> 
 <p>“Brat, you’re seeking…”</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, the competition is more important. There are more than one hundred puppet masters here,” another puppet master pulled the man back.</p> 
 <p>“Just you wait! I will teach you a lesson after this!” the man threatened before hitting the road.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei revealed a satisfied smile. He was just wondering who to start with, and someone delivered themselves right to his door.</p> 
 <p><em>Don't worry, this lord will wait for you!</em></p> 
 <p>Then, Bai Xiaofei resumed his recruiting. Even though the competition had just started, many people had already given up, knowing they could not rank in the top 100, whether speed or endurance.</p> 
 <p>“Little brother, can you really ensure that I will pass the first level?”</p> 
 <p>Suddenly, a dark-skinned, burly uncle came up to Bai Xiaofei with a glimmer of hope. From his face, Bai Xiaofei read he just wanted to try everything as he was desperate.</p> 
 <p>“Of course, as long as your specialty is what I need.” Bai Xiaofei smiled as he scrutinized the uncle.</p> 
 <p>“I am born with abnormal strength, does it count? My master chose me because of this. Originally, she did not intend to let me participate in this competition, but for some reason, I felt that this might be an opportunity for me. At my request, she agreed,” the uncle poured his heart out.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei nodded and promised, “Don't worry, uncle. Not just the first test, but I can ensure that you’ll pass the next two as well!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the uncle reported his name, Liao Kuo.</p> 
 <p>After Liao Kuo, more people introduced themselves with the idea of giving it a desperate try. However, Bai Xiaofei did not accept everyone and started to choose people seriously. In the end, he couldn’t achieve the goal of finding nine teammates, having selected only four people.</p> 
 <p>The other three were Liu Yishou, good at disguise; Wen Yuan, well versed in history; and Lies, extremely good at lying.</p> 
 <p>No matter how one looked, the abilities of the four had nothing to do with the first test at all, but Bai Xiaofei seemed to be in a particularly good mood.</p> 
 <p>“Although this is the first time we meet, I promise that we will become good brothers who fight alongside each other. Let us share a good drink today!” Bai Xiaofei declared with a grin.</p> 
 <p>The four teammates were stunned. <em>A drink?! What about the test?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Brother Fickle, we are now…” Liao Kuo was confused and anxious. </p> 
 <p>The expressions of the other three weren’t different. They thought that Bai Xiaofei had some kind of method to speed up the journey.</p> 
 <p>“Now is not the time. Just rest easy. If I can't do what I promised, you’re free to handle me however you want!” Bai Xiaofei declared and started walking off.</p> 
 <p>The four teammates followed with doubts, but after they sat down at a table full of good wine and food, all the worries were thrown to the back of their heads.</p> 
 <p>Nothing couldn’t be solved with a good drink, or the drink was just not refreshing enough!</p> 
 <p>The five quickly got to know each other while eating to their hearts’ content. Except for Bai Xiaofei, the remaining four people poured out their grievances as servants and quickly bonded.</p> 
 <p>These kinds of complaints were what Bai Xiaofei wanted to hear most. If they really had no resentment at all, then it was really over. Being able to complain meant they wanted changes!</p> 
 <p>What Bai Xiaofei wanted to do was change the status of men in Moonlight!</p> 
 <p>“Alright, brothers, it's getting late. Time for us to prepare for the competition.” Bai Xiaofei, who had drunk the most wine, was actually the most sober among the five. His alcohol tolerance that had been cultivated by his foster parents’ group had never lost to anyone.</p> 
 <p>However, the weight of the word ‘competition’ was enough to jolt the four teammates from their chairs. Despite their fuzzy mind, their eyes shone.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was educated on the wine table, and now several people's trust in Bai Xiaofei has risen several steps.</p> 
 <p>“It’s still not too late yet?” asked Lies with a hint of dejection. He had chosen to have this meal with the idea of giving up on the competition.</p> 
 <p>“Don't worry, it’s just the right time.” Bai Xiaofei smiled and headed straight towards the south gate.</p> 
 <p>The other four followed with suspicion. Before long, they arrived at the city gate.</p> 
 <p>Looking at the distance, Bai Xiaofei laughed. “Here they come.”</p> 
 <p>Several figures were rapidly running in their direction. The four teammates looked intently and recognized them to be the puppet masters who had laughed at Bai Xiaofei earlier. From their moves, it was clear that they had some skills. No wonder they were so confident.</p> 
 <p>The puppet master who had threatened to teach Bai Xiaofei a lesson was running at the front. Seeing Bai Xiaofei standing in the way, he cursed, “F*ck off!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei inwardly pitied him. <em>This person has zero experience of actual combat! If swearing is useful, what’s the use of improving your strength?</em></p> 
 <p>Without further ado, Bai Xiaofei leaped out and swung his fist. Before the puppet master could understand what had just happened, he felt a sharp pain and became dizzy.</p> 
 <p>After punching down the first person, Bai Xiaofei grabbed him and conveniently threw him at the people behind. The two other puppetsmiths’ first reaction was to catch their companion, but it also cost them the opportunity to respond.</p> 
 <p>Closing in on them in a split second, Bai Xiaofei took them down with two beautifully executed hand-chops, leaving only one left. This person was the only one to have released his puppet. However, before Bai Xiaofei could do anything to him, Liao Kuo had picked up a boulder and smashed down!</p> 
 <p>Having abnormal strength was no laughing matter!</p> 
 <p>“Done.” Bai Xiaofei said as he picked up one of the five iron teapots on the ground, his lips curling up.</p> 
 <p><em>A piece of cake!</em></p>
