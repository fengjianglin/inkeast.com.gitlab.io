 <p>Chapter 785: Half-Human, Half-Beast!</p> 
 <p>Standing quietly in front of the teenager, Bai Xiaofei’s aura changed from intimidating to savage. Feeling his change, the teenager started to tremble from fear from the depths of his soul. He was like a low-ranked magical beast being threatened by a high-ranked one.</p> 
 <p>It was not only the teenager. Sensing Bai Xiaofei’s wild aura, the Phantom Fox also widened her eyes in shock.</p> 
 <p>A short time later, Bai Xiaofei retracted his aura and slowly opened his eyes to look at the teenager. The latter was no longer angry and filled with the desire to eat him but currently showing respect laced with fear.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, you will follow me from now on. As long as you are by my side, no one can bully you, be it humans or magical beasts,” Bai Xiaofei declared solemnly.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the teenager froze. In fact, his particularity was not from birth but acquired. His parents had abandoned him at birth because he was born with a congenital disability, after which a magical beast whose child had just died, came across him. The magical beast used the flesh of her dead child to treat his disability, then took him as her own and became his new mother.</p> 
 <p>However, his happy days were short. The magical beast was rejected by other beasts for bringing up a human child, while the humans showed great interest in her for her strong recovery ability. In the end, she collapsed from the hunt from both sides. Before her death, she transferred all of her essence blood into the teenager’s body and turned him into an existence that could not be killed.</p> 
 <p>After that, the teenager began to wander between humans and magical beasts.</p> 
 <p>He knew animal languages and quickly learned the human language, but failed to find anyone who would communicate with him. His efforts even resulted in him being tricked and captured by humans. He had thought that he found someone he could trust, but in fact they only wanted to sell him.</p> 
 <p>Just now, Bai Xiaofei forcibly invaded the teenager’s consciousness using Heaven Wandering, an ability of the fourth realm of the Grandmaster Rank. He obtained information about the teenager and at the same time conveyed his goodwill.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei only achieved this because he was special. He also had the unique scent of both human and magical beast, the human scent being his own and the magical beast scent from Hu Xian’er.</p> 
 <p>Aside from their beauty, Phantom Foxes had a talent of turning the first human to have sexual intercourse with them into a half-beast. Such a ‘beast’ characteristic could not be noticed ordinarily but was of great use when that human had contact with magical beasts.</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er had informed Bai Xiaofei of this long ago in order to make it easy for him to find her kin. He had always thought of it as a tool to find the Phantom Foxes, but now it turned out to be an underestimation of his half-beast identity.</p> 
 <p>“You are… a brother-in-law?!”</p> 
 <p>Watching Bai Xiaofei completely tame the teenager, the Phantom Fox girl finally opened her mouth and stupefied everyone with just a few words.</p> 
 <p><em>What the hell do you mean by ‘brother-in-law’?! Could it be that he’s not human?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>…That’s right! That has to be the case, definitely not human! This explains everything! How would he beat up Exquisite Rank experts with his Grandmaster Rank strength otherwise, right?!</em></p> 
 <p>That was what Blood Wolf and Strong Steel firmly believed.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Fang Ye’s group was not so stupid as to reach such a conclusion. However, they still found this situation a bit strange because they were not aware of Hu Xian’er’s identity. They knew that Bai Xiaofei had connections with magical beasts, but they were sure that he was human from being very close with him for a long time.</p> 
 <p>“You have it wrong. Although I do have the smell of your clan, it is not what you think. However, I am helping a sister of yours to find your clan members. Now that I’ve found you, I can report back to her,” Bai Xiaofei explained calmly.</p> 
 <p>The Phantom Fox girl was puzzled. She knew that Bai Xiaofei was lying, because the smell on him could only be the result of a Phantom Fox’s absolute willingness to give herself to him.</p> 
 <p>However, she quickly guessed the reason why Bai Xiaofei lied. There was not a fox who was stupid.</p> 
 <p>“So that’s why. Thank you for your help, Young Master, this humble one is grateful. I wonder if I can see my sister?” she asked nervously.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately thought of Hu Xian’er.</p> 
 <p><em>You can see her soon, but you two cannot recognize each other! That will hurt your sister!</em></p> 
 <p>“It will take a while. First of all, you have to stay here until our mission is over, then we’ll have to cross half of the continent to return to Starnet, and then go deep into the Infinite Mountain Range!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei deliberately made it sound as long as possible. As soon as he finished speaking, there was a knock on the door.</p> 
 <p>This time, it was Hu Xian’er who entered with five people.</p> 
 <p>Seeing the Phantom Fox girl, Hu Xian’er almost rushed up. However, Bai Xiaofei’s voice rang out directly in her head and she suppressed her impulse. The Phantom Fox girl naturally recognized Hu Xian’er as well, but she recalled Bai Xiaofei’s words just now and immediately understood his intention.</p> 
 <p>“Buying beautiful women behind our backs? It seems you have really lived enough!” Hu Xian’er got to Bai Xiaofei’s side in a flicker and dragged him by the ear to the Phantom Fox girl.</p> 
 <p>“Sister, what’s your name? This guy did not bully you, did he?” Hu Xian’er asked.</p> 
 <p>“My name is Xing’er. Young Master didn’t bully me,” Xing’er cooperated with Hu Xian’er and answered truthfully. Thus, poor Bai Xiaofei survived.</p> 
 <p>“He has not, but no one can tell if it’ll happen in the future. How about this, you will be my sister from now on, so he won’t dare to bully you!” Hu Xian’er glared at Bai Xiaofei, her implication obvious.</p> 
 <p><em>If you dare touch my sister, imagine the consequences for yourself!</em></p> 
 <p>“What’s wrong with Big Sister Xian’er? I have never seen her so fierce!” Shi Kui poked Chen Hui, but the latter was confused as well.</p> 
 <p>“Maybe that there are too many girls around Brother Fei and she can’t stand it anymore. I bet his future won’t be so peaceful!”</p> 
 <p>“We.”</p> 
 <p>“Agree!”</p> 
 <p>Ming One and Ming Two ruthlessly added fuel to the fire. Everyone snickered.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei seemed high and mighty in front of outsiders, but not so much in the eyes of the Savage Class. There was nothing to brag about for a henpecked man!</p> 
 <p>However, being henpecked was already the feature of men of the Savage Class, where the girls held all the power…</p> 
 <p>“AHHH!!!”</p> 
 <p>Just as everyone focused on Bai Xiaofei, Fang Ye suddenly screamed and fell straight down. His body curled up into a ball and he kept trembling…</p> 
 <p><em>Does the Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill have a problem?!!</em></p>
