 <p><span style>The new student district was in an uproar!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The senior students were in an uproar as well!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire Starnet Academy was utterly and completely in an uproar!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The news about three seniors being hung on the dormitory of the new students swiftly swept through the entirety of Starnet Academy like a tornado.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though the academy didn’t prohibit personal fights between students, such ruthlessness was absolutely unprecedented!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, it was a junior that had hung a senior up!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many people thought they’d heard mistakenly when they heard the news, but those seniors were hanging there, so seeing was believing!</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a time, the entire academy fell into mad discussion. The seniors investigated who’d done this, whereas, the new students were researching what the New Student Mutual Aid Community was, and the assignment on the Bounty Rankings pushed this matter to a climax.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Bai Xiaofei’, this name instantly became the center of all discussion!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Bai Xiaofei who was the center of ‘public discussion’ was having a very hard time because once he made this string of decisions, the current situation was bound to appear, and he was bound to have a race with time!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, isn’t this a great celebrity? Why’d you think of coming to look for me?” Bai Xiaofei’s appearance by Bai Ye’s side caused Qin Lingyan to be slightly shocked. She naturally knew about such a large commotion, and there had already been many people that asked her about Bai Xiaofei’s background. But, she didn’t tell them and only said that he wasn’t simple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To a certain extent, Qin Lingyan had even helped Bai Xiaofei win over some time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, based on Bai Xiaofei’s situation, her efforts were still insufficient. At the very least, Bai Xiaofei felt she could do even more!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can we talk somewhere else? This place is….” Bai Xiaofei glanced at the students by Qin Lingyan’s side because if Qin Lingyan were to call out his name at this moment, then he would absolutely be captured and studied like a lab rat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, the 100 Flavor House.” Qin Lingyan grinned while happiness from taking revenge appeared on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So long as you’re happy, anywhere is fine.” Bai Xiaofei didn’t refuse at all and agreed right away because Qin Lingyan didn’t know the World Devourer technique, so she couldn’t eat much no matter how she stuffed herself….</span></p>
 <p><span style>In next to no time, the three of them arrived at the place that was unforgettable to Qin Lingyan. But, Qin Lingyan had come to take revenge this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One of every single one of these.” After she received the menu, Qin Lingyan didn’t order the best food but the most expensive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lingyan, we can’t finish all this, right?” The nearby Bai Ye was horrified, and he couldn’t help but break out in cold sweat for Bai Xiaofei. Moreover, as far as he was concerned, both of them were taking revenge on each other….</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>When is this going to end!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Wouldn’t it be fine if we packed it up and took it with us if we’re unable to finish it all? What? I only asked you to go look for him once, and you’re already on his side?” Qin Lingyan still treated Bai Ye in a cold manner, and she’d even placed the hate she had for Bai Xiaofei onto Bai Ye now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No! No! No! Absolutely not! My position is absolutely clear! I wouldn’t be on his side even if someone beats me to death!” Bai Ye instantly made his position clear as he was deeply afraid that completely cut off any chance he had.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lingyan rolled her eyes at Bai Ye when she saw him instantly turn against Bai Xiaofei, and then she turned to look at Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it? Go on. In any case, there’s still some time before food is served.” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly took an extremely deep breath when he saw Qin Lingyan finally had the mood to talk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want you to help me with the New Student Mutual Aid Community.” Bai Xiaofei stared right at Qin Lingyan as he spoke a sentence that caused Bai Ye’s eyes to stare wide open from shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother, there isn’t something wrong with you in the head, right? You want Lingyan to help you?!” Bai Ye’s tone displayed the feelings in his heart. Just as he’d said, he felt Bai Xiaofei was absolutely mad!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Insane!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look, even an idiot knows it’s impossible. So what else do you have to say?” Qin Lingyan continued along what Bai Ye had said, and it caused Bai Xiaofei to wish for nothing more than to pull Bai Ye over and strangle him to death….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, you’ll help me because helping me is only beneficial to you, and there isn’t any disadvantage.” Bai Xiaofei spoke sincerely, and he successfully drew a trace of interest from Qin Lingyan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? Let me hear what benefits there are for me.” Qin Lingyan chuckled lightly while her tone carried a slight lack of belief, and it seemed as if she’d heard a joke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t want to be bothered because of the Blossom Rankings, right? So long as you help me this time, I can help you get rid of all future troubles. Moreover, I’ll take care of all your expenditures in the academy. Your family is probably unable to give you full financial freedom here, right?” Qin Lingyan was instantly moved by the two successive pies he’d thrown out to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything Bai Xiaofei spoke of were problems she wanted to deal with urgently. Putting the Blossom Rankings aside, she did indeed have a large void to fill in terms of finance. At the very least, there were many things she wanted that she couldn’t afford now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Talk is cheap. How can a fellow like you that has to depend on others for food bear my expenditures?” Even though she was asking a question, the content of her words had changed from utter refusal to the desire to confirm Bai Xiaofei’s ability, and these were exactly the words Bai Xiaofei wanted to hear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m indeed unable to produce any convincing evidence now, and whether you should believe me depends entirely on your understanding of me. I’m unable to make any guarantees because I’m gambling as well.” Bai Xiaofei paused for a moment as he spoke, causing the expressions of Qin Lingyan and Bai Ye to change instantly. </span><i><span style>Isn’t that like trying to get help without providing anything? Would anyone go along with you and risk their lives?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“But, what I can confirm is once you’ve helped me, you’ll be repaid greatly if it succeeds, whereas, if it fails, I’ll be bearing all the risk, and you’ll be entirely capable of backing out without suffering any harm!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>When he spoke up to here, both their eyes lit up because the people that were getting something for nothing had become them instead….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then tell me to what extent is this help you require? Based on the people you’ve offended up until now, it’s impossible to ask me to make a move against them.” Qin Lingyan finally made her stand clear, whereas, Bai Xiaofei revealed a wisp of delight. At the same time, he spoke something that Qin Lingyan was slightly unable to believe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You just have to make it known that you’re willing to help me. Moreover, you just have to be there when I need you. Of course, it’s best if you bring a few friends because the effect would be even better.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So simple?” Qin Lingyan was stunned, whereas, Bai Ye had a puzzled expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, it’s just that simple. Senior Sister, even though you’re very necessary, you’re merely one of the links, so the things you have to do won’t be more than this.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as he finished speaking, &nbsp;Qin Lingyan’s brows knit together slightly. But, she didn’t frown this time because she didn’t believe Bai Xiaofei, and it was because she’d got a new understanding of Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the beginning until now, her understanding towards Bai Xiaofei would be renewed every single time they met, and this time wasn’t an exception as well!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I agree. I hope you can still create another miracle this time!” After keeping silent for a long time, Qin Lingyan finally made a decision, and it was at this moment as well that the attendants served the food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A toast to your wise decision.” After he filled two cups with wine, Bai Xiaofei slowly carried it before Qin Lingyan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this point, Bai Xiaofei’s own assignments had been completed!</span></p>
