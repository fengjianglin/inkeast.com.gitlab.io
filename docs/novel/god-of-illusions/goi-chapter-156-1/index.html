 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>Bai Xiaofei pushed open the door while supporting Hu Xian’er. The others were stunned the moment they saw them.</p>
 <p><em>Shouldn’t it be the other way around? Why is he supporting our class monitor instead?</em> All of the students of class 21 shared the same thought. The teachers from the Furnace of Agarwood narrowed their eyes.</p>
 <p>“Didn’t you say that it was the guy who was injured? What’s going on here?”</p>
 <p>A female teacher in glasses asked frostily. She was the leader of this group of teachers.</p>
 <p>“Ma’am, I was urgently in need of treatment earlier. That’s why Hu Xian’er used a forbidden technique on me. Although she was able to heal me, she overexerted herself and that’s why she’s in this state.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately lied without hesitation. In a way, what they did in the room could be considered forbidden as well, right?</p>
 <p>“All is good if you are fine. There is no need for apologies. We were only idling around at the Furnace of Agarwood anyway.”</p>
 <p>The teacher in glasses heaved a long sigh before turning and leaving. She still appeared to be displeased. Her displeasure was understandable, of course. If anyone else was called over in a rush just to be forced to wait for several hours, that person would be just as annoyed. In fact, one could say that all things considered, this teacher had quite a good temper!</p>
 <p>“Fellow students, can I trouble you to send Xian’er back to her room? She needs to rest.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei handed Hu Xian’er over to the girls. The couple did not say too much for fear of being seen through by the others. If their secret was to be found out, the thrill would be gone. On top of that, trouble would come knocking as well.</p>
 <p>“I am extremely grateful to everyone here. If it wasn’t for you guys, I would have lost my life here.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei thanked Bai Kai and the others after Hu Xian’er was taken away.</p>
 <p>“You are being too polite, Class Monitor Bai. This wouldn’t have happened to you if it wasn’t for us.”</p>
 <p>Bai Kai replied with more solemnity than Bai Xiaofei. After all, although Bai Xiaofei’s wounds had healed, bloodstains still remained on his torn clothes.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. We should be the ones thanking you, Class Monitor Bai. I have a new set of uniform here. You can change into this if you don’t mind.”</p>
 <p>Guo Hong offered his uniform, only to have Bai Xiaofei retreat<s>ing</s> two steps hurriedly.</p>
 <p>“There is no need. I will change when I go back.”</p>
 <p><em>Are you kidding? I still need my clothes to preserve my life when I go back. If I dare return wearing a new set of clothes, won’t I die miserably?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Of course, Bai Xiaofei kept his thoughts to himself, since there was no way he could say them out loud.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Oh, right. I was actually here to talk with you guys about the cooperation between our classes. Xian’er had already agreed to it earlier. What does everyone think?”</p>
 <p>Rather than using Hu Xian’er to pressure them into agreeing, he asked them solemnly.</p>
 <p>“It is our honor to be able to cooperate with Class Monitor Bai. In any case, getting through the first round by ourselves won’t be easy. Since our class monitor has agreed, we will naturally follow.&nbsp;We'll be in your care when the time comes.”</p>
 <p>Bai Kai replied, the punch Bai Xiaofei sent Fang Yuesheng flying with resurfacing in his mind. A trace of fear rose in his heart when he recalled that he had once fought Bai Xiaofei one on one as well. Fortunately, Bai Xiaofei hadn’t used his full strength back then, or else…</p>
 <p>“I will leave first then. My classmates are still waiting for me. I will see you again during the match tomorrow.”</p>
 <p>After bidding them a simple farewell, Bai Xiaofei rushed back to the Savage Class.</p>
 <p><em>Clothes, my life depends on you now!</em></p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei started cursing at his own body for failing to leave even a single scar behind. He would have a much easier time explaining if he still had some scars to show. With his reputation, nobody would believe him if he didn’t have anything to back his words with.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei reached the Savage Class filled with nervousness. The Savage Class was in the midst of dinner when he arrived. It did not seem like they had intended to wait for him at all.</p>
 <p>After taking a deep breath, Bai Xiaofei slowly pushed the door open. Everyone in the classroom turned and looked at him. Xue Ying had originally intended to interrogate Bai Xiaofei yet her brain went empty the moment she saw the bloodstains on his clothes. She went up to Bai Xiaofei in a flash.</p>
 <p>“What happened to you? Where are you injured?”</p>
 <p>In her agitation, Xue Ying pried Bai Xiaofei’s robe open before he could say anything. She was greeted by Bai Xiaofei’s toned chest, making her blush. Immediately after, frost covered her face.</p>
 <p>You're certainly well-prepared, aren't you?&nbsp;You even poured blood all over yourself so that you could get away with it?”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was immediately judged guilty before he could say anything. Xue Ying snorted coldly and pulled Bai Xiaofei’s robe closed again before turning and walking away. The other students sat back down as well and continued with their dinner. Only Lin Li lifted her head and signalled Bai Xiaofei with her eyes.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei felt like dying now.</p>
 <p><em>Good lord. I have truly been wrongly accused this time.</em></p>
 <p><em>Did you do something you shouldn’t have then?</em></p>
 <p><em>Fine fine, I indeed did something I shouldn’t. But that was for the sake of saving my life. I wasn’t even conscious when it happened!</em></p>
 <p><em>Did you enjoy it?</em></p>
 <p><em>Yes yes yes, I admit that I greatly enjoyed it...</em></p>
 <p>Two difference voices started arguing in Bai Xiaofei’s mind. The argument ended with the defeat of the voice of evil.</p>
 <p><em>It’s over. How am I supposed to explain myself if I can’t even convince myself?</em></p>
 <p>“Believe it or not, I really did fight with Fang Yuesheng today. My injuries were inflicted by his Divine Beast Transformation. Fortunately, I was resilient enough and survived with the help of others.”</p>
 <p>He had no choice but to speak the truth.&nbsp;Surprisingly, his explanation managed to get Xue Ying’s attention. But it was mainly the term “Divine Beast Transformation” that made her look at him again.</p>
 <p>“Fang Yuesheng is actually able to perform the Divine Beast Transformation?”</p>
 <p>Xue Ying asked doubtfully, her gaze fixed on Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“It was a transformation that only lasted for a short while. There seems to be great limits to it as well. However, his offensive power was truly crazy after transforming. He was trying to get class 21 to cooperate with him, which was why we ended up fighting.”</p>
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei spoke, he took a seat among his classmates. He casually took a chicken drumstick and started stuffing himself with food, not considering himself to be intruding upon them at all.</p>
 <p>“You better be telling the truth. Otherwise, you know the consequences.”</p>
 <p>Xue Ying glared at Bai Xiaofei coldly. When he heard her, a certain body part that had just gone through an intense “battle” shrunk slightly.</p>
 <p><em>Holy shit. Why must you set your eyes on my little buddy all the time?</em></p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. I am an honest person.”</p>
 <p>This invited the disdain of everyone there.</p>
 <p>“They have no problem cooperating with us, right?”</p>
 <p>Xue Ying asked again. After all, both the Savage Class’s result in the tournament and her fate were on the line here.</p>
 <p>“Of course. How can I mess up something like this?”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei grinned smugly.</p>
 <p>“Good.”</p>
 <p>Xue Ying heaved a sigh of relief, feeling less stressed than before. With Hu Xian’er’s help, the Savage Class wouldn’t have any problems advancing into the next round.</p>
 <p>“Oh, right, Big Brother Fei, I have something to tell you. The Babel Merchant House is holding a bet for the New Student Tournament.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was busy stuffing himself with food when he heard Fang Ye. He then stopped, joy spreading on to his face.</p>
 <p><em>Gambling, my favorite hobby!</em></p>
