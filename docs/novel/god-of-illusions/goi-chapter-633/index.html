 <p>Chapter 633: Investigate to the End!</p> 
 <p>“State your name first so I at least know what to call you.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s first question surprised the boss by how simple it was. The boss gulped and answered right away, “A’Da! I’ve never gotten to see my family since I was very young, so I picked this…”</p> 
 <p>A slap from Bai Xiaofei cut off A’Da before he could finish. The crisp sound of the slap echoed in the stone room but was still far cheerier than Liu Rushi’s doleful shrieks.</p> 
 <p>“Answer what you are asked. I’m too lazy for your nonsense,” Bai Xiaofei simply explained the reason for the punishment before asking the next question, “You have some Soul Stealing Grass in your possession, don’t you?”</p> 
 <p>A’Da froze.</p> 
 <p><em>How does he know about the Soul Stealing Grass?!</em></p> 
 <p>Soul Stealing Grass, a very rare carnivorous grass, released a special aroma upon maturity. This aroma attracted other creatures, but once overly inhaled, the attracted victim would fall into a deep sleep before being eaten by the Soul Stealing Grass. This grass was rare even in the Infinite Mountain Range.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had once used the Soul Stealing Grass to make something similar to A’Da’s Soul Stealing Incense, but he had used it up when he still lived in the Gorge of Heroes. Therefore, when he had smelled this fragrance last night, he was set on getting it.</p> 
 <p>“Yes… yes,” A’Da gave an honest reply despite his shock.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t tell me you don’t have any storage props. Pour out everything inside,” Bai Xiaofei, as expected, said the last thing A’Da wanted to hear.</p> 
 <p>However, A’Da obediently did as told. After lifting the link between himself and his storage bracelet, he handed it to Bai Xiaofei with a bitter expression.</p> 
 <p>Taking the bracelet, Bai Xiaofei threw it to A’Tao.</p> 
 <p>“Pour out everything inside.”</p> 
 <p>With pleasant surprise, A’Tao linked the storage bracelet, making it his own, then poured out the contents.</p> 
 <p>As the leader of a human trafficking ring, A’Da was quite rich. However, Bai Xiaofei only took the Soul Stealing Grass and Soul Stealing Incense he made and left the rest to A’Tao.</p> 
 <p>“Trash! Looking at you makes me sick in the stomach! How do people like you get to the Grandmaster Rank? Heaven is really blind!” Bai Xiaofei turned to Liu Rushi and ruthlessly reviled.</p> 
 <p>It was impossible for Liu Rushi to give any reply. A’Tao gave him quite a beating.</p> 
 <p>“Why? What’s with that look?” Sneering, Bai Xiaofei suddenly came up with an idea, a very interesting one.</p> 
 <p>Under Liu Rushi and A’Da’s fearful stares, he slowly walked to A’Da and slightly tapped his finger on the latter’s forehead. A sliver of origin energy entered A’Da’s body.</p> 
 <p>“I will give you a chance to live. After we walk out here, you will deal with him in the cruelest way you can think of. Then I will let you go,” Bai Xiaofei paused a little, his face flashing with malice. “Don’t even think about running. I just left a mark on you. If I find out that you ran, you will die an even worse death than him!”</p> 
 <p>Then, amidst Liu Rushi’s frantic groaning, Bai Xiaofei untied the rope binding A’Da and handed him his dagger.</p> 
 <p>A’Da looked at the two people leaving the room, then down at the dagger in his hand, then at Liu Rushi who was already a cripple…</p> 
 <p>In the next period of time, shrieks never ceased. When Bai Xiaofei returned to the room, Liu Rushi was unbearable to look at.</p> 
 <p>“Very good, you did a good job.” Bai Xiaofei smiled.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, a trembling A’Da was panicking. “I can go now, right…?” he asked weakly, but his eyes were full of desire to survive. To people of his kind, to be able to live was already the greatest happiness.</p> 
 <p>“Of course, I always keep my word, but there’s one more task for you.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, A’Da immediately creased his brows, but he had no other choice but to agree.</p> 
 <p>“You should also have contact with An Ming. Liu Rushi is an outsider, he couldn’t have known a local snake like you,” Bai Xiaofei hit home as A’Da instinctively gulped.</p> 
 <p>“What do you want me to do?” No matter how reluctant, this was his only possible reply.</p> 
 <p>“Bring An Ming here using Liu Rushi’s name. I don’t want anyone with intent to harm me to live at ease!” Bai Xiaofei said with a cruelty that was rarely seen on his face. A’Da felt a chill run down his spine.</p> 
 <p>“Then I…” A’Da uttered with difficulty as he swallowed repeatedly. His meek appearance didn’t look like it belonged to an experienced trafficker at all.</p> 
 <p>“As long as you cooperate, I will not kill you, and I promise my people won’t either.” Bai Xiaofei smiled and pointed to the Starnet Brilliance on his chest. “With this thing here, you should be able to believe me.”</p> 
 <p>Looking at Bai Xiaofei’s chest, A’Da relaxed. As far as he knew, Starnet people valued the reputation of their academy very much. He didn’t believe that Bai Xiaofei would do something to stain the Starnet Brilliance.</p> 
 <p>“Leave it to me, Master!” A’Da cupped his hands and solemnly promised.</p> 
 <p>“Dispose of this guy’s body. I don’t want the news of his death to spread yet,” said Bai Xiaofei to A’Tao as they were about to leave.</p> 
 <p>A’Tao looked back at Liu Rushi’s body with an odd expression…</p> 
 <p>“You actually didn’t have any reaction over your first time killing people. I didn’t expect that.” Bai Xiaofei didn’t hide his surprise. When he said this, he observed the boy closely.</p> 
 <p>“Should I have a specific reaction?” A’Tao frowned in confusion.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was speechless. Indeed, there was no rule that there must be any specific reaction. People with steel will could adapt right away, so it was understandable for someone with A’Tao’s past. Having lost two family members in a row, he was already an exception for not collapsing.</p> 
 <p>“No, I’m just happy that you’re so outstanding.” Bai Xiaofei stroked the boy’s head, but his heart inexplicably tensed up.</p> 
 <p><em>I hope this child’s experience won’t affect his future growth. Or else, if he really strays from the right path…</em></p> 
 <p>Thinking to this point, Bai Xiaofei snuck a glance at A’Tao.</p> 
 <p><em>If that happens, what will I do?</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei successfully baffled himself with his own question…</p>
