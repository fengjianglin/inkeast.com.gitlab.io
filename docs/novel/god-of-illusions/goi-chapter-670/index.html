 <p>Chapter 670: An Eye for an Eye…</p> 
 <p>“Huh? He’s sent a signal already?”</p> 
 <p>Cang Lan, who was drinking and eating to his heart’s content in the peach blossom forest, suddenly had a startled expression. Hearing his words, Leng Liuying was secretly delighted.</p> 
 <p>“Is it from that perv?” she asked.</p> 
 <p>Joy quickly spread among the triplets as Leng Liuli and Leng Liushuang immediately rushed over.</p> 
 <p>“What’s with your reaction? You lot aren’t even married yet.” Cang Lan snorted coldly.</p> 
 <p>The three girls stuck their tongues out at him at the same time.</p> 
 <p>“We just don’t want that stupid pig to taint your reputation, alright? Since you’re teaching him so seriously, wouldn’t it be a shame if he failed to learn?” Leng Liuying flattered.</p> 
 <p>Upon the word ‘seriously,’ Cang Lan turned red in the face. If it weren’t for Bai Xiaofei being tough enough, he would have starved to death while trying to catch Snow Moles…</p> 
 <p>“You three go practice. I’ll go and check on that smelly brat. Don’t fall behind when I’m not here. If he comes back better than you, you won’t find the consequences very pleasant!” Cang Lan coughed and solemnly warned.</p> 
 <p>The triplets already had no mind to think about other things. Knowing that Bai Xiaofei was returning, each was more spirited than the last. He had been away for almost a month. A reunion after a long time was impossible not to get excited about.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, grandpa, we won’t let you down!” Leng Liuyi quickly promised as she watched Cang Lan get on the Light Chaser and disappear in a flash.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei, with self-made pills stuffed in his nostrils, was carefully fishing out Crystal’s Longings from a big iron bucket with an expression as if his greatest revenge had been taken.</p> 
 <p>“Finished!”</p> 
 <p>Stowing the pile of Crystal’s Longings, he took out a bottle of powder from his storage ring, carefully sprinkled it around, and then buried the bucket.</p> 
 <p>After all this, the stench he had suffered from dissipated, replaced by a faint fragrance.</p> 
 <p>Just after Bai Xiaofei called it a day, Cang Lan appeared on the Light Chaser. Bai Xiaofei’s lips curled up into an evil smile as he grew excited.</p> 
 <p><em>Old fellow, if this revenge is not taken, my name isn’t Bai Xiaofei!</em></p> 
 <p>“Finished?”</p> 
 <p>Cang Lan’s voice trembled slightly as his eyes glinted with exhilaration. Thinking of the taste of Crystal’s Longing made his saliva unconsciously flow.</p> 
 <p>“You think too much.” Bai Xiaofei snorted, his face full of resentment.</p> 
 <p>One hundred Crystal’s Longings was simply nonsense. Unless he camped here for three or five years, it was impossible to steal so many!</p> 
 <p>“These are the rest of the charms. If you want to steal it, go in by yourself. You can’t make me do this again.” Bai Xiaofei took out the remaining six yellow talismans before Cang Lan could ask anything, as well as 32 Crystal’s Longings.</p> 
 <p>Of course, this was not all the achievements of Bai Xiaofei’s ‘hard labor’ in the past half-month, but as he had said, he refused to go back there even if he was killed. In this half-month, he could be said to have spent most of his time tiptoeing on the verge of death!</p> 
 <p>A total of seven times in, he was discovered all seven times. Because of his stimulation, each time the garrison was smarter than the last, and in his final heist, Bai Xiaofei almost died! More than 200 people chased after him!!!</p> 
 <p>Can you imagine such a scene?!</p> 
 <p>The most terrible thing was that he had been chased for too long inside during the last attempt, so his face was now remembered by many. It shouldn’t be long before he was on the blacklist of the Snow Kingdom.</p> 
 <p>This was also an important reason why he didn’t want to go in again no matter what. Aside from fearing for his life, he was more scared of being handled when he went to ask for the triplets’ hands in marriage. As for the matter that his face had been seen, Bai Xiaofei could only respond according to the situation.</p> 
 <p>However, despite his near-death experience, Bai Xiaofei’s gains were just as amazing.</p> 
 <p>In addition to the 32 Crystal’s Longings that he showed Cang Lan, there were more than a hundred others lying in his storage ring, and none of them were less than five years old. Moreover, there were two most special ones that he was certain to be the legendary ten-year-old fruit kings!</p> 
 <p>Because their color was completely bright gold!</p> 
 <p>At that time, Bai Xiaofei had spotted at least a dozen such fruits on the tree. Unfortunately, he was discovered as he was picking the second one, and after that, he did not dare to go in again.</p> 
 <p>However, what Bai Xiaofei didn’t expect was that Cang Lan was not as disappointed as he imagined, and instead full of disbelief.</p> 
 <p>“You stole so much?! How did you do it?!!” Cang Lan’s eyes were bulging as he stared at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>His question struck Bai Xiaofei dumb.</p> 
 <p><em>What do you mean? Didn’t you tell me to steal a hundred of them? I didn’t even hand in half of it here! What does your expression mean?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Did you just randomly pick a number??!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Cang Lan!!!!!</em></p> 
 <p>Realizing what was going on, Bai Xiaofei ground his teeth. At the same time, he gained a brand-new understanding of Cang Lan. This old man was absolutely trying to trick him to death!!!</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t finish your task, aren’t you angry?”</p> 
 <p>Despite the murderous waves in his heart, Bai Xiaofei forced a calm expression that was even laced with a hint of timidity.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t be angry! Don’t be angry! I set such a goal for you because I want you to work hard. In fact, ten would have been enough.” Cang Lan laughed in a good mood as put away the talismans and the Crystal’s Longings.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Bai Xiaofei inwardly sneered.</p> 
 <p><em>Indeed as I thought! I was right not to take out all the crystals, or else they’d pocketed by this old geezer.</em></p> 
 <p>“Then, can we go back now?” Bai Xiaofei suddenly interrupted as Cang Lan took out a Crystal’s Longing and was about to put it into his mouth.</p> 
 <p>“Uh-huh, right away. You don’t have to run this time. You’ve already trained almost everything you should have.” Cang Lan’s mood wasn’t just good, it was exceptional judging from the big favor he was offering.</p> 
 <p>“Okay, then I’ll go first. Since you are faster than me, I won’t wait,” Bai Xiaofei said and took out the Downwind Boat. Jumping onboard without a word, he disappeared from Cang Lan’s sight.</p> 
 <p>“This smelly boy, what’s the hurry?”</p> 
 <p>Despising Bai Xiaofei, Cang Lan licked his lips and bit down on the Crystal’s Longing. However, the sweetness he expected did not appear, but instead it was instant heat!</p> 
 <p>Devil Pepper!!!</p>

 <p>The swearing of the few-hundred-year-old man echoed for a long time in the snowland…</p>
