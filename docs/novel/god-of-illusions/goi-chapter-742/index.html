 <p>Chapter 742: No Need!</p> 
 <p>“How’s the investigation?”</p> 
 <p>In Lei Shan’s office, a rare gathering of all higher-ups was taking place. Everyone looked serious, even the principal.</p> 
 <p>“A similar situation has occurred in many countries, especially in dukedoms and kingdoms, but the source is still unidentifiable…” reported Jing Cheng helplessly. Since the eerie incident, Starnet had sent a large number of teachers and students to investigate the situation, but it had been nearly half a month without any useful information.</p> 
 <p>“Raise the rank of the mission again! As long as anyone can provide useful information, their mission will be considered completed!” Lei Shan clenched his jaw. He had not a single good night of sleep in the past half month.</p> 
 <p>“Principal, this information-type mission is already S-rank, which is already our highest level!” Chu Qingtian looked troubled. Even though extraordinary time called for extraordinary methods, once certain rules were overthrown, it would be extremely difficult to re-establish.</p> 
 <p>“Change its category to combat-type. The content remains unchanged but raise it directly to SSS!” said Lei Shan.</p> 
 <p>Chu Qingtian did not say anything. However, this time it was Luo Xi.</p> 
 <p>“Principal, I have a suggestion,” she said, gathering everyone’s attention.</p> 
 <p>“You want to send that boy?” Lei Shan instantly knew what she was about to say, but listening to his tone, it didn’t seem to be within his consideration.</p> 
 <p>“He can always create miracles, can’t he?” Luo Xi asked back.</p> 
 <p>Lei Shan fell silent. Indeed, Bai Xiaofei was always good at creating miracles, but Lei Shan knew him well enough. Once the boy got involved in this matter, he would not stop until he got to the bottom of it. This whole incident was obviously too difficult for students. Lei Shan did not want anything to happen to Bai Xiaofei because of a mission. That was why he had not disclosed anything to him</p> 
 <p>“I don’t agree. That boy is carrying two Starnet Brilliances. If he has an accident, it will have too great an impact on the academy!” Jing Cheng was the first to object. Ever since his opinion on Bai Xiaofei changed, he was more concerned about him than anyone else.</p> 
 <p>After all, Bai Xiaofei currently had an inseparable relationship with the Leng triplets…</p> 
 <p>“Holding a Starnet Brilliance means one should be protected? Do you think that’s the meaning of a Starnet Brilliance? Don’t you think it’s ridiculous?” Luo Xi mercilessly retorted.</p> 
 <p>“If you two are going to quarrel, you can leave,” interrupted Lei Shan before the two could continue. </p> 
 <p>Luo Xi and Jing Cheng instantly quieted down.</p> 
 <p>“Bai Xiaofei cannot get involved in this mission, that is my decision. From now on, no one is allowed to mention him!” Lei Shan firmly finalized. This time, Luo Xi had nothing to say. He went on, “Jing Cheng, you go personally, no matter what, give me…”</p> 
 <p>“Gramps! I brought you something good!”</p> 
 <p>Before Lei Shan could finish his order, outside rang a voice that he wanted to hear the least. The room full of people exchanged glances while trying not to breathe too loudly.</p> 
 <p>“Now is not the time…”</p> 
 <p>“I’m coming in!” Bai Xiaofei pushed open the door and barged in before Lei Shan could stop him. “Woah, it’s so lively here today. Luckily, I brought plenty of food. Don’t be courteous!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei handed all the things he carried to everyone. To say ‘plenty’ was obviously a lie. It was exactly enough for every person to have one!</p> 
 <p>“Gramps, don’t blame me for not knowing etiquette. If I didn’t come in, my half a month of effort would be wasted.” Bai Xiaofei placed a bottle of fine wine in front of Lei Shan with his usual sleazy smile.</p> 
 <p>“How long have you been eavesdropping?!” Lei Shan’s expression was unusually ugly, but it didn’t scare Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“I’ve just arrived, really! I guessed the majority, for example, you don’t want me to get involved in the Blood Diamond matter,“ Bai Xiaofei laughed as he mentioned the key phrase.</p> 
 <p>Lei Shan was shocked. The two words ‘Blood Diamond’ was his heart demon. Outside of the people in the office, no one else should know about it. Coupled with the complete confidentiality imposed on the matter, it was impossible for the students to know about the Blood Diamond.</p> 
 <p>“You monitored the teachers?!” Lei Shan’s eyebrows pricked up instantly.</p> 
 <p>This was a big taboo of the academy. Even with his great contributions to Starnet, being expelled would already be the best result for Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Gramps, you wrong me. Anyone can notice the teachers’ strange whereabouts in the past two days. You won’t even let us go out, how can I monitor them?” Bai Xiaofei made an innocent face.</p> 
 <p>Lei Shan’s anger consequently subsided.</p> 
 <p>“Since you’ve guessed what I want, then I will tell you directly. Do not intervene in this matter. Go to your classes and be a good student. Welcoming your own graduation is your biggest mission!” Lei Shan was determined to keep Bai Xiaofei away.</p> 
 <p>However, since Bai Xiaofei came, he was naturally prepared. With a slight smile, he cleared his throat.</p> 
 <p>“A Blood Diamond is a special essence stone that suddenly appeared six months ago and is still of unknown origin. Its main effect is to greatly enhance physical qualities with a therapeutic side effect. Some special Blood Diamonds can also serve as origin stones more effectively than even Starnet Stones, while some extremely special ones allow users to obtain special physiques.”</p> 
 <p>“The emergence of Blood Diamonds has broken the balance of the trading system for origin stones and Starnet Stones. Several merchant groups have started to specialize in the Blood Diamond business, and therefore are affecting many other merchant groups.”</p> 
 <p>“At present, three main production locations of Blood Diamonds are known: two first-class dukedoms and a second-class kingdom, but in fact those places are facades. In a sense, they are just distribution ports, while the real production area of Blood Diamonds is elsewhere.”</p> 
 <p>“After carefully analyzing the Blood Diamonds, as well as what happened to that person who came to ask for help, the existence of Blood Diamonds is very likely founded on the death of a large number of ordinary people and even puppet masters, which is not good news, but it provides us with a direction: there is actually only one real origin of Blood Diamonds, and we are very close to discovering it!”</p> 
 <p>From the opening of Bai Xiaofei’s speech to the finish, no one interrupted. They were all shocked silly because their investigation didn’t result in a fraction of the information he had just provided!</p> 
 <p>Indeed, Bai Xiaofei didn’t spy on the teachers, there was no need to…</p>
