 <p>Chapter 1032: Thrown-away Dignity!</p> 
 <p>“Xiaofei!” Realizing that Bai Xiaofei planned to attack, Tan Xin hurriedly stopped him.</p> 
 <p>Crossing Violethorn was the fastest route to get to Cloudveil. While she was not afraid of causing trouble, the subsequent consequences of starting a fight would definitely delay them indefinitely.</p> 
 <p>Violethorn wasn’t called the top empire for nothing. Even a small border guard could be a Grandmaster Rank puppet master among countless all over the empire.</p> 
 <p>“Just come on board if you want to check. It’s not convenient for our boat to land unless you are willing to reimburse the operating cost of hundreds of thousands of Amethyst Coins,” Tan Xin offered.</p> 
 <p>“What a joke! No one is an exception to the border inspection of Violethorn. From how you're acting, I'm afraid there’s a big problem about you, high-flyers of Starnet!” The guard leader sneered, obviously regarding Bai Xiaofei’s group as fledgling young graduates. “If my memory doesn’t fail me, we just detained a brat with a Starnet Brilliance the other day. I really don’t understand how rubbish Starnet Academy has become to give their honor medal to just anyone.”</p> 
 <p>It seemed like this was why the guard leader was so confident. This was his second encounter with a similar event.</p> 
 <p>“You said you detained a student with a Starnet Brilliance?” Bai Xiaofei suddenly asked in an icy tone as murderous intent swept out from him.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin couldn’t help but sigh. “You’ve really done it now. I hope you can learn to speak better if you survive,” she said and retreated a step. Bai Xiaofei was currently extremely sensitive about his friends being harmed, and this guard leader pushed right on that button…</p> 
 <p>The border guards also sensed the threat and immediately assumed fighting stances, but it was too late. Mind Sunder had left its scabbard.</p> 
 <p>With just an ordinary slash, the air around the guards became extremely hot, and their breathing became an attack against them.</p> 
 <p>“Spread out! He’s an elemental puppet master!” roared the guard captain in agony. </p> 
 <p>The guards hurriedly spread out. However, no matter how far they moved, the air around them still had that burning sensation. In just over ten seconds, their skin had begun to show severe burns.</p> 
 <p>“It’s useless to run. I changed the elements in the air around you into fire and gave them the effect of attachment. You are no different from being in magma right now,” said Bai Xiaofei indifferently.</p> 
 <p>The guards were horrified. <em>How?!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Tell me where the man you detained is, and I will spare your life.” Bai Xiaofei stared at the guard captain.</p> 
 <p>However, the latter’s response directly assured his ending.</p> 
 <p>“Damn brat, you asked for it!” shouted the guard captain as a familiar light barrier lit up around him – a Starnet Brilliance’s invincible protection!</p> 
 <p>The guard leader turned into a streak of light as he zoomed towards Bai Xiaofei. Staring at him, Bai Xiaofei gritted his teeth in fury.</p> 
 <p>“Die!” The guard captain’s sword stabbed at Bai Xiaofei’s chest.</p> 
 <p>However, what happened next shocked him silly.</p> 
 <p>A dark-purple poisonous fog gushed out from Bai Xiaofei and melted the sword into nothingness in just a flash. Not only so, but the fog also proceeded to reach the guard captain and immediately disabled the invincible barrier before melting away his arms.</p> 
 <p>A long shriek like a slaughtered pig echoed in the air as Bai Xiaofei walked to the guard captain with a straight face.</p> 
 <p>“Since you took something you shouldn’t have, you must have prepared to die!” Bai Xiaofei waved his hand, and the poisonous fog enveloped the guard captain’s body.</p> 
 <p>During this, the other guards had passed out from the burning pain. Tan Xin gathered them together and hung them in the air.</p> 
 <p>“Just kill them. Wait for me for three minutes.” </p> 
 <p>After Bai Xiaofei coldly sentenced the guards to death, he jumped off the ship, opened the Purple Luan wings, and swooped down.</p> 
 <p>“Blackie, search within a thirty-mile radius.”</p> 
 <p>He summoned Blackie and supplied her with origin energy. When fully unleashed, the range of her environmental control ability could reach a radius of thirty miles!</p> 
 <p>As the scenes within the thirty-mile radius flashed in their minds, Bai Xiaofei soon locked onto his target. He teleported directly into a dark room and seeing the person inside, his heart ached.</p> 
 <p>“Sorry, Chen Hui, I’m late,” Bai Xiaofei’s voice was full of remorse.</p> 
 <p>The weak Chen Hui opened his eyes in disbelief.</p> 
 <p>“Big… Big Brother Fei?!”</p> 
 <p>Upon seeing that it was really Bai Xiaofei, Chen Hui trembled excitedly, but couldn’t move further because his hands and feet were cuffed with chains.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei hurriedly unlocked the chain and then took out a pill. After feeding Chen Hui the pill, he asked, “What happened?”</p> 
 <p>“They robbed me of something. I told them that someone would come to redeem me, but then they locked me up here.” Chen Hui burst into tears from humiliation. For a puppet master from Starnet, this shame was worse than death. He hugged Bai Xiaofei tight, his voice growing more and more mournful. “I’m sorry, Brother Fei, I couldn’t protect my Starnet Brilliance. I’ve embarrassed you.”</p> 
 <p>To Chen Hui’s shock, Bai Xiaofei’s response was a slap.</p> 
 <p>“If you want to kill yourself, I won’t stop you. If you want to find your dignity, follow me out of here. If you’re not strong enough, you can keep training, but if you have no confidence, then you are as good as dead. When did the Savage Class produce a coward like you?!” Bai Xiaofei spat out and left. Behind him, the jail cell collapsed into pieces of scrap metal.</p> 
 <p>Chen Hui stared at Bai Xiaofei’s back in a long daze as all kinds of thoughts flashed through his mind. Finally, he hurriedly got up from the ground. His eyes were no longer weak as they shone with determination!</p> 
 <p><em>Thrown-away dignity? I can just get it back! Sooner or later, I will truly be worthy of my Starnet Brilliance!</em></p>
