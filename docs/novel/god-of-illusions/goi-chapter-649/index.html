 <p>Chapter 650: Hook, Line!</p> 
 <p>“Where are we going?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei, who had seen enough of the scenery, asked Leng Liuli who was piloting the Downwind Boat, which he had yielded the right to control since entering the territory of the Snow Kingdom. Although happy with the leisure, he had been kept in the dark about the destination and it felt uncomfortable.</p> 
 <p>“Toward our main business, of course. You think we’re just taking you around for a walk?” Leng Liuying retorted. She knew where they were going from the direction.</p> 
 <p>“We’re going to Senior Cang Lan?!” Bai Xiaofei exclaimed in delight.</p> 
 <p>However, Leng Liuying didn’t confirm his guess and instead avoided this topic.</p> 
 <p><em>Payback time! I’ll let you have a taste of constant confusion as well!</em></p> 
 <p>Thinking this, Leng Liuying couldn’t help remembering something else.</p> 
 <p>“You haven’t explained why you called us up early in the morning. Did you provoke someone and have to flee?” Leng Liuying hit home in just two sentences. Bai Xiaofei instantly looked embarrassed.</p> 
 <p>“Can you say something nicer? What do you mean ‘flee’? This is strategic avoidance. Or else, how would we, some soft eggs, win against a big boulder!” said Bai Xiaofei seriously with his head tilted.</p> 
 <p>“Tch, excuses!” Leng Liuying snorted and gave up on pursuing the matter as she knew it would be useless to ask.</p> 
 <p>“Here we are!”</p> 
 <p>Just as boredom was about to drain Bai Xiaofei, Leng Liuli’s joyous declaration infused him with vitality again. As the Downwind Boat slowly landed with the wind, he directly jumped down and scanned the surroundings.</p> 
 <p>However, what he saw baffled him. There was nothing around him except stark-white snow.</p> 
 <p>“What are you dazing out for? Keep up!” called Leng Liuli who sent the dumbfounded Bai Xiaofei an exaggerated eye-roll.</p> 
 <p>With a helpless sigh, the stranger to the area could only follow obediently. After walking for a while, his disappointment gradually dispersed.</p> 
 <p>The surrounding snow was gradually thinning, and spots of green and young trees slowly emerged. Such a scene might be very common in other places, but in this kingdom that was covered in snow all year round, this place was definitely a blessed land!</p> 
 <p>Then, according to common sense, this place must be inhabited by a mighty expert. For example, someone like Cang Lan!</p> 
 <p>“Why didn’t we just fly here directly, why waste so much effort?” Bai Xiaofei whined as he walked with difficulty behind the triplets.</p> 
 <p>“If you want to die, go ahead and try it. This is the territory of the Snow Raptors, who eat everything that flies. Our little boat won’t even last one round,” Leng Liuying said coldly as her contempt for Xiaofei deepened.</p> 
 <p>Being scolded out of nowhere, Bai Xiaofei made an innocent face. <em>How am I wrong for not knowing?</em></p> 
 <p>Learning from this experience, he no longer said a word during their journey, until the group arrived at a paradise. Here, there was no wind and snow, only birds and flowers!</p> 
 <p>If he weren’t sure that he wasn’t dreaming, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t even imagine that there was such a place in the Kingdom of Snow!</p> 
 <p>“Remember, you can’t use any powerful ability here in Tiny Paradise. There is an active volcano right under our feet. If you stomp your feet a little, magma may just spurt out,” Leng Liuying exaggeratedly warned.</p> 
 <p>A frightened Bai Xiaofei gulped. <em>No wonder it’s so warm here…</em></p> 
 <p>“Grandpa Cang Lan! Your precious granddaughters are back!!!”</p> 
 <p>After going deep into Tiny Paradise, Leng Liuying ran like crazy like she was set free. The words she shouted shook Bai Xiaofei to the core.</p> 
 <p><em>It’s really Cang Lan’s place!</em></p> 
 <p>However, there was no response, as if there was no one else in this small area.</p> 
 <p>“Heh, that smelly old man probably went somewhere to scam for free alcohol. It seems we can only wait.” Sitting down on a stone bench, Leng Liuli smiled as she watched Bai Xiaofei curiously looking around.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei had seen everything in this Tiny Paradise. It was not that he had good eyesight, but that there was really nothing here.</p> 
 <p>Aside from a small thatched cottage, the biggest ‘structure’ in the area was a huge banyan tree that seemed to have lived for countless years. Apart from it, there was only grass everywhere and a peach blossom forest in full bloom.</p> 
 <p>“Hey, idiot, do you want to find our grandfather?” Leng Liu suddenly asked. Bai Xiaofei instantly turned to her in excitement.</p> 
 <p>“What do you want me to do, Empress?” The clever Bai Xiaofei understood what she meant as soon as she opened her mouth. Approaching her with a flattering smile, he was ready to play submissive.</p> 
 <p>“Why are my legs a little sour?” Leng Liuying’s voice just fell and Bai Xiaofei was already massaging her legs.</p> 
 <p>“Your Majesty, is this the right amount of force? Are you comfortable?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s tactfulness pleased Leng Liuying greatly. Playfulness took over her and she began creating a variety of ‘difficult games’ for him.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, don’t mess around. Since Grandpa isn’t here, we can make use of this time to prepare. The happier we make him, the easier we can ask for his favor.” Leng Liuli was the most serious out of her sisters. Bai Xiaofei completely agreed with every word.</p> 
 <p>“Liushuang, it’s your turn.” After ‘saving’ Bai Xiaofei from his predicament, Leng Liuli turned to Leng Liushuang, whose sleeves had been rolled up, seemingly ready for something huge.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, Grandpa’s taste buds are the easiest to satisfy!” Grabbing the kitchen utensils with a smile, Leng Liushuang took out the ingredients that they had well prepared and started finesse cooking.</p> 
 <p>“Where’s the wine I told you to buy before? It’s still there?”</p> 
 <p>Leng Liuli turned to Bai Xiaofei with a question that made him scratch his head.</p> 
 <p>“What is it? Don’t tell me you didn’t buy it!” Her voice instantly grew icy.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei hurriedly fixed his expression. “I did! I definitely bought it! Only that last night I used up some, which should have no impact…” His ‘some’ was actually 80% of the wine…</p> 
 <p>It couldn’t be helped, that fellow Qiu Feng could really drink!</p> 
 <p>“Whatever you have left, take it all out and put it over there. And remember to take off the lid.” Leng Liuli pouted. Still, she assigned the task without pursuing his responsibility.</p> 
 <p>“Alrighty!”</p> 
 <p>Seeing that he was not being held accountable, Bai Xiaofei hurriedly got to work. Taking out the jars from his storage ring and setting them down one by one, he peeled away the paper lids. A variety of aromas started to spread.</p> 
 <p>Finishing his job, Bai Xiaofei frowned a little.</p> 
 <p>“It feels like fishing, doesn’t it?” Leng Liuying walked over and asked with a grin.</p> 
 <p>As if something had perfectly clicked, Bai Xiaofei’s eyes lit up. <em>That’s right! It’s exactly this kind of feeling!</em></p> 
 <p>Feeling the exact same way, Bai Xiaofei nodded like crazy. Leng Liuying then laughed her head off.</p> 
 <p>“Exactly. If we want Grandpa to come back quickly, this is precisely what we have to do!”</p>
