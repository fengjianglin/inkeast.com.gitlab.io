 <p>Chapter 765: Corrupt Young Master!</p> 
 <p>“To excel in both poison and insect arts is the world’s impression of the Southern Border people, but I’ve known you guys for so many years and have never seen you use them outside of your puppet master abilities.” Bai Xiaofei’s eyes were sharp. “And I never realized this up until that day at the rest stop. Since you two are strong enough to leave the Southern Border on your own, it’s impossible that you’d know nothing about these two arts.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei quietly looked at Zhu Sisi, who had been preparing for this conversation for four years.</p> 
 <p>“We do know, but we made a promise to someone that we wouldn’t use them to cause trouble after leaving the Southern Border.” Zhu Sisi didn’t elaborate. Just as she had said at the start, she would only say what she could.</p> 
 <p>“Next question, the Northern and Southern Borders are separated by the prohibition seal on the Infinite Mountain Range. Except for magical beasts, those who want to cross it have to pass through the Gorge of Heroes. But before I left the Gorge of Heroes, it had been closed to the outside world for five years, so how did you come over?” After asking, Bai Xiaofei added, “I ask only for our mission. You don’t have to answer if it’s inconvenient, but don’t think too much, I have absolute trust in you.”</p> 
 <p>“Monitor, are you looking down on us? You think we would worry about that?” Zhu Sisi complained with displeasure on her face.</p> 
 <p>“Yeah, Boss, that hurts! You’ve caused great damage to our hearts, we want compensation!” Xing Nan immediately chimed in.</p> 
 <p>However, as soon as he finished, Zhu Sisi kicked him aside.</p> 
 <p>“Idiot, no one would take you for a mute if you don’t talk! So slow to learn the good but so quick to learn the bad!” Shooting Xing Nan a glare, she then turned to Bai Xiaofei. “There is indeed a seal on the Infinite Mountain Range, but it’s been constantly weakening over time. Moreover, there are some secret arts in the Southern Border that can fool the seal into thinking that we are not human beings.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei’s expression became grave. “Your Southern Border is not very harmonious, is it?”</p> 
 <p>“The Southern Border is known to practice the poison arts and insect arts, but the only truly proficient ones are the peoples of Miao, while the other nations only know the tip of the iceberg. There are many forces, which is the same as in the Northern Border,” replied Zhu Sisi.</p> 
 <p>Her affirmative answer drew a sigh from Bai Xiaofei. The Windless Zone was on the edge of the Infinite Mountain Range. If there were other people with the ability to pass through the seal on it, then Windlove City was definitely not the last stop.</p> 
 <p>“Last question, if you are forced into a desperate situation, how will you choose?” Bringing the topic back to the poison and insect arts, Bai Xiaofei’s expression grew serious.</p> 
 <p>He had divided them into teams after taking the two abilities of Xing Nan and Zhu Sisi into consideration. If they really would rather die than break their promise to that ‘someone,’ then he would have to adjust his plan.</p> 
 <p>“Monitor, we are only keeping our word, we’re not fools. What’s the meaning of promises if we lose our lives? And we didn’t promise to absolutely not use them.” Zhu Sisi looked at Bai Xiaofei like looking at an idiot.</p> 
 <p>Rarely did Bai Xiaofei have such a day. Xing Nan tried hard to hold back his laughter. <em>Big Brother, you really took a loss! Now you know how formidable my little ancestor is! And you all said how nice she is! Do you regret it now?</em></p> 
 <p>Xing Nan’s inner thoughts were quite active. If it weren’t for his fear of Zhu Sisi, he would have thrown his head back and laughed out loud. This feeling of watching others experience the same ‘pain’ as oneself was too satisfying…</p> 
 <p>“Hahaha, alright, there’s nothing else. You two go get ready,” Bai Xiaofei laughed dryly and hurriedly dismissed the two. If they continued like this, he would really think that he was a fool too.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, Monitor, we absolutely won’t make mistakes, I swear to you in the name of the peoples of Miao!” Zhu Sisi smiled, then got up and dragged Xing Nan out of the room.</p> 
 <p>Left alone in the room, Bai Xiaofei was lost in thought.</p> 
 <p>It had been more than half a year since he accepted the mission. Although he had not told Lei Shan when he would complete it, he was sure that his reputation would be ruined if he could not return before his graduation.</p> 
 <p>“Damn it, I should have quickened the pace. Half a year of work for nothing!” Bai Xiaofei scolded himself and stood up with a long sigh.</p> 
 <p>He had to step up his game!</p> 
 <p>Before the sky got dark, Bai Xiaofei left the inn with Rui Mengqi. This time, he didn’t use Bai Sicheng’s appearance.</p> 
 <p>Of course, he wasn’t so stupid as to use his true face. Since the incident in Tranquil, he had realized how famous he was. To avoid trouble, he disguised himself as a random, handsome young man.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Rui Mengqi, who had a very low exposure rate, used her original appearance. Although no one knew her, she still attracted a lot of attention with her super big chest… Being beautiful was indeed a sin in itself!</p> 
 <p>“Remember, call me Young Master when we arrive at the merchant group. We are from a clan in Violethorn. If someone asks you anything, do not answer,” Bai Xiaofei carefully reminded Rui Mengqi before entering the base of Unify Business.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, Young Master, I have remembered it all!” Rui Mengqi instantly entered her role. From Master to Young Master was only a change of titles. She had fully adapted to her role of a personal maid without any difficulty.</p> 
 <p>“Very good. Now then, we shall meet this Unify Business!” His lips slightly curled as he walked straight into the building of Unify Business.</p> 
 <p>The receptionist immediately came up to him. Although also very beautiful, she was, overall, less interesting-looking than the naturally silly Rui Mengqi.</p> 
 <p>“Honored guests, can I help you?” The receptionist’s voice was pleasant to the ears. It was impossible to work in such a major merchant group without enough training.</p> 
 <p>“I am very interested in tomorrow’s auction and have some things to auction. Find me the person in charge here,” Bai Xiaofei directly explained his purpose.</p> 
 <p>The receptionist’s eyes lit up. <em>Sounds like a big boss! Huge commission guaranteed!</em></p> 
 <p>“Very well, please wait here, I will find the manager.” She led the two people to a private room before retreating.</p> 
 <p>Rui Mengqi immediately went behind Bai Xiaofei. “Young Master, you have worked hard. Let Mengqi rub your shoulders.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was going to refuse, but the comfortable feeling stopped him from opening his mouth.</p> 
 <p><em>Ahhh, looks like I can only be a corrupt young master…</em></p>
