 <p>Bai Xiaofei finally experienced what it was like to be annoyed to the point of having a headache. Ever since he had woken up, an unending stream of people had come to see him – from notable figures like Lei Shan to less notable ones like the little brothers of the new student organization. Each had visited him at some point, and at its peak, forty people had squeezed into his tiny ward. Ultimately, Xue Ying had violently cleared the crowd to give him some peace.</p>
 <p>“You mean to say I have already missed three of the elimination matches?” Bai Xiaofei exclaimed in shock, his brows furrowed. He never would have thought he'd be unconscious for eight consecutive days.</p>
 <p>“It's not a big deal. Our opponents for the first three matches were merely the classes ranked in the hundreds near the bottom. Apart from one class that had put up a bit of a fight, the other two immediately surrendered after discovering we were their opponents. Now that you are awake, I’ll leave the arrangements for the future matches to you.”</p>
 <p>Xue Ying, sitting before Bai Xiaofei, heaved a long sigh of relief. The burden of leading the Savage Class would have fallen to her if Bai Xiaofei had remained unconscious. As far as she was concerned, it wasn’t a good job…</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei thought deeply for a while then asked, “Do you roughly know how many matches we have left?” Even as he spoke, he was already thinking of his next step. He wasn't sure if it was a misconception, but he had a feeling that his thought process was now much clearer than before.</p>
 <p>“Elimination is based on a point system. The winner will gain three points, the loser will lose three points, and in the event of a draw, there will be no changes. The first hundred classes to garner ninety points will qualify for the New Student Tournament. In other words, even if we win all our matches, we still have twenty-seven matches left. Each class needs to fight a minimum of three matches per day, with no limit on the maximum number of matches.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei heaved a sigh of relief. If that was the case, there wouldn’t be too much pressure on him. He was confident they could obtain twenty-seven victories within three days.</p>
 <p>“The entire academy must have discovered we were sneaking into the Infinite Mountain Range by now, right? What does the academy plan to do with us?” Bai Xiaofei brought up a heavy topic, pushing aside the matters pertaining to the elimination match.</p>
 <p>A country couldn’t stand tall without laws. Starnet Academy might seem lenient, but they were still rather strict in matters involving their principles.</p>
 <p>“Principal Lei Shan personally covered it up. However, he has a condition for doing so.” As Xue Ying spoke, her voice grew softer, and a look of hesitation appeared on her face.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei frowned and immediately asked, “What are you dallying for? What was his condition?” He was slightly anxious as well. From Xue Ying’s expression, the request was definitely an unreasonable one… &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“If our class doesn’t place first in the tournament, I have to take responsibility and tender my resignation…” By the end of her sentence, Xue Ying’s head had already drooped all the way down. She may be confident of the Savage Class, but what if something unexpected were to happen?</p>
 <p>Surprisingly, Bai Xiaofei started laughing. “Just this?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, just this…”</p>
 <p>“Then, you can sit back and relax. With me here, nobody can hope to kick you out of Starnet Academy!” Bai Xiaofei confidently declared.</p>
 <p>Xue Ying lifted her head in a daze. After a short pause, two gentle words drifted out her mouth, “Thank you…”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei gave her a roguish smile in return.</p>
 <p>“Yo, is this still our tyrannical Big Sister Xue? Why are you acting bashfully like a little girl? Am I seeing things?” The more he spoke, the more he looked like a scoundrel, and in the end, Xue Ying couldn’t take it anymore. She smacked Bai Xiaofei on the head, slamming him into the ground. <em>There’s a limit to everything!</em></p>
 <p>“Stop hitting me! Big Sister Xue, it’s my bad!” Bai Xiaofei begged for mercy, and he was no longer smiling mischievously. With their roles reversed, a smug look appeared on Xue Ying’s face, and the stress she had been suppressing inside herself was released.</p>
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei saw the change in her, he foolishly giggled.<em>&nbsp;There are times you can comfort someone without using consolation.</em></p>
 <p>“Now this is the Xue Ying I know. In the future, you are not allowed to act like that for no reason. The change in your behavior scared me so much I thought you had your soul replaced!” In a moment of carelessness, Bai Xiaofei blurted something normal people wouldn’t understand.</p>
 <p>Naturally, with how clever Xue Ying was, she realized something didn’t sound right. After an intense interrogation, Bai Xiaofei finally told her everything that had happened in his sea of consciousness.</p>
 <p>After listening to him, Xue Ying sank into silence. A solemn look appeared on her face. “I’m warning you as well, Bai Xiaofei. In the future, do not push yourself beyond your limits in front of me. I am your teacher. The task of being a rearguard should fall to me! You may have been lucky this time, but what about next time?”</p>
 <p>Despite being reprimanded by Xue Ying, Bai Xiaofei felt as if he had done nothing wrong. “Next time? Naturally, I will rely on my strength instead. Don’t you have any confidence in your favorite student? It won’t take me long to conquer a mere Grandmaster Rank like you.”</p>
 <p>Right afterwards, Bai Xiaofei learned something new again: a loose tongue invites trouble…</p>
 <p>After another round of beating, Bai Xiaofei surrendered, but the atmosphere within the room gradually turned weird. Since they no longer had any proper business to talk about, the two of them began to feel awkward.</p>
 <p>“Uhm…that…” After trying his best, Bai Xiaofei was only able to squeeze these words from his mouth. Unfortunately, they were not enough to express his internal thoughts.</p>
 <p>“Let me take you on a walk. You have been bedridden for so long, and it’s about time you take in some fresh air,” Xue Ying suggested. She seemed to have remembered something, and a smile crept onto her face.</p>
 <p>Seeing her happiness, Bai Xiaofei took note of only one word. He inwardly muttered.</p>
 <p><em>Walk… Instead of accompanying me, you are the one who wants me to accompany you on a walk, right?</em></p>
 <p>Naturally, he had learned his lesson and thus didn’t say anything out loud. After all, what Xue Ying said made sense as well. He had never been someone who could obediently stay in bed for an extended period of time.</p>
 <p>“Alright! Let’s go now, then!”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately bounced up from the bed. The moment he stood up, the blanket fell off his body, revealing the fact that he was only wearing a pair of underpants. Xue Ying loudly swallowed her saliva. After staying in bed for eight days, Bai Xiaofei hadn’t grown weak as a normal person would. Rather, his entire body had become extremely well proportioned. The slightest exertion made his well-defined muscles stand out clearly. In addition, he seemed to have grown taller.</p>
 <p>“Weird. Why do I feel lighter?” An expression of doubt surfaced on Bai Xiaofei’s face. He clenched his fist and sent a punch into the empty air before him. Once again, both Xue Ying and Bai Xiaofei were stunned. That single punch had exceeded even what a Martial Warrior like Wu Chi was capable of throwing. More importantly, Bai Xiaofei didn't even use his full strength!</p>
 <p>“I…” After pulling his fist back, Bai Xiaofei fell into a daze. He found it hard to believe that that punch belonged to him.</p>
 <p>“You said that the Nirvana Pearl exploded in your sea of consciousness, right?” Xue Ying reacted quickly and immediately connected the dots, and at her prompt, epiphany suddenly struck Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p><em>Have I benefited from the disaster?</em></p>
