 <p>Chapter 402: Caught in the Act?!</p> 
 <p>“The second question, are you the one behind the incident at the party?” After sorting out all his gathered information so far, Bai Xiaofei used up his second precious opportunity.</p> 
 <p>“No. While I am indeed a puppet master, I belong to the Illusion Stream. My abilities are basically for self-protection. Only a rare Spirit Stream puppet master is capable of controlling others like that,” answered Imperial Concubine Qing straightforwardly. Believing it or not depended on Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“So you are a member of the Thunderstorm Bandits?” he probed. This was the only reasonable guess for her identity.</p> 
 <p>“Is this your third question? If so, I will answer it.” She calmly looked at him through the mirror.</p> 
 <p>After a moment of silence, Bai Xiaofei took a deep breath.</p> 
 <p>“No, it’s just curiosity.” Giving up this chance to know her real identity, he asked something else, “You must know a lot about the Thunderstorm Bandits, including Uncle He Tian following the Third Prince. I hope you can tell me everything you can about the Thunderstorm Bandits. I won’t ask about what you cannot say.” Bai Xiaofei was much more easy-going this time. He had learned his lesson after the fruitless talk with He Tian.</p> 
 <p>“Your demand is tricky. If I answer, won’t it indirectly say that I am a member of the Thunderstorm Bandits?” A pondering expression appeared on Imperial Concubine Qing’s face as she smiled captivatingly.</p> 
 <p>“I won’t make any judgments if you don’t directly admit to it. As you said, beauties like you can be deceptive,” Bai Xiaofei side-stepped her question.</p> 
 <p>“Little fellow, you really can talk. Seeing as you delight me, I will tell you something.” Imperial Concubine Qing stopped smiling at this. She looked straight into Bai Xiaofei’s eyes and said in a calm voice, “Tell me about your understanding of the Thunderstorm Bandits first.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was stunned a little.</p> 
 <p>“My understanding is very simple. Apart from others’ descriptions of them, I say they are a group composed of ruthless but strong people who will do whatever it takes to achieve their goals, even if it means killing their own people.” The emotion in his voice had already expressed his attitude towards the Thunderstorm Bandits: negative…</p> 
 <p>Then he took a turn.</p> 
 <p>“But talking with Uncle He Tian gave me some doubts. Although it can’t change my opinion of them, I will keep a little room of goodwill for those doubts.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei said this seriously, bringing a smile to the imperial concubine’s lips.</p> 
 <p>“You’re very honest, and there’s nothing wrong with what you said, but my understanding of the Thunderstorm Bandits is just the opposite.” She relaxed and started to tell her side of the story. “In my understanding, they dare to act upon their love and hate and have a clear opinion of good and evil. They dare to stand up bravely in the face of unfair events. Even if the final result brings harm upon themselves, their ideal will never change!”</p> 
 <p>Imperial Concubine Qing straight at Bai Xiaofei with a trace of persistence in her eyes. After a long silence, Bai Xiaofei again moved and combed the last bit of her hair.</p> 
 <p>“You are the second person to say something nice about the Thunderstorm Bandits. I’m actually looking forward to meeting them now. Although they are currently enemies and not friends, I think we will get along very well, provided that they are really like what you said.” With a smile, he handed the comb to her. “Well, since everything has been said, I should go. I hope we don’t have to confront each other one day.”</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei had just turned around when a loud announcement rang out from outside.</p> 
 <p>“The emperor has arrived at Qingxue Palace!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei froze in the spot as he felt a pang of guilt in his heart.</p> 
 <p><em>Shit, what am I feeling guilty for? I haven’t done anything!</em></p> 
 <p>“Hide quickly!”</p> 
 <p>Just as he mustered up some courage, Imperial Concubine Qing pushed him to a glass cabinet, opened the door, and shoved him in. And this was not the end. Pushing him aside, she also got in the not-so-large cabinet and closed the door.</p> 
 <p>“What are you doing in here?!”</p> 
 <p>“Hiding from the old goat of course!” Imperial Concubine Qing threw him an eye-roll before turning to check the outside. Obviously, this cabinet was special. From the inside, the two could clearly see what was happening outside and the light outside could also come in, but from the outside, it was just a normal cabinet.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, the bracelet on her wrist flashed and another ‘Imperial Concubine Qing’ appeared in the room. Examining this new person with his spirit, Bai Xiaofei could see that it was a translucent illusion shadow.</p> 
 <p>“Illusion?!” Surprised, Bai Xiaofei felt as if he had discovered something big.</p> 
 <p>“Didn’t I tell you that I am an Illusion Stream puppet master? You don’t believe me?” With a disdainful look, Imperial Concubine Qing threw him another eye-roll.</p> 
 <p>The cabinet was only so large, Bai Xiaofei saw her expression clearly. No, not to mention her expression, he could even see the fine peach fuzz on her face…</p> 
 <p>Moreover, when two people were stuffed in such a space, touching was inevitable. Smelling her unique womanly fragrance and feeling the softness of her body, Bai Xiaofei naturally had a reaction that men would have…</p> 
 <p>“If you don’t put that thing of yours away, I’ll break it!” Aware that something was off, the imperial concubine coldly glared at Bai Xiaofei, her pretended calm face flushed red.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was not the only one with a ‘natural’ reaction. Being held in the arms of a sunny boy whose special body part was still stubbornly challenging her, Imperial Concubine Qing’s reaction was much more intense…</p> 
 <p>Although she looked skilled and experienced with men, the imperial concubine was, in fact, not much different from Leng Liuying. They were both paper tigers who always backed out at the critical moment.</p> 
 <p>Having no real contact with men was Imperial Concubine Qing’s only weakness…</p> 
 <p>“I’d like to, but you think I can move?” Bai Xiaofei was helpless.</p> 
 <p>Looking at him like this, she wanted to explode from annoyance but had to hold it in. The emperor had come in and was checking the room. He was a gray-haired old man, but his ruddy face looked inconsistent with his age.</p> 
 <p>“This cabinet is soundproof. As long as you don’t mess around, no one can’t find us. Do you understand? If we are found out, we will both die. The old fogey is very narrow-minded!” Imperial Concubine Qing poked Bai Xiaofei, her face still blushing.</p> 
 <p>“What do you mean?”</p> 
 <p>“Nothing. You’d better close your eyes now or it will be bad for both of us!” When she said this, her face was already as red as an apple…</p>
