 <p>“Big…. Big Brother Fei, how many Starnet Stones did you say you have?!” Mo Ka’s voice was already slightly trembling, and he looked at Bai Xiaofei with a gaze filled with disbelief.</p>
 <p>“Two hundred. What? Look here if you don’t believe me.” Bai Xiaofei picked up his jade token as he spoke, and he displayed the number on it to Mo Ka and the others.</p>
 <p>In the next second, the sound of gulping down mouthfuls of saliva rose and fell in the room.</p>
 <p><i>It’s actually real!</i></p>
 <p>“Big Brother Fei, do you know what 200 Starnet Stones represent?” At this moment, Mo Ka had already started feeling lucky that his scheme didn’t succeed earlier because obtaining 200 Starnet Stones in the entrance exam meant that Bai Xiaofei was absolutely amongst the top 10!</p>
 <p>After all, he, Shi Kui, and Wu Chi had only obtained over 10 Starnet Stones!</p>
 <p>“What? Is it a lot?” A trace of bewilderment appeared in Bai Xiaofei’s eyes, and Mo Ka and the others started nodding madly instead.</p>
 <p>“The starting price for Starnet Stones on the continent is 100 Amethyst Coins for one, whereas, a single Amethyst Coin is sufficient to pay for an ordinary family’s expenditures for a week. So do you think 200 Starnet Stones are a lot?”</p>
 <p>As soon as Mo Ka finished speaking, Bai Xiaofei’s eyes had instantly lit up, and the jade token he wouldn’t spare a glance to a moment ago had instantly been hidden into his chest.</p>
 <p>“So in this way, this is a vast sum of wealth?” Mo Ka and the others started nodding madly once more.</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Fei, can I ask you what your position was when you completed the entrance test?” As soon as Mo Ka finished speaking, the gazes all three of them shot towards Bai Xiaofei carried a trace of anticipation.</p>
 <p>“I ought to be the first because no one had arrived at the entrance when I entered it.” When he spoke up to here, a trace of pride appeared on Bai Xiaofei’s face because no matter where it was, this was something worthy of being proud of.</p>
 <p>“You were the one that rode the Blackscale Horse back to the entrance?!” The figure that galloped swiftly past him suddenly appeared within Wu Chi’s mind, and a trace of astonishment appeared on his face.</p>
 <p>“Right, that was me.” After they obtained Bai Xiaofei’s reply, all the expressions on their faces swiftly turned into wild joy at the exact same time.</p>
 <p><i>This is a great pillar to rely on!</i></p>
 <p><i>Such a figure is actually in the same dormitory as me!</i></p>
 <p>As the same thought arose in their minds at the same time, the three of them instantly surrounded Bai Xiaofei, and their ferventness was absolutely not inferior to fans of a star.</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Fei, leave all your living arrangements to me in the future. I guarantee that you’ll be extremely comfortable!”</p>
 <p>“Right, right, right! Besides that, I’ll take care of the cleanliness of the dormitory room. Big Brother Fei, you don’t have to care about it!”</p>
 <p>“Me too! Me too! Big Brother Fei, so long as you say the word, then I, Wu Chi, will bash anyone you ask me to, and I’ll absolutely not do it perfunctorily!”</p>
 <p>The three of them spoke out at the same time, and in the blink of an eye, they’d finished arranging everything in Bai Xiaofei’s life in the future.</p>
 <p>“Stop! Stop! Stop!” Bai Xiaofei who was slightly unable to stand it asked them to stop, and he moved onto the bed to avoid them at the same time.</p>
 <p>Even though it was good if roommates were slightly warm to one another, Bai Xiaofei was still accustomed to maintaining a certain amount of distance with those of the same sex. After all, Bai Xiaofei was straight….</p>
 <p>“I know what all of you desire. Maintain a distance from me or I’ll scream for help if all of you continue to act like this.”</p>
 <p>Mo Ka and the others smiled at each other when they saw Bai Xiaofei’s hard pressed appearance.</p>
 <p>“My Lord, do you want to play?”</p>
 <p>“I can both hit and receive, and I’m much more robust than Mo Ka. Big Brother Fei, do you want to consider me?”</p>
 <p>“I only hit but don’t receive. But, I’m absolutely able to make Big Brother Fei satisfied.”</p>
 <p>As they bit their lips, Mo Ka and the others seemed as if succubi had possessed them as they surrounded Bai Xiaofei and pressed him to a corner….</p>
 <p>“F*ck, you three freaks….”</p>
 <p>“Let me f*cking go….”</p>
 <p>“F*ck, big brothers, I was wrong. Isn’t it enough that all of you are my big brothers?”</p>
 <p>After they fiercely ‘served’ Bai Xiaofei for a while, the three of them dispersed with satisfaction. Luckily, Bai Xiaofei’s physical strength wasn’t bad, otherwise, he might have really lost his chastity today….</p>
 <p>“Motherf*cker! I’ll remember this! If there’s any danger in the future, then I’ll absolutely make the three of you be the first to charge at it.” Just like a bitter woman that had been abandoned, Bai Xiaofei started to curse them relentlessly.</p>
 <p>Now, he finally knew why everyone didn’t look favorably upon the Illusion Stream. It was because he was crippled once he was approached!</p>
 <p><i>This won’t do, I must get some fighting puppets in the future.</i></p>
 <p>As he thought like this, Bai Xiaofei firmed his resolution to become an unusual Illusion Stream puppet master.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, I know that Big Brother Fei can’t bear to do that.” As soon as Mo Ka spoke, Shi Kui and Wu Chi instantly sent a seductive gaze at Bai Xiaofei, and it almost caused Bai Xiaofei to vomit out all the things he’d just eaten….</p>
 <p>“Woof! Woof!” Right at this moment, Huskie ran in the room nervously, and following closely behind him was a wave of rumbling footsteps.</p>
 <p>“Where’s the dog meat hot pot?!”</p>
 <p>“I saw it enter that room!”</p>
 <p>“Dammit! Go ask for the dog! Kill them if they don’t hand it over!”</p>
 <p>The voices in the corridor entered into the room in an extremely clear manner, and the four people in room 807 had utterly nowhere to go.</p>
 <p>“Stuff one into each of your nostrils. All of you attack when I tell you to attack in a while and hit them as fiercely as you can. Anyone who chickens out can forget about living in this room in the future.” After he tossed two pills to each of the three of them, Bai Xiaofei’s expression instantly became serious.</p>
 <p>Their reactions weren’t slow as well, and they processed everything at practically the first possible moment. Even though they were extremely afraid yet their movements weren’t slow.</p>
 <p>Choose the lesser of two evils. As far as they were concerned, between being pushed aside by Bai Xiaofei and being beaten up, the latter was more acceptable.</p>
 <p>Not to mention they might not be the side that gets bashed, but the person standing here with them was the great reliance that had obtained the result of first in the entrance test!</p>
 <p>During the time the three of them considered all this, an entire eight people had already gushed in, and the room that couldn’t be considered to be extremely big had instantly lost more than half of the space within it.</p>
 <p>“Brother, we’ve chased this dog all the way here. Can you give us face and give it to us?” The person that took the lead to speak was a young man that was even more robust than Wu Chi. The dormitory rooms had just been established for an afternoon of time, so besides an exception like Bai Xiaofei, the remaining people that were capable of gathering so many people to their side were basically those who had a fairy frightening outward appearance like this.</p>
 <p>“Huskie is my puppet. Big Brother, I can’t give it to you!” Bai Xiaofei’s entire face was covered in a pleading expression, and his cowardly expression already seemed as if he’d already been scared stiff.</p>
 <p>“Oh, so it’s your puppet. Then I really can’t eat it.” The young man chuckled, and the people behind him gradually moved into formation.</p>
 <p>“But, Brother, you can’t make so many of us come here for nothing, right? How about you treat us to a meal?” As he spoke, the fluctuation of Origin Energy was already surging on the young man’s body, and so long as Bai Xiaofei said ‘no’, he would absolutely charge forward in the next second.</p>
 <p>“How could a single meal be enough? Brothers, such an array is only worthy of being treated to a great feast!” Bai Xiaofei’s words that showed he ‘knew what to do’ caused the expression of the young man to ease up slightly.</p>
 <p>“It’s troublesome to bring so many people to have a meal as well. Brother, why don’t you convert it into Starnet Stones, and take it as making friends with us.” Finally, the young man revealed his true purpose for coming here. How could a group of puppet masters possibly be unable to discern that Huskie was a puppet?</p>
 <p>“It’s not troublesome at all. I can treat you all to your heart’s content right here!!!” As soon as he finished speaking, Bai Xiaofei who held a trace of an evil smile on the corners of his mouth instantly smashed the two round balls in his hand onto the ground. In the next second, two strands of gases that were a mix of yellow and white instantly effused out.</p>
 <p>“Attack!”</p>
