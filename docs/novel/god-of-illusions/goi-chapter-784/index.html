 <p>Chapter 784: Final Preparation!</p> 
 <p>“You want to get a Phantom Fox with only one hundred billion? Did you lose your brains?”</p> 
 <p>“Two hundred billion!”</p> 
 <p>Roars and a new sky-high bid pushed the auction of a Phantom Fox to a climax, and it was a half-transformed Phantom Fox at that!</p> 
 <p>The Phantom Fox clan’s secret transformation art did not guarantee a 100% success rate, and if failed, one would assume the appearance of half-human, half-beast.</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er had the highest success rate as a royal family member, but her kin did not have that kind of luck, such as the one being auctioned. She had an angelic face and a devilishly charming body, and her lilac fox tail was proof of her failed transformation. Yet this was already a high degree of transformation for a normal Phantom Fox. However, this degree of transformation was also the deadliest…</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er could pretend to be human without issue, but this one could not, and therefore for humans, she would make a top-class slave!</p> 
 <p>Needless to say, Bai Xiaofei knew this from experience…</p> 
 <p>“Four hundred billion!” Not giving his competitors a chance, Bai Xiaofei doubled the price. This was already his limit with the 20% discount. What he wanted was to scare the rest out of the bidding. “If you want to go higher, go ahead. I promise to ‘satisfy’ you.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing the familiar cold voice, the hall fell silent. One group of bidders had already been destroyed in the last bidding war. No one really dared to bet how much money Bai Xiaofei still had left.</p> 
 <p>Although a Phantom Fox was precious, it was just a pretty decoration for most people. If it weren’t for the fact that their clan had long vanished from the continent, a hundred billion Amethyst Coins should have been the limit.</p> 
 <p>“Five hundred billion!” a voice rang out just as everyone thought that Bai Xiaofei would win for sure.</p> 
 <p>In the private room opposite Bai Xiaofei, the curtain slowly rolled up and revealed a familiar face. It was Min Xizi, the resurrected zither expert who he had met in the Holy Snow Mountain!</p> 
 <p><em>How did this fellow get so much money?</em></p> 
 <p>“You guys wait here, I need to go out for a while,” said Bai Xiaofei after some hesitation before running out.</p> 
 <p>Standing at the door to Min Xizi’s room, Bai Xiaofei took a deep breath and knocked.</p> 
 <p>“Our young master doesn’t want to see anyone, please go back.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing the rejection from inside the room, Bai Xiaofei sighed and lightly uttered, “Snow Mountain.”</p> 
 <p>Moments later, the door was suddenly opened. Seeing Bai Xiaofei, Min Xizi’s face was filled with horror.</p> 
 <p>“How is it you?!” Min Xizi gulped.</p> 
 <p>“Cut the crap, I want this Phantom Fox. Can you let me win?” Bai Xiaofei directly stated his purpose. Seeing Min Xizi’s response, which was a troubled look, he asked, “What? There’s a reason that you can’t say?”</p> 
 <p>“No, no, no. You saved my life. I’ll pay back this favor. This is one hundred billion Amethyst Coins. You can outbid me.” Min Xizi took out an Amethyst Card and gave it to Bai Xiaofei, who took it without hesitation.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, I owe you one,” Bai Xiaofei said and hurriedly ran back to his room. At this time, Han Qing was about to say ‘Going twice.’</p> 
 <p>“Five hundred billion and twenty million!” Bai Xiaofei’s voice rang out again.</p> 
 <p>This time, his bid truly crushed the rest. No one could call higher than this. However, the real fight only began after the auction ended…</p> 
 <p>The appearance of Min Xizi gave rise to new doubts in Bai Xiaofei’s heart. Min Xizi’s money was definitely not his own, so it had to be that someone else was looking for Phantom Foxes, and this person had the according strength and financial resources too. Otherwise, they would not be able to make Min Xizi work for them and give him so much money.</p> 
 <p>If this person was not a known power, then Windlove City would only be more chaotic than it already was.</p> 
 <p>However, this was not what Bai Xiaofei needed to worry about at the moment, with more than a dozen people eyeing him. Moreover, due to the affairs with Dragon King and the sniper group who took away the Paraselene girl, he had to stay behind!</p> 
 <p>“Thank you for your support, honored guests. Today’s auction is over. By convention, please rest before we conduct the grand lucky draw for all the successful bidders tonight. The winner of the grand prize will have one of their won items completely free of charge!”</p> 
 <p>This was a tradition of Unify Business’s auctions to keep people behind. However, the smart ones would not be greedy for this petty gain, and it was definitely better for them to withdraw as early as possible given what could happen next.</p> 
 <p>This time, however, many people remained – they were waiting for Bai Xiaofei!</p> 
 <p>Looking at the crowded hall, Bai Xiaofei took a deep breath.</p> 
 <p>“Shaman King, take them back to your place. If something happens to them, you don’t need to live and see me again,” he said.</p> 
 <p>Shaman King immediately stepped forward. “Please rest assured, Young Master. I won’t let you down!”</p> 
 <p>With that, Shaman King brought the large group of rescued women and left.</p> 
 <p>“I’m going as well. That Shaman King person looks scary. They will be uneasy around him.” Qing Ya stood up.</p> 
 <p>Looking at her, Bai Xiaofei sighed. “Luo, Xia, you guys go with her.”</p> 
 <p>With that, three more people left. The room immediately felt spacious. The weird teenager growled at Bai Xiaofei, while the Phantom Fox girl stared at him with a puzzled expression.</p> 
 <p>At that moment, there was a knock on the door.</p> 
 <p>“Took you long enough. Come in,” said Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The door opened and Fang Ye’s group of four entered the room.</p> 
 <p>“Aiii, when can I have some mystery? If you keep this up, I’ll lose confidence in front of you,” Fang Ye said with an exaggerated long sigh.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was not in the mood to banter with Fang Ye and threw a pile of things to him. “These are yours. Use them all at once.”</p> 
 <p>Since Qing Ya was absent and Bai Xiaofei was too lazy to explain, Fang Ye could only look at the items in confusion.</p> 
 <p><em>How do I use them?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Eat the pill, then use all three Blood Diamonds, and then link Into Oblivion – it’s that gun puppet. Then fuse the Tri-Form Stone with the gun. As for the bracelet, you decide. It’s vampiric,” Bai Xiaofei explained as briefly as possible, then turned to the eccentric teenager. This little brother might play an important role in whether Bai Xiaofei could get what he wanted.</p> 
 <p>As for the Phantom Fox girl, he wanted to give her some more time. He believed that she would understand without him having to explain.</p> 
 <p>“Be quiet, or I can’t guarantee that you will live.”</p> 
 <p>Along with Bai Xiaofei’s icy warning, a terrifying aura spread. The growling teenager instantly quieted down. Under the eyes of everyone, Bai Xiaofei slowly placed his hand on the little guy’s head…</p>
