 <p>“I was only able to be alone with such a beautiful Senior Sister with great difficulty, so there would be something wrong with my brain if I just go back to sleep right away.” Bai Xiaofei chuckled as Huskie who was beside him barked twice along with him, and he wagged his tail endlessly.</p>
 <p>“There aren’t many people that dare flirt like this with a senior anymore, do you know why?” As her smile carried a trace of mysteriousness, Qin Lingyan stared maliciously at Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“It should be because their methods weren’t proper, and then they were dealt with. Don’t worry Senior Sister, I’m not a fellow with low IQ like that.” Bai Xiaofei’s answer was rather unexpected to Qin Lingyan, and for the first time, it caused her to feel that this fellow she originally thought to be an idiot wasn’t simple.</p>
 <p>“You’re promising. Then tell me, how do you intend to flirt with me so that you aren’t dealt with like those other people?” Seeming to have her interest aroused, Qin Lingyan grabbed onto this topic and didn’t have any intention of letting it go.</p>
 <p>“Mmm, I’ve decided to first eat a huge meal treated by you and eat to the point your heart aches so that you’ll be unable to forget me and try every possible method to get even with me.”</p>
 <p>As soon as Bai Xiaofei finished speaking, Qin Lingyan couldn’t hold back her laughter, causing her apricot eyes to narrow slightly, causing Bai Xiaofei to be dazed by this appearance of hers.</p>
 <p>“Then shouldn’t I go make proper preparations? And find someone to obstruct you because what if you eat to the point that I become poor.” After she restrained her laughter, Qin Lingyan’s eyes carried a trace of a playful expression because someone that could make her poor from a single meal seemed to really not exist.</p>
 <p>“Being able to have Senior Sister Lingyan causing trouble for me is my honor.” Huskie barked twice one more in rhythm with him, and his timing was just perfect.</p>
 <p>“This animate puppet of yours has quite the high intelligence. But, why does it seem to only be a blue-grade puppet?” Qin Lingyan squatted down as she spoke, and then she stretched out her hand to rub Huskie’s head, whereas, this fellow’s appearance of enjoyment was even slightly more despicable than Bai Xiaofei’s.</p>
 <p>“I don’t even know how he advanced to the blue-grade, he was only at the white-grade in beginning.”</p>
 <p>The grade of a puppet corresponded more or less to the rank of a puppet master, and they were normally differentiated by the color of the energy emitted when a puppet was activated. From the lowest to the highest, they were respectively the white-grade, blue-grade, yellow-grade, red-grade, violet-grade, gold-grade, violetgold-grade, blackgold-grade, and divine puppets that were of unknown color.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s tone was extremely casual yet Qin Lingyan had frowned instead when she heard this.</p>
 <p>“Your first puppet was a white-grade puppet?!” Her tone carried a trace of disbelief, causing Huskie to grunt with grievance when he heard this, and his excitement from before had completely vanished.</p>
 <p>“What about it? It’s not like he can’t advance in grade. I believe that my Huskie will at least be a violetgold-grade puppet in the future.” Bai Xiaofei was completely unaffected by Qin Lingyan, and he gestured towards Huskie, causing him to instantly wag his tail before leaping into Bai Xiaofei’s arms.</p>
 <p>“You’re really optimistic but I’ve really never seen a puppet surmount such a huge gap. I ought to leave now, good luck tomorrow.” It seemed as if Huskie’s grade has severely affected Qin Lingyan’s interest, and the communication between them that had started with great difficulty was left unsettled just like this.</p>
 <p>“Ah, she left just like that. The people outside are really just like how foster mother and the others said, all of them are extremely realistic.” Bai Xiaofei sighed as he rubbed Huskie’s head, and then he suddenly revealed a sly smile.</p>
 <p>“How was it? It was enough time, right?”</p>
 <p>“Woof! Woof!”</p>
 <p>Huskie wagged his tail once more, and his tongue that was slanting to the side was flicked up.</p>
 <p>“Alright. Since she looks down on us, we’ll eat to the point it hurts!” Bai Xiaofei rubbed his nose as he looked at the direction Qin Lingyan vanished towards, and the corners of his mouth curled up lightly.</p>
 <p><i>Just you wait!</i><i></i></p>
 <p><i></i></p>
 <p><i>Senior Sister!!</i></p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Woof! Woof!” Huskie’s resounding barks resounded in the community dorm where only Bai Xiaofei remained in, and after a while of fierce licking, he forcefully pulled Bai Xiaofei out of his dreams.</p>
 <p>“Shit! The test!!!” After jumping up from the bed like a loaded spring, Bai Xiaofei who merely wore his underpants didn’t even have the time to wear his shoes before he ran out, and his speed wasn’t any slower than someone who was being hunted.</p>
 <p>Everything comes to he who….</p>
 <p>Err, nevermind….</p>
 <p>In any case, after a period of running madly, Bai Xiaofei got on the last carriage as he leaped successfully into the carriage right when the timekeeper counted out the last second.</p>
 <p>But, the ‘horses’ that pulled this carriage was truly slightly imposing!</p>
 <p>Spiritual Rank magical beast, Blackscale Horse!</p>
 <p>Magical beasts and puppet masters could be said to be existences that both loved and killed each other. But, if magical beasts and puppet masters of the same rank were to fight one on one, then magical beasts would normally have the upper hand, and this was especially so in lower ranks because the number of puppets possessed by a puppet master was generally few.</p>
 <p>In other words, these Blackscale Horses that were pulling the carriage could beat Bai Xiaofei up to the point even his parents wouldn’t be able to recognize him!</p>
 <p>Moreover, the number of carriages like this that were sent out by Starnet Academy were utterly innumerable!</p>
 <p>The reputation of the strongest academy was really not an exaggeration!</p>
 <p>But, this wasn’t the most important thing, the most important thing was Bai Xiaofei had already become the center of attention within this carriage….</p>
 <p>The males were whispering in discussion while the faces of females had flushed red….</p>
 <p>But, Bai Xiaofei was capable of achieving complete indifference, and he didn’t have the slightest intention of being embarrassed!</p>
 <p>“I’ll give you 10 seconds to wear this!” The senior that led the group in this carriage seemed to be truly unable to bear the sight of this any longer, and he withdrew a set of clothes from his own storage ring and tossed it to Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, Senior!” As he smiled slyly, Bai Xiaofei wore the clothes swiftly and only his legs were still bare, but it was already much better than before.</p>
 <p>“Senior, what’s your name. I’ll bring you along when someone treats me to a meal once I enter the academy, and I’ll return these clothes to you at that time as well.” His nature of acting familiar with anyone he met for the first time came into effect once again, and Bai Xiaofei revealed that sly smile of his once again.</p>
 <p>“Bai Ye, forget the meal and take those clothes as something I gave to you. I don’t have the habit of wearing something another has worn.” As he continued to maintain a cold expression, the senior seemed to be very uninterested towards Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“Then we’re of the same clan! But, unfortunately, it looks like I can’t eat to the point that Senior Sister Lingyan becomes poor.” A trace of disappointment appeared on Bai Xiaofei’s face as he sighed, and he mentioned Qin Lingyan intentionally.</p>
 <p>“Who did you say it was just now?!” Bai Ye’s attitude instantly took a complete turn, and his voice was filled with excitement.</p>
 <p>“Senior Sister Lingyan. She has already promised that she would treat me to a feast after I’ve been registered into the academy. You’ll be able to see her when we return a while from now because she said she would come to receive me.” Bai Xiaofei’s expression was extremely serious. Especially when he mentioned Qin Lingyan, his expression seemed as if the two of them were old acquaintances.</p>
 <p>“You really know Lingyan?!” His surprise hadn’t dispersed when a trace of doubt appeared on Bai Ye’s face. <i>I never heard that Qin Lingyan had any relatives or friends entering the academy. Not to mention even if there was one, it would be absolutely impossible for that person to be holding an ordinary invitation letter.</i></p>
 <p><i>Shit! Based on the way he addressed her, the two of them seem to be slightly familiar with each other! </i>Bai Xiaofei’s heart couldn’t help but constrict.</p>
 <p>He’d expected that Bai Ye might know Qin Lingyan yet he never expected that he would just casually encounter someone that was familiar with her.</p>
 <p>But, Bai Xiaofei who’d experienced countless battles didn’t reveal this on his face and persist until the end.</p>
 <p>“How could I dare deceive you, Senior. Not to mention that it can be verified as soon as we return to the academy’s entrance, aren’t I courting death by telling this lie?”</p>
 <p>“What? Senior, are you very familiar with Senior Sister Lingyan? But I’ve never heard her mention you….” Under Bai Xiaofei’s effort to make an unfounded countercharge, a trace of embarrassment appeared on Bai Ye’s face.</p>
 <p>“We’ll…. We’ll talk about this later.” After he coughed twice, Bai Ye forcefully stopped this topic.</p>
 <p>“About that… meal….” His cold expressions vanished and Bai Ye’s tone actually carried an intention to flatter!</p>
 <p>“Leave it to me!” Bai Xiaofei struck his chest as he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. <i>I got through it!</i></p>
