 <p>Chapter 674: Tough Choice!</p> 
 <p>Looking at the three nervous girls, Cang Lan laughed.</p> 
 <p>“And who told me not to spread the news of your return again? You’re only worried about your father now? I thought you forgot about him after you have this smelly boy,” he teased, turning them into three bright red apples.</p> 
 <p>“Do you still want your food and wine, grandpa?!” Leng Liuying domineeringly stepped out and saved the day. Against Cang Lan, this threat was very effective!</p> 
 <p>He would finish spending the money that Bai Xiaofei had just ‘given’ him sooner or later, but his three baby granddaughters were his long-term meal tickets, not to mention the culinary craftsmanship of Leng Liushuang. Therefore, so as long as the matter didn’t violate his bottom line, Cang Lan would concede…</p> 
 <p>“Fine, fine. I won’t laugh at you. You don’t have to worry, your father is fine and so is the Kingdom of Snow. He issued that continental order because he thought the Holy Snow Mountain was worth it.”</p> 
 <p>Cang Lan didn’t explain in detail but it was already enough for the triplets, who only cared about their father’s safety. As for the affairs of the state, they didn’t have any interest despite being the only children of the emperor…</p> 
 <p>“Then hurry up and teach us. Although I don’t know what’s the big deal about this mountain, I have a hunch that it’ll be super interesting! We’ll regret it if we go too late!” Leng Liuying urged while rubbing her hands excitedly. She had even forgotten about Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, it has not reached the most exciting peak yet. You three have completed the most difficult part of practicing God Control. The rest is just mastery and proficiency. You’ll be in time,” Cang Lan reassured, then handed the scroll to Leng Liuli.</p> 
 <p>“You go cultivate, I want to sleep. As for the smelly boy, you don’t need to hurry. Believe me, if the anomaly on the Holy Snow Mountain is really related to The Ruins, your problem will probably be solved.”</p> 
 <p>Cang Lan was thoughtful enough to comfort Bai Xiaofei. Unfortunately, those comforting words sounded a little perfunctory.</p> 
 <p>In fact, Bai Xiaofei didn’t think there was much difference between ‘probably’ and ‘impossible.’ Things that would not happen, would never happen no matter how high the probability was. At least, he didn’t believe in this possibility that he could not see.</p> 
 <p>However, Cang Lan had no plans to comfort him to the end. After leaving those words, he didn’t even wait for Bai Xiaofei to reply and already started walking to the thatched cottage. An aromatic wine gourd also floated up from a distance toward him.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll place the Crystal’s Longings at the door. Remember to cleanse them when you have time, otherwise, you might as well leave this peach blossom forest.”</p> 
 <p>Cang Lan’s plain voice came out from the thatched cottage, and Bai Xiaofei, who was so irritated that his teeth itched, could only choose to be obedient. Or else, he was certain that the old man would act on his words…</p> 
 <p>After handling the Crystal’s Longings, Bai Xiaofei started to be bored to death. The triplets were busy cultivating God Control while Cang Lan wouldn’t react to him at all. Blackie was aloof as ever while Huskie had run off to the now-safe peach blossom forest to enjoy himself.</p> 
 <p>“Ahh, so it’s this tough to be by oneself!”</p> 
 <p>Heaving a long sigh, Bai Xiaofei felt the dread of ‘loneliness’ for the first time in his life. His eyes subconsciously drifted to the triplets with a trace of expectation, but after seeing their serious attitude towards their cultivation, he couldn’t bring himself to bother them.</p> 
 <p>However, just as Bai Xiaofei was ready to turn his eyes, he stopped! Attracting him was the scroll that now had no meaning to the triplets, who already memorized it.</p> 
 <p><em>Damn it! Even if I can’t learn, it shouldn’t be a problem to have a look, right? It’s a pseudo-god technique! If I don’t even give it a glance, wouldn’t it be wasted?</em></p> 
 <p>With the idea of not returning empty-handed after finding treasure, Bai Xiaofei walked over. The triplets simply ignored his actions, allowing him to grab the scroll.</p> 
 <p>Despite having received the final judgment from Cang Lan, Bai Xiaofei was uncontrollably animated. It was hard not to be excited about something of this caliber.</p> 
 <p>Slowly unfolding the scroll, Bai Xiaofei’s eyes lit up.</p> 
 <p>God Control was a cultivation method, but as Cang Lan had said, it was more like a secret art. There were very few words describing how to cultivate it and on the contrary, diagrams of energy circulation in the human body took up the majority of the space.</p> 
 <p>After reading for a while, Bai Xiaofei understood why Cang Lan made them go through so much preparation.</p> 
 <p>If what was written there was real, God Control was even crueler than his Spiritualization Art!</p> 
 <p>In addition to the energy store points located in the heart, the other six store points must also erupt at the same time, and the energy gushing out from them had to reach the heart at the same moment. Then, the impact of these energy flows would forcibly combine them into one, and they’d flow from the heart to the meridians, thus activating God Control.</p> 
 <p>And that was only the tip of the iceberg!</p> 
 <p>After it was activated, this strong energy flow would continue to impact the body. One careless move and the heart might burst without any notice. Even with a strong heart, the meridians might not be able to bear that violent force for a long time. In other words, this technique was something that hurt its practitioners before anything else.</p> 
 <p>However, it would be a different story if they were implanted with God Control silk.</p> 
 <p>Cang Lan’s God Control puppet gave him the ability to control puppets. The implantation of its silk was equivalent to an opportunistic shortcut that assisted practitioners to complete the whole energy circulation process without being toyed to death.</p> 
 <p>Although this did not let practitioners control all kinds of puppets without restriction like Cang Lan, it was enough to fortify control over their own puppets and some additional white-grade puppets.</p> 
 <p>Reading up to this part, Bai Xiaofei gulped hard. If the God Control silk was only supposed to be an aid, it should be possible to practice the technique without it!</p> 
 <p>When this idea sprouted, Bai Xiaofei’s already volatile mood instantly evolved into a storm.</p> 
 <p>Indeed, he was not wrong. If he could finish the whole energy circulation process without the silk, then he might be able to learn the technique.</p> 
 <p>However, the risk was too high, so much so that Cang Lan didn’t even dare to think about letting Bai Xiaofei give it a try, because he had no way to protect Bai Xiaofei if something went wrong…</p> 
 <p>Staring intently at the scroll, Bai Xiaofei was caught in a difficult decision.</p> 
 <p>To learn or not to learn?</p>
