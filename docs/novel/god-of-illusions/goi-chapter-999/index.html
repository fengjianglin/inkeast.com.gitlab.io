 <p>Chapter 999: Special Training!</p> 
 <p>“This is mine!”</p> 
 <p>“Don’t take mine!”</p> 
 <p>“Hahaha, I told you to lose weight! Your clothes feel tight recently, don’t they?!”</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>In a vast training ground outside Divine Light Fortress, 600-odd men roamed around a brand-new equipment pile like happy children.</p> 
 <p>“This is the training ground you wanted. Is it to your satisfaction?” Ye Qingcheng proudly gestured at the facilities around.</p> 
 <p>“Well, it looks good, but you have one thing wrong,” Bai Xiaofei commented.</p> 
 <p>“What?” Ye Qingcheng frowned.</p> 
 <p>“This place is not what I wanted, it was built for Moonlight and will definitely not be the last one. In the future, you will build many like this, and the elites I’m going to train will be your military instructors in the future,” replied Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingcheng snorted. “Like I’d believe in your nonsense. I have something to do, so I won’t spy on your ‘military secrets.’ Remember what you promised me, I’m keeping my eyes on you.” With that, she flashed him a profound look before leaving the area.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei instinctively trembled a little.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin immediately came over to him and questioned, “What did you promise her?!”</p> 
 <p>After the first experience, she had been sleeping in Bai Xiaofei’s arms like a kitten every night in the past few days, which had made her much bolder.</p> 
 <p>“What else? I help her handle the Sacks and she will help me save Qing’er,” Bai Xiaofei cleared his throat and said seriously, then hurriedly called out to Zhuang Shuo. “Bring them here after you’re all equipped!”</p> 
 <p>Glaring at Bai Xiaofei from behind, Tan Xin angrily pursed her lips, but with so many people watching, she couldn’t throw a tantrum. Just you wait!</p> 
 <p>“Boss, the 645 men of the Fickle Army have assembled. The new equipment feels great!” Zhuang Shuo reported as the rest of the members stood orderly behind him, all smiling widely.</p> 
 <p>Zhu Chunyang, the deputy commander, stood beside Bai Xiaofei in a suit specially ordered and sent from the imperial city by Ye Tong.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin and Ye Qingtong were also dressed uniquely. Since crafting women’s armor was the main business of Moonlight equipment production, the two’s combat outfits were obviously more beautiful and comfortable than the others.</p> 
 <p>At this moment, everyone only had one thought – to try out these strange equipment as soon as possible!</p> 
 <p>Yes, strange.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s customized armor as a whole was lightweight, only covering key body parts. However, the addition of a large number of advanced materials gave the armor a very strong defense.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the weapons were also on the lightweight side. The standard long blades had been similarly shaped to Mind Sunder and were already the most ‘bulky’ weapons among the rest, which were all gadgets such as spring-loaded arrows that could be equipped all over the body.</p> 
 <p>On the whole, they looked more like a group of assassins than soldiers!</p> 
 <p>“In the next two weeks, you will be receiving special training from me. During the day, it will be mainly physical and technical training, while at night, it will be techniques for martial artists. From now on, you can only rest for four hours a day!” Bai Xiaofei announced with a serious face, but the déjà vu was making him smile wryly inside.</p> 
 <p>Once upon a time, he was just like these men, being the one receiving this very same lecture…</p> 
 <p>“Go all out, Boss, we can handle it!” Zhuang Shuo fearlessly chortled.</p> 
 <p>“I hope you can be so chipper later.” Bai Xiaofei gave him a strange smile before announcing the first training content. “Now, run twenty laps around the training ground without losing any of your equipment. Every piece you lose adds ten laps!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the group of men collectively gulped as their eyes darted around. The size of the field made their legs go soft.</p> 
 <p>This is training?! You just want to kill us!</p> 
 <p>“There are still three hours until lunch. If you can’t finish by then, it’s as good as skipping that meal,” Bai Xiaofei added.</p> 
 <p>The hesitant men immediately dashed to the field. Nothing was more important than food!</p> 
 <p>“What are you three looking at?” Bai Xiaofei then looked at Zhuang Shuo, Tan Xin, and Ye Qingtong.</p> 
 <p>Zhu Chunyang looked back at him blankly. “We… also have to?” he pointed to himself and gulped in disbelief.</p> 
 <p>“Oh… on second thought, with your strength, you don’t have to train like them…” Bai Xiaofei mused with a look of realization.</p> 
 <p>The three heaved a sigh of relief.</p> 
 <p>“You three need at least fifty laps for the training to have any effect! And by the way, don’t use origin energy. This is to train your body. After all, you can’t use energy against the Sacks,” Bai Xiaofei concluded.</p> 
 <p>The eyes of the three widened in utter shock.</p> 
 <p>“Smelly Bai! You wanna die?! Fifty laps?! Why don’t you run that?!!” Tan Xin immediately objected.</p> 
 <p>However, in this respect, Bai Xiaofei did not chicken out.</p> 
 <p>“Who knows what you were doing when I started this training? If you want to stay at the rear while we go out to battle, then you don’t have to run,” he said calmly and took out grills from his storage ring. “I’m going to prepare lunch. If you want to eat, you’d better hurry. After all, you have to run thirty laps more than them.”</p> 
 <p>Obviously, the three’s opinions didn’t matter to him. Realizing his resolution regarding this matter, Ye Qingtong was the first to move. Moonlight meant too much to her and so she had to witness all of its important moments. It was impossible for her to miss a battle!</p> 
 <p>With Ye Qingtong taking the lead, the other two also followed. Although they had no idea what Bai Xiaofei had in store, they believed him.</p> 
 <p>After the training officially started, Bai Xiaofei started preparing lunch.</p> 
 <p>“Mind Sunder, ah Mind Sunder, I can only wrong you to be a kitchen knife. This place has nothing good…” Bai Xiaofei sighed as he took out a pile of medicinal materials that he had asked Ye Qingcheng to purchase.</p> 
 <p>With Mind Sunder’s ability, he changed the medicinal properties of the material as much as he could into the desired effect… Gradually, the barbecue exuded an aroma that fueled the enthusiasm of the running group.</p> 
 <p>Sitting next to the grill, Bai Xiaofei looked amusedly at the sweating crowd.</p> 
 <p>“Seems like it’s a little too much for them,” he mumbled to himself upon seeing the group switch from jogging to running like crazy. Some even began to get exhausted and needed to be dragged.</p> 
 <p>However, to Bai Xiaofei’s satisfaction, none of them stopped to rest!</p> 
 <p>When the noon sun was at the highest point in the sky, everyone had run out of sweat!</p> 
 <p>“My brother, come on! There’s only half a lap left!!” someone shouted in a hoarse voice and made the final sprint.</p> 
 <p>“Go! Go! Go!”</p> 
 <p>“Can’t let Boss look down on us!”</p> 
 <p>“Crawl to the finish even if you have to!!”</p> 
 <p>Their tragic roars echoing around the field, the group encouraged each other as they finished the last bit of the cruel run in a variety of awkward postures.</p> 
 <p>“Congratulations! You can take a rest and enjoy your lunch now. I have dug a pond for you nearby. After finishing lunch, soak yourself for fifteen minutes.” Bai Xiaofei welcomed them at the finish line with a smile.</p> 
 <p>The men were moved to tears. <em>Finally done!!</em></p> 
 <p>As the men rushed to the barbecue, the trio had also finished their laps. Unlike the others, they were very quiet, but it was clear from their pale complexion that they had reached their limits.</p> 
 <p>“Not bad, not bad. To the left you go, just find Zhuang Shuo and them,” Bai Xiaofei said, then pulled out a chaise and lay down comfortably.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Tan Xin just wanted to kick his butt. It was a pity that she had no strength left in her to do so…</p> 
 <p>At that moment, excited howls rang out from the men who were having their barbecue lunch.</p> 
 <p>“Damn!! How can food be this good?!”</p> 
 <p>“Brothers, don’t you feel as if the more you eat, the more energized you are?!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing the exclamations from the crowd, Bai Xiaofei chuckled. “Cherish it. A top-class nanny like me is hard to find…” he muttered.</p> 
 <p>After lunch, everyone ran to the pond to take a bath. The moment they stepped inside, astonishment took over them. <em>The water… smells medicinal?! Besides, there seems to be a heat flow?!</em></p> 
 <p>Having no knowledge in this regard, the men started discussing. Meanwhile, in another pond, Tan Xin and Ye Qingtong instantly understood what the deal was.</p> 
 <p>“Setting up a formation to gather the energy in nature to reforge the body, plus medicated baths and medicated meals. I thought he was joking when he said half a month’s special training, but now it seems he’s really set on completely changing those men!” Ye Qingtong sincerely exclaimed.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin also felt her anger easing a little. “Humph, since he prepared so thoroughly, I’ll let him off this time.” She stretched her body comfortably.</p> 
 <p>“What do you think he will let us do next?” With a hint of curiosity in her voice, Ye Qingtong suddenly looked forward to the next arrangement.</p> 
 <p>What other surprises would there be?</p>
