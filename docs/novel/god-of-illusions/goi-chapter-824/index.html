 <p>Chapter 824: Fiend of Pain; Blood Cocoon!</p> 
 <p>“Give me a body!”</p> 
 <p>On the seventh floor, a vague figure walked up to Zhao Ji. The latter was not surprised by the figure’s appearance at all.</p> 
 <p>“I have already told you, don’t engage in unnecessary competition with that boy. As long as our plan is completed, even a hundred Bai Xiaofeis will be meaningless.” Zhao Ji waved his hand, and several long blood whips dragged the dead Sun Shadow toward him.</p> 
 <p>The figure attached itself to Sun Shadow, and the next second, the body was alive again.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t forget what you’re supposed to do.” Resurrected in Sun Shadow’s body, Tong Fei looked up at a place not far away. There, Bai Xiaofei was coming in slowly.</p> 
 <p>“The big boss is here, huh?” Tong Fei suppressed his fury and desire to eat Bai Xiaofei alive. This was the first time in his life he had to experience this kind of frustration.</p> 
 <p>“Heh, sure enough, I knew Shadow Death couldn’t beat you. After all, this is your home field. Looks like I accidentally helped you out, even. If it wasn’t for my interference, Shadow Death wouldn’t have been so easily handled,” Bai Xiaofei said as he looked around before his eyes finally rested on the huge cocoon of blood in midair. “How many people did you kill for this thing?”</p> 
 <p>Like Tong Fei, Bai Xiaofei was suppressing his fury.</p> 
 <p>Their fury stemmed from different sources, one from his ridiculous self-esteem and the other from his respect for life.</p> 
 <p>“They are but slaves. If I don’t give them a meaningful death, their lives could have been worse. They should thank me.” Seemingly realizing what could hurt Bai Xiaofei, Tong Fei sneered.</p> 
 <p>“If you are trying to trigger me, then congratulations, you’ve succeeded. I’ve never been this triggered before!” replying with a similar sneer, Bai Xiaofei clenched his fist.</p> 
 <p>“Oohh, you’re scaring me to death!” Tong Fei ‘trembled’ and burst out laughing. “You think no one knows your current state? A piece of trash who can’t even use energy, what else can you do here except die? Still want to keep up your act? You really think I’ve grown this big from being scared?!” Tong Fei was near insanity. Knowing Bai Xiaofei’s ‘secret’ was the only thing that made him feel like he could oppress Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, a crowd of blood people floated out from the blood pool, each emitting the aura of at least a Grandmaster Rank puppet master!</p> 
 <p>On top of that, no one knew if there were higher-ranked blood people or how many more of them were inside the pool. Even when Bai Xiaofei was still at his peak, he was not necessarily a match for Zhao Ji, who reigned over the blood pool, let alone there was still a barrier between them!</p> 
 <p>However…</p> 
 <p>“Have you forgotten something?” Bai Xiaofei suddenly spoke as his aura soared. “Wang Chuan’s puppet is a Dark Descent King, a creature that’s extremely difficult to be found and will self-detonate the moment it’s defeated. From the day that magical beast was first discovered, none were able to be made into a puppet in any way. But I did it in only half a day.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei talked about a seemingly irrelevant matter until his whole aura turned into that of someone completely different.</p> 
 <p>“Because that was this lord’s deed! Hahahaha, free at last!! Oh, free air! How long has it been!!” ‘Bai Xiaofei’ laughed like a mad man who had been locked up for tens of thousands of years. However, it was undeniable that his aura was extremely powerful, as if boundless!</p> 
 <p>“Stop him no matter what! I need to hurry the cocoon!!” Realizing something was wrong about Bai Xiaofei, Tong Fei immediately went under the blood cocoon. A dozen blood threads drilled out from the cocoon and connected him to it.</p> 
 <p>Hearing that, Zhao Ji controlled the blood people to charge at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Zhao Ji, the president of the All-Around Merchant Group, was in fact just a laborer, a cover-up to hide Tong Fei’s real identity from Shadow Death. This was why Shadow Death thought that Zhao Ji had become a soldierless commander after they massacred the entire personnel in the production base.</p> 
 <p>However, it was all meaningless for Bai Xiaofei, no, for the mad man. There was only one thing he wanted to do – Use blood to signify his re-emergence in this world!</p> 
 <p>“Wanting to stop this lord with this garbage?!” Bai Xiaofei’s voice rang out as a dense mass of black fog spread out from his body. When the blood people came into contact with the fog, piercing shrieks echoed.</p> 
 <p>“How is this possible?!” Zhao Ji’s eyes widened in utter disbelief. <em>How can blood corpses feel pain? They are already dead! There’s an ability to make a corpse feel pain again?!</em></p> 
 <p>Just like that, Zhao Ji gawked as all the blood corpses got swallowed up by the fog in less than thirty seconds.</p> 
 <p>Standing in front of the barrier, ‘Bai Xiaofei’ looked at Zhao Ji scornfully. “Remember this lord’s name: Demonic God of Pain! A god!” With that declaration, ‘Bai Xiaofei’ pressed his palm on the barrier, and the barrier that had rendered Sikong Ming’s group helpless melted at a speed visible to the naked eye!</p> 
 <p>“How long are you taking?! The barrier is not holding!” Zhao Ji panicked. He could clearly feel that it was impossible to beat Bai Xiaofei!</p> 
 <p>“Decompose all the blood corpses and force catalysis!” Tong Fei said coldly.</p> 
 <p>Zhao Ji immediately followed his words. The countless blood corpses in the blood pool exploded and the calm pool churned. Thick columns of blood rose and connected themselves to the blood cocoon.</p> 
 <p>It did not take long for the blood pool to be cleanly absorbed. At that moment, loud rhythmic beats came from the cocoon, like the sound of a heart beating.</p> 
 <p>“Almost there! My babies, contribute your final power and welcome the birth of the king!!” roared Tong Fei.</p> 
 <p>The next second, fat blood worms crawled out from an unknown space that he summoned and flocked over to the cocoon, becoming another round of nourishment. As the worms were exhausted, the pulsation of the cocoon also became more and more intense.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter?! Not finished yet?! The barrier is collapsing!” Zhao Ji was dumbfounded to see the cocoon remained unhatched despite already finishing the last step.</p> 
 <p>“The one we’re welcoming is the king. Since its queen has not yet arrived, it naturally won’t come out,” Tong Fei slowly said.</p> 
 <p>Zhao Ji frowned. “What do you mean? You didn’t tell me anything about a queen or whatever!” As Zhao Ji questioned, the doubt on his face suddenly turned into horror!</p> 
 <p>“That’s right, what I use to control you is the queen!”</p> 
 <p>With Tong Fei’s sneer, the unwilling Zhao Ji suddenly burst open, and a golden worm as thick as a thumb flew straight to the blood cocoon…</p>
