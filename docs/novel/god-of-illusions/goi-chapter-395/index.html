 <p>Chapter 395: Conversation with the Crown Prince!</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness knows of me?” said Bai Xiaofei in surprise as something Huskie just told him echoed in his mind.</p> 
 <p>“I watched the records of the Blossom Ranking competition. It’s impossible for me not to know you, the shining star businessman. Not only so, but you were also able to get the lead over a dozen people to win the Starnet Brilliance – the highest honor possible – at such a young age. Your reputation exceeds what you may think.”</p> 
 <p>Imperial Concubine Qing’s words astonished the people around.</p> 
 <p><em>He organized the Blossom Ranking competition?! He even holds the Starnet Brilliance?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Now to think about it, it seems that the student in the records is indeed called Bai Xiaofei!</em></p> 
 <p><em>An elite hidden in plain sight! No wonder he has the Feature Locking Pill!</em></p> 
 <p>As amazement swept over the onlookers, what Imperial Concubine Qing had said successfully pushed him into the limelight. Everyone began to take a closer look at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness overpraised me. What I did was only trivial. To be able to have many gains, it was thanks to first, luck and second, a group of able people helping me,” Bai Xiaofei responded humbly. He wasn’t sure if there were people of the Thunderstorm Bandits lurking within the people present, so it didn’t do him any good to attract attention and become cannon fodder.</p> 
 <p>“There are not many young people as modest as you. I believe you will have greater achievements in the future.” Imperial Concubine Qing revealed a slight smile, then looked at the others. “Make yourselves comfortable. We are all here for the Feature Locking Pill as equal competitors. There is no need to bring out status at this banquet.” Imperial Concubine Qing was very modest. It wasn’t without reason that certain people could stand tall in a place like the imperial city. She was one of the few who enjoyed the emperor’s favor while still maintaining a good reputation among the lower-ranked people.</p> 
 <p>As Imperial Concubine Qing started a conversation with the princes’ consorts, the banquet began to get on track. Everyone formed groups with who they were on good terms and discussed the recent news or gossiped about someone.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei discovered a strange phenomenon as he paid close attention. As the latest event, the topic of people being killed in the imperial city was selectively ignored by all! To say that there wasn’t anything wrong about this, he’d rather die than believe it. After all, it was impossible for these idle nobles not to know about the matter.</p> 
 <p>Yet, no one dared to even mention a word, which meant Xiaofei’s guess was correct. There was definitely a powerful person intervening, and this person was likely to be the happily chatting Imperial Concubine Qing. Just now, Huskie wasn’t praising her for being beautiful but was telling Bai Xiaofei that she was a puppet master, and a powerful one at that!</p> 
 <p>However, Huskie couldn’t tell exactly how strong she was, not to mention Bai Xiaofei. In his view, Imperial Concubine Qing was a normal, fragile person… To be exact, this was how everyone else perceived her as well.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Xiaofei, let’s get to know each other. I’m Gu Heng.”</p> 
 <p>Just when Bai Xiaofei was observing the crowd, the crown prince’s sudden goodwill startled him a little. He had been wondering how to strike up a conversation with Gu Heng as well.</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness is too polite, I should have gone to you first. I’m ashamed,” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly replied with an awkward laugh.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t be modest, my brother. Your future will be much better than a little crown prince like me. Every owner of the Starnet Brilliance becomes a mighty figure in the end. I just want to invest in advance,” Gu Heng flattered with some truth in it. Bai Xiaofei couldn’t pick out any discourtesy from his words.</p> 
 <p><em>If your future development turns out great, then I will make a fortune. If you flop, it will have no impact on me. Showing a little goodwill is not going to cost me anything anyway. Acting aloof at a time like this is the real brain-dead move!</em></p> 
 <p>“Then I will count on your blessing,” Bai Xiaofei said and raised his glass. The alcohol tolerance he had trained hard back in the Savage Class finally came in handy.</p> 
 <p>“Brother, may I know how you are going to give away the Feature Locking Pill?” When the crown prince got to business, his wife not far away looked over with shining eyes. Obviously, Gu Heng was forced to go probing by her…</p> 
 <p>“I actually have to keep a lid on this one. I can’t afford to offend anyone present. I hope Your Royal Highness won’t make it difficult on this little brother,” Bai Xiaofei politely refused with a wry smile.</p> 
 <p>“Of course, of course… I was too abrupt. It’s all because that wife of mine insisted I come to ask. You know, this thing is a bit too alluring to women.” Gu Heng looked a little embarrassed but his tone was relaxed. Having asked this question, the stone pressing down on his heart was finally unloaded.</p> 
 <p>“I understand, otherwise, it’s impossible for me and the Bright Road Merchant House to enter a grand place like this for a banquet.” Bai Xiaofei actually understood Gu Heng. He had witnessed for himself the power of the Feature Locking Pill in Starnet. The proud girls of the Blossom Ranking worked really hard for over a month for a chance to get this thing.</p> 
 <p>“But then again, my brother, for you to give out such a pricey stunner, you must have another motive.” His eyes abruptly grew sharp as Gu Heng stared straight into Bai Xiaofei’s eyes as if wanting to dig out something from his reaction.</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness, you should be able to guess what I am striving for. After all, we have only one purpose for this trip to Ancient Yue.” Bai Xiaofei didn’t give a direct answer, but it was already obvious.</p> 
 <p>“If that’s the case, I advise you not to interfere further, my brother. Getting out early will only do you good. The water runs too deep in this one,” Gu Heng lowered his voice and said to Bai Xiaofei after making sure that no one else could hear.</p> 
 <p>This was the second time Bai Xiaofei had heard those words.</p> 
 <p><em>How deep is the water in this Ancient Yue Kingdom? This lord refuses to give in! Even if you are a bottomless pit, I shall go down and find out!</em></p> 
 <p>“Leaving is impossible. I can afford to lose this face, but Starnet can’t. The Starnet Brilliance on me is no decoration.” Bai Xiaofei acted helpless and sighed.</p> 
 <p>“In that case, I can only wish you good luck, brother.” Gu Heng didn’t continue to persuade Bai Xiaofei otherwise, and he seemed to have no intention to end the topic at all. His reaction made Bai Xiaofei’s eyes lit up!</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness, you…”</p> 
 <p>“Shh!” Making a gesture to be silent, Gu Heng cast Bai Xiaofei a meaningful look. Then, with a smile, he gave a ray of hope, “Some things aren’t suitable to be said on this occasion. If there is a chance, we should meet again after this. I hope that you give me the honor when the time comes.”</p> 
 <p>“Definitely, as long as it’s convenient for you, Your Highness. I will be on your call during my stay in Nabu City.” Bai Xiaofei cupped his fist to Gu Heng, so elated that he just wanted to give the guy a big loving hug.</p> 
 <p>Sure enough, the massive gamble had paid off!</p>
