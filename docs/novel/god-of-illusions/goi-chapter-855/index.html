 <p>Chapter 855: Conversation with Yun Tianhe!</p> 
 <p>“Since you came across them, you should already know what I do. So, what do you think of this matter?”</p> 
 <p>Slick and sly, Yun Tianhe was a qualified politician. His implication was obvious: ‘If you didn’t really see what you claimed to, don’t even think of digging anything from me.’</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei naturally understood. <em>Since there aren’t outsiders present, I’ll just tell you what you want to hear!</em></p> 
 <p>“Quite simple. First, this matter definitely concerns your high-ranked puppet masters. Second, this is no trivial situation. Third, if I don’t guess wrong, it’s still not too late to fix it.” Bai Xiaofei looked Yun Tianhe in the eyes, “That person’s skill should not have been perfected yet, otherwise, they would not stop at just normal people.”</p> 
 <p>With that said out loud, there was no longer anything to avoid.</p> 
 <p>“Since Brother Bai has made it so clear, I will not hide from you,” Yun Tianhe conceded with a long sigh.</p> 
 <p><em>Sure enough, grandpa’s praises for him are no exaggeration!</em></p> 
 <p>He continued, “Remote control of puppets definitely uses our new technology. However, we have not restricted anyone from learning it, so it is very difficult to investigate from this aspect. Therefore, I came here not only to quell the chaos but also for on-site investigation, to see if there are any clues at all.”</p> 
 <p>Now that Yun Tianhe had revealed what he had, Bai Xiaofei also relaxed.</p> 
 <p>“Quelling the chaos is no problem, but forget about clues. Not to mention their command to self-detonate, even if they didn’t have it, we still wouldn’t find anything, unless you guys can tell who created a puppet by just looking at it,” Bai Xiaofei ruthlessly stated.</p> 
 <p>However, he did not expect that this failed to faze Yun Tianhe.</p> 
 <p>“We actually can,” Yun Tianhe said nonchalantly.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei nearly spat out the seafood soup he was drinking.</p> 
 <p>“What?! Seriously?!” His face full of disbelief, Bai Xiaofei suddenly felt that he was still too green.</p> 
 <p>“Well, although the result isn’t 100%, it’s still possible to find a direction. Every smith has their own method of forging puppets and a fixed habit in techniques and choosing materials. All of our high-ranked puppet masters are registered in detail. If we can capture a finished product, we can narrow down the scope to a certain extent.” Yun Tianhe sighed as he looked troubled. “Unfortunately, from what you’ve said, that person set a self-detonation command. It’s impossible to catch such a puppet.”</p> 
 <p>“That I can do!” Bai Xiaofei declared seriously, also surprising Yun Tianhe once.</p> 
 <p>“How?! Even an Exquisite Rank puppet master can’t stop the auto-activation of commands. Can you actually stop a puppet in the middle of self-detonation? Even so, the internal structure will still be damaged and there’s no way to analyze it,” Yun Tianhe ran through the possibilities from a professional point of view.</p> 
 <p>“Have you heard of God Control?” Bai Xiaofei said with a smile.</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe was speechless. If it was the God Control Technique, it would be absolutely no problem to catch an ownerless puppet, since the art allowed the user to gain ownership of that puppet and disallow it from blowing up.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai, don’t tell me that you know God Control. Senior Cang Lan is said to be in the Snow Kingdom.” Yun Tianhe was a little unconvinced. As far as he knew, Bai Xiaofei already had a variety of secret arts. If they added God Control to that… <em>Damn it, can you let us ordinary puppet masters live?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Well, the old drunkard is indeed in the Snow Kingdom. I also learned God Control there. Although it is not the normal version, it’s not a problem to control white grade puppets,” Bai Xiaofei replied with a smirk.</p> 
 <p>Thus, this troublesome problem was solved. What was lacking was only implementation!</p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai, a toast to you, seriously!” Yun Tianhe was overjoyed when he saw that Bai Xiaofei was not joking. Talking about traveling far and wide looking for something, only to find it so easily. With Bai Xiaofei’s help, his trip to the border might just be finished early.</p> 
 <p>“Happy cooperation!” Bai Xiaofei raised his cup and drained it. Then, he hurriedly started a food competition with Huskie!</p> 
 <p>The Yun brothers suddenly felt their eyes weren’t enough to process what was going on. The eating speed of Bai Xiaofei and Huskie could match that of a storm!</p> 
 <p>“Brother, they really won’t have a problem eating like that…?” A shocked Yun Tianhai hadn’t eaten anything yet but had gulped countless times.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t ask me, I don’t know.” Yun Tianhe also swallowed with difficulty. <em>Fortunately, he paid for this meal himself…</em></p> 
 <p>After Qin Lingyan, another person who was scared to invite Bai Xiaofei to meals was born.</p> 
 <p>The lunch lasted all the way into dinnertime. If it wasn’t that Bai Xiaofei was embarrassed to keep Yun Tianhe waiting, he would have ordered dinner.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai, although it’s already a little late, we…” suggested Yun Tianhe awkwardly, the word ‘urgent’ written on his face. He originally planned to ask around first before searching for clues, but after getting Bai Xiaofei’s guarantee, he just could not wait to get right to it ––</p> 
 <p>Outside inns certainly could not be as comfortable as his house back in the imperial city!</p> 
 <p>“Mhm, I plan to start as soon as possible, too. The longer it drags on, the more inconvenient it will be for us,” Bai Xiaofei said righteously, as if it wasn’t him who had been eating and eating. Then he asked, “But do you know where to look?”</p> 
 <p>Upon this question, Yun Tianhe stared blankly at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai, didn’t you say that you ran into them?”</p> 
 <p>“Yeah, but I also said they all blew themselves up. I didn’t know they had the skill at that time…”</p> 
 <p>Just like that, the two stared at each other with small beady eyes. After a while, they burst out laughing.</p> 
 <p>“Baby steps, it seems.” Yun Tianhe shook his head with a wry smile.</p> 
 <p>“Not necessarily, Brother Yun. I’m afraid you seldom deal with mercenaries.” Bai Xiaofei chuckled. He had already thought up a new plan.</p> 
 <p>Problems that could be solved by money were not problems at all, and mercenaries were definitely the best implementers of this principle!</p> 
 <p><em>Since the situation in the ghost village is so particular, it shouldn’t be a problem for them…</em></p>
