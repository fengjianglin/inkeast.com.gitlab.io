 <p>Chapter 374: Yun Jingshuang Repays a Debt of Gratitude!</p> 
 <p>“In fact, I made two preparations before coming out. One is my act with Brother Feng, which was only for you to see and force you into choosing one out of two options. So long as you ‘figured it out’, my chance of winning would be 50%.”</p> 
 <p>“As for why I am sure that you have the intelligence, it’s actually simple. Rash people won’t have your patience, and patient people are no fools. Since you were willing to wait for me to have my meal for so long, it means that you are a patient person who came prepared!”</p> 
 <p>“So, I set up everything based on what you would have understood of me. You said that I disguised as Brother Feng, while in fact, it’s the opposite. It was Brother Feng who acted as me, and he succeeded.”</p> 
 <p>“True or false, false or true, all is fair in war, so this time, you lost.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei explained with a smile. Chu Tianyi was sincerely convinced.</p> 
 <p>With lingering unwillingness, Chu Tianyi asked, “What is your second preparation?” </p> 
 <p>“Preparation for a hard fight! In this kind of one-on-one, as long as you haven’t reached the Grandmaster Rank, I have absolute confidence to win! Because I dare to bet that you won’t attack my weak points under the gaze of so many people!”</p> 
 <p>This shook Chu Tianyi.</p> 
 <p><em>It turns out that I already lost when I proposed a one-on-one duel, and here I was so full of confidence…</em></p> 
 <p>“Alright, no need to be so tense. After all, we’ll all be family in the future.” Feng Wuhen stepped out as a peacemaker right after Bai Xiaofei finished.</p> 
 <p>Chu Tianyi revealed a pained smile. <em>I actually sold myself for three years just like that! Is this why they all say don’t look for Bai Xiaofei if you don’t want to die? He truly deserves his reputation.</em></p> 
 <p>Suddenly, Bai Xiaofei became serious, his face icy as if he wanted to eat someone alive.</p> 
 <p>“Family or not, there is one thing I must make clear.” His cold tone startled everyone, even Feng Wuhen, and Lu Lingyun.</p> 
 <p><em>What’s going on?</em></p> 
 <p>Slowly walking up to Chu Tianyi, Bai Xiaofei’s eyes were filled with an unprecedented cold.</p> 
 <p>“This time, I deem you innocent since you weren’t informed, but remember, Chu Liuyun is mine, so don’t have ideas about her, or I will kill you!”</p> 
 <p>As his voice coldly echoed, the nearest audience, Chu Tianyi, couldn’t help shed a drop of cold sweat. He could tell that Bai Xiaofei was not joking!</p> 
 <p>Unlike Chu Tianyi, the onlookers paid more attention to something else.</p> 
 <p><em>Chu Liuyun is his woman?! Could it be…</em></p> 
 <p>As a variety of contents were automatically generated by their imaginations, Bai Xiaofei was surrounded by surprised faces staring at him and started to panic.</p> 
 <p><em>Why do I suddenly have a bad feeling?</em></p> 
 <p>“Brother Feng, please take it from here and explain to our new employee his tasks. I have something to discuss with Brother Lu!”</p> 
 <p>Sensing that the atmosphere was wrong, Bai Xiaofei immediately took Lu Lingyun and ran off after throwing the mess to Feng Wuhen.</p> 
 <p>“Erm, always leaving your own people behind to shoulder your mess, doesn’t it prick your conscience?” After running to a safe place, Lu Lingyun asked on behalf of the employees.</p> 
 <p>And Bai Xiaofei’s answer petrified him.</p> 
 <p>“No, I went through so much trouble to pull you guys to solve my problems; everything so far is but a small test. If you can’t endure this level of wind and waves, how are you going to achieve great things in the future? I only mean well! Brother Lu, your understanding is not deep enough!”</p> 
 <p>Lu Lingyun blinked blankly.</p> 
 <p><em>That… makes sense… But why do I still feel like something is off?</em></p> 
 <p>“Wait, no! You clearly…”</p> 
 <p>When Lu Lingyun returned to his senses and wanted to complain, he found that Bai Xiaofei had run off without his notice.</p> 
 <p><em>How can I give you a chance to complain! If you complain too much, I may have to pay more, and that’s still okay, but what if you can’t handle it and quit? Who will face my problems for me?!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei, who once again dodged a bullet, was feeling proud in his heart, not knowing a tragedy was soon upon him…</p> 
 <p>Humming a little song as he happily walked towards the Demon of Illusions, Bai Xiaofei was already thinking about the next arrangement, and then he realized a problem – He had nothing to do after the Blossom Ranking competition.</p> 
 <p>At this thought, Bai Xiaofei panicked. When talking about what he feared most in this world, it was absolutely boredom!</p> 
 <p>Now that he thought about it, as long as Lei Shan organized the voting and the Student Community completely replaced the Student Union, he would be completely idle!</p> 
 <p><em>What am I gonna do when I’m free?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Attend classes?!</em></p> 
 <p>No, no, Bai Xiaofei’s head hurt at the thought of this. He’d rather be semi-literate than to be tortured to death in class. Anyone who knew him knew this.</p> 
 <p><em>Shit! There’s really nothing to do!</em></p> 
 <p>Growing increasingly rattled as he walked, Bai Xiaofei completely didn’t notice someone was blocking his path.</p> 
 <p>“Hey! Little Feifei!”</p> 
 <p>Suddenly being called, Bai Xiaofei instinctively looked up. Just when he was about to crash into the person in front of him, a snow-white arm stopped him and nearly flipped him to the ground.</p> 
 <p>“Almost let you take advantage of Qianye. Pay attention next time.”</p> 
 <p>When he heard a familiar voice, Bai Xiaofei instantly knew who it was.</p> 
 <p><em>Sigh, I thought it was a beautiful girl…</em></p> 
 <p>“Woah, Brother Yun, you thought it through so quickly. How long has it been since we just talked about it and you two are already inseparable.”</p> 
 <p>Indeed, it was Yun Jingshuang who stopped Bai Xiaofei and Han Qianye who just called him.</p> 
 <p>Immediately his eyes noticed Han Qianye intimately holding onto Yun Jingshuang’s arm.</p> 
 <p>In truth, those two had accumulated their feelings for each other over a long time. Han Qianye had waited for a yes from Yun Jingshuang just as long, so it was completely understandable why they got close so quickly.</p> 
 <p>Despite this, Han Qianye was as red as an apple from Bai Xiaofei’s teasing. However, she had no intention of letting go at all. She held on tight as if afraid Yun Jingshuang would run away.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t make fun of us, we are here to save your life.” Yun Jingshuang simply got past the topic with a smile.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was stunned.</p> 
 <p>“Save me?! What’s going to happen to me?”</p> 
 <p>If Yun Jingshuang had said it outside, Bai Xiaofei might try to consider who wanted to deal with him, but he was here in the Demon of Illusions. Who would dare to cause a ruckus? That’d mean being extinguished in minutes!</p> 
 <p>“Have you forgotten how you set up the second round?” Yun Jingshuang kindly reminded, and Bai Xiaofei immediately had a look of realization.</p> 
 <p>“You mean…” gulping, Bai Xiaofei muttered.</p> 
 <p>“That’s right, it’s what you think. The Demon of Illusions is very lively now, but if you don’t handle it well, you probably won’t even have a place to sleep in the future.”</p> 
 <p>When Yun Jingshuang finished his words, Bai Xiaofei’s face was immediately filled with bitterness.</p> 
 <p><em>Damn it, I really didn’t think so much at that time!!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Well, since my part is complete, I wish you the best of luck!”</p> 
 <p>Yun Jingshuang had waited at the gate of the Demon of Illusions just to say this. Consider this him paying back a debt of gratitude. After all, it could save Bai Xiaofei’s life…</p>
