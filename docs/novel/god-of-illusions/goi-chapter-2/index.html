 <p>“Have you eaten something strange?” His laughter gradually stopped while the geezer who was unable to conceal his joy any longer grabbed tightly onto Bai Xiaofei’s hands as he asked.</p>
 <p>It was this question that caused Bai Xiaofei to be stunned.</p>
 <p><em>How did this geezer know…?</em></p>
 <p>“Right, I ate a scarlet red fruit on the side of a precipice when I was young. After having a fever for three days, my Origin Energy wouldn’t respond to me, whereas, Huskie was my puppet since before that.” As he replied truthfully, a trace of anticipation suddenly arose in Bai Xiaofei’s heart.</p>
 <p>In this world where puppet masters were the boss, there was no one that wanted to become a cripple that was incapable of utilizing Origin Energy.</p>
 <p><em>If this geezer is able to help….</em></p>
 <p>“Right!” As he exclaimed one more, the joy on the geezer’s face grew deeper. “The reason you’re incapable of sensing your Origin Energy is because that fruit is of heavenly origin, whereas, the capacity of your body is too small and was insufficient to contain so much Origin Energy. So, under the circumstances of your body being filled with Origin Energy, it sealed up all your meridians, and once your meridians were blocked, you were naturally unable to sense the existence of your Origin Energy.”</p>
 <p>This explanation of the geezer was indeed something Bai Xiaofei had heard for the first time as his foster parents had once searched through countless books because of this yet had never found an answer.</p>
 <p>“But, logically speaking, you ought to have been directly blasted apart from the pent up energy, so how could you have possibly survived until now?” A trace of bewilderment appeared on the geezer’s face as he spoke, but it vanished soon after.</p>
 <p>“Who cares! It’s good so long as you survived! And meeting me is even better!” As he started laughing once more, the geezer who was addicted to speaking to himself stared fixedly at Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“Grandpa…. You…. I….” The geezer’s aggressive gaze caused Bai Xiaofei’s hairs to stand on end, and he somehow had the feeling that his ‘chrysanthemum’ twitched….</p>
 <p>“There’re only two cultivation techniques in the entire world that can help your current condition. The first is the Moonlight Empire’s Moongod Technique, but it’s a secret technique of the Moonlight Empire. Not to mention an outsider, there’re less than 10 people in the entire Moonlight Empire that have the qualifications to cultivate it.”</p>
 <p>“The second is an incomplete divine technique I obtained in my early years and that I’ve used my lifetime’s worth of energy to perfect, the Lunisolar Brilliance!”</p>
 <p>The geezer’s face held a trace of pride before revealing the smile of a ‘bad uncle’. “So, do you want to consider my suggestion from before?”</p>
 <p>As he swallowed a mouthful of saliva with difficulty, Bai Xiaofei admitted that he was moved.</p>
 <p>But, his instinct drove him to choose caution because just like how his foster fathers used ‘bloody’ experiences to educate him, a pie wouldn’t just fall from the sky!</p>
 <p>“You said that it’s an incomplete technique that you perfected? So, no one has cultivated this thing before?”</p>
 <p>The geezer was stunned when he heard Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“That’s because no one had the qualifications!” As he raised his head, the geezer tried his best to avoid letting Bai Xiaofei see his unconfident gaze.</p>
 <p>“There’re many requirements to cultivate this technique, right?”</p>
 <p>The geezer gulped down a mouthful of saliva again. “It’s a divine technique! Isn’t it very normal for it to have some requirements!?”</p>
 <p>The extremely astute Bai Xiaofei noticed all of this, yet his face didn’t reveal any fluctuation in his expression.</p>
 <p>“Actually, you haven’t completely perfected this cultivation technique, right?”</p>
 <p>“F*ck! Do you want to cultivate it or not! In any case, you’re already hopeless. Either be a cripple or be my disciple, choose!” Finally, the geezer couldn’t take it any longer because if he allowed Bai Xiaofei to continue asking like this, then his plans would surely fail.</p>
 <p>But, what the geezer never expected was that the plot suddenly twisted!</p>
 <p>Thump!</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei knelt heavily on the ground before kowtowing three times to the geezer without giving the geezer the time to speak.</p>
 <p>“Your disciple, Bai Xiaofei, greets his Master! I hope that Master will live for a hundred more years and be filled with more vigor with every passing day!” As he intentionally placed emphasis on the word ‘vigor’, Bai Xiaofei reminded the geezer that he still had dirt on the geezer, and the geezer should act accordingly!</p>
 <p>But, the geezer utterly didn’t notice all this as he was already dizzy with happiness.</p>
 <p>“Come, come, come! I’ll give you a gift for this occasion!” As he spoke, the geezer selected from his right hand for a long time before finally removing the smallest pinky ring and pushing it into Bai Xiaofei’s hands. “This is a Spatial Ring, and it possesses a hundred cubic meters of space within it. I’ve already severed its connection with me. Use your Origin Energy to wrap up your blood before covering the ring and it’ll be yours.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei looked at the geezer with a blank expression after he received the ring.</p>
 <p><em>Motherf*cker, are you f*cking playing with me? Why don’t you let me use Origin Energy first!</em></p>
 <p>“Master, are all the other rings on your hand Spatial Rings as well?” Bai Xiaofei blinked his small eyes with an innocent expression on his face as he pointed at the rings of various shapes on the geezer’s hand.</p>
 <p>“Err…. Yes, but don’t worry, all of them aren’t as big as yours. You’re my one and only disciple, so I surely have to give you the best!” The geezer had a miserly expression and wasn’t believable in the slightest.</p>
 <p>“Right, you’re still unable to utilize Origin Energy, right? I’ll resolve this problem of yours first!” As he hastily changed the topic, a light flashed once more on the geezer’s hand, causing an antique scroll to appear there. After it was opened up, an extremely long cultivation technique and instructions were written atop it with words that really didn’t conform to this high grade scroll.</p>
 <p>“Master’s writing isn’t very good. Just make do and identify them, and you can ask me if you’re unable to recognize any.” The geezer pushed the scroll into Bai Xiaofei’s hands as if he was throwing away trash, and it didn’t seem like a divine technique no matter how Bai Xiaofei looked at it.</p>
 <p>The cultivation techniques for cultivating Origin Energy on the continent were divided into a total of nine grades, and from lowest to highest, they were respectively origin-grade, mortal-grade, spirit-grade, yellow-grade, profound-grade, earth-grade, heaven-grade, saint-grade, and divine-grade. Ordinarily, the grade of a cultivation technique only affected the speed of condensing Origin Energy, and it didn’t affect anything else.</p>
 <p>But, some cultivation techniques had special effects, just like the Moongod Technique the geezer mentioned earlier, it possessed an extremely strong healing effect.</p>
 <p>“What’re you look at me for? Go cultivate! It just happens that I’m free now and can stand on guard for you.” Bewilderment was written all over the geezer’s face when he saw Bai Xiaofei hadn’t moved after a long time.</p>
 <p>But, the one that was even more aggrieved was Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“Err…. Master, aren’t you going to pass down some cultivation experience to your disciple?”</p>
 <p>As soon as he finished speaking, both of them stared at each other for a long time.</p>
 <p>“Cough, cough, about this… The cultivation technique Master cultivates just happens to be adverse to this Lunisolar Brilliance. Thus, giving you guidance will only have an exactly opposite effect. So, my good disciple, you can only rely on yourself.” The geezer had an expression of entrusting heavy responsibility over to Bai Xiaofei as he patted Bai Xiaofei on the shoulder.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, at this moment, a million f*cks were flying about in Bai Xiaofei’s heart.</p>
 <p><em>Bastard, the cultivation technique you cultivate just happens to be adverse to this cultivation technique, yet you still dared to perfect it?! Did you consider your disciple’s feelings?!</em></p>
 <p><em>Even if you don’t know, don’t tell me!!!</em></p>
 <p><em>How do I cultivate it now!!!</em></p>
 <p>While being furious to the point of trembling slightly, for the first time in his life, Bai Xiaofei felt that he wasn’t the most despicable in this world….</p>
 <p>“Don’t be angry, you must be calm when you cultivate this technique, otherwise, it’s extremely easy for you to encounter qi deviation!” The geezer that seemed to display a rare occasion of understanding Bai Xiaofei’s thoughts took the initiative to console Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, you won’t die with me at the side. Moreover, look, the Infinite Mountain Range is covered in natural treasures, so protecting your life isn’t a problem at all!”</p>
 <p>As he listened to the guarantee that was the most worrying in this world, Bai Xiaofei’s hands trembled as he slowly opened up the scroll.</p>
 <p><em>I’ll leave it up to fate!!!</em></p>
