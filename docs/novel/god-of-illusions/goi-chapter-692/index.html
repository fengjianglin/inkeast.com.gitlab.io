 <p>Chapter 692: Into the Holy Snow Mountain Again!</p> 
 <p>A night where countless people couldn’t sleep well quietly passed. The next morning, Bai Xiaofei for once was an early riser.</p> 
 <p>After all, the floor was cold…</p> 
 <p>“Boss, it’s time.” A’First’s voice softly rang from outside the door, completely different from his blunt tone at the beginning of last evening.</p> 
 <p>“No hurry. You guys go and eat first, we will go down after getting ready,” Bai Xiaofei answered.</p> 
 <p>Their conversation woke the Leng triplets from their sleep.</p> 
 <p>“Who are you talking to?” Her head on her arm, Leng Liuying raised an eyebrow at Bai Xiaofei. Her enchanting looks made his throat dry.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, this was not the time for pleasure, or they’d delay until noon.</p> 
 <p>“The helpers I hired when you were asleep last night. They are very reliable,” replied Bai Xiaofei with a smile, successfully earning an eye-roll from Leng Liuying.</p> 
 <p>“Pff! You are so poor that you have to live off us. I bet you tricked them into it!” Leng Liuying deliberately emphasized ‘live off.’ Unfortunately, this couldn’t take Bai Xiaofei down.</p> 
 <p>“I live off my wives ‘cause I’m qualified to. You envy me? Who told me to have three great wives who are gentle, beautiful, and rich?!”</p> 
 <p>Oh, the Shameless Road. Once one set foot on it, they would only keep walking.</p> 
 <p>“Cut your crap. Hurry out, we need to get changed!”</p> 
 <p>Despite having faced each other in their birthday suits, Bai Xiaofei still needed to leave at times like these when he was not in bed.</p> 
 <p>Although Bai Xiaofei didn’t know what there was to avoid…</p> 
 <p>“Alright, I’m leaving. You guys hurry. We’ll have to pay more if we make our helpers wait,” Bai Xiaofei kept up his act.</p> 
 <p>However, even Leng Liushuang didn’t believe it, which couldn’t be helped as they knew him too well. Contrary to others, they felt assured when relying on him during big events, but wouldn’t believe a word from his mouth in normal times. He specialized in tricking people he was familiar with!</p> 
 <p>After the triplets got ready and came out of the room, Bai Xiaofei had already ordered a large table of dishes.</p> 
 <p>The ‘A’ group of five sat close together. Upon seeing the triplets, they were stunned.</p> 
 <p>Although the triplets weren’t using their true faces, they still appeared as triplets, and everyone knew what triplets represented in the Snow Kingdom. Moreover, Bai Xiaofei didn’t turn their appearances into anything unbearable.</p> 
 <p>“So you are a noble, boss,” said A’First respectfully. Bai Xiaofei required them to call him ‘boss’ for convenience in communication.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s not talk about this. Time to eat! Miss this meal and we won’t be able to enjoy one like this again soon.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s creed that eating was an important event in life had never changed. Perhaps it was the reason why he won the favor of Huskie. Birds of a feather flock together after all.</p> 
 <p>After introducing themselves to each other with no one using their real name, Leng Liuli brought up the main topic, “Are we following Jackdaw?”</p> 
 <p>“Of course not, or else I would have gone to sign up yesterday if I planned to go with them. They are a big family now, they don’t need us non-enthusiasts,” replied Bai Xiaofei nonchalantly.</p> 
 <p>The ‘A’ group wasn’t surprised to hear this. It might not be easy for others to cross the valley into the Holy Snow Mountain, but this did not include them. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have been able to finish the tasks assigned by Bai Xiaofei previously.</p> 
 <p>“Are we going to take the route from yesterday?” Leng Liushuang slightly frowned. Although she was confident to find the way they had used yesterday, she had to consider the high possibility of coming across unexpected events with Bai Xiaofei in the group.</p> 
 <p>“Of course, and the sooner the better. This will depend on you guys.” For once, Bai Xiaofei was normal.</p> 
 <p>Leng Liuli was then decided upon as the guide, while the ‘A’ group was the pioneers.</p> 
 <p>At first, the ‘A’ group was a little displeased, feeling that the triplets were too young for the task and Bai Xiaofei only let them be the guide to placate them. However, going deeper into the valley, they gradually became obedient.</p> 
 <p>There was nothing wrong with the whole route and it was definitely the best path. The time they used to exit the valley area was at least two hours faster than A’First’s planned route…</p> 
 <p>“Since we were so quick, we shouldn’t fall behind them.” Bai Xiaofei glanced back with satisfaction. The howling wind and snow didn’t hinder his voice from reaching the rest. The weakest ones present were already at the Master Rank and had attained the Origin Energy Control skill, so they could all envelop their voice with energy.</p> 
 <p>“They are definitely not as fast as us. They were still gathering when we arrived, and they are still a big temporary team. Their speed will only be slowed,” A’First said with admiration for the triplets’ ability.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei smiled and didn’t say anything, despite the fact that he didn’t just mean Jackdaw when he said ‘them.’</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go. A fire-attribute magical beast in the snow-capped mountains, If we don’t get to see this one, I’m afraid we won’t have another chance in our lives,” said Bai Xiaofei as he started climbing the mountain, but no one except him moved.</p> 
 <p>“Where are you going?” Leng Liuying tried to hold back her laugh as she stopped Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei looked back in confusion.</p> 
 <p>“Going up the mountain. Didn’t they say that the cave is on the mountainside?” Bai Xiaofei’s face was innocent. He still felt there was nothing wrong with his action.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know where the cave is, but if you climb up like this, you’ll probably freeze to death before you can reach any mountainside,” Leng Liuying said with a straight face. Her two sisters showed expressions of approval.</p> 
 <p>“Although the south side is leeward, you can see that it doesn’t mean no wind here. With the increase of height, the wind becomes stronger and the intensity is no less than an energy attack of a wind-attribute Master Rank puppet master. Therefore, it’s definitely impossible to climb directly,” Leng Liuli briefly explained, and then looked at the ‘A’ group. “We originally planned to find the way ourselves, but since A’First has been here, you guys should know the specifics better.”</p> 
 <p>When Leng Liuli finished speaking, the respect on A’First’s face couldn’t be more obvious. It was really hard to imagine that the triplets hadn’t been to the Holy Snow Mountain as their understanding was much deeper than his group. If A’First hadn’t been here in advance, he wouldn’t even have a chance to speak now.</p> 
 <p>“There are many natural ice caves here. Through these ice caves, we can enter the belly of the mountain, and similarly, to that cave as well.” A’First squatted down, and a small purple-tailed mink appeared. “Ice caves are basically connected, so we just need to find an entrance.”</p> 
 <p>A while later, the purple-tailed mink looked up in a direction and squeaked.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, found one!”</p>
