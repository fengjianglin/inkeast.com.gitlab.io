 <p>Chapter 958: Moonlight’s Capital, Finally!</p> 
 <p>“Empty words are pointless, we’ll be watching your performance while still continuing with our task. After all, I can’t just entrust my little sister’s life to someone who disappeared for several years.” Fang Lei snorted.</p> 
 <p>The rest of the Thunderstorm group wryly shook their heads. <em>That’s our stubborn leader for you… Didn’t we all agree to set this aside as long as he presents a good attitude? Isn’t this good enough?</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei ignored Fang Lei’s blunt attitude and asked, “Are you guys cleaning up the Sack spies?” He had planned to slowly get to know the emperor, but now, he could not wait even for a second!</p> 
 <p>“You can even guess this? You’ve run into them as well?” Yun Mo asked back in surprise. However, he immediately knew that he had revealed too much after receiving a glare from Qing Shuang.</p> 
 <p>“Then, you guys can have a rest. It won’t be long before there will be no such spies in Moonlight,” declared Bai Xiaofei with an earnest face. Then, he waved his hand at Zhu Chunyang. “Come on, Your Majesty, we should get down to business!”</p> 
 <p>With that, the two left. Bai Xiaofei didn’t say anything more to the Thunderstorm group because he knew action spoke louder than all the promises he could make.</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother, now that we’ve found him, do we…” Qiu Mumu’s expression was confused and vacant. Although he had resented Bai Xiaofei like the rest of the group, after seeing the man again, all that came to mind was how reliable he had been back then.</p> 
 <p>Carrying a burden above one’s ability was truly exhausting, at least for Qiu Mumu…</p> 
 <p>“Clear out your abundant thoughts. She is our little sister, and I will not stop as long as she has a chance to stand up again!” Fang Lei said coldly.</p> 
 <p>Qiu Mumu awkwardly shut his mouth.</p> 
 <p>“In fact, I think that she would rather be saved by him…” Xia He’s lips curled up into a helpless smile. Women often knew women best, but from the view of an older sister, it made her feel quite bitter…</p> 
 <p>“What she thinks is her business. I only want to fulfill my promise to you all as your big brother: to protect each and every one of you!” declared Fang Lei, stubbornness written all over his face.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, alright, as long as you are happy. Let’s go. Someone’s come again. The capital has been really restless lately.” Xia He sighed. The life of a serious person was destined to be busy…</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, inside the imperial capital of Moonlight.</p> 
 <p>Unlike the rest of the continent, Moonlight’s imperial city highlighted the word ‘women’ to the extreme. In other cities in Moonlight, men could occasionally be seen outside, but this was nearly impossible in the capital – From merchants to customers, from civilians to nobles, they were all women!</p> 
 <p>In Moonlight’s capital city, men were not allowed to appear on the street unless they had a special permit…</p> 
 <p>“Didn’t you say he’d definitely come? We’ve been here for a week. He didn’t run, did he?”</p> 
 <p>At the gate of the city, Ye Xi and Tan Xin stood side by side in a corner. Ye Xi’s brows were tightly knitted and her face was full of displeasure.</p> 
 <p>“I’m still here, where can he run to?” Tan Xin rolled her eyes. During Bai Xiaofei’s absence, she and Ye Xi got to know each other thoroughly. Thanks to Tan Xin, many troubles were easily solved along the way.</p> 
 <p>“I’m not so sure about that. Isn’t it common for men to move their love to others quickly? Maybe he found a new master. After all, you don’t know anything aside from fighting, your chest is flat, and you are a loli. Cute to look at but can’t eat. Aren’t what men fancy just the opposite of you?” Ye Xi used the most insipid tone to say the most irritating words.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin’s expression had darkened to an extreme. Only after getting to know Ye Xi did she realize how this person, who always appeared more proper than anyone, was actually so black-bellied in private.</p> 
 <p>“If he dares, I will castrate him!” said Tan Xin savagely.</p> 
 <p>As soon as her voice fell, a sneeze echoed behind them.</p> 
 <p>“How long have I been away and you’re already speaking ill of me?”</p> 
 <p>Hearing Bai Xiaofei’s voice, the duo turned around in surprise.</p> 
 <p>“When did you arrive?!” Ye Xi frowned. As a general who had just returned from the battlefield, she found it unacceptable for herself not to notice when approached from behind.</p> 
 <p>“Just arrived. You guys were too absorbed in your conversation to notice me,” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly explained.</p> 
 <p>When he and Zhu Chunyang approached the city gate, the latter was arrested by the guards right away. He would have shared the same fate if his feet had been half a beat slower. Therefore, he had used the method of hiding aura learned in the Kingdom of Snow and snuck over when he spotted the two women.</p> 
 <p>“Where have you been?!” Tan Xin immediately sprang over to Bai Xiaofei, her face terrifyingly icy.</p> 
 <p>“Working, I’ve been working on my plan…” Bai Xiaofei chortled.</p> 
 <p>“As if anyone would believe that!” Tan Xin rolled her eyes.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, you two have plenty of opportunities to talk later. We need to get into the city as tomorrow is the preliminary of the finals. You must make preparations tonight,” Ye Xi said and took out a mask. “Put it on. If a man wants to walk around in the capital, he must be accompanied by a woman and must wear a mask, otherwise the guards will arrest him. The imperial city is much more sensitive than the rest of the country about the presence of men.”</p> 
 <p>Under Ye Xi’s stare, Bai Xiaofei sighed.</p> 
 <p>“Ahh, what other choice do I have, right?” He took the mask, but upon seeing the panda face, his mouth twitched. “Is there no other type?”</p> 
 <p>“Yes, I also have a rabbit, goat, wild boar…”</p> 
 <p>“No need! I’ll just wear this one!” Looking at the pile of masks Ye Xi had poured out, Bai Xiaofei decisively stopped her. It turned out that the first one was already the best choice…</p> 
 <p>“Keep an eye on your servant. The women in the capital are different from those outside. If you don’t want trouble, make sure that he’s obedient, otherwise, even I can’t help you,” Ye Xi sincerely gave a final piece of advice before entering the city.</p> 
 <p>However, the two certainly couldn’t feel the weight of it yet.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I will behave,” Bai Xiaofei promised with a straight face.</p> 
 <p>Ye Xi snorted with a mocking look. <em>Ah, men. You think too simple of Moonlight’s imperial city!</em></p>
