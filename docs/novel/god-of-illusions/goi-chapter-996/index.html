 <p>Chapter: 996: Just Need to Wait!</p> 
 <p>“You didn’t keep me here just to stare at me, did you?”</p> 
 <p>After following Ye Qingcheng into her room, seeing her take her uniform off, and being stared at her for a good while, Bai Xiaofei started to panic.</p> 
 <p>“I just want to see how long you can keep acting all cold. Where’s the rumored easy-to-laugh Bai Xiaofei? How did he become a different person after just a battle?”</p> 
 <p>Her remark rendered Bai Xiaofei speechless.</p> 
 <p>Indeed, ever since he was rescued by the Second Leader, Bai Xiaofei had completely changed. No one dared to bring up this matter to him during the journey back, but Ye Qingcheng had no such scruples.</p> 
 <p>“Over ten thousand people followed me, but in the end…”</p> 
 <p>“Do you know how many battles are fought and how many people die on this continent every day?” Ye Qingcheng interrupted him with a cruel question.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei sank into silence.</p> 
 <p>“You are a good general, or else I’m afraid you wouldn’t even be able to bring back a single soldier with you. I also believe that those people had prepared for the possibility that they would die before the battle started. I don’t think they want to see you all depressed. They’d want to see you make their sacrifices worth it.”</p> 
 <p>As Ye Qingcheng advised, her eyes seemed far away, obviously full of similar memories.</p> 
 <p>“When they say thousands of corpses make up a general’s achievement, some indeed tread over the dead bodies of their troops, but some, on the other hand, are willingly raised up by their troops. No one will feel that you are a good and righteous person because of your guilt. Only when you keep creating more achievements will the contribution of those people who support you to the pedestal become meaningful.”</p> 
 <p>“If you stand on the summit, would you still worry that you won’t be able to do their sacrifices justice? Or so to speak, do you want to always use this attitude to face the living ones around you? If so, I advise you to leave the frontier because you’re not cut out for this place.”</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingcheng’s voice was calm, but every word was a knife to Bai Xiaofei’s heart.</p> 
 <p>“Remember, you did not kill them; they were willing to die for you, just like how you were willing to stand in front of them to give them a new opportunity. What you have to do is not mope around, but to become stronger, only then…”</p> 
 <p>“It’s okay, I understand now,” Bai Xiaofei stopped her with a wry grin.</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingcheng smiled. “I actually do a good job with the mental work, no? Why do my sisters just refuse to listen to me?” she said and let out an exaggerated sigh.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei also smiled. “Maybe they’re just scared of your nagging.”</p> 
 <p>As soon as he finished saying this, a chill ran down his back as a strong murderous aura made him tremble.</p> 
 <p>“What do you mean ‘nagging?’ You mean I’m old?! Only old people nag! I’m just always worried about them! I’m not old at all!” declared Ye Qingcheng with a dead serious face as she aggressively walked toward Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p><em>Damn, I touched a sore spot…</em></p> 
 <p>Realizing the trouble he was in, Bai Xiaofei quickly brainstormed. Then, he raised his hand and pointed at Ye Qingcheng’s chest while looking up at the ceiling.</p> 
 <p>“Your collar is a little loose.”</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingcheng subconsciously looked down at her chest, and her face instantly turned red.</p> 
 <p>“You didn’t see anything, did you?” She coughed after fixing her collar.</p> 
 <p>“Well, I didn’t see anything white.”</p> 
 <p>“You’re seeking death!” Ye Qingcheng appeared in front of Bai Xiaofei in a flash and her hand grabbed his neck.</p> 
 <p>“You can’t afford to kill me! I just helped you beat away 300,000 Sacks troops!” Bai Xiaofei appealed.</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingcheng was stunned. “Indeed,” she admitted and let him go, then seized the opportunity to continue the topic. “Although I’m curious, I won’t mention it if it makes you unhappy. Tell me about your next plan.”</p> 
 <p>“Which plan do you mean? The one about those people who follow me, or about the whole frontier?” Heaving a sigh of relief, Bai Xiaofei took a seat.</p> 
 <p>“All.” Ye Qingcheng assumed an all-ears posture and looked at him with a smile.</p> 
 <p>“Then let’s start with the big picture first.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei cleared his throat.</p> 
 <p>“Although I didn’t take part in the battle at Divine Light, judging from the situation I saw in the city, your battle was not easy.”</p> 
 <p>“I also gained some information on the Sacks. They have become much more clever in strategies, and I’m certain that the person who united them is a command talent as they have been able to teach his commanding to the whole Sacks tribe. After our enemy suffered a loss, they learned very quickly.”</p> 
 <p>“No matter who will initiate the battle, their preparation is much more complete than we can imagine. So, I suggest that we endure for a month!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Ye Qingcheng’s eyes widened in shock. “A month doing nothing?!” she shouted.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was unfazed. “If I weren’t concerned about Qing’er’s situation, I would have said ‘three months.’”</p> 
 <p>His reply actually made Ye Qingcheng calm down.</p> 
 <p>“Tell me why,” she said.</p> 
 <p>“I wonder if you noticed a problem.” Instead of directly explaining, Bai Xiaofei asked her with great interest in return.</p> 
 <p>“Testing me, huh? You’re talking about their supplies,” she replied.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei laughed.</p> 
 <p>“Well, it seems that you’re not just an empty mascot. Indeed! The Sacks have made plenty of preparations, but their food resource is quite scarce. It stands to reason that they needed to prepare enough for nine days of attacking Crimson Moon plus the time on the road, but in reality, they brought so few dry rations.”</p> 
 <p>“So, if I didn’t guess wrong, they’re going all out to invade you because of a food shortage. However, they didn’t expect that they picked the wrong time to attack. The seven occupied fortresses have also been running out of food, am I right?”</p> 
 <p>At this question, Ye Qingcheng nodded. “The grain output of the whole empire hasn’t been high this year. The military grain supply is three months late, and the grain reserves of the fortresses haven’t been refilled.”</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingcheng never thought that such a headache was the result of this.</p> 
 <p>“So, we just have to wait,” Bai Xiaofei concluded.</p>
