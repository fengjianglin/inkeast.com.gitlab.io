<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>For the sake of saving time, Wu Chi and the others were signaled by Bai Xiaofei to utilize some ‘tricks’ to wake up all six of the seniors that stood guard at the entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first reaction all six of them had upon waking up was to resist, but after they received a wave of ‘humanitarian’ beating, all of them sensibly realized that in the current situation, Bai Xiaofei was the blade, and they were the meat….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can we communicate normally now?” Bai Xiaofei squatted down by Wang Mu’s side while revealed the smile of an unscrupulous merchant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, you’ll pay for what you did today!” Up until now, Wang Mu still firmly believed that Bai Xiaofei and the others had completely relied on a surprise attack to restrain him and the others, and so long as he was given sufficient time to prepare, he would absolutely be able to teach Bai Xiaofei a proper lesson.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Looks like we can’t!” Bai Xiaofei had just finished speaking when the other five seniors were bashed by the three people that surrounded them, and their howls of pain rose and fell without end….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can we communicate normally now?” Bai Xiaofei held the same expression as he asked once more, and Wang Mu didn’t speak this time but just looked at Bai Xiaofei with a resentful and indignant expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alas, Senior, why do you have such backbone!?” As soon as Bai Xiaofei finished speaking, shrill cries resounded out once more, and Wang Mu was still the only one that wasn’t bashed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go ahead!” Finally, Wang Mu spoke first before Bai Xiaofei could ask him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Mu actually didn’t care much if those five were beaten up or not. But, if he disregarded them, then his reputation would absolutely stink, and this was something he had to fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You took a bag of mine that contained the nails of Earth Dire Bears, 5,000 Starnet Stones, 30 high grade medicinal materials, and 500,000 Amethyst Coins. Can you consider returning it to me now?” As he spoke of a large pile of things in one go, Bai Xiaofei’s expression remained unchanged as if he was speaking the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stinking kid, when did I….” Wang Mu hadn't finished speaking when shrill cries resounded out once more from nearby, and the faces of those five seniors were no different to the heads of pigs at this moment….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look, all of you were willing to cause trouble for him. But, he seems to be unwilling to buy back your freedom! After all, it isn’t him who is getting beaten.” Bai Xiaofei didn’t do anything to Wang Mu, but it was even more painful than being bashed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s nonsense!!!” Wang Mu tried his best to deny it, but what he got in exchange was the five of them being beaten up once more….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whether it’s nonsense or not isn’t up to me, and it depends on what they say after they leave.” Bai Xiaofei sneered as he looked at Wang Mu once more, and he stretched out his right hand at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you return my things to me?” Wang Mu hesitated when facing Bai Xiaofei’s question because so long as he opened his mouth, he would only have a single choice, otherwise, the other five would be beaten up again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, if he were to agree, then he wouldn’t be able to produce 5,000 Starnet Stones, let along high grade medicinal materials. But, he had a great deal of Amethyst Coins. After all, he was a famous figure in the Popularity Rankings as well, and the funds given to him from home wasn’t a small amount.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hesitating isn’t a good habit!” Bai Xiaofei’s words were the command to make a move, and Wu Chi and the others who enjoyed this raised their fists and legs once more before bashing the five of them to the point they cried out for their parents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll give it to you! I’ll give it to you!!” Wang Mu gritted his teeth as he spat these words out, and his eyes that stared at Bai Xiaofei seemed as if flames would leap out from them at any moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right, wouldn’t those five ‘friends’ of yours have suffered fewer beatings if you said this earlier?” Bai Xiaofei intentionally placed emphasis on the word ‘friends’, causing Wang Mu’s face to burn in pain, and it was even more painful than being beaten up….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But, I don’t have so many Starnet Stones and high grade medicinal materials. Can I exchange them into Amethyst Coins?” As he forcefully suppressed the flames of rage in his heart, Wang Mu tried his best to control his tone because he’d already decided to pay Bai Xiaofei, so it wasn’t worth to make Bai Xiaofei continue doing something that might harm his reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, but it has to be 1.5 times the market price.” When faced with Bai Xiaofei’s subsequent demand, Wang Mu could only swallow his losses quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, under Bai Xiaofei’s ‘Bai Algorithm’, Wang Mu gave Bai Xiaofei a total of 1.6 million Amethyst Coins. But, because Bai Xiaofei didn’t have an Amethyst Card, all of it was passed over to the Savage Class’s ‘Minister of Finance’, Fang Ye….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was nice doing business with you. I’ll give you a huge present before I leave.” Bai Xiaofei patted Wang Mu’s white and tender face before revealed a devilish smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Girls, move aside, and boys, come greet our guest!” Bai Xiaofei moved aside as he spoke, and he brought all the girls along towards the classroom first, whereas, Wu Chi and the other ‘men’ crowded around Wang Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The beatings that he owed earlier were completely repaid in less than five minutes. However, no one hit his face during the entire process, but Wang Mu’s clothes were completely stripped off….</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they dealt with everything, Wu Chi and the others left the scene of the crime, and as for how the matter would develop later, it wasn’t something within their scope of considerations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Bai Xiaofei didn’t think that the five of them would help Wang Mu!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Principal, are we not going to interfere with their actions?!” Within the principal’s office in the academy, Feng Guangshi stood respectfully behind Lei Shan, and a screen that was like a pool of water stood before them. The scenes on the screen were precisely everything that the members of the Savage Class had just done.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Those few people played the role of bandits first, so how do you expect me to interfere after Bai Xiaofei counterattacked? Differential treatment? Starnet Academy doesn’t have such rules.” Lei Shan grunted coldly while displeasure was revealed clearly on his face. But, when he thought of Bai Xiaofei, this displeasure quickly turned to a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But, their actions have gone slightly too far, right? If we don’t warn them, then what would we do if they cause even greater trouble in the future? Moreover, that Wang Mu is a young master from a noble clan in Cloudveil Empire, and his clan can’t be underestimated!” Fei Guangshi knew that Lei Shan was unhappy, but he still summoned up the courage to speak his concerns.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph! What you mean is our Starnet Academy is afraid of a noble clan from Cloudveil Empire?” His rage earlier wasn’t obvious, but this time, his negative feelings towards Fei Guangshi were rather obvious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, not at all, I didn’t mean it that way!!!” Fei Guangshi hurriedly denied this, and his bald head had already started to think of words to redeem himself, but Lei Shan didn’t have any intention to wait for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enough, leave and stop annoying me.” After he gave the order to leave, Fei Guangshi instantly withdrew sensibly. But, he’d just walked to the door when Lei Shan’s voice sounded out once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t have to mind bother about what Bai Xiaofei did, and don’t let me find out that you did something you shouldn’t have later on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A trace of cold sweat flowed down from Fei Guangshi’s forehead, and he replied with acknowledgment before vanishing from Lei Shan’s sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Someone offended you, so you destroy that someone’s everything. Kid, if you’re able to stay like this until you leave the academy, then I, Lei Shan, will give you a great fortune!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like this, at a place Bai Xiaofei was unaware of, a pie had already fallen from the sky….</span></p>
