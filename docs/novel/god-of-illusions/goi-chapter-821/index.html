 <p>Chapter 821: Clashing with an Old Enemy, Savage Class Awakens!</p> 
 <p>“Little girl, you are much stronger than the last time we met, huh? It’s just a pity you are still not my match!” With a smile and a slight wave of his hand, Ling Tianxia sent Lin Li flying with a series of rumbles.</p> 
 <p>Everyone felt like a stone was pressing down on their hearts. The battle had tilted toward them after Lin Li killed Mister Mirror, but just as they were about to enter the underground base, Ling Tianxia appeared without anyone else with him. Yet he alone blocked the entire Savage Class!</p> 
 <p>Still at the Legend Rank, still as strong as ever…</p> 
 <p>“You are not Ling Tianxia!” Lin Li declared, her eyes glinted sharply as they fixed on Ling Tianxia.</p> 
 <p>Except the person of interest, everyone was stunned upon hearing this. <em>Same looks, same puppet, how can he not be?</em></p> 
 <p>“Tch, your eyes are good as usual, as expected of the daughter of the Angelic Maiden. But I’m quite curious, what kind of man was able to make a character like her willingly give herself to?” ‘Ling Tianxia’ affirmed Lin Li’s statement as there was no need to hide. After all, Ling Tianxia’s identity was useless.</p> 
 <p>For some reason, the Savage Class had a feeling that as long as they did not go into the underground base, this person would not kill them. After all, it had been a while and no one had fallen. It was as if ‘Ling Tianxia’ was deliberately showing mercy!</p> 
 <p>“Get out of the way, or I will kill you!” Lin Li declared coldly. Her aura soared, and the degree was much more horrifying than that from burning vitality!</p> 
 <p>“Oooh! Coming for real, aren’t you?!” exclaimed ‘Ling Tianxia’ exaggeratedly as an invisible sound barrier rose in front of him.</p> 
 <p>“Windlove Army, formation!”</p> 
 <p>At the same time, the somewhat battered Windlove Army seized the opportunity to attack. Their first-class strength was enough to make them a match for any ace troops on the continent, especially in war!</p> 
 <p>“Windlove Might!”</p> 
 <p>The Windlove Army was composed of three brigades, each consisting of one hundred and twenty people. They were no longer at their peak after such a fierce battle, but upon the call of the vice commander, every soldier joined in a formation and contributed their energy to condense a huge golden lance hanging above the army.</p> 
 <p>The next second, the lance stabbed at ‘Ling Tianxia.’ The moment it collided with the sound barrier, a piercing sound spread and pushed everyone back. At the same time, blood began to seep out from the skin of all the Windlove soldiers.</p> 
 <p>However, ‘Ling Tianxia’ was not in a good situation either. His skin trembled and then started to turn into a golden liquid as his shape became unstable.</p> 
 <p>“Tear the Sky!” shouted the Windlove vice commander decisively.</p> 
 <p>The golden lance suddenly burst. The whole army was sent flying while the sound barrier in front of Ling Tianxia dissipated. The sonic wave from the explosion completely destroyed his human form, returning him into a pool of golden liquid.</p> 
 <p>However, the golden liquid quickly began to re-condense into human form bit by bit.</p> 
 <p>“You have no chance!” a faint voice rang out.</p> 
 <p>It was Lin Li who had taken on a new form, wrapped in a blinding light. From a distance, Lin Li seemed to be a source of light, dazzling and powerful!</p> 
 <p>“Element Disorder!”</p> 
 <p>Lin Li raised her hand, and the elements in the area materialized. Then, the elemental energy began to grow unstable and even started to mutually transform into each other. In the center of this elemental disorder, the condensing golden liquid was divided. In less than ten seconds, it was all reduced into elements.</p> 
 <p>In addition to being an energy embodiment, elements were also the foundation of various materials, only that they were extremely stable as objects. Under normal circumstances, this stability remained solid for a very long time, but there were always exceptions.</p> 
 <p>The current Lin Li was an exception. In other words, ‘Ling Tianxia’ was forcefully transformed into elements by her!</p> 
 <p>The death of ‘Ling Tianxia’ made everyone breathe a sigh of relief. However, floating in the air, Lin Li froze a little.</p> 
 <p>“Come out!!” She suddenly swung her hand, and in the distance, a hundred earth thorns drilled out from the ground. At this moment, Lin Li’s control over elements had reached an extreme!</p> 
 <p>Upon her actions, everyone looked over. Seeing the ‘things’ that she forced out from hiding, they gasped and gawked in terror.</p> 
 <p>There were six whole ‘Ling Tianxias’!!!</p> 
 <p><em>This… How can this be?!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Heh, amazing. Micro-level elemental control. Even Angelic Maiden Nishang Fairy had not reached this level at this age. However, you can’t last long.”</p> 
 <p>One of the six ‘Ling Tianxias’ opened his mouth, but the only response was Lin Li’s merciless attack!</p> 
 <p>Fire and wind combined into a terrifying flame tornado and swept the six ‘Ling Tianxias’ away. At the same time, earth thorns rose and stabbed into the tornado from all directions, constantly enhancing its damage.</p> 
 <p>However, before long, a series of explosions resounded and the tornado abruptly dispersed. The six ‘Ling Tianxias’ became golden miniature humans, each covered in a sound barrier.</p> 
 <p>This scene thwarted everyone’s hope. All the six ‘Ling Tianxias’ could use his abilities!</p> 
 <p>“Can’t just leave it all to little Li Li, right? If we do, what’s the use of our efforts over the past year?” Fang Ye suddenly laughed and switched back to the first form, which had the strongest attack power.</p> 
 <p>With Fang Ye’s questions, the fear in the hearts of the Savage Class members was replaced by fighting spirit.</p> 
 <p>“Heck, we were so scared by this old guy that we forgot what we’re here for. This is the mission for us to prove ourselves. If we go on like this, we won’t even qualify as sidekicks!” Mo Ka rubbed his nose and tightened his grasp on the Floating Blade.</p> 
 <p>“We can let you guys ignore any attacks for ten seconds. The rest depends on you.” The talkative Zhu Nuo was able to be concise for once.</p> 
 <p>Duan Yiyi did not speak, but she was together with Zhu Nuo. After all, they were the only two Support Stream puppet masters in the team.</p> 
 <p>“Wifey, at this rate, we’ll be redundant soon. Even if you don’t mind, I can’t hold back.” The mischievous Xing Nan was suddenly unusually serious.</p> 
 <p>Although Zhu Sisi did not reply, she was emitting a strange fluctuation…</p> 
 <p>It was time to show their real strength!</p>
