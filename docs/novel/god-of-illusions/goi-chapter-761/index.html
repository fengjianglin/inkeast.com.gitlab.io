 <p>Chapter 761: Windless Zone!</p> 
 <p>As his puppet was triggered, Heartless woke with a start. Then, he vanished right before the fat man’s eyes.</p> 
 <p>“Run!” The fat man reacted quite quickly. Almost right after his attack failed, he picked up his weapon to run and even did not forget to notify the thin man.</p> 
 <p>Suddenly, an emerald ball was smashed on the ground and exploded into a green smoke that filled the whole room in an instant. A series of metallic sounds of weapons clashing ensued.</p> 
 <p>After a while, it was calm again…</p> 
 <p>The sound of fighting awakened everyone and they hurriedly ran to Heartless’s room. At that time, the emerald smoke had started to fade, but no one was bold enough to enter it. Around five minutes later when the smoke had completely dispersed, Wang Hang and Wu Chi covered their nose and mouth and rushed into the room.</p> 
 <p>Not hearing the sound of fighting as he had imagined, an anxious Tong Fei also went in. What he saw inside froze him in place.</p> 
 <p>The fat man’s throat was slit, the body was on the ground with his eyes wide open. Shockingly, in another corner lay the thin man and Heartless, with Heartless’ dagger at the thin man’s heart and the latter’s machete stuck in his neck!</p> 
 <p>A powerful Grandmaster Rank Assassin Stream puppet master died in the hands of a bandit just like that!</p> 
 <p>“How?!!!”</p> 
 <p>Tong Fei gawked in terror. He refused to believe that Heartless could die to two rubbish bandits. Even mutual destruction was unacceptable!</p> 
 <p>“There’s a faint smell of the Miao borderland’s poison. If I’m not wrong, it should be sedating and energy-limiting smoke, poisons specially made to restrain puppet masters,” said Xing Nan softly as he sniffed the air.</p> 
 <p>“Impossible! Even so, Heartless would not die in their hands! I’m very clear about his ability!” Tong Fei shouted as if possessed.</p> 
 <p>Although Heartless was only his bodyguard, the two had been together for more than ten years. Their relationship had already exceeded that between master and servant.</p> 
 <p>“My brother, I know it’s hard, but this is already the case…”</p> 
 <p>“Brother, please leave. I want to spend some time with him for the last time,” Tong Fei cut Bai Xiaofei off, his eyes gloomy.</p> 
 <p>“Alright.” Bai Xiaofei motioned for everyone to leave with him.</p> 
 <p>After leaving the inn, Zhu Sisi asked, “How did he wake up? Even Exquisite Rank puppet masters can’t fight back that sedating poison!”</p> 
 <p>“He had a trigger-type puppet. It woke him up.” Bai Xiaofei was the only one alive who knew what happened in the room.</p> 
 <p>His reply made everyone break out in cold sweat. Fortunately, they had Blackie, or else the ending would have been different.</p> 
 <p>“So you killed him?” Hu Xian’er frowned. The intuition of a magical beast gave her a bad feeling.</p> 
 <p>“He had to die!” Bai Xiaofei didn’t deny it. He knew what she was worried about, but he had no choice at that time.</p> 
 <p>“I hope that man didn’t leave anything behind, but we’d better be careful.” After a short silence, Hu Xian’er sighed. There were just times when one had to make choices on the spot.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, Big Sister Xian’er. With Brother’s Fei speed, how can he leave anything behind?” Mo Ka chimed in and broke the heavy atmosphere.</p> 
 <p>“Mo Ka is right. In any case, it has already happened, there’s nothing we can do even if we regret it. Now we need to consider the next step. If Tong Fei does not react to our expectations, we will have to remake our plan,” Fang Ye comforted.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, everyone relaxed.</p> 
 <p>“Next, Chen Hui, you are mainly responsible for supervising Tong Fei. The rest of you continue to maintain our act. Do not expose your puppet master abilities until we truly have contact with the target,” reminded Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The group fell silent. <em>Ugh, so we still have to continue the play!</em></p> 
 <p>When the group returned to the rest stop, Tong Fei had already buried Heartless. As for the two rest stop people, he burned them into ashes.</p> 
 <p>“My brother, I didn’t think this would happen.” Bai Xiaofei patted the despairing Tong Fei on the shoulder.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t blame you. I brought you here. I should have noticed it. Those two weren’t the same as the previous rest stop people,” Tong Fei said slowly, his tone heavy. He and Heartless failed to realize something was wrong because they put most of their energy on Bai Xiaofei’s group.</p> 
 <p>“How long before we get there? Furthermore, where are we going?” Finally, Bai Xiaofei asked the questions he had never asked before. This could not be a more suitable time.</p> 
 <p>“Windless Zone, you should have heard of it,” Tong Fei whispered with a strange light in his eyes.</p> 
 <p>“Windless Zone?!!!” Chen Hui, who stood behind Bai Xiaofei, yelled out before anyone could say anything.</p> 
 <p>“What place is that?” Zhu Nuo looked confused as if he really didn’t know what Windless Zone was, even though Bai Xiaofei had already told them his guess of the most likely place they were going to long before.</p> 
 <p>“One of the six forbidden areas on the continent. It’s calm and windless all year round, and there are no powerful creatures inside. However, for reasons unknown until now, puppet masters will have their origin energy quickly drained once they set foot in there until they dry up and die!” Chen Hui said with a fear on his face, which was not all acting.</p> 
 <p>“What about normal people?” Duan Yiyi immediately asked.</p> 
 <p>Chen Hui then shook his head. “Normal people are fine, but there’s something strange in the atmosphere that makes people get depressed easily… Of course, I only know this from hearsay. I have never been to that place personally.”</p> 
 <p>“Brother Chen is right. However, we found a solution,” Tong Fei said and took out a Blood Diamond. “Although we don’t know why, as long as puppet masters carry a Blood Diamond, the energy in it will be consumed instead of their energy. Under normal circumstances, three Blood Diamonds are enough for one day of activity in the Windless Zone.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the faces of Bai Xiaofei’s group revealed surprise at the same time. Their instinctive reaction was instantly noticed by Tong Fei.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately realized something was wrong and hurriedly covered, “So to speak, the Windless Zone is no longer considered a forbidden area? Are there many people trading with you over there?”</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, they are all individuals and will not affect our cooperation.” Tong Fei truthfully answered, but it was unclear whether he had noticed anything.</p> 
 <p>They had to maintain extreme caution!</p>
