 <p>Chapter 782: Counter-Snipe!</p> 
 <p>With the activation of Bai Xiaofei’s savior mode, those who had saved their money for the Slave stage were shocked silly. But, would they let him go on like this?</p> 
 <p>Of course not, everyone was just waiting for a chance to teach him a lesson! Even auctions had their unspoken rules, as well as ways to handle moneybags like Bai Xiaofei who appeared out of nowhere and ruined that.</p> 
 <p>“I suppose the next item can be regarded as a small height of today’s auction. Will our Young Master Bai upstairs continue his victory or will the beauty go to a dark horse downstairs, I wonder?” Qing Han stirred the atmosphere before the slave was even brought out.</p> 
 <p>While it sounded like incitement to others, Qing Ya understood the implication. She told Bai Xiaofei, “Young Master, you should be careful. My brother is giving you a warning.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was stunned. “What do you mean?” he asked with a frown.</p> 
 <p>“You are not the first person in history to crush everyone financially. There have been similar situations in the past, and in the end, those who intended to buy the entire auction failed to even win what they wanted most.”</p> 
 <p>Qing Ya only stated the history, but Bai Xiaofei immediately understood.</p> 
 <p>“Shill bidding?” He chuckled.</p> 
 <p>At that moment, the next slave was brought to the stage. She had clear eyes and long light blue hair, and the simple clothes on her body could not hide the ethereal aura she exuded, which gave Bai Xiaofei an illusion that he was seeing Lin Li in her Divine Phoenix Feather Dress!</p> 
 <p>“She is…” Bai Xiaofei, who was still contemplating how to counter shill bidding a moment ago, was dumbstruck.</p> 
 <p>Qing Ya anticipated his reaction, but she didn’t look down on him because no one could contain themselves facing a woman of that race!</p> 
 <p>“She’s a Paraselene, a race that’s born with the Allure Physique. You are only seeing her from afar and already have this kind of reaction. If she’s near and you can control yourself from jumping at her, I’d say your self-control is excellent. However, what makes the Paraselene clan the darling of auctions is another characteristic.”</p> 
 <p>Qing Ya’s expression grew serious.</p> 
 <p>“A Paraselene woman can perfectly pass on the ability of the previous generation to her children and even with enhancement. In other words, if you are a genius, then the child you produce with her will be a genius among geniuses!” Qing Ya gave a vivid example and added, “Because of this, the women of this clan are also called god-making machines!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei instinctively swallowed. <em>Why does this sound dangerous? …However, no one is more suitable for a counter-attack than her!</em></p> 
 <p>“Starting price, one hundred million Amethyst Coins!” Below, Qing Han had also finished the introduction and stated a well-deserved price.</p> 
 <p>A collective gasp was heard. They knew a Paraselene was very valuable, but they didn’t expect this one to be so much so! Most of their money had already been spent on the previous items.</p> 
 <p>Many people had begun to regret it, but some subconsciously looked toward Bai Xiaofei’s room. The auction house had its rules, one must not bid without having that amount of money in hand. Therefore, those who planned to use shill bidding on Bai Xiaofei had gathered and gave all of their money to one person, which was also the usual practice for malicious shill bidding.</p> 
 <p>Of course, this was not without a contract beforehand. Otherwise, no one would hand over all of their money to another.</p> 
 <p>“One billion,” the first bidder calmly called out, but everyone knew that this price could not win the Paraselene girl.</p> 
 <p>“One billion and one hundred million!”</p> 
 <p>Not waiting for Bai Xiaofei to bid, the others began competing and raised the price to three billion Amethyst Coins in a short time.</p> 
 <p>“Is it fun to be so careful? If you have no money, don’t embarrass yourselves here. Ten billion!” Bai Xiaofei mocked as always and pushed the price to a level that scared away many people.</p> 
 <p>“You’re right, don’t embarrass yourselves if you have no money. Twenty billion!” With this price being shouted, the sniper targeting Bai Xiaofei finally showed themselves.</p> 
 <p>“Fifty billion. Trash, bid if you have the guts. This lord shall see what you have to compete with me! This woman is mine!” Bai Xiaofei sneered.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, despair filled the eyes of the Paraselene girl on the stage.</p> 
 <p>Perhaps, this was the tragedy of her race. Ever since the Paraselenes were discovered on the continent, their females had become highly sought after, starting from endless pursuits which then turned into abductions, and finally slavery and trade…</p> 
 <p>Just like that, the quiet life of the Paraselene people was destroyed and the whole race became fragmented as everyone had to live in hiding.</p> 
 <p>Lin was one of them who in the end could not escape the clutches of hunters. In order to protect her own people, she sacrificed herself and was sold here, but ridiculously, none of the people she saved had come to save her…</p> 
 <p>Perhaps the Paraselene should never have appeared on this continent!</p> 
 <p>Her heart like a dying ember, Lin thought that death was the only way out for her, but even dying had to wait as she didn’t even have the freedom to kill herself.</p> 
 <p>“One hundred billion! Sorry, I must have her too!” The sniper had completely declared war with Bai Xiaofei by this point.</p> 
 <p>“Two hundred billion!” Bai Xiaofei announced without any hesitation. It was as if money was nothing to him at all.</p> 
 <p>The sniper group panicked this time. They had only raised a total of 400 billion. If Bai Xiaofei didn’t give up before that, they would have to wait for the next opportunity. Even if they won this time, so what? How many more 400 billion did they have to compete with him next?</p> 
 <p>“You are ridiculous. I’ll let you see what a frog in a well you are!” After ridiculing Bai Xiaofei the sniper called a price that stupefied everyone, “Four hundred billion!”</p> 
 <p>The bidder’s domineering voice echoed with pride, but this pride gradually turned into panic with the ensuing silence. <em>Why is he not bidding?!</em></p> 
 <p>“What’s the point, it’s just a woman. Forget it, this lord has suddenly lost interest,” Bai Xiaofei’s faint voice rang out.</p> 
 <p>The next second, the sniper widened his eyes in shock, and passed out…</p> 
 <p><em>My four hundred billion!!!</em></p>
