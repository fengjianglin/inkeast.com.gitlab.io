 <p>Chapter 501: Feng Wuhen’s Warning!</p> 
 <p>“Your strength has grown again!” Calming down, Feng Wuhen commented with a somewhat meaningful sigh. At the same time, he instinctively inched back on his seat. If Bai Xiaofei hugged him again, his life might just conclude here.</p> 
 <p>“Eh… Yeah, that really seems to be the case.” Bai Xiaofei scratched his head with a silly smile. Looking at him now, no one would be able to connect him to his legendary ruthless and greedy image outside.</p> 
 <p>“You are a work of art. Obviously an Illusion Stream puppet master, but now you want to be more of a fighter than a martial artist…” Feng Wuhen exclaimed from the bottom of his heart as his gaze on Bai Xiaofei grew even stranger.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was used to this kind of gaze. Feng Wuhen and Lu Lingyun often looked at him like this.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s talk about me later. Brother Feng, how is going at your side?” Bai Xiaofei was excited when he said this. He wanted to sit closer to Feng Wuhen, but after a second thought, he chose the opposite seat. It wouldn’t be good if he sat too close and affected the guy’s thoughts.</p> 
 <p>“Going smooth, I suppose. Now we have control of a total of 17 small businesses, and we have been very busy. However, the batch from Starnet just two days ago solved the biggest problem of manpower shortage, otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to come back.” Feng Wuhen’s expression relaxed at this. This kind of free time squeezed out from a busy schedule was always the most enjoyable.</p> 
 <p>“What about Brother Lu? Why didn’t he come back with you? I was thinking of holding the two of you a party!” Bai Xiaofei’s brow creased and there was pity in his expression.</p> 
 <p>“It’s still early to celebrate. After all, it’s just the first step of the plan. We’ve only stabilized the situation, and those 17 businesses have only just been revived from their half-dead state.” Feng Wuhen paused and an odd smile appeared on his face. “As for why only I came back, you can only blame Old Lu for his bad luck. We need someone to watch over that side, so the two of us made a small bet…” Here, Feng Wuhen chuckled evilly and his tone was smug.</p> 
 <p>“Then, what did you come back this time for? It is impossible that it’s just to report such a simple situation. Could it be that we don’t have enough money?” guessed Bai Xiaofei worriedly. He hadn’t done anything to make money recently. There was nothing he could do if they were really short of money.</p> 
 <p>“How is that even possible? It’s been quite some time already. If we can’t even keep our capital, we might as well give up on creating the tenth largest merchant group.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei’s anxious heart settled. <em>As long as you don’t ask for money…</em></p> 
 <p>“I returned this time is actually because of you!” Feng Wuhen suddenly grew serious.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei also became serious. Anything that made Feng Wuhen show this expression was definitely not simple!</p> 
 <p>“Brother Feng, just tell me, I can take anything.” Bai Xiaofei gulped. In fact, he was a little uneasy.</p> 
 <p>“Did you offend someone?” Feng Wuhen asked, stunning Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p><em>I’ve offended too many people. I can’t single anyone out when you ask me like that!</em></p> 
 <p>“Why? Is someone looking for me?” Bai Xiaofei frowned and his expression became ruthless. This kind of issue must be eliminated in its infancy, otherwise, there would be endless future troubles if it is allowed to develop!</p> 
 <p>“Not only that. We accidentally got wind that someone is investigating you vigorously. According to experience, the next step would be putting a bounty on your head. This kind of bounty list is different from the Starnet Ranking. It is really endless until the target dies!”</p> 
 <p>Feng Wuhen didn’t seem to be joking at all, and this was indeed worth a trip back.</p> 
 <p>“Big Bro, where did you get this news?” Without enough clues, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t come up with anything.</p> 
 <p>“Someone used their merchant group connections to find me and asked about your situation. I tricked them and learned of this.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing the phrase ‘merchant group,’ two names instantly ran through Bai Xiaofei’s thoughts.</p> 
 <p>Unify Business and Globe Merchant Group!</p> 
 <p>However, he quickly dismissed the former. The grudge between him and Wu Xizhao hadn’t been established for long, and he doubted that Unify Business would really go to such lengths for a brainless young master. Even if they did, it wouldn’t reach Feng Wuhen’s ears so quickly.</p> 
 <p>So, there was only one answer, one with good reasons at that – the Globe Merchant Group!</p> 
 <p><em>Ah, they refuse to stop, huh?</em></p> 
 <p>“If someone outside wants my head, then that can only be the Globe Merchant Group.” After determining the target, Bai Xiaofei’s mind was set at ease. Although the enemy was in the shadows and he was out in the open, he didn’t need to be passive after knowing who the other party was.</p> 
 <p>“The Globe Merchant Group? How did you provoke them?” asked Feng Wuhen in surprise as he frowned.</p> 
 <p>Recounting everything to Feng Wuhen that had happened in Ancient Yue, Bai Xiaofei then heaved a long sigh.</p> 
 <p>“I know that this matter isn’t over yet, but I didn’t expect them to be so dead set on payback. It seems that they intend to silence me permanently so they can continue their plan later!” Sneering, Bai Xiaofei’s killing intent grew.</p> 
 <p>If it wasn’t that he wasn’t strong enough yet to take down the Globe Merchant Group, Bai Xiaofei would have brought his people to crush them. This was also his purpose of establishing the Illusion Demon. He wanted a large organization that could back him up at any time!</p> 
 <p>“Too bad for them, they chose the wrong person.” After clearing up the situation, Feng Wuhen relaxed.</p> 
 <p>Even if the Globe Merchant Group wanted to act against them, they could only do it in secret, but pulling tricks in secret was Bai Xiaofei’s strong point. He was so far ahead in this that he could be their ancestor.</p> 
 <p>“Let them come. No matter what they have in store, I will make them return empty-handed!” His face firm, Bai Xiaofei was ready to make the Globe Merchant Group suffer. If they had moved against him in Ancient Yue, Bai Xiaofei might end up a little miserable, but once back in Starnet, he could handle even Exquisite Rank existences!</p> 
 <p>“Although I’m very confident in you, I still hope you won’t underestimate the Globe Merchant Group. Since they dare to do things that are obviously taboo to meddle with Ancient Yue, it means that they have made prior preparations. You’d better not attract their full firepower to yourself,” advised Feng Wuhen. He didn’t want to lose his boss before their careers even took off.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I’m not that stupid. I can pretend that I haven’t found out anything.” Bai Xiaofei smiled.</p> 
 <p>“If I remember correctly, the son of a branch president of the Globe Merchant Group has a place on the Wealth Ranking. If you have the chance, you can consider seeing him for yourself,” Feng Wuhen made a good suggestion. Bai Xiaofei’s eyes brightened, but then soon dimmed.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, I bet he’s just an abandoned chess piece, or else he wouldn’t be so quiet that I don’t even know of him. If he actively finds me for trouble, it may even expose their preparations. Let’s just leave them feeling good about themselves for now.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing Bai Xiaofei’s reply, Feng Wuhen was stunned a little. Then, he looked at Bai Xiaofei in approval. He could feel that Bai Xiaofei had changed, less edge and more wit! And this change was very gratifying!</p> 
 <p>“I haven’t had the taste of the Hundred Flavor House in a long time. Since I’ve come back all the way for you, shouldn’t you treat me to a meal?” Feng Wuhen smiled, ready to make Bai Xiaofei bleed a good sum.</p> 
 <p>“Of course, but I have a better place to go than the Hundred Flavor House. Would you like to try?” said Bai Xiaofei with a mysterious smile.</p> 
 <p>“Oh? Are you sure you just don’t want to pay?” Although Bai Xiaofei had changed, it didn’t affect the ‘guard’ that Feng Wuhen always put up against him. Bai Xiaofei had no credibility at times like these.</p> 
 <p>“Tch, you think I’m that kind of person?! Let’s go, I’ll open your eyes!”</p> 
 <p>Believing his words, Feng Wuhen followed Bai Xiaofei, and was taken to the dining room of the Demon of Illusions…</p> 
 <p>“This is what you said is better than the Hundred Flavor House?” Feng Wuhen’s voice was full of surprise and his expression clearly said ‘I will never believe you again in my life.’</p> 
 <p>“The quality of a place is not about how famous it is, but about who lives in it. We just don’t open to the outside world. Otherwise, what Hundred Flavor House, what Thousand Aroma Restaurant, they’d all have to stand aside!” Bai Xiaofei vowed, but this time Feng Wuhen didn’t believe a word.</p> 
 <p>Before long after the two sat down, an apron-clad Leng Liushuang delivered dishes to the table with the shy expression that provoked Bai Xiaofei’s heart every time.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Feng, the road must have been rough. I hope my food won’t disappoint you,” said Leng Liushuang softly. Her gentle voice made Feng Wuhen feel like he was facing a spring breeze.</p> 
 <p>He had met Leng Liushuang before, but so far he still couldn’t tell the triplets apart.</p> 
 <p>“You are too kind. I’m already very satisfied to have something to eat.” Feng Wuhen was exceptionally polite. Despite complaining about Bai Xiaofei in his heart, he didn’t show a hint of displeasure when facing Leng Liushuang.</p> 
 <p>But soon, even the complaints against Bai Xiaofei vanished…</p> 
 <p><em>How can this be so delicious?!!!</em></p> 
 <p>Looking at the wide-eyed Feng Wuhen, who was dumbstruck by the delicious food, Bai Xiaofei was smug, and then he joined the group of table sweepers.</p> 
 <p>According to his past experience of being at the same table with someone who had Leng Liushuang’s cooking for the first time, he wouldn’t get to eat anything if he didn’t hurry…</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei and Feng Wuhen talked over the meal, from the grand celebration plan to the development of Illusion Demon.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, over at the new-student area, two people were having a tense conversation.</p> 
 <p>“Branch Master, have you been here for so long that you already forgot your identity? Do you know what will happen to you if I report our discussion to our Holy Lord?” The speaker sounded like a young man, but his figure was hidden entirely in the shadows.</p> 
 <p>However, the person he called ‘Branch Master’ was someone familiar – Xue Ying!</p>
