 <p>Chapter 1020: Strike while the Iron is Hot!</p> 
 <p>“Thank you, Honorable Saintess, for letting bygones be bygones. We will do our best!”</p> 
 <p>Receiving Qiu Muxue’s generosity, the three elders didn’t think too much. After all, in their view, they were irreplaceable if she wanted to take control of Barbaric Godism.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, they really overestimated themselves…</p> 
 <p>“If there is nothing else, we will excuse ourselves and go prepare to announce your takeover,” said the Second Elder.</p> 
 <p>Qiu Muxue nodded. It had been quite a while since the Third Elder set out for the First Elder. If it still hadn’t been handled, then the Third Elder might as well resign from his position.</p> 
 <p>“I just hope there won’t be another First Elder,’” Qiu Muxue warned before leaving with Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the expressions of the three elders were a sight to behold.</p> 
 <p>“Next, we…” The Fourth Elder gulped, at a loss of what to do.</p> 
 <p>“We go check the First Elder!” The Second Elder gritted his teeth and headed out. He didn’t have the courage to test out Qiu Muxue’s present strength. If the First Elder was really killed as she had said, then he wouldn’t have any reason to seek death. Therefore, the First Elder’s result would decide their future path!</p> 
 <p>The three ran non-stop to the First Elder’s residence. When they approached, a strong stench of blood had already overwhelmed their noses.</p> 
 <p>Their expressions immediately sank. However, the Second Elder still clung to a sliver of hope. He pushed open the door and walked in.</p> 
 <p>The scene inside made them stop dead on their feet.</p> 
 <p>The First Elder, who had been beaten so badly that his dead body no longer looked human, was tied to a pillar. At his feet were multiple corpses, their blood forming a stream that had reached the door.</p> 
 <p>No one in the First Elder’s branch was left alive!</p> 
 <p>Swallowing with difficulty, the Second Elder directly headed back outside. What he had seen was already enough…</p> 
 <p>Not long after the three elders left the tragic scene, the news of Qiu Muxue’s awakening, as well as the takeover of Barbaric Godism, quickly spread, causing heated discussions. Some expected this to be the beginning of a reform, some thought of it as a mere change of oppressors, while some started envisioning a better future.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Qiu Muxue, the center of the discussions, was laughing like crazy in her room…</p> 
 <p>“Did you see their faces? Too funny!! ‘Thank you, Saintess, for letting bygones be bygones.’” Qiu Muxue mimicked the Second Elder, all of her pent-up anger at them finally vented.</p> 
 <p>“It’s still too early to laugh. There are still four people left unresolved.” On the contrary, Bai Xiaofei was indifferent as if it was only something trivial.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, whatever you say! What do we do next?” Propping her chin, Qiu Muxue’s eyes glinted as she kept her gaze on Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Wait for the Third Elder to return. As we’ve planned, he should be hiding somewhere to recover. During this time, we don’t have to do anything.” Bai Xiaofei smiled shallowly.</p> 
 <p>For the first time, Qiu Muxue didn’t find his smile very annoying.</p> 
 <p>“So we continue our act?” Qiu Muxue was a little worried that her fake awakening would be exposed. She could not wait for too long.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, they will definitely be taken care of before you’re exposed,” Bai Xiaofei reassured her before sinking into contemplation.</p> 
 <p>“You’re going to deal with the Second Elder next, aren’t you?” Qiu Muxue asked with a smile.</p> 
 <p>“He talks too much. This kind of person is an unpredictable variable as both the other two elders listen to him. So as long as he’s dead, they will be nothing to worry about.” Bai Xiaofei didn’t regard the Fourth and Fifth Elder highly at all. In his view, they were no different from dead.</p> 
 <p>“When are you going to do it?” asked Qiu Muxue curiously.</p> 
 <p>“He dies when the Third Elder returns,” Bai Xiaofei nonchalantly decided the fate of the Second Elder…</p> 
 <p>In the following, the three elders arranged for Qiu Muxue’s takeover and had finalized the date. As for the defeat of the border war, no one dared to mention it anymore.</p> 
 <p>“Father, you are back.”</p> 
 <p>In Bai Xiaofei’s room, the Third Elder was sitting in a chair, looking at him with satisfaction.</p> 
 <p>“I was wrong to blame you at the beginning. This Qiu Muxue girl is a rare one. You must win her heart,” said the Third Elder solemnly.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei oozed cold sweat. He never expected this to be the first thing coming out of the Third Elder’s mouth.</p> 
 <p>“Of course, don’t worry about that, Father. Is everything going well with the First Elder matter?” He brought the topic back to the right track.</p> 
 <p>The Third Elder laughed joyously and said, “Although the process was a little difficult, the result was great. If there is no surprise, now I should be the strongest among the elders.” There was pride in his voice. Benefiting from the characteristics gained from the stone idol, slaying the First Elder had raised his strength to a higher level.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t you want to advance even further, Father?” asked Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The Third Elder instantly frowned. “What do you mean? Barbaric Godism should be under your control now. Didn’t you say you would win over that woman?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had long prepared the answer to this question.</p> 
 <p>“Double insurance is always better, no? I’ve witnessed her strength. Although her special ability is very strong, her actual fighting power is not as heaven-defying as everyone thinks. As long as you progress a little more, you can be a match for her in a fight!” He threw out an irresistible bait and waited for the Third Elder to bite.</p> 
 <p>Silent for a moment, the Third Elder’s expression grew extremely solemn. “What’s your plan?”</p> 
 <p>“What do you think of the second elder?” Bai Xiaofei asked back with a smile.</p> 
 <p>The Third Elder hesitated.</p> 
 <p>“He didn’t know that it was you who killed the First Elder, so his perception of your strength is still in the past. Moreover, he would never expect that we would want to kill him at a time like his. With the element of surprise and the gap in strength, as long as we create a suitable opportunity, he will die for sure!” Bai Xiaofei analyzed.</p> 
 <p>The Third Elder was more than persuaded. Finally, he said what Bai Xiaofei wanted to hear most, “When do we start?”</p> 
 <p>“The longer it drags the more uncertain it becomes, so let’s do it tonight!” Bai Xiaofei said icily.</p> 
 <p>The Third Elder was startled. “Is it necessary to be in such a hurry?” He hesitated again. What had been going on in the past few days was a little too sudden for him.</p> 
 <p>“Even you didn’t expect it to be so fast, so the Second Elder naturally will never expect this at all,” replied Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The bottom line of the Third Elder was completely breached. He smacked the table and stood up. </p> 
 <p>“Alright!”</p> 
 <p>When night fell, the Third Elder carried a flask of fine wine and went straight to the Second Elder’s place. Because Bai Xiaofei had been creating the illusion that the Third Elder had been home all the time, no one was surprised by his appearance.</p> 
 <p>“Second Brother, open up!” shouted the Third Elder.</p> 
 <p>When the doorman saw that it was the Third Elder outside, he immediately greeted him respectfully.</p> 
 <p>“Third Elder, Second Elder has just retired for the evening. Please wait while I report to him.”</p> 
 <p>“No need, I know which room he sleeps in.” Third Elder swaggered right in and quickly arrived at the door of the sleeping chamber.</p> 
 <p>“My old Second Brother, not coming out to see me?” yelled the Third Elder.</p> 
 <p>At his call, the Second Elder opened the door and came out.</p> 
 <p>“What are you saying? I was just getting dressed,” he explained. Seeing the Third Elder whose face was beet-red and body reeked of alcohol, he let his guard down a little. “What are you so happy about, drinking to this state?”</p> 
 <p>The Second Elder welcomed the Third Elder into his room. The latter immediately found his way to a chair and sat.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t you already know why I’m happy, Second Brother? Come and have a drink with me. Let’s not leave until we are drunk!” The Third Elder grabbed two cups on the table and poured in the wine. Before the Second Elder could doubt him, he drained one cup then said, “Why aren’t you drinking? Don’t tell me you’re afraid that I will hurt you? It doesn’t matter, I’ll drink it.”</p> 
 <p>Then, he drained the other cup.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, the Second Elder completely relaxed. <em>Old Third is dead drunk.</em></p> 
 <p>“Fine, I’ll drink. When have I ever been afraid of you?” he said and took the wine flask before pouring himself two cups and draining them as well.</p> 
 <p>“Second brother, do you know why I am so happy today?” the Third Elder suddenly asked after three rounds of wine.</p> 
 <p>The Second Elder, who had drunk quite a bit, was happy to banter with him. “You are now like the sun at high noon, of course, you should be happy,” he commented with a wry smile and poured himself another cup.</p> 
 <p>When he wasn’t paying attention, the Third Elder ate a pill…</p> 
 <p>“However, there is still something to be desired!” the Third Elder exclaimed.</p>
