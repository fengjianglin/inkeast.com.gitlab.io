 <p>Chapter 655: A Blessing or a Curse?</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei talked all tough, but what he threw out was only a mass of compressed Light of Obliteration…</p> 
 <p>As the saying goes, perfect one skill to dominate the world. So far, nothing had shown to be able to defend against the Light of Obliteration. The only regret for Bai Xiaofei personally was its massive energy consumption.</p> 
 <p>When the blinding light cleared, the huge monster had become history. As all of the black viscous liquid had been consumed by the Light of Obliteration, the second level of the formation also became a thing of the past and a gorgeous light gate appeared behind Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“What will it be this time?” Bai Xiaofei wondered with a wry smile after he deactivated Spiritualization.</p> 
 <p>Curiosity could indeed kill. If he hadn’t entered this peach blossom forest, nothing would have happened. Although he had done his best for a quick victory, the duration of Spiritualization still exceeded what Gu Xing had advised. Bai Xiaofei felt the meridians in his whole body aching…</p> 
 <p>Yet no matter what, he already had no retreat. It was his only option to experience all the abilities of this natural formation!</p> 
 <p><em>Heck! If others can make it out, this lord can as well!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei dared not say anything about everyone else, but he was certain that with Leng Liuying’s personality, she had definitely entered this peach blossom forest, the only thing that stuck out in such a simple place. And if she did, then her two sisters definitely followed her in. In other words, they had left this formation safely.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei just couldn’t figure out how they had been able to pass the second level!</p> 
 <p>Even in his wildest imagination, he could never guess that one would be automatically sent out after wandering for three full hours on the first level…</p> 
 <p>Having accepted his fate, Bai Xiaofei stepped into the door of light. In a dazzling flash, he found himself in a white space. The next second, cold sweat streamed down his face…</p> 
 <p>…… </p> 
 <p>“It should be three hours by now.” Leng Liuying gulped.</p> 
 <p>Her question made everyone even more nervous. It had been almost five hours since they started waiting. The sky was already dark!</p> 
 <p>This peach blossom forest had been explored by countless people. Everyone was sent out after three hours. How could it be different this time?</p> 
 <p>“Perhaps he never went in there?” Cang Lan suggested with a frown.</p> 
 <p>The eyes of the triplets immediately lit up. <em>That’s right! That should be the case!</em></p> 
 <p>However, their newly-rising delight was quickly suppressed by rationality. It was impossible. Bai Xiaofei was a stranger in this area and he had no other place to visit. This peach blossom forest was the only place he’d go to.</p> 
 <p>“I’m going in to find him!”</p> 
 <p>Leng Liuying rushed in, but she took only two steps when her body suddenly floated up. All her struggling was useless as it felt like a big hand was lifting her.</p> 
 <p>“Even I can’t see through this formation. What’s the use of you going in? It’ll just be one more person trapped. If you really believe in him, keep waiting. This is the only thing you can do now,” Cang Lan said as he looked at the forest solemnly.</p> 
 <p>Although he hadn’t seen anyone coming out on their own, this wasn’t the first time he had known of someone not coming out after more than three hours. Those people who never made it out all had a common characteristic, their spirit was far superior to that of the majority! In other words, they were all excellent at solving illusions. This was Cang Lan’s conclusion after watching so many people.</p> 
 <p>If someone could not come out after three hours in this peach forest, there were only two possibilities. One, they would never get out, or two, they defeated the formation!</p> 
 <p>The former had many precedents, while the latter…</p> 
 <p>For some reason he couldn’t explain, Cang Lan had the feeling that he could see this miracle today!</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei was experiencing a baptism from head to toe!</p> 
 <p>What was a blessing in disguise? Bai Xiaofei could tell everyone all about it with his own personal experience. He thought he had found a fun place, but he entered only to find that it was an illusion formation with no exit!</p> 
 <p>Then, he was fortunate enough to find a way out, only to find that he had entered a new one where there was risk to his very life!</p> 
 <p>After trying his best to pass the new illusion, he entered the next one with an uneasy heart, ready to accept that he might lose his life. However, he was greeted with a warm kiss – this was a place full of energy!</p> 
 <p>To what extent?</p> 
 <p>In the Endless State, Bai Xiaofei only needed ten seconds to completely refill his drained body. And the most important thing was that this energy could be directly absorbed by puppet masters!</p> 
 <p>Anyone who entered this place would probably laugh out loud in exhilaration because cultivating there was not a matter of getting twice the result with half the effort, but at least five or six times the result!</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei wanted to cry after a while…</p> 
 <p>His physical quality was outstanding, but at the end of the day, he was only a Grandmaster Rank. He, who had just stepped into the third realm, could not contain much energy at all. Under normal circumstances, other people could stop a while and stabilize their foundation after absorbing enough energy to rank up. Bai Xiaofei, however, could not because the Endless State could not be turned off!</p> 
 <p><em>Sh*t! Could it be that I really have to die from over-absorbing here?!</em></p> 
 <p>At this thought, Bai Xiaofei could feel his swollen meridians. He broke out into a cold sweat.</p> 
 <p>“F*ck it. I’ll just risk it!”</p> 
 <p>Just as he was about to lose control of the surging energy in his body, Bai Xiaofei focused on the origin core in his abdomen!</p> 
 <p>After his previous battle against Dark Wolf, his origin core had been exhausted and entered a half-shutdown state. Unfortunately, only the energy was consumed, while that pink energy that gave Bai Xiaofei a headache didn’t seem to decrease at all…</p> 
 <p>For this reason, Bai Xiaofei had always avoided this little ball that was his origin core as much as possible.</p> 
 <p>But now, he had no other options. He could only pray that Heaven could open its eyes and save him from falling into lust this time…</p> 
 <p>Who would want to do <em>that</em> when they had no sanity at all?!</p> 
 <p>At Bai Xiaofei’s urging, his origin core slowly moved. The energy excess trapped in his body immediately found an outlet and flowed toward it. His origin core then quickly absorbed the supply of energy, and with the stimulation, the Endless State also accelerated!</p> 
 <p>In that way, the Endless Mode and the origin core used Bai Xiaofei’s body as a racing track and launched a competition!</p> 
 <p>But…</p> 
 <p><em>You bastards! This body is mine, mine!!!</em></p>
