 <p><span style>After they sent Lei Shan off, expressions of joy hung on the faces of Xue Ying, Bai Xiaofei, and the others. Based on the outcome, bringing the Principal over this time was an extremely wise choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t get happy too early. The Principal said the earliest he would be able to deal with your problem is tomorrow. How do you plan to get through tonight? Not return to your dormitory room? I dare bet that there’s surely a group of people waiting for you there.” Xue Ying poured down a bucket of cold water yet it didn’t affect Bai Xiaofei at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s there to be afraid of? I have you!” Bai Xiaofei chuckled and revealed an extremely despicable expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, what’re you planning!?” Xue Ying took a step back instinctively, and a trace of panic appeared on her face, but she quickly recovered from this state. </span><i><span style>Why should I be afraid of Bai Xiaofei…?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to hire you as a bodyguard. If you don’t come, then not to mention me, even Mo Ka and the others will suffer misfortune. Even if you can bear to see me being beaten up, you wouldn’t want others to look down upon our class, right?” Since he found Xue Ying’s weak point, Bai Xiaofei had grabbed on tightly and never intended to let go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What you mean is that you want me to go to your male dormitory room?!” Xue Ying’s tone was filled with disbelief, and it sounded as if she’d heard a huge joke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What else? Do you want us to sleep on the streets? Moreover, what’s wrong with the headteacher inspecting the conditions of the dormitory rooms? Could it be that you are worried others would say you’re involved with a student?” The nearby Xu Chen was truly unable to refrain from giggling when she heard this, but she was unable to find any problem with Bai Xiaofei’s logic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s already late, shouldn’t we make a move?” Bai Xiaofei yawned and seemed as if Xue Ying had already agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai Xiaofei, you better remember this. You’ll receive retribution sooner or later!” Xue Ying clenched her fists tightly and stared fixedly at Bai Xiaofei, and she was already puffed up with rage. But, her mouth that was puffed up from anger seemed slightly cute, and it caused Bai Xiaofei to be dazed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s too much retribution that I have to wait for, you should line up first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin Li… wants to go as well….” Lin Li who stood behind Bai Xiaofei pulled lightly on the corner of Bai Xiaofei’s shirt, and her large eyes flickered with a glow of anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be a good girl. The male dormitory isn’t a place for a good girl. We’ll see each other tomorrow, and I’ll accompany you then. Go back and sleep obediently with Xue Chan.” Bai Xiaofei rubbed Lin Li’s head. He’d already understood Lin Li’s temperament clearly, and it was entirely the temperament of a young child….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, it was that of an exceptionally obedient child….</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they left the classroom, Xue Ying who had no choice walked towards the male dormitory with Bai Xiaofei, and the fury on her face didn’t reduce in the slightest because that sentence Bai Xiaofei said, ‘The male dormitory isn’t a place for a good girl’ had caused her to gnash her teeth with hatred towards Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m warning you. If you dare bully Little Li’Li because she’s naïve, I’ll surely castrate you at the first possible moment!” Xue Ying couldn’t help but be worried when she recalled Lin Li’s obedient appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Does the academy require teachers to pay attention to the love affairs of students? Or is it your own personal hobby, Big Sister Xue?” Bai Xiaofei grinned and revealed a smile of understanding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Or Big Sister Xue has been single for too long and can’t bear the sight to see others have good relationships? It’s fine, there’ll surely be one or two crazy people that pursue you, and it’s only a matter of time….” Bai Xiaofei hadn’t finished speaking when the sky and the ground had instantly changed places, and then with a muffled bang, Bai Xiaofei successfully embraced mother earth intimately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll really castrate you if you continue talking nonsense!” Xue Ying patted her hands with extreme satisfaction, and she felt the resentment she’d held back all night had been vented by this low kick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When dealing with someone despicable, one’s methods really had to be even more ruthless, and it was from this moment that Bai Xiaofei’s bitter life began….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei had the feeling as if generations had passed when he arrived at the dormitory entrance because this day was truly a bit too long….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai Xiaofei has returned!!!” Before Bai Xiaofei could enter the entrance to the dormitory, an exclaim of surprise had already sounded out from within. Unknowingly, Bai Xiaofei had already become a ‘celebrity’ in this dormitory building.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Looks like you’re very ‘well received’.” Xue Ying grinned and turned around to look at Bai Xiaofei whose face was badly battered already, and a trace of pride appeared on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed as if she was saying ‘you’re absolutely dead tonight without me!”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, I’ll be even better received in the future.” Bai Xiaofei laughed slyly, and Bai Xiaofei whose nature wouldn’t change even after being beaten up started once again but provoking Xue Ying had already been ranked as something forbidden by him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go. Let me see what sort of monsters are there, and they better be able to allow me to properly move my muscles.” Xue Ying clenched her fist as a trace of anticipation appeared on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the first floor until the eighth, Bai Xiaofei received the baptism of numerous gazes, and this time seemed to be more than double the last time. Many people that intended to watch the show even followed closely behind him as they were deeply afraid of missing anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In next to no time, Bai Xiaofei and Xue Ying had climbed up to the eighth floor, and dormitory room 807 was close at hand. But, unlike the bustling state of the lower floors, the eighth floor was unusually quiet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Looks like the person that has come is quite imposing.” Bai Xiaofei sighed with emotion before slowly placing his hand on the door, and the door opened up while accompanied by a creaking noise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the instant the door was opened, Bai Xiaofei saw a long haired young man with a dark expression sitting on a chair that faced the door. Beside him on either side were respectively two people that stood there silently with arrogance all over their faces, and they looked at Bai Xiaofei without the slightest emotion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Based on their uniform, these five people were all third year students!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Besides the four of them, Mo Ka and the others were already beaten black and blue, and they lay weakly on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re Bai Xiaofei, right?” The young man with a dark expression stood up as a terrifying imposing aura pressed down towards Bai Xiaofei. The Proficient Rank and Master Rank seemed to only be a rank apart, yet this distance of a rank was extraordinarily huge!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Before you ask the name of another, shouldn’t you speak your own name first? Didn’t your mother teach you this?” Bai Xiaofei’s eyes were completely red as he bit his teeth and spoke, and he wished for nothing more than to charge forward and bash up these five people before him. But, he didn’t possess the strength….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re courting death!” Before the young man with a dark expression could speak, the lackey by his side assumed the posture of charging forward. But, right at this moment, Xue Ying arrived at the entrance, and the cloak that represented a teacher was exceptionally striking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Similarly, after she saw Mo Ka and the others who were on the ground, Xue Ying’s expression sank instantaneously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, how many times do you want to use the same tricks? Do you think we’re rookies? And you can casually use a dog to deceive us?” As he sneered, the senior that moved earlier shot out once more, and he charged directly towards Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, this mere distance of two steps was exceptionally far for him because some things weren’t as he had thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Ying sidestepped to stand before Bai Xiaofei, and then her slender hand grabbed accurately onto the wrist of the person that charged over before slowly lifting him up. “Who did you call a dog just now?!”</span></p>
