 <p>Chapter 726: Worn-out Bai Xiaofei!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was a bit dumbfounded. He thought he was fighting the demon king, but how did he become a prisoner?</p> 
 <p><em>And what the hell are these bracelets?</em></p> 
 <p>Slowly regaining his sobriety and looking around, Bai Xiaofei was greeted with a mass reunion: Ferret, Jiao He, Fan Xingyu, the ‘A’ group, Cang Lan, Lin Nishang, Yue Xiaofei, Tu Ying, and the zither expert… None of his close acquaintances after the Holy Snow Mountain were absent. Only Snow escaped with the baby foxes and phoenixes thanks to her familiarity with the mountain.</p> 
 <p>“Where are Liuli and Liuying?!” Finally realizing who was missing, Bai Xiaofei was horrified.</p> 
 <p>“Calm down. The situation is quite complicated. We’ll slowly discuss it.” Cang Lan sighed helplessly.</p> 
 <p>After a long explanation, Bai Xiaofei understood everything and sneered. <em>Motherf*cker wants to take advantage of this lord? You think I’m so easy?!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei called out in his mind and his three puppets successively emerged from the puppet space. Although his energy was sealed, animated puppets could act without the support of their master’s energy, which was their advantage.</p> 
 <p>“Aunt Gold, can you burn this?” Bai Xiaofei raised his hands.</p> 
 <p>Golden Feather looked at the pair of interlocking bracelets for a moment before revealing a disdainful smile. Then, she grasped the bracelets and exerted her energy, breaking them into halves.</p> 
 <p>“If I can’t even handle this garbage, I might as well stop calling myself a sacred beast,” said Golden Feather proudly.</p> 
 <p>Thanks to the beautiful woman earlier, the damage to Bai Xiaofei from using Spiritualization had been negated. Although it only worked once, it was a great help.</p> 
 <p>Golden Feather proceeded to deal with the bracelets on the others and freed them. Fortunately, in this makeshift tent there was only Bai Xiaofei’s group, or else they would have been noticed.</p> 
 <p>“Are we going to act? My team members can gather at any time,” asked Ferret icily. Orton’s imprisonment had greatly irritated him. He would blow up the entire Snow Lion Corps if he could.</p> 
 <p>Ferret was not the only one. There was no one present who didn’t want to give Orton a good beating. Even Cang Lan didn’t want to find an excuse for him.</p> 
 <p>The Hellfire Brigade had been able to leave thanks to their eclectic outfits. In the end, only Ferret was captured as an unidentified Exquisite Rank puppet master.</p> 
 <p>“No need. The soldiers just obey orders, it’s not their fault. The only problem here is Orton.” Bai Xiaofei was not as indignant as the rest and maintained a cool head.</p> 
 <p>“I got out of trouble because of you. This time, I will listen to you.” Although looking almost the same as Lin Li, Lin Nishang’s eyes were full of wisdom, which made it easy to distinguish her from her daughter.</p> 
 <p>Lin Nishang said ‘this time,’ which meant she still bore a grudge against the Snow Kingdom. Cang Lan shook his head in pity. Having offended her, this kingdom’s future would not be very peaceful.</p> 
 <p>Who was Lin Nishang? How many men on this continent were willing to unconditionally answer her calls? Cang Lan couldn’t even think of a number because it was too big!</p> 
 <p>“Doesn’t he want us to go to the Imperial Capital? Then we’ll satisfy him.” Bai Xiaofei smiled as his eyes shone brilliantly.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the others’ eyes also shone with great interest. <em>Sounds like fun!</em></p> 
 <p>“Blackie will take you away. If anyone has other business to attend to, you can leave directly. But if you want to see a play, wait for me,” said Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Huskie immediately activated its ability and slowly fused into Bai Xiaofei’s body and his appearance turned into Bryne’s, shocking those who had never seen him using this ability before.</p> 
 <p><em>Mimicry?! What kind of puppet master is this boy?!</em></p> 
 <p>And the surprise had only just begun. After becoming Bryne, Bai Xiaofei opened the tent.</p> 
 <p>“Go, what are you waiting for?” Bai Xiao called the rest over and walked out of the tent.</p> 
 <p>The group was worried that they’d be discovered, but they soon found that their worries were pointless – nobody could see them at all!</p> 
 <p>Blackie had masked the surrounding environment with illusions. Looking from the outside, nothing was happening in this area at all.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t be too scattered and don’t touch anyone, then you guys can openly walk out of here.” Leaving this last piece of advice, Bai Xiaofei disappeared.</p> 
 <p>The group did as he instructed. Although they were still a little worried when they saw the patrols, nothing happened in the end. No one saw them!</p> 
 <p><em>Isn’t this ability a little too perverse?!</em></p> 
 <p>After reaching a safe area to stop, everyone gulped. Thinking of the abilities that Bai Xiaofei had displayed so far, a similar thought rose in their hearts. No matter what, they must not be his enemy. He was not just scary, he was terrifying!</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei headed towards his destination, saluted by the soldiers of the Snow Lion Corps along the way. This made him aware of how lofty Bryne’s position was in the Snow Lion Corps.</p> 
 <p>Blackie returned to the puppet space after sending Cang Lan’s group to safety. Knowing this, Bai Xiaofei was relieved. He then called out Blackie again. Although Huskie was good, it was better to be absolutely certain. Blackie’s ability was more suitable for the current situation.</p> 
 <p>Getting into stealth, Bai Xiaofei picked up speed. He followed Huskie’s lead and soon arrived at the tent of the Leng triplets. After making sure that there was no one else inside but the three of them, Bai Xiaofei suddenly felt playful.</p> 
 <p>Once again becoming Bryne, he cleared his throat and barged in.</p> 
 <p>“Scram!!” Bai Xiaofei had just entered the tent when a teapot flew at his face. It was Leng Liuying.</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, Bai Xiaofei was trained well. He swiftly stepped aside to evade the teapot, only to see teacups, plates, and bowls next…</p> 
 <p>“Liuying, take a closer look!”</p> 
 <p>Leng Liuli suddenly spoke right before Leng Liuying erupted. Three pairs of eyes then fixed on Bai Xiaofei before turning into three huge eye-rolls…</p>
