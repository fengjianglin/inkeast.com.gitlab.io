 <p>Chapter 870: A Brand New Bai Xiaofei!</p> 
 <p>The area around Bai Xiaofei was nothing but a fiery red as everything had crystallized due to the high temperature. However, it not only had stones, but also flowers and trees!</p> 
 <p>“These should be all naturally formed treasures!” Bai Xiaofei gulped, staring intently at the crystallized vegetation overflowing with fire elements.</p> 
 <p>“Under normal conditions, these things would have to take at least 100,000 years to reach this state,” Golden Feather’s voice rang out in Bai Xiaofei’s sea of consciousness. She had separated from him in the Spiritualized state, but unlike him whose body had been built to adapt to the place, she did not dare to come out. “Compared with your new body, however, everything here is nothing worth mentioning.”</p> 
 <p>Her tone was obviously excited. Bai Xiaofei’s attention was shifted to his own body that was much more muscular, the features much sharper and skin glossier. His lips curled up… into a wry smile.</p> 
 <p>“Am I still human now…?”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Golden Feather and the Demonic God of Pain facepalmed…</p> 
 <p>“You have all the abilities that humans have and don’t have, so this depends on your mindset, but in terms of physical strength, you have reached a peak,” Golden Feather simply concluded.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei chuckled. <em>Whatever, as long as I still look like a human being!</em></p> 
 <p>“So, Aunt Gold, what is my current situation?” he curiously asked. Although he could feel that his body was full of energy, he did not have a thorough understanding of the changes.</p> 
 <p>“Originally, I just wanted to temper your body with our clan’s unique Nirvana method, but I did not expect that the formation is a Heavenly Nonaburn, which exceeds the limit that the Nirvana method can bear. Fortunately, you integrated another refining method along the way, otherwise, you might not have lived.”</p> 
 <p>Golden Feather had no way to communicate with the Demonic God of Pain and therefore did not know that he had been helping Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“As for your physical changes, it’s mostly structural,” she continued. “Before, your energy was stored in your origin core, but it shattered during the previous process and did not recondense after your body was rebuilt. Instead, your whole body now has the ability to store energy. The amount of origin energy in your body should be more than ten times that of before, and this is only because you have not fully mastered and trained your body yet. After you do, this amount will only keep increasing.”</p> 
 <p>It sounded from Golden Feather’s tone that she was not exaggerating at all, leaving Bai Xiaofei super excited. However, he suddenly thought of some problems.</p> 
 <p>For example, did that headache of a pink energy disappear with the origin core? Would it affect him negatively to absorb Nightcharm and the grievances from that black bead? Without the origin core, would his cultivation technique still work normally?</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t even know where to start from.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, allow me.”</p> 
 <p>As he pondered, a dark fog appeared in front of him and slowly condensed into the face of the Demonic God of Pain!</p> 
 <p>“You… you can come out?!” Bai Xiaofei gawked in horror.</p> 
 <p>“What’s with that stupid face? You think this lord wants to come out? Do you know what it means to be able to come out?!” roared the Demonic God of Pain. One could hear sobbing in his voice. “I could not come out before because you couldn’t freely control the demonic energy in your body. That hateful nine-tailed fox set up a seal in your sea of consciousness to limit me. Now, although I can come out, I have completely lost contact with my demonic energy, because you bastard absorbed it all!!”</p> 
 <p>In his agony, the Demonic God of Pain had thrown all image out the window. He just wanted to ruthlessly curse Bai Xiaofei out.</p> 
 <p>But what could cursing do? He had completely become an accessory of Bai Xiaofei, one that was much less useful than the puppets!!</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, let’s talk about your body first.” Upon adjusting his mentality, the Demonic God of Pain looked at Bai Xiaofei with a drooling expression. This body, in terms of potential alone, was on par with his former body!</p> 
 <p>“You had a variety of energies in your body, but because of this shitty formation, they have been forcibly mixed and created a brand new kind similar to origin energy, but at the same time also very different.”</p> 
 <p>“The corrosiveness of demonic energy and grievances, the softness of origin energy, the destructiveness of Nightcharm, and the explosiveness of fire – these characteristics are now fused in your energy. Even if you don’t activate a puppet, unleashing this energy alone would be able to kill a normal person. To put it simply, you are now equivalent to a Multi-Energy Stream puppet master, one that doesn’t even need a puppet!”</p> 
 <p>“In addition to that, your body currently stores a very special force. Although faint, it is there. I don’t know what it does, but it should be nothing simple to be able to coexist with so many high-rank energy types.”</p> 
 <p>Looking at the puzzled Demonic God of Fiend, Bai Xiaofei instantly recalled that pink energy. In addition to that, he did not have any other special energy…</p> 
 <p><em>Damn, it’s already to this point and I still can’t get rid of it!!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Anyway, the new energy and your Endless State makes you an invincible cockroach. At least, I can’t think of any way to destroy your body with your astonishing self-recovery ability, perverse physique, and BUG-like energy foundation. Tsk, smelly boy, you are really blessed after the calamity.”</p> 
 <p>As the Demonic God of Pain showered praises, Bai Xiaofei’s impression of his body once again rose.</p> 
 <p><em>This lord is hella awesome! Hahaha!</em></p> 
 <p>“Wait!” Bai Xiaofei suddenly thought of something very important at the sight of his bare hands. He sank into his sea of consciousness.</p> 
 <p>Seeing the extra thing there, he gulped hard…</p>
