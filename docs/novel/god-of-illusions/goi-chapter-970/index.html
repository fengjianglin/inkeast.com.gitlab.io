 <p>Chapter 970: The Performance Begins!</p> 
 <p>“Alright, don’t you chicken out later!” Bai Xiaofei warned his group of nine men, now in female-soldier disguises.</p> 
 <p>The group of men gulped. This demand was too difficult for them… because Bai Xiaofei wanted to attack the real patrols!</p> 
 <p>This would be a death sentence anywhere else and not just Moonlight. Not to mention how low the status of men in Moonlight was. If the slightest bit went wrong, even the gods wouldn’t be able to save them…</p> 
 <p>“Boss, is there really no other way?” one man asked in a trembling voice.</p> 
 <p>“Even if there is, I won’t use it. If you don’t even have the courage to do this, you won’t be able to follow me in the future. Remember, once you decide on a goal, all obstacles between you and that goal will only have one result,” said Bai Xiaofei, his eyes glinting. “Being crushed by you!”</p> 
 <p>With that, he took the lead to rush into an alley.</p> 
 <p>According to his investigation, after a patrol toured around the entire city, they would come to the palace gate to switch posts, and this alley was the last stop right before that.</p> 
 <p>“Who goes there?!”</p> 
 <p>The alley couldn’t be more desolate and quiet at night, so the arrival of Bai Xiaofei’s group immediately aroused the guards’ vigilance.</p> 
 <p>“Why are you guys here? The next shift should be ours!” said Bai Xiaofei as he stood behind several people so as to avoid getting his energy sealed by the guards’ weapons. Although their sealing ability was perverse, it wouldn’t activate unless they pointed their weapons at him.</p> 
 <p>“Which team are you from? Reinforcements?” asked the leader of the guards after recovering from her brief surprise.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei naturally couldn’t answer this question, but he had no intention to anyway. What he wanted was a brief moment of surprise.</p> 
 <p>“Something’s wrong about them!” he shouted the secret phrase.</p> 
 <p>This once again stunned the guards. Their first thought was not to resist but explain, and this hesitation made the process extremely simple. When the guards returned to their senses, they had been disarmed.</p> 
 <p>“Well? Nothing scary, right?” Bai Xiaofei patted the man who had been worrying before with pride on his face.</p> 
 <p>“Boss… My legs are a little weak…” The man’s voice was trembling as he fearfully looked at the tied-up guards.</p> 
 <p>“Tch, look at you. Just… try to hide it. Next is our time to perform!” Shaking his head, Bai Xiaofei gave up on trying to change these men’s mental state right away. “Up ahead!”</p> 
 <p>Then, he led the group and swaggered toward the palace entrance with his head held high and said to the soldiers there, “You’ve worked hard. Let us take over. You can go back and rest.”</p> 
 <p>The guards at the gate were showing signs of fatigue, so the arrival of the next group delighted them. When people were in a good mood, they relaxed their guard and therefore not a hint of doubt crossed their mind at all.</p> 
 <p>“We’ll leave it to you then. I don’t know what the crazy men are up to, but we must not make any mistakes here,” the team captain reminded Bai Xiaofei with goodwill, and after seeing him nod, she retreated from her post with her group.</p> 
 <p>“Everything is going according to plan. You can move closer to me.” Bai Xiaofei’s voice reached the three hundred men’s ears through Huskie’s marks.</p> 
 <p>Everyone was ecstatic to hear this.</p> 
 <p>“Implement as planned!” Zhuang Shuo instantly said to the people around him.</p> 
 <p>Then, the fake patrols that were scattered everywhere in the city issued an alarm at the same time and threw all the city soldiers into confusion.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the situation?!”</p> 
 <p>All the nearest patrol teams immediately rushed to the place where the alarms were issued. Because their original routine was disrupted at this moment, no one could judge whether it was right for any patrol to be there or not.</p> 
 <p>“There are men, a lot of them! They all ran away before we could capture them. I think they are organized.”</p> 
 <p>This was the answer that all the real patrols received, which immediately triggered a state of alert.</p> 
 <p>“Attention, all soldiers. Carry out carpet searches! Signal immediately when you find the targets!”</p> 
 <p>Team captains began to give out orders. Following them, Bai Xiaofei’s people naturally didn’t have to walk around the city according to a fixed route.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei released Blackie and monitored the situation within a one-kilometer radius. Then, he guided his scattered teams to take advantage of the chaos and head to him one by one before leading them into the palace.</p> 
 <p>Unlike his smooth sailing, the other contestants were in a dire situation as the patrols became extremely active. Most planned to sneak in quietly, but now it was no longer possible.</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei strode towards victory, a scene he could never imagine was playing out in a luxury mansion within the city.</p> 
 <p>“No! You cannot! Do you know why Big Sister had Second Sister organize this shitty servant competition?!” shouted Ye Tong so loudly that she scared the servants outside the room.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the person being yelled at, Zhu Chunyang, was smiling ear to ear.</p> 
 <p>“Of course I know. In fact, I originally didn’t come here for you. You know, although Heavenly Star is a kingdom, we are nothing compared to Moonlight. If even you can’t handle the Sacks, we will also be doomed as your neighbor. So, I came here to find out the situation, and I should have left when the investigation was done, but I didn’t expect to meet you and changed my mind. Instead of waiting for Moonlight to solve the problem, I should devote myself to joining it, so that I can confidently ask your sister for your hand in marriage,” Zhu Chunyang slowly explained.</p> 
 <p>Ye Tong’s expression was full of grievance. “But the border is dangerous! You are supposed to be my servant for life. I forbid you from dying…” Her voice was getting lower and lower as she teared up.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I wouldn’t dare go if it was just me, but we now have a very interesting person!” Zhu Chunyang’s lips curled up as a face he hated so much he just wanted to bite off emerged in his mind.</p> 
 <p><em>Damn brat! If it weren’t that this king has use for you, I would have taught you a memorable lesson!</em></p>
