 <p>Chapter 753: A Chain of Schemes! (3)</p> 
 <p>After entering Starflame City, the group of students did not rest at all before starting to search. Moreover, their goal couldn’t be more obvious: clues on Blood Diamonds!</p> 
 <p>Very quickly, they locked onto the inn where Old Song’s group was located.</p> 
 <p>The two parties then entered a deadlock. The students wanted to go inside to have a look, while Old Song’s people refused to let them in. Judging from the situation, it was likely that they were going to fight.</p> 
 <p>Although the student group only consisted of first and second-year students, normal people would be scared to death to face thirty puppet masters together, let alone fight back.</p> 
 <p>“Friends, even if you are from Starnet, you can’t be unreasonable.” Bai Xiaofei slowly came out. He was still assuming Liu Heng’s appearance, so the students didn’t recognize him.</p> 
 <p>“This brother, we are not being unreasonable. There is a problem with this Blood Diamond thing and we just don’t want it to continue to spread harm in the continent. I hope that you can cooperate, we will not mess up your items.”</p> 
 <p>The speaker was Liu Ming, the next Community president after Bai Xiaofei. Despite his unremarkable looks, he was a genius with a cautious mind, currently ranked third on the Illusionary Sandboard Ranking after Bai Xiaofei and Sima Ye.</p> 
 <p>“This classmate, no matter whatever is wrong with the Blood Diamonds, we are only resellers. If you want to investigate the goods, it’s better to go to the supplier instead of us, don’t you think?” Pausing, Bai Xiaofei added, “Of course, we can’t give you our supplier’s information as it’s strictly confidential, or else I might as well stop doing business.”</p> 
 <p>There was nothing that could be refuted in Bai Xiaofei’s speech. When he finished, Liu Ming looked awkward.</p> 
 <p>Of course, it was not that Liu Ming didn’t know what to say in response. It was only an act so that he could leave the place. The task he received from Bai Xiaofei was to make a scene and attract attention, and he had completed it. Only that no one had given him an excuse to leave and it was giving him a headache.</p> 
 <p>“We will be watching you!” Liu Ming snorted coldly before leading the group out of the inn.</p> 
 <p>“Those brats are really tired of living!!” Old Song walked out ‘just in time,’ right after Liu Ming’s group disappeared from sight.</p> 
 <p>Nowhere to be found when there was trouble but was the first to act all formidable when the trouble was gone, Old Song’s character was clear for everyone to see.</p> 
 <p>“I’m going to discuss with Bai Sicheng about how to deal with those students tonight. We can’t wait any longer. Their purpose is too clear. I’m afraid something will really go wrong,” Bai Xiaofei decided.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, Old Liu, you go. I’ll keep guard here, there won’t be any problems!” Patting Bai Xiaofei’s shoulder, Old Song decisively chose to hide in his turtle shell.</p> 
 <p>“Whether Bai Sicheng is a reliable ally or not depends on what he chooses tonight!” Leaving these words, Bai Xiaofei left the inn.</p> 
 <p>…</p> 
 <p>As a small city in the border area, Starflame City was quiet in the evening. Except for the few drunkards and gamblers, no one wanted to be night owls. However, tonight was destined to not be as quiet as usual.</p> 
 <p>At the inn that hosted the Starnet group, several students were standing guard.</p> 
 <p>In the dark, a figure quietly snuck over. </p> 
 <p>Keep an eye on the target, wait, seize the opportunity, and move! A set of smooth actions repeated before the sentry students could react. The next second, they collapsed on the ground, their eyes wide with brimming unwillingness and fear of death.</p> 
 <p>After the sentries were handled, several agile-looking figures snuck in and began the hunt!</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, on a rooftop not far away, Old Song was monitoring what happened at the inn with his puppet. Seeing the students fall down one by one, his heart was completely set at ease. Nothing else was better proof that Bai Sicheng was a reliable partner than this!</p> 
 <p>However, he couldn’t be happy for too long as a loud explosion echoed. Then, several figures were sent flying out from the inn, followed by four or five students covered in energy shields.</p> 
 <p>However, the students who clearly had the upper hand did not pursue victory but ran straight out of the city. Before long, the city soldiers were alerted and closed all of the gates as well as shut down any businesses that were still operating.</p> 
 <p>In order to avoid being captured by the soldiers, Old Song left. He had seen what he wanted to see. All he needed to do now was wait for the good news from the higher-ups.</p> 
 <p>Little did Old Song know, a pair of eyes were observing him in the dark. Seeing Old Song leave, Bai Xiaofei knew that his plan had entered the final stage. He also vanished into the night.</p> 
 <p>…</p> 
 <p>In the woods outside the city, a group of Starnet students quietly waited. Most of them were the ones that had just been ‘killed’ by Wang Hang’s group earlier.</p> 
 <p>“Everyone has worked hard,” said Bai Xiaofei as he descended from the air.</p> 
 <p>Seeing him, the junior students’ eyes sparkled.</p> 
 <p>“Boss!”</p> 
 <p>“Boss Bai!”</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother, you have arrived!”</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>If Bai Xiaofei was a legend in the eyes of the general Starnet populace, then to these students, he was a super legend, for they were all students of the Demon of Illusions. Many of them joined the department because of him.</p> 
 <p>It took great determination for a puppet master to set illusion as their main stream, and the existence of Bai Xiaofei gave them that belief!</p> 
 <p>As for the sneak attack just now, apart from Wang Hang, the rest of the ‘attackers’ were illusions created by this group of students. In other words, what Old Song had seen was nothing but a play, and he fell for it.</p> 
 <p>“You guys did a great job. If I didn’t know it in advance, it would be difficult to tell that it was an illusion.” Bai Xiaofei was not stingy with his approval. From the perspective of a senior, this group of juniors had done very well.</p> 
 <p>“Of course, we can’t embarrass you, Boss Bai! What do you need us to do next?” a student boldly replied. However, his face was flushed bright red. It was truly exciting to talk to one’s idol!</p> 
 <p>“There’s nothing to trouble you with. Go back to class and leave the rest to me.” Bai Xiaofei then looked at the quiet Liu Ming. “Remember, the Illusion Stream is not weak! I believe that the Demon of Illusions will have a wonderful future under your leadership!”</p>
