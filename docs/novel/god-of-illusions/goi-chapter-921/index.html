 <p>Chapter 921: Devastating!</p> 
 <p>The eyes of the five godsmiths immediately fell upon Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>It was impossible to say that Bai Xiaofei felt no pressure upon being stared at by the pillars of the puppetsmith world. After all, what he was going to do next would not be courteous.</p> 
 <p>“Ladies and gentlemen, what I’m going to say may offend you, so I hope for your forgiveness.” Bai Xiaofei cupped his hands apologetically before his expression abruptly grew solemn.</p> 
 <p>Seeing his change of expression, the five godsmiths tensed. They had a feeling that their deepest secrets were about to be uncovered.</p> 
 <p>And indeed…</p> 
 <p>“Senior Blossom, do you still remember Qiu Liang?”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the rest of the room gasped. <em>How dare he mention this?!</em></p> 
 <p>Qiu Liang could be said to be a knot in Blossom’s heart. If it weren’t for this person, she might have become a godsmith much earlier. A person who loved her so much that in order to get her, killed the person she loved the most, and in the end, died at her hands.</p> 
 <p>With the passage of time, this matter had become a forbidden topic for those who knew Blossom: it must never be mentioned!</p> 
 <p>Otherwise, the anger of a godsmith was something that very few could afford!</p> 
 <p>“Take back your words and get out of here, and you may still be able to leave alive!”</p> 
 <p>Blossom’s reaction was exactly as everyone imagined, including Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Senior, if I were scared that I’d die, I wouldn’t be standing here saying such things. Even if you want to kill me, I still have to ask!” said Bai Xiaofei firmly as he looked Blossom in the eyes.</p> 
 <p>The staring contest lasted nearly twenty seconds and ended with a cold snort from Blossom.</p> 
 <p>“Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. I am now Blossom and not that little girl of the past. That name has nothing to do with me anymore. My interest now is entirely on making puppets,” she said indifferently.</p> 
 <p>Except for Bai Xiaofei, everyone looked appalled.</p> 
 <p><em>What just happened?! Why did she answer it?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Thank you, senior.” Bai Xiaofei bowed to Blossom and shifted his eyes away from her.</p> 
 <p>Blossom snorted again but did not leave the room. She answered his question because she wanted to see whether he could find out who produced the human puppets. At that auction, two of her three disciples had died!</p> 
 <p>This was also why Bai Xiaofei had chosen her as the first to ask. He was betting that she’d cooperate for the sake of her disciples. Once the first person cooperated, the process would become much simpler!</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei’s eyes fell upon Nanmo Sheng, the latter felt his whole body tense. Everyone had their own past that they didn’t want to mention, and he was no exception.</p> 
 <p>“Senior Nanmo, when your son died in a faraway riot, you swore an eye for an eye from those who caused it. However, twenty years have passed and you still haven’t done anything. Don’t tell me you have forgotten your oath.”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Bai Xiaofei’s voice fell, Nanmo Sheng’s expression instantly grew ugly.</p> 
 <p>The rest no longer had the attitude of watching someone else’s bustle. Looking at the situation, it would be their turn soon.</p> 
 <p>“The rioters are all dead, so my revenge naturally was taken. Why, do you want me to whip their corpses?”</p> 
 <p>Nanmo Sheng’s tone was irritating, but Bai Xiaofei ignored it. After all, he was even ready to be beaten.</p> 
 <p>“But as far as I know, there is something strange about your son’s death. Don’t say you didn’t know about it,” he said, making Nanmo Sheng’s face turn beet red.</p> 
 <p>“You brat! If you continue like this, don’t blame this old man for being rude!” Nanmo Sheng smacked the table and stood up. It looked like Bai Xiaofei really wasn’t far away from being beaten.</p> 
 <p>However, Blossom opened her mouth to speak to the surprise of the room.</p> 
 <p>“Why, old man? Something you can’t say? Now this is interesting.” Blossom looked at Nanmo Sheng with obvious ill-intent, as if trying to let out her pent-up anger from earlier on him.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Nanmo Sheng stopped gnashing his teeth and gradually calmed down. He was also reminded of the purpose of this meeting – to find the puppetsmith behind the human puppets. If he failed to answer Bai Xiaofei’s question well, he might become a suspect.</p> 
 <p>“Since you already know everything, you should also know the tragic overnight massacre of General Lang Ri’s family of 167 members nineteen years ago.” Nanmo Shengly sat back down.</p> 
 <p>Everyone gulped. The massacre of the Lang family was known as an unsolved case, but now it seemed there was something else…</p> 
 <p>“Thank you, senior, for dispelling my doubts!” Bai Xiaofei cupped his hands to Nanmo Sheng, then turned his gaze to Pinocchio.</p> 
 <p>Although he didn’t say anything, Pinocchio’s face sank the instant their eyes met. However, what had to come would come eventually…</p> 
 <p>“Senior, do you miss your daughter?”</p> 
 <p>The question was short, but for Pinocchio, it had been several decades long.</p> 
 <p>Pinocchio once had a lovely little daughter, who was his only family. However, one time when she was watching him forge a puppet, he accidentally blew up the furnace…</p> 
 <p>After that, Pinocchio spent his life in guilt and did not step out of his place for eight years, after which he became a godsmith!</p> 
 <p>“I miss her very much,” he uttered after a long silence, the heavy emotions in his voice having fermented for decades.</p> 
 <p>“What would you do if there was a chance to bring her back to life?” asked Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Everyone was stunned.</p> 
 <p><em>Resurrection?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Human puppet?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Smelly boy! Don’t go too far!! You think I’d make my daughter into a human puppet?!!” After Nanmo Sheng, Pinocchio became the second to strike the table with fury in his voice.</p> 
 <p>“Sorry, senior. I have been too abrupt. You can sit down,” Bai Xiaofei apologized and his eyes swept to the next person, Heartless Snow. “Senior, in fact, we have a connection.”</p> 
 <p>Unlike with others, Bai Xiaofei actually smiled when he talked to Heartless Snow, but it only flustered the latter. Seeing his confused expression, Bai Xiaofei mobilized his origin energy and the Purple Luan wings unfolded at his back.</p> 
 <p>Heartless Snow instantly understood. Purple Luan was his work.</p> 
 <p>“So it was you who gave this to me,” said Heartless Snow as an ordinary-looking seed appeared on his palm. He shook his head with pity. “It’s good stuff, but unfortunately it’s useless to me. Now I can just return it to its original owner.”</p> 
 <p>Heartless Snow then tossed the seed to Bai Xiaofei to the latter’s surprise. However, this time, the seed reacted the moment Bai Xiaofei touched it. It cracked with a clear and crisp sound, revealing a shuttle-shaped stone as translucent as jade.</p> 
 <p>It was not until then that Bai Xiaofei understood that the dusty appearance was only a shell, which was why so many people failed to understand what it was. However, he remained in the dark as to why it suddenly reacted this time and what it could be useful for.</p> 
 <p>“Sure enough, it’s destined to be yours. So I finally did one thing right.” Heartless Snow smiled without a trace of reluctance, even if the seed looked like something extraordinary.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei still had to ask his question!</p> 
 <p>“Senior, it’s rumored that you are seriously ill and will die soon, and it seems that you’ve been looking for a cure. If I guess correctly, you’ve been collecting odd items from everywhere for a hope to live.” Bai Xiaofei really didn’t let anyone down with his merciless words.</p> 
 <p>“Indeed I am ill, but it’s not as bad as the rumors say. And I won’t let myself use a puppet body, you can rest assured about that. I still have decades of life left, during which I believe I will find the cure to my condition.” Heartless Snow knew full well why Bai Xiaofei asked this question. After all, using the human puppet technique to rebuild oneself was a feasible cure.</p> 
 <p>“Senior, I hope you will recover soon. If there is anything you need that I can help with, please don’t hesitate to tell me.” Bai Xiaofei smiled slightly at Heartless Snow before turning to the last person, Thousand Flames.</p> 
 <p>“Lad, I know what you want to ask me. I don’t mind the way I look now. My disability is a fact, and I don’t struggle against it. I won’t do anything contrary to moralities. So, save me some face, won’t you?” said Thousand Flames before Bai Xiaofei could open his mouth. Knowing that he couldn’t escape the same fate after the other four had all answered their questions, he took the initiative to poke his own sore spot instead of letting someone else do it.</p> 
 <p>Hearing these words, Bai Xiaofei let out a long sigh. “Alright, seniors, thank you for your cooperation. I’m done.”</p> 
 <p>Everyone heaved a sigh of relief. However, this begged the question: <em>Who is it?!</em></p>
