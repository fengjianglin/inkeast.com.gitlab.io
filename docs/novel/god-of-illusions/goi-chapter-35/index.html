 <p>“Heh, Junior Brother, you’ve asked the key point!” As soon as he heard Bai Xiaofei ask about the Bounty Rankings, Bamboo’s interests were instantly aroused, yet he was already pushed aside by Fat Dog before he could even speak.</p>
 <p>“I’ll tell this to you.” Fat Dog’s face carried a trace of excitement, and he’d successfully seized over the right to speak.</p>
 <p>“You don’t know the Bounty Rankings, so you surely don’t know of the eight rankings of Starnet Academy, right?” Bai Xiaofei shook his head lightly when faced with Fat Dog’s question.</p>
 <p>“That’s good. Now listen….”</p>
 <p>“We’ve arrived at the infirmary. Even if you aren’t in a hurry, Junior Brother’s girlfriend is in a hurry. Keep your crap for later after we go in.” Fat Dog hadn’t finished speaking when he was forcefully interrupted by Bamboo who’d been pushed away earlier.</p>
 <p>When he raised his head to look over, he noticed that they’d already arrived before an enormous building that was ancient styled, and there was an enormous medicine furnace that seemed to be extremely imposing and required at least over 10 people to join their arms around it at the entrance.</p>
 <p>“This is the infirmary. You have to maintain silence upon entering it because, besides the sick, anyone that makes loud noises will suffer grave consequences.” Fat Dog who stood by Bai Xiaofei’s side pointed out extremely seriously.</p>
 <p>After they confirmed that Bai Xiaofei wouldn’t make a mistake, Bamboo and Fat Dog led the way around the medicine cauldron before swiftly entering the infirmary.</p>
 <p>The infirmary in Starnet Academy was divided into a total of five floors. The first floor was the place to obtain medicine and refine medicine. The second floor was mainly for treating external injuries while the third floor was mainly for treating internal injuries. The fourth floor was the place the heavily injured and those that were seriously ill usually resided. The fifth floor was a high level treatment area that only important figures could enter.</p>
 <p>Lin Li’s condition belonged within the scope of the second floor, whereas, it was even more obvious for Fat Dog and Bamboo.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, it’s only ordinary fatigue. She just has to lay her for a while, and it won’t be long before she’ll be able to wake up. I’ll ask someone to send over some medicine to recover her physical strength later, and you just have to feed it to her after she wakes up.” The person that spoke was a third year senior sister that wore glasses and the brown coat that belonged especially to the infirmary, and her light violet Cheongsam drew out her alluring figure.</p>
 <p>The senior sister left after explaining to Bai Xiaofei what he had to do, and Fat Dog and Bamboo who were both respectful and fond of the senior sister ran in hastily.</p>
 <p>After the care in the infirmary, their injuries had obviously become much better. At the very least, Bai Xiaofei was able to roughly discern their appearances….</p>
 <p>“What the f*ck! Junior, is this your girlfriend?!” Fat Dog and Bamboo let out exclaims of shock at the same time when they saw Lin Li who lay on the bed, and their saliva instantly started flowing.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei sidestepped and blocked their vision before revealed a silly smile along with them.</p>
 <p>“Senior, we can be considered to be friends, right?” Bai Xiaofei didn’t speak frankly yet the meaning within his words was already extremely obvious, whereas, Fat Dog and Bamboo could be said to be righteous as well because they hurriedly wiped off the saliva on their mouths.</p>
 <p>“One shouldn’t covet the wife of a friend. We have our own principles, and it was just a normal reaction….” As they smiled embarrassedly, Fat Dog and Bamboo quickly fixed their expressions.</p>
 <p>“But, Junior Brother, it wouldn’t be a problem for this girlfriend of yours to be placed on the Blossom Rankings!”</p>
 <p>“Right, right, right! It’s even to the extent that it wouldn’t be a problem for her to charge into the top few rankings!”</p>
 <p>Both of them spoke in perfect harmony, and they once again spoke of a term that Bai Xiaofei didn’t know.</p>
 <p>“Seniors, please have a seat. Can you tell Junior Brother what exactly these eight rankings are?” After he invited both of them to have a seat, Bai Xiaofei moved their attention from Lin Li to his question.</p>
 <p>“This is an interesting subject!” The chubby Fat Dog rubbed his hands together before continuing with the topic he hadn’t finished earlier.</p>
 <p>“The eight rankings are divided into two types. One type is acknowledged by the academy, and there’re a total of four. They’re respectively the Starnet Rankings, Combat Rankings, Command Rankings, and Popularity Rankings.</p>
 <p>“The other type is only spread between students, and they’re respectively the Wealth Rankings, Blossom Rankings, Treasure Rankings, and Bounty Rankings.” Fat Dog had just finished speaking of the names of the eight rankings when Bamboo instantly pinned him down.</p>
 <p>“It’s my turn! It’s my turn!” After he seized over the right to speak, Bamboo cleared his throat and continued.</p>
 <p>“The Starnet Rankings can be said to be one of the foundations of our academy. It updates the various assignments and commissions from within the academy or the outside world on a real-time basis. All students in the first year or above may take assignments from the Starnet Rankings, whereas, those that complete the assignments will obtain the corresponding points. So, the Starnet Rankings is sometimes called the Point Rankings as well because the assignments on the Starnet Rankings are ranked according to the number of points provided.”</p>
 <p>“Points?” Bai Xiaofei revealed a bewildered expression as he interrupted Bamboo.</p>
 <p>“Points can be used to be exchanged for Starnet Stones. At the same time, possessing sufficient points is one of the requisites to graduating, and a lot of people were unable to obtain their graduation cert in the end because their points were insufficient.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei nodded and grunted lightly in acknowledgment, and then Bamboo continued.</p>
 <p>“The Combat Rankings is also called the Genius Rankings. Many organizations that come to Starnet Academy would select the students they want according to the rankings on the Combat Rankings.</p>
 <p>“Just as its name implies, the Combat Rankings is naturally ranked based on who is more formidable in battle. Moreover, this rankings changes in real time as well, and so long as you’re willing, you can challenge those 100 people on the Combat Rankings. If you defeat them in a fair battle, then you’ll replace their position.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s eyes lit up abruptly when he finished listening to the introduction of the Combat Rankings. “Can I use all sorts of methods in battle?”</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Fat Dog and Bamboo were slightly stunned when they heard that Bai Xiaofei was interested towards the Combat Rankings, and then they revealed an experienced expression.</p>
 <p>“That is true. But, Junior Brother, this ranking isn’t something you can consider now. There’re over 10,000 people when all the students of Starnet Academy are added together yet there’re only 100 on the rankings. So, even the person that’s last on the rankings isn’t someone you can resist.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t pay much attention to Bamboo’s warning, yet he still nodded.</p>
 <p>“Senior, don’t worry. I’m just asking. You can continue.”</p>
 <p>“Next is the Command Rankings. All the people on this ranking are freaks whose intelligence have attained a monstrous level. At the same time, the people on this ranking are people that the various Empires would fight to the death to seize over to their side. Besides that, the standard of one’s ability is judged by the Illusionary Sandboard. You’ll be able to command an army in there, and the most levels you lead your army through, the higher your ranking will be.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t interrupt this time, but this ranking was remembered by him.</p>
 <p>“The final ranking acknowledged by the academy is the Popularity Rankings. This ranking is comparatively fixed because the academy will organize voting every single year. Practically all those who enter the rankings are the backbone members of the Student Council, and they’re responsible for assisting the academy to manage various affairs.” Bamboo revealed a proud expression as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Your Senior, me, just happens to be one of the people on this ranking. Even though my ranking isn’t very high, if you mention my name, Chu Gan[1.Same thing as Fei Gou and Fat Dog, Chu Gan sounds like Bamboo in Chinese.], in the Furnace of Agarwood, it would still be slightly useful.”</p>
 <p>“F*ck, stop boasting! Aren’t you embarrassed to say this when you’re right at the bottom, move aside.” Fat Dog seemed to be extremely dissatisfied with Chu Gan’s actions of showing off, and he pulled Chu Gan to the side.</p>
 <p>“I’ll explain the remaining four.” After he left the disgruntled Chu Gan aside, Fei Gou started to explain the remaining four rankings to Bai Xiaofei.</p>
