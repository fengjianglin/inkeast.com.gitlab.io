 <p>Chapter 806: Long Time No See!</p> 
 <p>The Windlove slave market was feverish as ever. Despite having been there once, Bai Xiaofei still marveled at the thriving sight.</p> 
 <p>They said people’s benefits were not easy to earn, but that was inapplicable here, where people were goods!</p> 
 <p>“Boss, aren’t they a little too much…” Listening to the noisy hawking and seeing slaves being displayed like objects, Shi Kui carefully inched closer to Bai Xiaofei with fear of human nature in his voice.</p> 
 <p>Shi Kui was definitely not the only one with that idea. As students of Starnet, the rest found it difficult to accept such a thing as trading intelligent entities.</p> 
 <p>“It’s but the evolutionary version of the law of the jungle. Here, you can’t preach humanity. This is a problem of this whole continent. As long as lawless zones like this one exist, this kind of business will not go away.” Although Bai Xiaofei’s tone was indifferent, the glint in his eyes said otherwise.</p> 
 <p>From those eyes, even someone slow like Shi Kui could see his desire to change this situation!</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go, I don’t want to stay here too long,” Bai Xiaofei said lightly and headed toward the goatee man’s store.</p> 
 <p>Along the way, he kept an eye on the surroundings but did not see the person he wanted to see. A trace of loss welled up in his heart.</p> 
 <p><em>Really not coming at all?</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei still carried with him a hint of hope as he arrived at the goatee man’s shop. The latter was already waiting at the door as expected.</p> 
 <p>“My lord, you have arrived.” The man’s enthusiasm rose to a new level upon seeing Bai Xiaofei. Aside from his moneybag identity, it was clear what his new outfit represented.</p> 
 <p>This was why Tan Xin insisted he came out wearing his current outfit. The convenience it provided in Windlove was definitely not small.</p> 
 <p>As for Tan Xin – the city lord herself, the goatee man did not pay attention to her, because barely anyone knew that the city lord was actually a little girl.</p> 
 <p>“My goods should be ready?” Bai Xiaofei asked with a straight face.</p> 
 <p>“Of course! All ready! And not only me, but other businesses also want to sell the slaves in their hands to you, my lord. I just don’t know if you can take them all.” The goatee man immediately donned an ingratiating smile and rubbed his hands expectantly. He did not bridge the others to Bai Xiaofei for nothing. If Bai Xiaofei bought all the slaves, the commission he would earn would be a fortune.</p> 
 <p>“I want as many as you have, but make sure there is no problem with the quality.”</p> 
 <p>Seeing Bai Xiaofei’s fearless manner, the man’s eyes lit up.</p> 
 <p>“Yes! Please wait a moment, my lord. I’ll contact them now!” saying this, he rushed to the door.</p> 
 <p>However, before the goatee man could leave the shop, a cold voice rang out, “Boss, our contract has not expired yet, right?”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this voice, the goatee man froze in place. Cold sweat flowed down his face and his mouth twitched.</p> 
 <p>“Long time no see, President Bai!” Tong Fei glared at Bai Xiaofei with thick murderous intent.</p> 
 <p>“Oh hey, isn’t it my good brother Tong Fei? Long time no see!” Bai Xiaofei burst out laughing with genuine joy – because Tong Fei’s appearance meant that his efforts were not in vain!</p> 
 <p>“And here I asked myself how Heartless could die to some small fries. It turned out the real mastermind was the miracle of Starnet. Unfortunately though, the so-called miracle will fall here.” Tong Fei’s cannibalistic eyes never left Bai Xiaofei. “I shall avenge Heartless!”</p> 
 <p>Looking at Tong Fei in near insanity, Bai Xiaofei shook his head with a chuckle. “I wouldn’t be called a miracle if I die at the hands of people like you.”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Bai Xiaofei’s voice fell, Tong Fei exploded. A weak energy flow surged and threatened Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t forget our mission. We’re not here to help you get revenge. And with your little ability, you’ll probably die.” A person behind Tong Fei pulled him back before he could make a move.</p> 
 <p>“Brat, you can keep your life for the time being, but you shall not leave the Windless Zone alive!” Tong Fei declared before turning to the goatee man and said coldly, “I’m here for the slaves. You should know what to do.”</p> 
 <p>The goatee man immediately looked at Bai Xiaofei with a troubled expression. Both parties weren’t people who he could afford to offend. His life lay with Bai Xiaofei’s decision. He knew Tong Fei very well, there was no possibility of discussion with him.</p> 
 <p>“My lord…” The goatee hesitated, but what he didn’t expect was that Bai Xiaofei was unusually generous.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I won’t make it difficult for you. I’m not in a hurry, so let them have it this time,” Bai Xiaofei said calmly and turned to his own people. “Let’s go back for tea.”</p> 
 <p>With that, the large group went for the door, passing by Tong Fei’s group as if the latter was invisible. However, no one noticed the slight energy fluctuation from Tan Xin…</p> 
 <p>Not long after Bai Xiaofei left, Tong Fei’s group received the slaves and prepared for transportation. The slave team was so huge that it could compare to a small army, and the ones leading this ‘army’ were the people that came with Tong Fei.</p> 
 <p>“That Starnet boy will not let this slide. We must be careful. If he really follows us, make it so that he cannot leave!” Tong Fei said coldly. From his attitude, it was as if he wished for Bai Xiaofei to follow them.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry. Even if you don’t say so, as long as he dares to come, we will make him stay!” declared the person who had previously stopped Tong Fei, his eyes gleaming with murderous intent. No one was allowed to ruin their business!</p> 
 <p>“We have talked to Unify Business and they will send help this time. After we settle these slaves, our president’s plan will be basically completed, and that’s when our All-Around Merchant Group rises!” another person chimed in.</p> 
 <p>This was why they risked coming despite knowing that Bai Xiaofei’s group was present. Their plan had entered the final stage!</p> 
 <p>“But Tong Fei, you must adjust your mentality. You’re not acting like a think tank should at all,” another person reminded, bringing the topic back to Tong Fei.</p> 
 <p>“I have my own discretion.” Tong Fei retorted with a cold snort. However, he inwardly reflected on himself. Indeed, he lost control after seeing Bai Xiaofei again, and he had never experienced this feeling of being tricked to the point of losing his composure before.</p> 
 <p>Everyone in the group had their own ideas, but little did they know they did not get involved in just an undercurrent, but a huge vortex!</p>
