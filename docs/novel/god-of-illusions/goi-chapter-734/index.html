 <p>Chapter 734: Dialogue with Hu Xian’er!</p> 
 <p>The gathering lasted for a whole day without a change of location. For the whole day, Bai Xiaofei and the Savage Class had been eating, drinking, chatting in a private room of the Hundred Flavor House.</p> 
 <p>After half a year, everyone had grown and they all wanted to tell Bai Xiaofei about their changes. Even so long after the Savage Class broke up, they still regarded him as their class monitor!</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er, the only non-Savage Class member in the whole group, did not seem out of place and was not any less familiar with them than Bai Xiaofei. This was her biggest gain in the past half year. She had conquered all the people in Starnet that were close with Bai Xiaofei, even Lin Li!</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t expect your capacity for alcohol to improve this much.”</p> 
 <p>On the roof of the Hundred Flavor House building, Hu Xian’er sat down beside Bai Xiaofei and looked up at the stars. There was a trace of melancholy in her voice.</p> 
 <p>In the private room, everyone was passed out drunk. Only Hu Xian’er’s constitution was strong enough to stay awake. If she weren’t a magical beast, she would be no different from Lin Li and the girls at the moment.</p> 
 <p>“Liquor from the Snow Kingdom is very strong. The alcohol hits slowly but very intensely when it does. The Snow Kingdom is a great place, I will take you there when we have the opportunity.” Bai Xiaofei smiled as he gazed at Hu Xian’er. “It’s been hard on you.”</p> 
 <p>After chatting with the Savage Class, Bai Xiaofei was caught up with what he had missed in the past six months and how difficult it had been for Hu Xian’er.</p> 
 <p>To put it bluntly, without her, Starnet would never have been able to recover to this state.</p> 
 <p>“It’s what I should do. Don’t forget that I’m also a member of Starnet.” Hu Xian’er did not accept his apology.</p> 
 <p>“Leave it to me now, you can have a rest.” Bai Xiaofei felt ashamed.</p> 
 <p>This time, Hu Xian’er did not refuse and assented softly. After all, she could be strong, but could not remain in such a state all the time. It was too tiring.</p> 
 <p>“What about the matter with the three of them? You should have met their father.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had been away for too long and Hu Xian’er knew that something had definitely happened. No matter how fun the Snow Kingdom was, it could not compare with Starnet where there was a group of people that Bai Xiaofei cared most about.</p> 
 <p>“Yeah.” His reply was short, the helplessness in his tone was keenly noticed by Hu Xian’er.</p> 
 <p>“It didn’t go well?” She frowned.</p> 
 <p>“It was not bad, but I don’t have the capital to convince him yet, and I don’t have much time left.” Bai Xiaofei smiled wryly.</p> 
 <p>He didn’t say it directly, but it was enough for Hu Xian’er.</p> 
 <p>“I believe you can do it. If there is anything I can do for you, just ask. I believe that at that time, I will be stronger than what I am now,” said Hu Xian’er with a captivating smile, devoid of any negative feelings.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei felt warmth washing through his heart. With a woman like her by his side, what else would he need?</p> 
 <p>“I believe it. How is the Infinite Mountain Range recently? Have you found your clansmen?” Bai Xiaofei asked with a smile.</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er sighed.</p> 
 <p>“Kuang Ta and our enemies have been very quiet, but my people are still nowhere to be seen. They have been scattered for too long, and the Fox clan’s territory has been constantly decreasing. It’s likely that they have left the Infinite Mountains,” with a hint of loss in her voice, Hu Xian’er looked dejected.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, they will be fine,” Bai Xiaofei comforted as his heart ached to see her like that. Then, he suddenly remembered the woman who had appeared in the sea of his consciousness. “I met a very special woman. She seemed to be from the Fox clan, and she had nine tails.”</p> 
 <p>“Nine… nine tails?!” a shocked Hu Xian’er exclaimed in disbelief. In her impression, she was already a special case to have three foxtails. From what she had learned, there had not been a nine-tailed fox in the history of the Fox clan.</p> 
 <p>“Mhm, I can’t be mistaken, she is very strong. It seems that even the Legend Rank is not worth a mention to her. She gave me the feeling that she’s stronger than the principal!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei did not exaggerate. Just the thought of the woman’s power made him shudder. Compared to such an existence, he was too minuscule. The incident in the Holy Snow Mountain gave him a clear idea of his own shortcomings.</p> 
 <p>“Did she tell you anything?” Hu Xian’er gulped and asked in expectation. She hadn’t gotten any news of the Fox clan for too long. Never did she expect that the first one she got would be so scary.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t quite understand what she meant, but it felt like it was a turning point for your clan. I don’t know why I felt that way.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei looked a little confused. At his answer, Hu Xian’er was lost in contemplation. When she had first spotted Bai Xiaofei upon his return, she had felt a strange familiarity from him. She thought it was just her imagination due to being separated for so long, but now it seemed that it was not so simple!</p> 
 <p>“I hope so. We don’t know what she meant anyway, but I always feel that you will find my people before me.” In the end, Hu Xian’er smiled as she had found hope again.</p> 
 <p>“You have to give me a thorough introduction to them then. After all, they are your family. It’d be embarrassing if I don’t know how to address them at our first meeting,” Bai Xiaofei said half-jokingly.</p> 
 <p>“As if you can tell them apart if I tell you. In your eyes, magical beasts of the same race should all look similar.” Hu Xian’er laughed and rolled her eyes.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was dumbstruck. <em>That’s actually right!</em></p> 
 <p>For humans in general, magical beasts could only be distinguished by the differences in appearance. If the size and color were similar, there were really few people capable of telling them apart.</p> 
 <p>“Ahh… Then I can only leave it to luck.” Bai Xiaofei faked a sigh to provoke her.</p> 
 <p>She gave him another eye-roll before changing the topic. “It’ll be a long time until our affairs can be settled. For now, you’d better have a good understanding of the current Starnet. After all, hearing from us can’t beat having a look for yourself.”</p> 
 <p>“Indeed, I did find Starnet kind of unfamiliar!” Bai Xiaofei’s lips curled as a hint of expectation flashed in his eyes.</p> 
 <p><em>What has Starnet become, I wonder…</em></p>
