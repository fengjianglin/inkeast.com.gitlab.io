 <p><span style>“Looks like Senior has really given it much thought!” Bai Xiaofei suddenly started roaring with laughter without the slightest sign, and then he turned around and walked back to the place he stood at earlier before turning back around to look at Tan Qiusheng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But, what if I said that isn’t the way we think? Why don’t you try now, Senior?” Bai Xiaofei’s voice suddenly turned cold while everyone behind him entered into an alert state at the same time, and they seemed as if they would charge out at Bai Xiaofei’s command.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The heart of the seniors that stood before Bai Xiaofei and the others tensed up, but they revealed a state of welcoming a battle in the next moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seniors, don’t be anxious. I’m just kidding because the effect of so many people fighting is really not good.” The icy coldness in his voice from a second ago vanished instantaneously and replacing it was a smiling face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, what exactly are your intentions!?” Finally, Tan Qiusheng lost his calm because being in confrontation with Bai Xiaofei made him feel as if he was immersed within a pot of oil at all times, and he didn’t know when Bai Xiaofei would suddenly turn up the heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, are you really stupid or are you feigning ignorance? My intentions are very obvious. You and everyone present must not step foot in the new student district from today onward!” Bai Xiaofei’s expression became serious once more as he spoke every single word forcefully, and the new students behind him started roaring at the same time under the leadership of Mo Ka.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never step foot in the new student district!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never step foot in the new student district!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll use our lives to defend our dignity!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll use our lives to defend our dignity!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Ka roared once and the new students behind him would roar along with him, and the terrifying wave of sound covered the heavens and the earth as it surged towards the seniors that stood before them. For the first time, the seniors sensed the rage that came from the new students.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tan Qiusheng, it’s time to stop. Otherwise, no good will come from it to you and the group of people behind you.” The person that spoke this time wasn’t Bai Xiaofei but Yun Jingshuang that stood in the front row.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since a long time ago, Yun Jingshuang had always disliked these people that exploited the new students, and now that he was standing on opposite sides from them today, he simply made his stand clear directly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When comparing offending a student of the same year that possessed an ordinary influence in his opinion and drawing someone with Bai Xiaofei’s potential to his side, Yun Jingshuang felt that these two things couldn’t be compared at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could a dragon be something that belonged in a pool? After he spoke once with Bai Xiaofei and saw the scene at this moment, Yun Jingshuang had already a label of extraordinariness to Bai Xiaofei in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could it be that anything good would come from us leaving right now?” Tan Qiusheng sneered as he summoned his puppet, an enormous sword that was of an extremely exaggerated make.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter which generation a puppet master was from, there were two ways to contract a puppet. The first was to ceaselessly improve upon the main puppet, using a single puppet to replace numerous, and utilizing this sort of puppet was more convenient and consumed lesser energy. But, its flaw was that once the puppet was damaged, one’s combat strength would plummet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other way was to link up with numerous puppets, and its flaws just happened to be opposite of the previous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tan Qiusheng was the formed, and this claymore in his hand converged three years of his painstaking effort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With Tan Qiusheng’s start, everyone behind him summoned their puppets at the same time. For a time, the smell of battle suffused the air….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I originally didn’t intend to fight. But, since senior insists on doing this, then I have no other choice.” Bai Xiaofei cracked his neck and snapped his finger, causing Mo Ka who stood behind him to summon the medicinal cauldron at the first possible moment before enlarging it to a terrifying degree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Lin Li flashed out to stand on the edge of the medicinal cauldron while staring down fiercely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tan Qiusheng hesitated when he saw Bai Xiaofei’s fearless appearance.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>There’s surely something within that cauldron, and it’s absolutely not something simple!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As he thought like this, Tan Qiusheng started scanning the surroundings. Originally, he was intending to put on an act and observe Bai Xiaofei’s reactions, but this reaction he saw now was obviously not something he wanted to see.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, make your move. Don’t worry, so long as I move even half a step back, then I’ll absolutely leave the academy right away!” Bai Xiaofei took a step forward as he spoke, and then he stared at Tan Qiusheng with a burning gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stinking kid! Don’t think that I don’t dare!” Tan Qiusheng roared and assumed the posture of wanting to raise his sword, and then a violet glow suffused the hands of Hu Xian’er who stood at the side of the chair while she narrowed her eyes and stared at Tan Qiusheng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So long as Tan Qiusheng dared to make a move, then she would absolutely charge over at the first possible moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only she could hit Bai Xiaofei!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if Bai Xiaofei were to be killed, his head belonged to her, Hu Xian’er!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A feeling of coldness assaulted Tan Qiusheng’s back as he instinctively looked towards Hu Xian’er, and then he gulped down a mouthful of saliva with great difficulty.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is absolutely not fake! I can sense abundant killing intent and feel deep terror from her!</span></i><i></i><i></i><i><span style>She’s capable of killing me!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Hu Xian’er was merely wearing the clothes of a new student, Tan Qiusheng still firmly believed this!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was precisely because of Hu Xian’er that Tan Qiusheng’s last trace of doubt towards Bai Xiaofei had vanished, and if they were to fight, then he really might not be able to gain an advantageous position!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t think you don’t date. But, I dare guarantee that even if you beat me down today. There’ll absolutely be a second and a third Bai Xiaofei that appears! The flames of the new student district have already been lit, and no one can extinguish them!” As he spoke, Bai Xiaofei had already moved over to stand by Tan Qiusheng’s side, and he held the claymore with a hand before slowly pulling it to his neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So, either f*ck off now or chop off my head. You choose!” The air in the surroundings froze instantly as everyone looked at Bai Xiaofei and Tan Qiusheng who were at the center with stunned expressions. At this moment, there was truly no one who could interfere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now, it’s something between you and me. What? Are you still not going to make a move?” As he asked once more, Bai Xiaofei was already able to see the cold sweat that dripped down from Tan Qiusheng’s forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Tan Qiusheng felt as if he was suffering torment, torment of the mind! For the first time, he felt the puppet in his hand was something he really didn’t want to hold, and if it was possible, he wanted to toss it away right away and not be stuck in a difficult position like he was now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t dare? Then it’s my turn.” When he saw Tan Qiusheng still keeping silent, he pulled off the claymore from his neck, and during the entire process, Tan Qiusheng didn’t resist in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next second, Bai Xiaofei slowly withdrew a dagger and placed it on Tan Qiusheng’s neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now, I’ll give you one final chance to make a choice. I’ll count to 10. Either f*ck off or die!” As he gazed at the ferocious expression in Bai Xiaofei’s eyes, Tan Qiusheng that was a few ranks higher than him in cultivation couldn’t help but start trembling. But, Bai Xiaofei had no intention to wait for him, and Bai Xiaofei started counting by himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Three….”</span><span style>“Eight….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This abnormal method of counting caused Tan Qiusheng’s eyes to instantly stare wide open, and right before the next number escaped Bai Xiaofei’s mouth, Tan Qiusheng had swiftly taken a step back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With this step, the dust had settled!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stinking kid, you’re too f*cking arrogant!!!” Right when Bai Xiaofei was about to taste the fruits of victory, an inharmonious voice sounded out, and the arrogant senior that stood behind Tan Qiusheng charged out directly while the dagger in his hand pierced towards Bai Xiaofei’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An unexpected event that caught him off guard!</span></p>
