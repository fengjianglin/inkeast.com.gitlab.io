 <p>“We each relied on our own abilities. Could it be that an Illusion Stream puppet master like me should try to forcefully pass through the entrance instead of relying on illusions?” Even though he was afraid, Bai Xiaofei didn’t have the slightest intention of admitting his mistakes.</p>
 <p>“You relied on this dog?” Qin Ling Yan’s tone carried a trace of disbelief as she lowered her head to look at Huskie who was by Bai Xiaofei’s side.</p>
 <p>According to her knowledge, there were many of the Illusion Stream that could transform themselves, yet she really hadn’t heard of any who could really turn false into genuine and openly deceive a group of people.</p>
 <p>Especially since Bai Xiaofei had deceived Bai Ye, a fellow that possessed a formidable strength and chased after her on a daily basis.</p>
 <p>This time, before Bai Xiaofei could reply, Huskie who’d been doubted barked twice with displeasure.</p>
 <p>“Huskie isn’t an ordinary dog, and you’ll understand in the future.” Bai Xiaofei smiled as he kept her guessing.</p>
 <p>“But, Senior Sister, shouldn’t you fulfill your promise now?” Whether he died or not wasn’t important because filling his stomach was of utmost importance.</p>
 <p>“I heard you invited Bai Ye as well? Did you obtain my permission?” Qin Lingyan’s expression became more and more unsightly because every single thing Bai Xiaofei had done could be said to have touched her bottom line.</p>
 <p>“Why should I obtain your permission when inviting others? You just have to pay for my food. Senior Bai Ye can take of himself.” Bai Xiaofei revealed an expression that seemed as if what he said was a matter of course before glaring back at Qin Lingyan.</p>
 <p>“I understand now. Senior Sister, you intend to shamelessly go back on your word, right? Actually, you don’t have to do this. Tell me directly if you don’t want to treat me to a meal….”</p>
 <p>“Bull…. You’re speaking nonsense!” Bai Xiaofei had only just finished speaking halfway when Qin Lingyan who couldn’t hear any more of it interrupted him directly. <i>Mmm, she even swallowed half a word….</i></p>
 <p>“When have I, Qin Lingyan, gone back on my word? It’s only a meal, I’m only afraid the academy will blame me when you die from being too full!” Qin Lingyan turned around and left as she spoke.</p>
 <p>“Hey…. Senior Sister Lingyan, where are you going!?” Bai Xiaofei feigned ignorance and asked with a voice that was loud to the point it seemed he was afraid others wouldn’t be able to hear it.</p>
 <p>“Cut the crap! Just follow me!” Qin Lingyan turned back to roll her eyes at Bai Xiaofei before continuing to walk forward by herself, and from the beginning until the end, she controlled her speed to maintain a certain distance between her and Bai Xiaofei as if she was deeply afraid others would misunderstand.</p>
 <p>But, it played exactly like she feared. All along the way, Bai Xiaofei shouted Qin Lingyan left and right, and he cried out her name to the point that all the students of passed by ceaselessly turned to look at the two of them.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qin Lingyan’s intestines could be said to have gone green with regret. She originally thought it was only a joke, and at most, she would really just treat Bai Xiaofei to a meal. But, now it would seem like she’d thought about all this too simply.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei wasn’t the type of person that passed by someone that he could rely on yet didn’t cling on to their leg!</p>
 <p>So, no matter if Qin Lingyan was willing or not, Bai Xiaofei would be one of the topics of conversation when she was discussed for a period of time in the future.</p>
 <p>“Brother Bai!!!” Right when Qin Lingyan and Bai Xiaofei were about to enter the area where the canteens resided, Bai Ye’s voice sounded out from afar, and he’d already flashed over like a wisp of smoke before Bai Xiaofei could reply.</p>
 <p>“Brother Bai, I’m not late, right?!” Even though he was speaking to Bai Xiaofei, yet Bai Ye’s eyes had secretly glanced at Qin Lingyan while excitement was already written all over his face.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. I would wait for you even if you were late. New students have to respect seniors, right?” Bai Xiaofei raised his brows and gave Bai Ye a gaze that said ‘you understand’.</p>
 <p>“What’re you saying? That sort of abnormal rule is only used on those rookies. You aren’t the same. You’re a friend of me, Bai Ye. Just say my name if anyone bullies you, I’ll protect you in here from now on!” Bai Ye’s voice was extremely loud, and to a certain extent, he was utterly not saying these words to Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>But, Bai Xiaofei didn’t care about all this, and he instantly agreed right after.</p>
 <p>“Since Senior has spoken like this, then I won’t take you to be an outsider. If there really is a day that you don’t care about me, then I’ll start complaining everywhere.” As soon as he finished speaking, Bai Ye carried a trace of an astounded expression as he turned around and looked at Bai Xiaofei, and then a trace of regret appeared in the bottom of his heart.</p>
 <p><i>Idiot! Why show off and act beyond my means! What if this kid really causes trouble….</i></p>
 <p>“Let’s go, Senior, it’s time to eat. You can leave right now if you don’t want to eat.” Bai ye was hesitating when Bai Xiaofei directly dropped a bomb, causing him to grit his teeth before following up in the end.</p>
 <p>“Speak, where do you want to eat!?” Qin Lingyan’s cold voice was filled with a threatening tone that displayed the intent of killing him if he didn’t hurry up.</p>
 <p>But, Bai Xiaofei seemed as if he hadn’t heard it, and his eyes carefully searched through all the restaurants in the area one by one.</p>
 <p>“That one!”</p>
 <p>As he looked at the restaurant Bai Xiaofei pointed at, the heart of Bai Ye who followed by Bai Xiaofei’s side went cold.</p>
 <p>The 100 Flavor House, the most expensive restaurant in the academy. This could be discerned from the terrifying amount of space it occupied and the gorgeous fixtures, and Bai Xiaofei had probably taken a fancy to this as well….</p>
 <p>“Let’s go, it’s only a single meal!” Qin Lingyan gritted her teeth as she glared fiercely at Bai Xiaofei, and then she walked into the 100 Flavor House first.</p>
 <p>Even though it was a restaurant, the prices of the 100 Flavor House was displayed right there, so it wasn’t very crowded here. Normally, besides some large scale gatherings, people didn’t come here just to eat an ordinary meal.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, if it was treating someone to a meal, this place was a restricted area because even if one was a noble or prince, one had to think it over properly before treating someone to a meal in the 100 Flavor House.</p>
 <p>Under the guidance of a waiter, the three people and a dog were brought into a private room. Bai Xiaofei consciously sat at the corner, whereas Bai Ye wanted to sit by Qin Lingyan’s side yet was forced to sit by Bai Xiaofei’s side by a glare from Qin Lingyan.</p>
 <p>“Senior, this won’t do.” Bai Xiaofei whispered to Bai Ye and told him of his method, whereas, it wasn’t difficult to discern from Bai Ye’s changing expression that Bai Xiaofei’s method was absolutely slightly shocking.</p>
 <p>But, Bai Ye had agreed in the end….</p>
 <p>It was a last resort!</p>
 <p>“What’re the two of you talking about? Order the food! I’m extremely busy, so you better not delay me!” Qin Lingyan already had the feeling of completely shedding all pretenses because from the moment she saw Bai Xiaofei, she had the feeling as if Bai Xiaofei had always been leading her by the nose.</p>
 <p>“Senior Sister, don’t be angry. I’ll order right away.” Bai Xiaofei took up the menu and paused abruptly.</p>
 <p>“Right, Senior Sister, my Huskie hasn’t eaten in a long time as well. You wouldn’t mind me bringing him along, right?” Bai Xiaofei asked ‘thoughtlessly’ as if he’d suddenly thought of it.</p>
 <p>“You’ve already brought a person along, so another dog makes no difference.” Qin Lingyan rolled her eyes at Bai Xiaofei once more before she turned away because just looking at Bai Xiaofei now caused her to feel uncomfortable.</p>
 <p>“Woof! Woof!” After Qin Lingyan agreed, Huskie barked twice to Bai Xiaofei, and the whining sounds he emitted seemed as if he was asking something.</p>
 <p>“It’s fine, it’s fine. You can eat freely this time because someone is treating us to the meal.”</p>
 <p>“Woof! Woof!” This time, Huskie barked to Qin Lingyan, and his bark was filled with excitement.</p>
 <p>“He said thank you.” Bai Xiaofei played the role of a translator, and what he got in return was Qin Lingyan laughing lightly and rolling her eyes at him.</p>
 <p>“I never imagined that you actually understand ‘dog language’.” Qin Lingyan especially placed emphasis on the words ‘dog language’, and she felt she’d finally made a comeback.</p>
 <p>“I’ve finished ordering!” As he grinned and passed the menu to the waiter, Bai Xiaofei suddenly looked at Bai Ye.</p>
 <p>“Senior, what happens if someone doesn’t have sufficient money to pay for the food here?”</p>
