 <p>Chapter 829: Luo Xi’s Advice!</p> 
 <p>After returning to the Demon of Illusions, Bai Xiaofei didn’t even get to warm his butt when he received Luo Xi’s summons.</p> 
 <p>However, it was not a bad thing in a sense. At least he had an excuse to cut off his ‘tail.’ After all, he could not bring them with him to see Luo Xi.</p> 
 <p>Humming along the way, Bai Xiaofei imagined countless possibilities of his ‘confrontation’ with Luo Xi. For some reason, he felt that she had ulterior motives and arrived at her office full of doubts.</p> 
 <p>As soon as he reached the door, it opened and Luo Han came out.</p> 
 <p>“Huh? Why are you here?” Luo Han was visibly delighted as expectation rose in her heart. She wanted to hear that Bai Xiaofei came for her. Although she had followed him on the trip to the Windless Zone, their relationship had not advanced as she had hoped.</p> 
 <p>“I heard you were here,” Bai Xiaofei chuckled as he said what she wanted to hear most.</p> 
 <p>However, Luo Han was not stupid. “Alright, that’s enough for nice words. Even if you knew I was with my mother, you wouldn’t come even if you wanted to find me. You think I don’t know how scared of her you are?” Rolling her eyes, Luo Han made way for Bai Xiaofei. “Go in. She seems to have a lot to say to you.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the already confused Bai Xiaofei was dumbfounded.</p> 
 <p><em>A lot to say to me?! Just what is it?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Ughh, forget it. Whatever it is, it’s definitely nothing good anyway!</em></p> 
 <p>Mustering enough courage, Bai Xiaofei raised his hand, and then… knocked on the door as softly as possible.</p> 
 <p>That’s right, it was the very definition of cowardice at play…</p> 
 <p>“Come in. Tch, all lily-livered, where is your propriety?”</p> 
 <p>Although separated by a door, Bai Xiaofei could sense Luo Xi’s contemptuous eyes. If it were someone else, he would definitely teach them a lesson. But Luo Xi? Forget it…</p> 
 <p>“Aunt Luo, you are incorrect. I’m not lily-livered, I’m just pondering a good opening for our conversation.” Bai Xiaofei immediately donned a smile as he entered the office. After all, it was hard for people to be harsh toward a smiling face. He had to make sure that he at least would not get beaten!</p> 
 <p>“Sit down, I’m afraid you won’t be able to stand in a while.” Ignoring Bai Xiaofei’s flattery in disguise, Luo Xi said something that piqued his curiosity.</p> 
 <p><em>Why? What can scare me?</em></p> 
 <p>“Aunt Luo, you called…”</p> 
 <p>“Save your probing. Since I specifically asked you to come over, I will naturally tell you everything,” Luo Xi cut Bai Xiaofei off with unprecedented seriousness laced with a hint of sorrow. “You still have not decided where to go after graduation, have you?”</p> 
 <p>In the face of her first question, Bai Xiaofei hesitated a little before nodding. He really had not figured this out yet.</p> 
 <p>“I knew this was the case. Do you have any plans for your future? Don’t tell me that you are going to roam the world. You should already be aware, as far as everything you have done during your student years is concerned, you are no longer allowed to be an ordinary person. Many people are definitely seeking you at tomorrow’s graduation ceremony,” Luo Xi said.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei sighed. Indeed, he had no plans to roam the world, but he did not want to work for anyone either. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have created the Illusion Demon Merchant Group.</p> 
 <p>Thinking for a moment, he suddenly recalled a matter. “Actually, I had a goal, but I have strayed from it a little in the past few years. Since I don’t know what to do now, I plan to pursue it. I think I will make some good progress with my current strength and connections.”</p> 
 <p>This was something that he had forgotten during the past four busy years – Investigating the death of his father…</p> 
 <p>“You finally remembered. I thought you weren’t going to touch it anymore.” Luo Xi was able to make a good guess despite Bai Xiaofei not saying clearly what it was as it resonated with her.</p> 
 <p>When she first learned from Bai Xiaofei that Bai Longfei was killed, she just wanted to avenge him immediately. Unfortunately, her identity and ability limited her. She could not affect something so far away…</p> 
 <p>“Aunt Luo, you mean…” Bai Xiaofei’s eyes widened as he felt like he was going to grasp the first breakthrough on the matter.</p> 
 <p>In the entire academy, no one knew more about Bai Longfei than Luo Xi. After all, this duo had a love-hate relationship and even almost became an item!</p> 
 <p>“If you are going to investigate your father’s matter, I can give you some advice,” said Luo Xi. A light flashed and a shiny token appeared in her hand.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this token, Bai Xiaofei’s eyes lit up. A Token of Heroes!</p> 
 <p>“You should have one. After all, you came out from the Gorge of Heroes,” Luo Xi said.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei took out his Token of Heroes in expectation. This was his first time truly getting to know his father’s past!</p> 
 <p>“That year, eight out of ten experts fell in that war in The Ruins. After your father came out, all thirteen Tokens of Heroes that were the keys to The Ruins had fallen into his hands. However, he distributed all of them. He sent someone to deliver this one to me along with some words.”</p> 
 <p>As Luo Xi paused, Bai Xiaofei perked up his ears.</p> 
 <p>“All thirteen tokens have been delivered to those he absolutely trusts. One day, someone will come to retrieve the tokens. That will also be the time when his debts are to be paid off.”</p> 
 <p>When Luo Xi finished, Bai Xiaofei swallowed with difficulty.</p> 
 <p><em>Talk about plotting against your own son!! Why the hell did you have to add that last part?!</em></p> 
 <p>“I think you are that person, so it is yours from now on.”</p> 
 <p>With that, Luo Xi threw the token to Bai Xiaofei. Although she looked indifferent, she felt like she had lost a piece of her heart.</p> 
 <p>All those years, she was only able to hold on thanks to this token and those words. But now, Bai Xiaofei had both…</p> 
 <p>“If you don’t know where to go, I have a suggestion.” Looking at the bewildered Bai Xiaofei, Luo Xi said with an expression of jealousy and anger, “When he left the academy, he was only a genius. However, with that woman, at that place, he paved the way to become a legend. Therefore, if you want to investigate your father’s past, that’s definitely where you should go.”</p> 
 <p>Finally, Luo Xi gritted her teeth as she uttered.</p> 
 <p>“Ethereal, Lan Qiushuang!”</p>
