 <p>Chapter 815: Changing Formation!</p> 
 <p>With the action of Mister Mirror, new sealed spaces enveloped everyone within the battlefield, but the difference was that they did not divide them into pairs, but only demarcated two scopes: One on the surface, one underground.</p> 
 <p>In other words, the underground one-on-one spaces had been dissolved!</p> 
 <p>“Dismissed so quickly? Looks like Old Fang and the others have arrived. But the caster must have taken the initiative to do so. Have they achieved their purpose?” Bai Xiaofei frowned, ambivalent about the change. He was glad that he no longer had to continue waiting in this hole, but also worried that his group might not be able to find him quick enough…</p> 
 <p>“My lord, I won’t stay longer. I believe our purposes are different,” said the loner who had been sharing the space in peace with Bai Xiaofei as it was actually a torment to have to be around someone like him. The fellow’s nerves had been extremely tense for fear that Bai Xiaofei would kill him when he did not pay attention.</p> 
 <p>So, before Bai Xiaofei could answer, the loner had disappeared from sight.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s just hope I meet one of my own first.” Looking at the pitch-black surroundings, Bai Xiaofei sighed.</p> 
 <p>Golden Feather and Huskie were instantly on alert. Bai Xiaofei’s safety was now in their hands.</p> 
 <p>“I feel a lot of fluctuations on this floor, but they are not very strong. We should be safe for the time being. However, I haven’t sensed a familiar existence,” Golden Feather gave Bai Xiaofei a piece of information that was neither overly bad nor good.</p> 
 <p>However, Huskie suddenly cried out in surprise, “It’s Big Sister’s scent!” With that, his four little legs moved.</p> 
 <p>The rest hurriedly followed. Along the way, they met many loners and people of Devil Forest, but everyone consciously stayed out of the way after seeing Bai Xiaofei. Aside from his own people, no one knew about his condition. Therefore, Bai Xiaofei was absolutely safe until he met someone who dared to fight him head-on.</p> 
 <p>Before long, Huskie arrived at the place where he had caught the scent of Hu Xian’er. Although he was not wrong, it was just one of the battlefields where she had fought in a sealed space. What remained was only the corpse of her opponent.</p> 
 <p>“Should have been someone she met in the sealed space.” Bai Xiaofei looked around before heaving a long sigh.</p> 
 <p>“Meow~” Blackie suddenly became alert, her eyes fixing on a dark corner with vigilance.</p> 
 <p>“If you don’t come out, I won’t be polite.” As their minds were linked, Bai Xiaofei immediately understood what Blackie meant. His aura instantly grew cold and there was murderous intent in his voice.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t, don’t, please don’t, my lord! I was just passing by! Passing by!!” A ball-like ‘object’ instantly rolled out of the corner.</p> 
 <p>After seeing the clear appearance of this ‘unknown object,’ Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but sigh at how miraculous Creation was.</p> 
 <p>It was a plump little guy, whose hands and feet could be hardly seen as they were hidden under loose clothes. His short neck and slightly flat head made him look infinitely close to a ball.</p> 
 <p>It was truly difficult for a human being to grow to that shape…</p> 
 <p>“Are you… that Earthwalker guy?” Staring at the ball for a moment, Bai Xiaofei gradually recalled the person’s identity.</p> 
 <p>Earthwalker, a resident loner in Windlove. He was only Grandmaster Rank, but few could match his skill in manipulating earth energy. He was one of the rare people noticed and mentioned by Tan Xin.</p> 
 <p>“Huh?! My lord, you know me? This little one is humbled!” The fear on Earthwalker’s face was immediately replaced by delight. From experience, when someone spoke to him in this manner, one thing was basically settled: They needed his help!</p> 
 <p>In other words, he was safe!</p> 
 <p>This was why Earthwalker had been living well in Windlove until now. He had always been an indispensable person.</p> 
 <p>“Seems like the rumors are right, you are a wise man. I won’t beat around the bush, I want you to do something for me. After the job is done, I guarantee it will be worth your time!” Bai Xiaofei wasted no time. After confirming the man’s identity, he immediately had a series of ideas that could get him out of his helpless situation…</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, on the ground, the fires of war had become widespread!</p> 
 <p>“Die!”</p> 
 <p>Shining brightly, Xu Chen’s Crimsonflame Sword split the assassin and their puppet in front of her in half, but before she could catch her breath, two more assassins had rushed up.</p> 
 <p>“F*ck off!!” Fang Ye, in his combat form, appeared beside Xu Chen at that critical moment. His long gun fired, and two energy bullets smashed the heads of the two assassins.</p> 
 <p>“Be careful.” Leaving this, Fang Ye rejoined the battle. Xu Chen also dragged her sword and followed suit.</p> 
 <p>“On the battlefield, this old man is invincible!” On another side, Shaman King declared as he snorted. Around him, the corpses that he temporarily resurrected crazily shredded any Shadow Death assassin that came near. The area around Shaman King had become a land of death!</p> 
 <p>Like Shaman King, Bai Xiaofei’s two other new underlings, Blood Wolf and Iron Steel, had also become human killing machines, each holding a different position.</p> 
 <p>The Windlove Army was even more deadly, looking like death reapers in their black armor as they one-sidedly slaughtered the Shadow Death assassins with their overwhelming momentum and crushing strength.</p> 
 <p>Everything went so smoothly that Fang Ye found it strange. <em>What went wrong? Why does something feel off?!</em></p> 
 <p>Fang Ye pulled away from the whole battlefield and started observing. After half a day, there was a hint of realization on his face. He finally knew what was wrong!</p> 
 <p>On the whole battlefield, it was clear that his side was completely crushing the assassins. Yet no matter how advantageous their situation was, almost no advancement in distance had been made! At this rate, they would never come into contact with Mister Mirror!</p> 
 <p>And the reason for this phenomenon was those strange Shadow Death assassins!</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye had seen Shadow Death assassins act before. Aside from dressing in the same way, the assassins present did not act like one at all. Moreover, their endless numbers were different from when he had first seen them!</p> 
 <p>“We actually fell into their trap.” With a pained smile, Fang Ye’s form slowly changed. “No matter what they have in store, as long as we destroy this place, so will it!”</p> 
 <p>Holding Into Oblivion that had resumed its original appearance, Fang Ye’s lips slightly curled up, and the Immovable Bracelet on his right wrist glowed…</p>
