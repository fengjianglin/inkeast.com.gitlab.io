 <p>Chapter 682: Portable Mobile Formation Base!</p> 
 <p>Receiving Nie Wei’s permission, Bai Xiaofei laid his hand slowly and carefully on the stone for fear of being tricked, but it seemed that he worried too much. There was nothing strange about it except that the surface was a little cold.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei took a deep breath and made a solemn face. He was about to check out something worth five million Amethyst Coins!</p> 
 <p>With his energy pouring out, bits and pieces of information flooded into his mind. Moments later, he withdrew his hand, as his eyes opened wide in eight seconds of shock.</p> 
 <p>After his dull expression regained his usual livelihood, Bai Xiaofei looked at Nie Wei with extreme seriousness.</p> 
 <p>“You sure you want to sell at this price?!” he asked in disbelief.</p> 
 <p>Nie Wei nodded.</p> 
 <p>“I know it’s worth more than that, but I urgently need money right now. If you want this stone, you’re in for a good deal.”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Nie Wei finished speaking, Bai Xiaofei had already presented an Amethyst Card to him.</p> 
 <p>“There are 5 million Amethyst Coins in it. Go ahead.”</p> 
 <p>After swiping the card and putting away the stone, Bai Xiaofei did not delay for a moment and left the trading area. He took numerous turns around the Holy Snow Mountain and changed his appearance several times before returning to the inn.</p> 
 <p>He originally had other plans to carry out but they had become insignificant. If this stone didn’t have any problems, then he had struck it big today!</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter? Look how hurried you are. Did you do something bad and are being chased again?” Leng Liushuang seemed to be wishing for Bai Xiaofei to be caught one day, mocking him every time she saw something wrong with his expression.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, Bai Xiaofei had never satisfied her little wish…</p> 
 <p>“How is that possible? That kind of thing can’t happen to me,” Bai Xiaofei retorted as he took out the stone he had just bought from Nie Wei and dropped it on the table with a smug face. “Guess how much it cost me.”</p> 
 <p>Seeing his smiling face, the triplets’ gaze on him grew strange.</p> 
 <p><em>Did the cold get to his head? Or else why would he be excited about buying a stone?</em></p> 
 <p>“Ehh… Wanna give us a hint?” Leng Liuli gently asked, afraid of saying something that would trigger Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Try a big number.” Bai Xiaofei opened his hand and the fingers on it wiggled back and forth.</p> 
 <p>“Five silver coins?” Leng Liuying was already the boldest one to offer this price. She thought that amount was already sky-high for a stone.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, you guys might never be able to guess it.” Bai Xiaofei completely lost his patience at her price. “This is a great deal. I only spent 5 million Amethyst Coins on this thing!”</p> 
 <p>The triplets nearly fainted.</p> 
 <p><em>What?! ONLY five million Amethyst Coins?! And you call that a great deal?! For a mere stone?!</em></p> 
 <p>Leng Liuying was on the verge of exploding, but just one second before she did, Bai Xiaofei grabbed her hand and pressed it on the stone.</p> 
 <p>“Try injecting your energy into it.”</p> 
 <p>Her face full of doubt, Leng Liuying slowly poured her energy into the stone, and then she froze like Bai Xiaofei had.</p> 
 <p><em>The five million Amethyst Coins was really worth it!</em></p> 
 <p>Because the stone was a complete formation base! To put it simply, as long as it received energy the formation inside would be activated.</p> 
 <p>To be capable of making a formation that could insta-launch, the person that had crafted this stone was absolutely beyond the reach of ordinary people.</p> 
 <p>Yet, this was still not the perverse part about the stone. Aside from the instant formation, it also functioned as storage for formations, a portable formation base that could store up to three formations.</p> 
 <p>However, once selected, the formations could not be changed.</p> 
 <p>At present, two of the three slots in the stone had been occupied. Bai Xiaofei hadn’t checked out their specific functions, but he already had an idea for the third slot – the Falling Flower Formation!</p> 
 <p><em>There is absolutely nothing more suitable than this!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was inexplicably thrilled at the thought alone. A Falling Flower Formation that could instantly launch would be terrifying!</p> 
 <p>However, adding the formation to this stone was not so simple, at least he wasn’t capable of it now. He could only wait until he found a professional…</p> 
 <p>In addition to its BUG-level effects, another thing that excited Bai Xiaofei was its origin. It was taken out from that cave on the Holy Snow Mountain.</p> 
 <p>This item was definitely not something that people on this continent were capable of creating. Not to mention its extraordinary functions, just the fact that it could store information for a long time and show that information to everyone who came into contact with it could already burden the majority of puppetsmiths.</p> 
 <p>Then, it was obvious where it came from.</p> 
 <p>The Ruins!</p> 
 <p>The existence of this formation base was a confirmation in disguise to everyone’s conjecture. The cave on the Holy Snow Mountain was indeed related to The Ruins, which was Bai Xiaofei’s greatest hope at present!</p> 
 <p>“How is it? I didn’t waste that money, did I?” Bai Xiaofei chuckled.</p> 
 <p>A puzzled Leng Liuli and Leng Liushuang also tried the stone and instantly agreed. Bai Xiaofei certainly did not lose out. However, this stone was of no use to him yet.</p> 
 <p>“Of the two formations in it, one is a large-size Origin Gathering Formation. I’ve seen one in the Crystal Forest. As for the other, I’ve never seen it before, but it should be a defensive one according to the patterns,” said Leng Liuli slowly.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s eyes widened.</p> 
 <p>“You understand formations?!” Bai Xiaofei’s voice was full of disbelief and his expression was like asking why he didn’t know this.</p> 
 <p>“I have always understood formations, you just never asked. I don’t have to list everything I can do out of the blue, right?” she replied.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was ashamed. He had been with them for such a long time yet didn’t even know that Leng Liuli was proficient in formations…</p> 
 <p>“Unfortunately, I don’t know how to imprint formations, or I would be able to fill the remaining slot.” Leng Liuli sighed. </p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei was not disappointed. After all, he had never expected…</p> 
 <p>“It’s okay, there will be opportunities sooner or later.” He put the stone away with a smile before getting serious again. “Well, now we need to discuss a very important issue.”</p> 
 <p>His sudden seriousness startled the three girls. They quickly focused.</p> 
 <p><em>Did he learn important intel?</em></p> 
 <p>“Ahem, well… how do we sleep tonight…?”</p>
