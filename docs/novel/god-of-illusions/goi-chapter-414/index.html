 <p>Chapter 414: Mission Failed? Stubborn Bai Xiaofei!</p> 
 <p>Nie Qing left, leaving behind nothing other than those last resolute words. For the first time, Bai Xiaofei doubted himself and his actions.</p> 
 <p><em>Am I really wrong? Am I oversimplifying everything? Or am I just a selfish person by nature?</em></p> 
 <p>The pain brought by Nie Qing’s departure gradually turned into a heart demon with the passage of time. He didn’t want to hurt anyone, but sometimes things just wouldn’t go in the direction that he wanted, and possibly even be the opposite.</p> 
 <p>Nie Qing’s exit not only left Bai Xiaofei in an uneasy state but also completely cut off his only clue. What he had deemed as very simple now became a difficult problem.</p> 
 <p>He hadn’t asked Nie Qing for the details on the Thunderstorm Bandits because he had thought they’d have a pleasant exchange soon, which would allow him to find out everything he needed. But now, this no longer seemed possible.</p> 
 <p>The unsolved mystery remained unsolvable with Bai Xiaofei unable to find an opening. Even if he did find an opening, he would still be unable to get in. At the moment, the Thunderstorm Bandits should be loathing him to the point of wanting to skin him alive.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, the people inside the Bright Road Merchant House were completely unable to sit still due to the previous night’s attack. Whether it was money or comforting words, no matter what methods Shang Youdao used, they were still dead set on leaving, and moreover demanding that he ensured their safety upon departure.</p> 
 <p>In the end, the troubled Shang Youdao resorted to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“I can’t handle this,” said Shang Youdao with despair on his face, getting to the point in one short sentence.</p> 
 <p>“What do you mean then? You want to give up on the Skypatch Pill? But do you even have anyone to take over?” With a chuckle, Bai Xiaofei cruelly pointed out a very practical problem.</p> 
 <p>Shang Youdao was now a discarded pawn, but it wasn’t time for him to be abandoned yet, so he had no choice but to continue suffering. When his value was completely drained and the Globe Merchant Group no longer needed him to shield the attention, he might be able to get away. However, the Bright Road Merchant House might not exist by that time.</p> 
 <p>“Yes. There’s nothing I can do at this point,” said Shang Youdao, who had fully accepted his reality, with bitterness. He looked like he had aged ten years in just a second.</p> 
 <p>At first, he had thought it was a great opportunity for his business, but now it looked like he had fallen into a pit trap, one that he couldn’t get out of.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll ask you again. If I give you a chance to wash your hands of this, will you be willing to hand over the Skypatch Pill?” Bai Xiaofei raised a painful question as he stared fixedly at Shang Youdao.</p> 
 <p>In the face of this, Shang Youdao, who had a resigned look just one second ago, became hesitant.</p> 
 <p>He couldn’t let go! It was a grade-nine pill, the divine Skypatch Pill!!</p> 
 <p>“Hahaha!! What a f*cking joke!! I actually wanted to help a person like you!!!” Upon Shang Youdao’s reaction, Bai Xiaofei burst out laughing. Then, the laughter turned into anger as he looked at Shang Youdao like looking at someone beyond cure.</p> 
 <p>“You can help me send those people off from my merchant group, right?” After some hesitation, Shang Youdao asked a question that made Bai Xiaofei want to kill him on the spot.</p> 
 <p>A snake who wanted to devour an elephant was exactly what Shang Youdao was. He just couldn’t stop until he killed himself from over-eating.</p> 
 <p>“Fine, I’ll help you send them away! But remember, don’t expect me and my group to deliver that Skypatch Pill for you. Neither the Thunderstorm Bandits nor the Globe Merchant House is something you can deal with. Either accept your fate or wait for some big fortune to fall from the sky,” with a cold snort, Bai Xiaofei advised out of forbearance.</p> 
 <p>Shang Youdao was stunned. “The Globe Merchant House?!” he asked with surprise and wide eyes.</p> 
 <p>“You really think you got the Skypatch Pill out of pure coincidence? This was but a scheme laid out by the Globe Merchant House. Everything you have done is under their surveillance, and your only role is to act as the holder of the bait to lure out the Thunderstorm Bandits!” Bai Xiaofei said coldly.</p> 
 <p>Shang Youdao’s face turned ashen.</p> 
 <p>“Although I don’t know why they chose your Bright Road Merchant House, I already have enough evidence to back it up. You and your business aren’t the protagonists in this incident, you’re not even a supporting role. If I hadn’t come here, you might even have died an unclear death!” After explaining, Bai Xiaofei looked fixedly at Shang Youdao. “Now, do you still think you can deliver the Skypatch Pill to Unify Business?”</p> 
 <p>Once again, Shang Youdao lapsed into silence. The difference was that there was no hesitation on his face this time, only horror.</p> 
 <p>“Xiaofei, is it convenient? Sister Lingyan wants you over,” Chu Yue’s voice rang out from outside the door before Shang Youdao could give Bai Xiaofei his answer.</p> 
 <p>“Yes.” Bai Xiaofei stood up and headed for the door. When walking by Youdao, he stopped to add, “Consider carefully. If you really care about your merchant group, let go of that persistence!”</p> 
 <p>Then, Bai Xiaofei left the room, leaving Shang Youdao in silent contemplation…</p> 
 <p>Qin Lingyan’s room was just several dozen steps away. When Bai Xiaofei arrived with Chu Yue, the other three were sitting together dejectedly.</p> 
 <p>“You should have figured out the situation. Isn’t it time you tell us?”Qin Lingyan looked seriously at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>They hadn’t once disturbed Bai Xiaofei for the past few days, but after last night’s attack, they really couldn’t sit still. If they still remained in the dark, they might just become the next Shang Youdao.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll tell you guys, just don’t be too surprised.” Taking a deep breath, Bai Xiaofei delayed a little to pique their curiosity. Everyone’s expression grew tense.</p> 
 <p>This tension gradually turned into surprise as Bai Xiaofei explained the information he had gathered. The sounds of gulping followed one after another. They really didn’t expect it to be so complicated.</p> 
 <p>“So, our mission basically… failed?” asked Bai Ye blankly. Everyone froze.</p> 
 <p>Indeed, however they looked at this, there was no hope of completing this mission, and whether they could get out safely was still a problem!</p> 
 <p>“That is no longer my concern now. I just want to find out what this whole thing is all about!” said Bai Xiaofei, his face solemn and his eyes full of determination.</p> 
 <p>He hadn’t found that mysterious person from the Globe Merchant Group yet!</p>
