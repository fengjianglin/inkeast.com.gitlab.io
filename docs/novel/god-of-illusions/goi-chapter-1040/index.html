 <p>Chapter 1040: Net!</p> 
 <p>“The garrison’s moved. They’re avoiding our sniper range. Looks like they want to surround us,” the lookout team in mid-air immediately reported the dynamics of the garrison to Fang Ye.</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye sneered. “Fifth Team, prepare to blow up the wall. The rest will move to below Seventh and build a defensive circle,” he commanded.</p> 
 <p>The Illusion Sword members immediately moved to their appointed positions. Watching as the garrison approached, the captain of the Fifth Team flashed them a smile, showing two rows of white teeth.</p> 
 <p>“Eat my sh*t!” He laughed.</p> 
 <p>The next second, the thick wall was blown into rubble in successive explosions, blocking the way of the garrison who approached from outside the city.</p> 
 <p>The Fifth Team had no intention to prolong the fight and ran straight into the defense circle created by the Seventh Team. Meanwhile, the members on the high ground had started to fire at the garrison!</p> 
 <p>Illusion Sword was never great at short-range and medium-range combat. Unless necessary, constant long-range attacks were always their best tactic!</p> 
 <p>“Someone’s approaching!”</p> 
 <p>As the garrison struggled to dodge attacks and advance, an armed force rushed into the battlefield. Unlike the garrison, they maintained a distance between each other, and their bright-golden armor also indicated how special their identity was.</p> 
 <p>“The Nine Dragons Army of Nine Dragons City excels at melee and mid-range fights. Their target is probably you, so be ready to land.” Fang Ye had done his homework during the past few hours besides watching the screens with Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>After the Seventh Team landed, the Illusion Sword members began to move again. Without hesitation, they abandoned their newly occupied position and ran into the nearby buildings as Fang Ye instructed. It didn’t even take a minute for the 6000 elites to vanish.</p> 
 <p>The only one remaining on the field was Fang Ye.</p> 
 <p>“I’m sorry to disappoint you, but we’re not good at head-on confrontations. However, if you take one step further, I can’t guarantee that you will be able to live.” Fang Ye’s voice echoed in the main street as he looked at the approaching Nine Dragons Army.</p> 
 <p>The disappearance of the Illusion Sword members made the leader of the Nine Dragons Army panic. With the intention to probe, he shouted, “Who are you? Why are you causing a disturbance here?! Don’t you know about the current situation of Cloudveil?!”</p> 
 <p>“It’s none of your business who we are, and we are here exactly because we know what has happened in Cloudveil.” Fang Ye laughed sleazily.</p> 
 <p>At his reply, the Nine Dragons leader’s expression became ugly. “You’re seeking death!”</p> 
 <p>That was his signal. A row of Nine Dragons soldiers stepped forth and golden spears appeared in their hands. Just like Illusion Sword’s equipment, these spears were also custom-made.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately for the Nine Dragons Army, however, their city lord was not as generous as Fang Ye!</p> 
 <p>Without even the opportunity to muster any energy, a round of gunfire came at the front row of the Nine Dragon soldiers from all directions, each soldier welcoming at least four or five energy bullets. Despite their decent defense, death could not be avoided.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, the leader of the Nine Dragons Army froze in shock. He had planned to expose the hidden Illusion Sword players by threatening Fang Ye, but now, how was he supposed to do that when the bullets came from all directions?</p> 
 <p><em>Did they… scatter completely?!</em></p> 
 <p>At this thought, the Nine Dragons leader broke into a cold sweat.</p> 
 <p>“Congratulations, you got it right. My people have spread to every corner of Nine Dragons City, and they are very good at hiding. I hope you enjoy this little hide-and-seek game!” Fang Ye laughed merrily and walked towards an alley. Every step he took seemed to trample on the ego of the Nine Dragons Army.</p> 
 <p>“Kill him!!” roared the Nine Dragons leader, who had completely lost his composure.</p> 
 <p>A group of soldiers rushed toward Fang Ye. However, they only made 20 meters when a golden light rose at their feet, and a terrifying explosion turned them into ashes!</p> 
 <p>Setting traps was also one of their required courses…</p> 
 <p>Thanks to Fang Ye’s stalling, Illusion Sword had completely spread out into Nine Dragons City. It was destined to be a protracted war, which was their favorite.</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>“It seems that our Nine Dragons City is being looked down upon!”</p> 
 <p>The city lord of Nine Dragons naturally couldn’t let six thousand enemies lurk in his city. Sitting straight in his lord seat, he gnashed his teeth in anger.</p> 
 <p>“Form up teams of twenty, the garrison soldiers are to be led by the Nine Dragons Army. Keep a close distance between each team so as to ensure they can quickly aid each other when needed. Search the whole city, kill every single one you find on the spot!” Despite his anger, the city lord maintained a clear mind. His arrangement was fast, precise, and ruthless.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, he could never imagine that his opponent had such a perverse puppet as the Concentric Knot that let them communicate and teleport freely!</p> 
 <p>With the development of the carpet search, the sounds of gunfire echoed one after another, each with the death of someone. However, every time the soldiers of Nine Dragons City arrived at the source of a gunshot, they only found the owner of that building who had been knocked unconscious.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the shooter had already teleported to another teammate.</p> 
 <p>This was what Fang Ye meant by ‘spread out.’ The Illusion Sword elites were like six thousand connected nodes that covered the entire Nine Dragons City. As soon as one person moves, the surrounding ones would go quiet to serve as a safe transfer point. Then, the first person would find a new place in the surroundings to set up a new node. Under this repetition, Illusion Sword was able to hunt the prey in their net safely and efficiently!</p> 
 <p>And this was the real use of the seemingly weakest puppets of Illusion Sword – making them invincible in urban warfare!</p>
