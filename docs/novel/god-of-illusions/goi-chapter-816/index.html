 <p>Chapter 816: Death!</p> 
 <p>“Stop him!!”</p> 
 <p>Mister Mirror, who was observing the battlefield, naturally noticed Fang Ye’s actions, as the terrifying fluctuation gathered at the muzzle of Into Oblivion was hard to ignore. The energy accumulated made even Mister Mirror feel threatened!</p> 
 <p>Upon Mister Mirror’s command, all the members of Shadow Death flocked towards Fang Ye, but the latter showed no intention to run at all.</p> 
 <p>Because he was not alone!</p> 
 <p>“Anyone who approaches, dies!”</p> 
 <p>Like a meteor, Lin Li in her Divine Phoenix Feather Dress shot down from the sky. The elemental billows from her landing sent the approaching assassins flying.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, the rest of the Savage Class gathered around Fang Ye, obviously planning to defend him to the end. Although they had no idea what he was doing, they believed that he had found a way to break this deadlock!</p> 
 <p>“Break!!!”</p> 
 <p>The accumulation was completed without any interruptions. As the muzzle of Into Oblivion flashed a gloomy glint, a black ball the size of an egg appeared instantly where Fang Ye was aiming. No ballistics, no impressive bombardment, the appearance of the attack seemed to have nothing to do with the energy accumulation at all, but what happened next had everyone frozen in place.</p> 
 <p>The black ball turned into a circle of rapidly spreading ripples. Everything that touched them, dead or alive, was dissipated in an instant, leaving not even a speck of dust!</p> 
 <p>Until the ripples touched an invisible wall. The two energies collided, and the sound of cracking echoed, along which cracks appeared in the air. At the same time, Mister Mirror’s expression grew ugly.</p> 
 <p>It did not take long for the invisible wall to be completely untenable and break into crystal-clear energy together with the ripples. The Shadow Death members running around the battlefield also dissipated, and the real scene inside the formation officially greeted everyone.</p> 
 <p>“The miracle generation of Starnet, huh? No wonder. Someone aside from that Bai guy can actually see through my mirror space,” commented Mister Mirror calmly. Standing around him were the original one hundred Shadow Death assassins.</p> 
 <p>“I’m flattered, but the real battle has only begun, hasn’t it?” Fang Ye smiled.</p> 
 <p>Everyone became serious. From the aura of the assassins around Mister Mirror, they were obviously not like the cannon fodder just now. As Fang Ye said, now was the real battle!</p> 
 <p>“Since you lot are bent on dying, I have no choice.” Mister Mirror waved his hand. The assassins around him all rushed out together. Upon approaching the Savage Class members, they suddenly vanished!</p> 
 <p>“Right, this is the Shadow Death I’m familiar with!” Fang Ye sneered. Into Oblivion switched to another form almost instantaneously while he activated Spiritual Attachment, the ability that came from his newly acquired special physique of the same name. Everything within a radius of thirty meters came alive!</p> 
 <p>“Die!” Taking one step forward so fast that his body flickered, Fang Ye shot seemingly empty air. A stealthed assassin did not even know what had just happened up to the moment he was blown backward.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, the rest also clashed with the assassins. However, few were as relaxed as Fang Ye. Starting from the Windlove Army, casualties began to appear…</p> 
 <p>“Leave that one to me!” Without any delay, Lin Li charged towards Mister Mirror. One Shadow Death assassin after another rushed to stop her, but none could enter within a five-meter radius around her.</p> 
 <p>Ever since Bai Xiaofei’s departure to find Cang Lan and Hu Xian’er consequently came into everyone’s sight, Lin Li’s character destined her to become a transparent person. However, during that period of transparency, she had been devoted to cultivation more intensely than ever, and in exchange, her power had soared to a terrifying level. Under three-aperture Exquisite Rank, no one could take away her control over elements!</p> 
 <p>“I’m being underestimated, huh?” Watching as Lin Li rapidly approached, Mister Mirror gnashed his teeth. He waved his right hand and a translucent whip appeared.</p> 
 <p>“Seal!” With a lash, whip shadows appeared and sealed off the path ahead of Lin Li.</p> 
 <p>As all elemental energy bounced off before they could near the whip, Lin Li had to stop charging forward. However, her attack did not stop. The earth energy around suddenly became active and the calm ground grew restless.</p> 
 <p>“Mirror Wall!” Scanning with his eyes wide open, Mister Mirror immediately found the source of the attack, and a smooth mirror surface generated at his feet. The earth thorn that had just drilled out from the ground was reduced back to dirt upon touching the mirror.</p> 
 <p>“You are too slow!” said Lin Li. She naturally knew that her attack could not hurt an Exquisite Rank puppet master. What she wanted was to buy time to get close. Grasping the opportunity, she appeared above Mister Mirror. “Wind! Fire! Flamestorm Dragon!”</p> 
 <p>At such a close range, Mister Mirror was engulfed by the billowing flames. Lin Li firmly believed that her attack would not be reduced back into raw elements at such a close distance.</p> 
 <p>“You are still too green!” Mister Mirror, who should have been torn up in the flame storm, suddenly appeared behind Lin Li, his whip shooting at her.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you for your compliment, but you have entered the restricted area!” Lin Li snorted as the whip stopped right before it could touch her. Being frozen with it was an appalled Mister Mirror.</p> 
 <p>“How could this be?! The Divine Phoenix Feather Dress absolutely does not have such an ability!!” After struggling only to find that it was useless, Mister Mirror’s mentality collapsed. The reason why he dared to fight Lin Li was the thought that he knew the dress puppet very well. After all, he had once fought Lin Nishang and gotten away safely.</p> 
 <p>“It does not, but it’s a different story with Thousand Star. I have not used Thousand Star, so you might have forgotten it.” Lin Li stepped in the air towards Mister Mirror while explaining in an indifferent voice, “My mother once told me that she met a tricky Exquisite Rank puppet master. His mirror ability could invalidate elemental attacks, which can be said to be the natural nemesis of the Divine Phoenix Feather Dress.”</p> 
 <p>Lin Li gently waved her hand. A part of Thousand Star transformed into a thread that roped around the terrified Mister Mirror’s neck.</p> 
 <p>“I did not expect to come across you here, and I did not expect that after so many years, you haven’t made any progress at all, still a four-aperture Exquisite Rank.” Slowly turning around, Lin Li smiled. “You block the way of someone you should not block, so I can only send you away. I shall help him clear all obstacles!”</p> 
 <p>A thin cut appeared on Mister Mirror’s neck. At the same time, the thread squeezed, and the man burst into a mass of blood fog!</p> 
 <p>Mister Mirror, dead!</p>
