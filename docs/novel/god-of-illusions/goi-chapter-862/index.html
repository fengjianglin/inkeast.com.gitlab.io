 <p>Chapter 862: What Can You Do?</p> 
 <p>“Are you two just going to follow me like this?” After lunch, Bai Xiaofei looked awkwardly at Bai Xing and Bai Yue.</p> 
 <p>“It depends entirely on you, Mister Bai. As long as you want, we can accompany you everywhere in the imperial city area,” replied Bai Xing with expectant eyes.</p> 
 <p>Next to her, Bai Yue was the same as she added, “Besides, the two of us haven’t gone out in a long time…”</p> 
 <p>Her tone was so full of yearning that Bai Xiaofei’s heart went soft. “I happen to be alone, so you two can come with me.” His mouth slipped on the spur of the moment. As soon as he finished saying this, he just wanted to slap himself.</p> 
 <p><em>What if Tan Xin comes back?! I’d be dead and still won’t be able to clear this misunderstanding!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Yay! Thank you, Mister Bai!” Bai Xing nearly jumped in excitement</p> 
 <p>Then, before Bai Xiaofei could understand what was going on, Bai Xing had grabbed… Huskie!</p> 
 <p>“Little guy, you can’t run now, I have long wanted to hold you!”</p> 
 <p>“Why don’t you follow me, kitty?” said Bai Yue who had gotten her hands on Blackie.</p> 
 <p>Blackie resisted, but as Bai Yue’s hands glowed with soft light, the cat quieted down and lay obediently in her arms.</p> 
 <p><em>A graduate from the Light of Protection…</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei instantly recognized Bai Yue’s ability. Then, he realized that he was the only one left alone.</p> 
 <p><em>What a delight!!!</em></p> 
 <p>After they left the room, Bai Xing asked as she stroked Huskie, “Where do you want to go, Mister Bai?”</p> 
 <p>“How about the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain? I’m quite curious about it, and maybe I’ll be able to meet an old classmate of mine there.” Bai Xiaofei once again remembered Shi Kui. Yesterday, he only walked around the city, while the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain was outside the city.</p> 
 <p>“Mhm, it’s within the allowed scope of our activities. However, if we go there, we may not be able to return by today. Do you want to leave a message for Mister Yun? He said before that he would come to see you when he had time.”</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t think of this. But a busy man like him probably won’t be free to visit me for a while. I’ll just leave a short message.”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Bai Xiaofei finished saying this, Bai Yue took out a pen and a piece of paper.</p> 
 <p>Impeccable service attitude the Moon Beck Pavilion had…</p> 
 <p>“I’ve already said, it’s either Bai Xing or Bai Yue today. I won’t accept anyone else!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei just put down the pen and paper when a slightly familiar voice rang out.</p> 
 <p>During his stay in the pavilion so far, this was the first time Bai Xiaofei heard someone dare to speak in a loud voice here. However, from Bai Xing’s reaction, this was still within the allowable extent.</p> 
 <p>“Mister Hai, please calm down. Both Bai Xing and Bai Yue are accompanying another VIP and therefore cannot leave. Why don’t I arrange a performance from our other sisters for you?” a gentle voice soothed. Although the person was comforting Mister Hai, her voice was not servile at all.</p> 
 <p>“I remember that your place allows the guests to compete for the attendants. Take me to that so-called VIP. I want to see who’ll dare to compete with me, Hai Jun!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, both Bai Xing and Bai Yue looked troubled. Although the Moon Beck Pavilion was a place famous for its elegance, there were still elegant rogues, and Hai Jun was a typical example.</p> 
 <p>However, despite his bad temper, Hai Jun had never done anything out of line. Perhaps, he also knew that he could not offend the backer of this place.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go, let us meet this Mister Hai.” Bai Xiaofei smiled as he heard the familiar name.</p> 
 <p>“Mister Bai, forget it. It will be okay as long as we leave before he finds us. It is very troublesome to offend people from the four great clans,” said Bai Xing anxiously.</p> 
 <p>Bai Yue didn’t speak, but her expression said she agreed with Bai Xing.</p> 
 <p>“I’m afraid you’ve forgotten who I am. When have I, Bai Xiaofei, ever been afraid of trouble?”</p> 
 <p>With that said, Bai Xiaofei strode out. Before long, the aggressive Hai Jun met with a smiling Bai Xiaofei, behind whom Bai Xing and Bai Yue were ready to take the heat for him.</p> 
 <p>However, the dead silence that ensued caught the two girls off guard.</p> 
 <p>Until Bai Xiaofei opened his mouth. “Oh hey, it’s been a while. Looks like your family has great medicine, huh? Such a heavy injury healed after just a night of sleep! And you even dare to make a fuss in the Moon Beck Pavilion, and moreover, want to compete for my attendants! Does your medicine have a side effect of stimulating your guts?”</p> 
 <p>A barrage of mockery flew at Hai Jun. Everyone present was horrified, while Hai Jun looked like he was trying hard to endure.</p> 
 <p>“Bai Xiaofei!!” Hai Jun gritted his teeth and his body trembled.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t get so emotional. Quarreling here may not be a problem, but if you really start a fight, I’m afraid that even your old man won’t be able to protect you. Who knows, maybe he will even put righteousness above family!” Bai Xiaofei commented with pity, as if he could already picture the situation of Hai Jun being sacrificed for righteousness.</p> 
 <p>“You will regret it! Even a powerful dragon cannot repress a local snake, and this lord is not just as simple as a local snake!!” Hai Jun threatened with a glare.</p> 
 <p>“Never heard of such a thing, but I’ve heard about pulling out trouble from its roots and I exercise that often. Whether you are a local snake or more than that, I’m not interested in figuring that out. However, if you really irritate me thoroughly, I will let you know that I, Bai Xiaofei, never make jokes!” Bai Xiaofei’s voice grew icy at the last sentence.</p> 
 <p>Hai Jun immediately froze in place, unable to say anything.</p> 
 <p>“Oh, by the way, I just heard you say you want to compete for Bai Xing and Bai Yue? How are you going to do that? I have no experience, but no matter how you’d like it, I will play along.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei yawned, the ease on his face in sharp contrast with Hai Jun’s twitching mouth.</p> 
 <p>“Looks like you don’t have that kind of guts. Remember to take a detour the next time you see me. If you do, you will still be the mighty Mister Hai after I’ve had enough of my stay in Ethereal. Otherwise…” Bai Xiaofei stopped with a profound smile that ran a chill down everyone’s spine.</p> 
 <p>He was really not joking!</p>
