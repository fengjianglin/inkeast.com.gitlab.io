 <p>Chapter 868: It’s All Good…</p> 
 <p>“This again. Can’t you just say it directly?!” Pinocchio grunted.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was speechless. This was definitely the worst that he had been verbally slain!</p> 
 <p>“I heard that the core of the Puppysmith Holy Mountain is a fire-attribute formation. I want to see it,” Bai Xiaofei could not be more direct this time.</p> 
 <p>Unexpectedly, Pinocchio froze.</p> 
 <p>“What the hell?!” Pinocchio’s voice pierced the sky one moment later.</p> 
 <p>The frightened Bai Xiaofei instinctively trembled. “What’s wrong? Is it not convenient to ask?” he asked tentatively and at the same time began to think about how to trick Pinocchio into agreeing.</p> 
 <p>However, the situation was not quite the same as he imagined.</p> 
 <p>“Convenience is secondary. What I want to ask is, are you tired of living?” Pinocchio looked at Bai Xiaofei like looking at an idiot.</p> 
 <p>“What… does that… mean?” Bai Xiaofei’s face was blank as he swallowed back his paragraph of reasons. The feeling of punching the air was really uncomfortable.</p> 
 <p>“The reason why you can stand here and talk to me like a normal person is because you are wearing a Fire Storing Crystal. Without it, you may already be cooked, and the temperature here is not even one-thousandth of the core. When you get there, even the best Fire Storing Crystal is useless. So tell me, aren’t you seeking death?” Pinocchio explained.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help thinking of the heatwave when he first arrived at the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain. “Aunt Gold, what he said is true, right?” he asked Golden Feather within his sea of consciousness.</p> 
 <p>Golden Feather looked nonchalant. “Don’t worry, the heat won’t get to you with me here, not to mention that you still have the Endless State. Just find a way to convince him without exposing my existence.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei immediately regained confidence.</p> 
 <p>“You don’t have to worry about this, Senior. I have a way to cope with the temperature at the core. And I promise that I will not do anything unfavorable to the formation,” he said with utmost sincerity.</p> 
 <p>Pinocchio pondered a little before opening his mouth, “You certainly don’t have the guts. If something goes wrong with the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain, the whole Ethereal Empire will go after your head, so your guarantee is bullshit anyway. What I want to know is, what do you want there? That place has nothing but heat.” He looked curiously at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“I won’t hide this from you. I have a hidden disease and an expert once told me that they could only be resolved by the baptism of the purest fire. That’s why I came here right after graduation, I can’t think of a better place than the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain.” Bai Xiaofei’s ability to lie allowed him to put together a perfect excuse without stuttering.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, you wait!” Pinocchio said as he took out a pen and paper from his storage ring and quickly wrote something. “Sign it and I’ll send you there.”</p> 
 <p>Doubtfully receiving the paper, Bai Xiaofei read it. Cold sweat trickled down his face the next second.</p> 
 <p><em>This old man… Damn you!!</em></p> 
 <p>What was written could roughly be summed up like this: Pinocchio was only responsible for sending Bai Xiaofei to the core of the formation. Whatever happened to Bai Xiaofei afterward would have nothing to do with him!</p> 
 <p>“I can’t just take your word for it. I know very well what’s going on there. You have a tight relationship with Starnet and your master is still one of the three legends. I can’t afford any responsibility.” Pinocchio just could not beat around the bush at all. In fact, interacting with him was quite comfortable after one got used to it.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei signed his name and handed the paper back to Pinocchio. “Here.” He chuckled, inwardly looking forward to it.</p> 
 <p>“Come with me.” Pinocchio walked to the forging room, where Big Cow and Small Cow were still discussing with Bai Xing and Bai Yue about the specifics for their tailor-made puppets.</p> 
 <p>Seeing Bai Xiaofei, the two sisters quickly came up to him. “Mister Bai.”</p> 
 <p>Big Cow and Small Cow instantly looked dejected.</p> 
 <p>“Just continue, we aren’t leaving so soon,” Bai Xiaofei informed them.</p> 
 <p>“Step inside,” Pinocchio pointed at a formation and commanded Bai Xiaofei with a straight face. Although his size was cute, his temperament as a divine smith was nothing short. “Remember, once this formation starts, you will be teleported right to the core of the grand formation and bear the entire temperature instantly. It’s best that you prepare yourself.”</p> 
 <p>Despite the old man’s warning, Bai Xiaofei had no intention to make any preparations because, in order to prepare, he had to release Golden Feather, who obviously did not want to expose herself to others.</p> 
 <p>“I’m ready, Senior. You can go ahead.” Bai Xiaofei’s expression was calm, but in his heart was a storm.</p> 
 <p><em>No accidents, please! I don’t want to be cooked!! Aunt Gold, whatever you said must work!!</em></p> 
 <p>Pinocchio couldn’t care less. As soon as he got the go-ahead, Bai Xiaofei vanished.</p> 
 <p>Only until this moment did Big Cow and Small Cow finally react. Both nearly dropped their jaws.</p> 
 <p>“Mas… mas…master!!! He… he… he… he…” stuttered Big Cow as he pointed to where Bai Xiaofei had just disappeared.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, he signed a guarantee. Your master will be fine even if he dies,” Pinocchio said.</p> 
 <p>Big Cow and Small Cow instantly relaxed. The latter even commented, “Is that so? Then it’s all good.”</p> 
 <p>Birds of a feather flock together indeed…</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei was panting heavily. If it wasn’t for the super high temperature of the place, he would have broken out into a cold sweat!</p> 
 <p>The moment he had appeared, terrifying heat engulfed him. His Fire Storing Crystal could not hold up for 0.000…01 seconds before it shattered. Fortunately, Golden Feather reacted quickly enough. She came out from the puppet space right away at that moment and protected him.</p> 
 <p>“Aunt Gold, what’s next?” Looking around at the materialized fire elements, Bai Xiaofei swallowed with difficulty. He still felt the fatal temperature despite the protection of Golden Feather.</p> 
 <p>“Dive.”</p>
