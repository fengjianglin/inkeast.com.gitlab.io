 <p>Chapter 790: Hu Xian’er vs Zhu Wuxin!</p> 
 <p>“Put away your puppets and I will spare you.”</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er said lightly, not taking the two Exquisite Rank puppet masters in front of her seriously at all, even though she was only peak-grade Grandmaster Rank.</p> 
 <p>“Little girl, are you joking?” Dragon King snorted and stepped forward.</p> 
 <p>The energy in Hu Xian’er’s body surged in response and her beautiful eyes glinted sharply.</p> 
 <p>“Master Dragon King, you take care of that boy, leave her to me,” Zhu Wuxin stopped Dragon King.</p> 
 <p>Dragon King frowned a little but agreed after some thought. He really needed Zhu Wuxin as an ally, otherwise, he was not confident that he would be able to win against Bai Xiaofei’s group, who seemed oddly dangerous despite being entirely Grandmaster Rank.</p> 
 <p>Seeing Dragon King still standing around, Hu Xian’er coldly added, “Not going yet? Want to see if I can kill you first before handling your friend here?” </p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Dragon King nearly could not control himself from rushing at her.</p> 
 <p>“Just leave it to me,” Zhu Wuxin intervened.</p> 
 <p>Dragon King gritted his teeth with anger. Leaving a snort, he wisely left the temporary base.</p> 
 <p>“And I was still thinking who had such big guts to cause a scene around a place like Windlove. Now that I see you, I finally know.” Zhu Wuxin wore a calm smile as if everything was under his control. “The number one of the Blossom Ranking, rumored to be the strongest student in Starnet, a puppet master who specializes in speed and has a pair of hands that can catch any attack. But unfortunately, you met me.”</p> 
 <p>During his speech, Zhu Wuxin’s puppets appeared around him.</p> 
 <p>“The guy over on that side should be Bai Xiaofei, isn’t he? A piece of trash that doesn’t even dare to use his real face. If this is near Starnet, I might have some scruples about that Thunder Emperor guy, but here in Windlove, your only result is…”</p> 
 <p>“You talk too much nonsense, but, you’ve succeeded in angering me,” Hu Xian’er interrupted. Her aura, which Zhu Wuxin thought to have reached its limit, began to climb again. She added, “ And you picked the wrong person to talk trash about!”</p> 
 <p>As Hu Xian’er abruptly made her move, everything around her seemed to slow to a stop.</p> 
 <p>Permanence!</p> 
 <p>Appearing right before Zhu Wuxin’s face in a blink of an eye, her right hand clawed at his neck. There was no doubt that if this attack hit, he would die for sure!</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er thought that he had something prepared, but to her surprise, she caught his neck! Without any hesitation, she tightened her grip. However, a golden light suddenly lit up and bounced her away from him, and at the same time nullified Permanence.</p> 
 <p>As the time flow returned to normal, Zhu Wuxin’s forehead shed a drop of cold sweat.</p> 
 <p>“Time ability?!” he exclaimed in disbelief and horror. “No wonder they say your speed is too fast to react to. It’s not about speed at all!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing Zhu Wuxin’s conclusion, Hu Xian’er remained expressionless.</p> 
 <p>“Trigger-type invincibility skill, this kind of puppet should not be able to activate again without a cooldown. So, how will you defend yourself next?” she commented indifferently, the energy in her body surging once again.</p> 
 <p>“You’re welcome to try me!” Zhu Wuxin retorted. One of his eyes suddenly lit up with a golden light.</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er suddenly felt a cold sensation on her forehead, and her surging energy instantly calmed down.</p> 
 <p>The next second, Zhu Wuxin’s entire body glowed gold and an illusion merged into his body. Then, he raised his right hand and a puppet behind him lit up.</p> 
 <p>“Hell Cage!”</p> 
 <p>Upon his call, pitch-black, evil-looking hands stretched out from the ground. Hu Xian’er, who had just barely regained her senses, fell into another trance. Right at that moment, Zhu Wuxin leaped at her. “Go to hell!”</p> 
 <p>“Combination skill – Black Hole!” Just as Zhu Wuxin’s hand landed on Hu Xian’er’s forehead, a powerful force fixed Zhu Wuxin in mid-air. It was Ming One and Ming Two not far away having just thrown out their shield.</p> 
 <p>During the last few years, the two brothers had reached a level that they had never dared to dream of. Being able to restrain an Exquisite Rank puppet master was definitely a feat out of the majority’s reach.</p> 
 <p>“Seeking death!!” Zhu Wuxin roared.</p> 
 <p>The black hole did not last very long. However, by the time Zhu Wuxin was free, the brothers’ combined shield puppet already stood in front of Hu Xian’er, firmly protecting her.</p> 
 <p>Missing the perfect opportunity to attack, the frustrated Zhu Wuxin changed directions and went straight for Ming One and Ming Two, who made the perfect target as Defense Stream puppet masters without their shield puppet!</p> 
 <p>However, Ming One and Ming Two had teammates.</p> 
 <p>“Iceberg!” At that critical moment, the water elements in the air condensed and formed a tall ice block in Zhu Wuxin’s path.</p> 
 <p>Chen Hui arrived just in time to save the Ming brothers, but only this one time. They were still weak in front of an Exquisite Rank puppet master. However, to be able to defend against the captain of the Devil Forest Mercenary Group, they could be proud of themselves.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll kill you all!!!” Zhu Wuxin gnashed his teeth. In extreme anger, his energy exploded and sent Ming One, Ming Two, and Chen Hui flying. All the bamboo around shot over, wanting to skewer the three.</p> 
 <p>However, Zhu Wuxin forgot his real opponent.</p> 
 <p>A figure shuttled among the trees and broke them into pieces. During the process, Hu Xian’er also caught her three flying teammates.</p> 
 <p>“You seem to have your opponent wrong.”</p> 
 <p>Moving her wrist to regain some flexibility, Hu Xian’er gazed at Zhu Wuxin. Feeling his terrifying aura, she grew a little excited. She could finally get serious for once!</p> 
 <p>“So what if you’ve woken up? Even if you can control time, your attacks are still physical, and physical attacks are completely meaningless to me, but can you avoid my attacks?!” Zhu Wuxin seemed to have lost a little of his sanity.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Hu Xian’er’s only reaction was disdain.</p> 
 <p>“Firstly, I can evade your attack just fine. Even without Permanence, you are still too slow for me.” Hu Xian’er raised her right hand, and the surrounding temperature began to rise rapidly. “Secondly, who told you that I can only use physical attacks?”</p> 
 <p>A fiery blaze shot to the sky and burned all the bamboo around to ashes.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, the Ming brothers and Chen Hui started to run. Hu Xian’er, once she started using fire, would become a completely different person! Moreover, the new Hu Xian’er did not distinguish between friends and foe!</p> 
 <p>In recent years, besides ‘Big Sister’, Hu Xian’er had gained another nickname –Destructive Fire Fox!</p>
