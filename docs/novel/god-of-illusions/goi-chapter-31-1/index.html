 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>A muffled band resounded out, Lin Li and Xue Ying separated upon coming into contact with each other. Moreover, they’d both retreated to the side. But, the difference was the steps Xue Ying retreated were slightly more than Lin Li.</p>
 <p>In other words, Xue Ying had suffered a loss!</p>
 <p>This sudden and enormous change in events caused everyone to be shocked, and even Xue Ying was no exception.</p>
 <p>But, unlike Bai Xiaofei and the others who were watching the show, Xue Ying was shocked because the move Lin Li utilized was actually exactly similar to hers!</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Xue… your… Origin Energy!” After they stood still, Lin Li stopped attacking and spoke a few words disjointedly.</p>
 <p>The others didn’t quite understand what Lin Li meant yet Xue Ying had.</p>
 <p>She wanted Xue Ying to increase the level of her Origin Energy!</p>
 <p>“I intended to do that even if you didn’t say anything!” As she spoke, the Origin Energy fluctuations on Xue Ying’s body suddenly rose two ranks, and it attained the Master Rank like Lin Li!</p>
 <p>In the next second, Xue Ying moved once more, and her speed was at least two times her speed for before. Moreover, the path Xue Ying moved on had already turned into an even more unusual ‘Z’ shape.</p>
 <p>As her almond eyes narrowed slightly, Lin Li took a defensive stance resolutely. Lin Li who’d entered into a state of battle was simply like a completely different person when compared to how she was normally. When faced with this sort of attack that she’d never seen before, she’d chosen to defend tenaciously while firmly remembering the path of Xue Ying’s approach!</p>
 <p>In the time for a single breath, Xue Ying had brought Lin Li into her range of attack once again. After having a simple collision with Lin Li from the side, Xue Ying used Lin Li’s strength to jump up lightly, and she flew into the air to somersault over Lin Li.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Lin Li’s reaction was fairly swift as well. Xue Ying who was in midair originally intended to grab onto Lin Li’s neck yet she’s squatted in time to avoid it.</p>
 <p>But, Xue Ying’s attacks hadn’t ended here. After she descended to the ground, a roundhouse kick instantly swept towards the back of Lin Li who was squatted on the ground.</p>
 <p>Lin Li knew that she was unable to dodge it, so she instantly turned around and crossed her arms in front of her chest to forcefully resist Xue Ying’s attack before retreating.</p>
 <p>“Discharging Origin Energy to resist attacks and utilizing Origin Energy as a buffer at the same time. Have you received close combat training in the past?” Xue Ying’s face was already covered in surprise after her attack failed because Lin Li’s display truly exceeded her expectations.</p>
 <p>“You… used it earlier….” A short few words, yet it contained information that stunned everyone present here.</p>
 <p>Xue Ying even recalled the first time the two of them collided and the reaction she made when she suffered a loss, and the astonishment on her face couldn’t help but grow deeper.</p>
 <p>“You're able to learn this sort of methods to manipulate Origin Energy by seeing it once?!” Xue Ying asked once more with a voice that carried a trace of disbelief, and the gaze she looked at Lin Li with had changed at the same time.</p>
 <p>If Lin Li said that she was lying now, then Xue Ying would surely believe Lin Li at the first possible moment. Because being able to learn and utilize something in battle right away after a seeing it once was truly too terrifying if it was true.</p>
 <p>“I’ve always… been like this….” As she stuttered to say this, Lin Li had once again become that young woman with a dull expression.</p>
 <p>“Are we… still going to continue? Lin Li still wants to learn even more….” Lin Li stared fixedly at Xue Ying while a trace of a rare emotion that seemed like excitement appeared in her eyes, and she awaited Xue Ying’s reply.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, all of them who were spectators had entered into a petrified state in unison. They’d heard the conversation between the two of them earlier, and besides being stunned and gulping down mouthfuls of saliva, they were utterly unable to figure out what expression they should use to face all of this.</p>
 <p>But, they were already able to be sure of a single thing!</p>
 <p>Lin Li was that sort of person from the legends….</p>
 <p>A genius!</p>
 <p>A combat genius!</p>
 <p>“Of course. But, you have to keep up with me because there’re some things that I’m only able to utilize once!” As soon as she finished speaking, Xue Ying moved instantly, and this time, she brought out all the strength capable of being exerted at the Master Rank!</p>
 <p>On the other side, Lin Li moved as well, whereas, the method she ran was precisely the ‘Z’ shaped path Xue Ying had utilized before!</p>
 <p>This time, Xue Ying was completely convinced. If it was said that the method of Origin Energy manipulation might have been taught by another, but this strange method of movement was something Xue Ying had specially researched yet Lin Li had executed it without the slightest inferiority!</p>
 <p>In the next ten minutes of time, Bai Xiaofei and the others were like ducks that had heard thunder, and they stood without moving while they looked with stunned expressions at the two people that fought each other on the practice grounds.</p>
 <p>Moreover, during this short time of ten minutes, both of them had practically collided with each other every few seconds, whereas, Xue Ying utilized a different method of attack in every single collision. But, for the sake of guiding Lin Li, every single move Xue Ying made could be dealt with by the previous move.</p>
 <p>Lin Li on the other hand didn’t disappoint Xue Ying in the slightest, and she copied Xue Ying’s moved flawlessly every single time and fought Xue Ying perfectly.</p>
 <p>At the end, when both of them stopped, Xue Ying’s forehead was already covered in dense beads of sweat, whereas, Lin Li was even drenched in sweat since long ago.</p>
 <p>“Thank you…. Big….” Lin Li hadn’t finished speaking when she suddenly lost her balance and fell weakly to the ground.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei who was the closest charged over with a large stride, and he was just barely able to catch Lin Li whose entire body was completely feeble.</p>
 <p>“Lin Li?!” Bai Xiaofei shouted Lin Li’s name, and the others surrounded over right away.</p>
 <p>“All of you move away!” Xue Ying’s voice resounded out, causing the group to instantly split apart and form a path.</p>
 <p>“I asked all of you to move away, do all of you want to suffocate her to death!?” Even though her voice was stern, Xue Ying didn’t seem to be very anxious, and she walked over to Lin Li’s side with a few steps and made a simple check before revealing a relaxed grin.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. She’s just fatigued. Het physical strength is too weak, and it was entirely because her attention wasn’t placed on her physical strength that she was able to fight me for so long. So, she was unable to endure it as soon as we stopped.” As soon as Xue Ying finished speaking, everyone instantly let out long sighs of relief.</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Xue, Ling Li….” Xu Chen asked carefully yet she hadn’t finished speaking when she was stopped by a glare from Xue Ying.</p>
 <p>“Keep in mind that Lin Li’s situation can’t be told to anyone.” Xue Ying swept everyone with her gaze as she spoke, and she revealed a relaxed expression after she obtained the confirmations of everyone.</p>
 <p>“Your training today has ended. But, Lin Li won’t participate in this sort of training classes next time. So, all of you have to properly reflect on the battle today because there won’t be such an unexpected event next time.” A single sentence instantly struck all their hearts to rock bottom, and all their curiosity was completely crushed by the powerlessness and despair in their hearts.</p>
 <p>“The meaning of ended is….” Mo Ka gulped down a mouthful of saliva and spoke with a voice that carried a probing tone because his fear towards Xue Ying had already gone deep into his bones now….</p>
 <p>“All of you are free to do what you want in the remaining time. Of course, if all of you are willing, you can have extra training with me.” Xue Ying raised her brows and turned back into that playful big sister from before.</p>
 <p>Of course, there was absolutely no one that would take her suggestion….</p>
 <p>“No, no! Big Sister Xue, you’re surely extremely busy! We won’t continue bothering you!” Various reasons were spoken from the mouths of every single one of them, and in the blink of an eye, all ten plus of them had already left Xue Ying’s field of vision as if they were fleeing for their lives.</p>
 <p>“What? Aren’t you leaving?” Xue Ying revealed a strange smile as she looked at Bai Xiaofei that remained on the spot….</p>
