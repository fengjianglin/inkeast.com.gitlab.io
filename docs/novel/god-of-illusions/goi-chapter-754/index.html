 <p>Chapter 754: Reeling in the Fish!</p> 
 <p>Starflame City underwent one of the noisiest nights in its history, but the report to the mayor’s building the next morning said it was only a harmless dispute with some guests. The fact that the killing at the inn was only fake made it impossible to find out anything fishy.</p> 
 <p>However, an unaware Old Song thought it was because Starflame City covered it up so as not to get involved in the matter. As for Starnet’s reaction, it wasn’t his concern. After all, he didn’t participate personally.</p> 
 <p>However, one thing alarmed Old Song.</p> 
 <p>The previous night, Liu Heng had said that he was going to check the situation but hadn’t come back ever since nor had he sent back any news. Old Song was worried if Liu Heng had exposed his identity to the Starnet students, in which case they would all be in trouble. The organization would not openly confront Starnet for such a little character like him!</p> 
 <p>Just as Old Song didn’t know what to do, an underling barged into the room in a panic and got him worked up even more.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter?! Is it news from Old Liu?!” Old Song anxiously grabbed the underling, his bulging eyes frightening the underling speechless.</p> 
 <p><em>Pa!</em></p> 
 <p>Old Song slapped the underling awake. The latter covered his cheek with an innocent face, but his wits had also returned to him.</p> 
 <p>“That man called Bai Sicheng came. He said he wanted to see you and Boss Liu.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing the name of his god of fortune, Old Song instantly perked up and threw his worry to the back of his mind.</p> 
 <p>“Then why are you spacing out?! Invite him in quickly! No, wait, I will receive him myself!”</p> 
 <p>Old Song hurriedly ran downstairs, where he saw a smiling Bai Sicheng.</p> 
 <p>Accompanying him were Wang Hang and Wu Chi, looking quite intimidating with their expressionless faces. When the two acted the previous night, Old Song had watched them very clearly. Although they had not used any puppet skills, their martial art ability alone was at the Grandmaster Rank, which was far beyond Old Song’s imagination.</p> 
 <p>However, both of them seemed to have serious injuries.</p> 
 <p>“Boss Bai, great work yesterday! My people are not very sensible. I apologize for any poor reception that you might have had to endure!” Old Song laughed and gave Bai Xiaofei a big hug.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei also showed great enthusiasm.</p> 
 <p>“Not at all, it only shows how conscientious and responsible they are. I’m assured that my partner has such excellent people working for him,” Bai Xiaofei flattered with a smile before his eyes became sharp. “Let’s talk somewhere else?”</p> 
 <p>Old Song grew serious as well. <em>Here comes the main business!</em></p> 
 <p>“Follow me, Boss Bai. My room is absolutely safe.”</p> 
 <p>Old Song led Bai Xiaofei upstairs. Wang Hang and Wu Chi followed Bai Xiaofei all the way up before stopping at the entrance to stand guard.</p> 
 <p>After Old Song and Bai Xiaofei entered the room, Old Song activated an origin device, creating a barrier that protected their privacy.</p> 
 <p>“Boss Bai, we can talk now. It is absolutely impossible for puppet masters below the peak of the Grandmaster Rank to eavesdrop on this room.” Old Song smugly patted his chest and looked expectantly at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Boss Song, I have some bad news for you,” Bai Xiaofei said gravely as his face darkened.</p> 
 <p>Old Song stared blankly. “Has something gone wrong with our cooperation? Or did Starnet discover us?!”</p> 
 <p>Of all the possible bad news that came to Old Song’s mind, none was about his ‘good friend.’ <em>This is your so-called ‘good friend’?</em> Bai Xiaofei inwardly derided.</p> 
 <p>“When we were chasing after the Starnet students last night, Boss Liu followed to make sure that it was handled cleanly. None of us could expect that the last student detonated their puppet, and Boss Liu was caught in the explosion. I had a grade-six pill, but he died instantly and did not have the opportunity to take it,” Bai Xiaofei slowly narrated.</p> 
 <p>Old Song was first stunned, then heaved a sigh of relief.</p> 
 <p><em>So it’s just that? Nearly scared me to death!</em></p> 
 <p>After feeling relieved, Old Song suddenly realized that his reaction was wrong. The next second, an agonized look appeared on his face.</p> 
 <p>“What did you say?! Old Liu… He…”</p> 
 <p>“My condolences, Boss Song. We weren’t cautious enough to expect such a possibility and therefore didn’t discourage Boss Liu from going. If you want to blame us, I have nothing to say,” interrupted Bai Xiaofei, unable to stand Old Song’s terrible acting.</p> 
 <p>“Aiii… You were only helping us, Boss Bai, how can I blame you? I will take good care of Old Liu’s family.” Old Song finished his act with a long sigh.</p> 
 <p>“Also, Boss Song, it’s not a good time to say this, but I have received a sudden order from my headquarters to return if I can’t obtain a Blood Diamond transaction. There are other urgent matters over there.” Bai Xiaofei’s eyes glinted and he stared fixedly at Old Song. “So, I would like to know if the agreement I made with Boss Liu is still valid and whether you are willing to continue our cooperation and arrange for me to see your superior.”</p> 
 <p>This time, Old Song no longer had any hesitation.</p> 
 <p>“Of course! In fact, I already sent them a message last night. In at most three days, my boss will bring people over. He can achieve at least one-third of the scope you want. As for deeper cooperation, it will need further inspection and our boss’ judgment on your work,” said Old Song proudly, his heart filled with joy. Now he only needed to wait to count his money!</p> 
 <p>“Then I am relieved.” Bai Xiaofei smiled, his heart filled with relief as well. <em>Finally, sight of the big fish!</em></p> 
 <p>“However, Boss Bai, there is something that worries me. You killed so many Starnet students last night, if they trace it…” Old Song was hesitant. He obviously wanted to ask if it would get him in trouble.</p> 
 <p>“You can rest assured, Boss Song. Before I even started, I had blocked all possibility of it leaking out. They had just come out on a mission, and it’s normal not to have a report within a month. When Starnet realizes the problem, we will have left this place,” Bai Xiaofei recited the answer he had prepared and put Old Song at ease.</p> 
 <p>“Then, I wish that your business will take off successfully, Boss Bai!”</p>
