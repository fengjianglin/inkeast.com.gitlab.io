 <p>Chapter 952: Liberation, From Now On!</p> 
 <p>“Do you know why the women in Moonlight hate men?” Bai Xiaofei suddenly asked a question that seemed completely irrelevant.</p> 
 <p>However, in order to get Bai Xiaofei’s help, Zhu Chunyang still seriously contemplated it. A long while later, he declared, “Because most men are heartless!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei almost vomited blood. <em>Damn it, have you been brainwashed by Moonlight? Who told you that?!</em></p> 
 <p>“This may be one of the reasons, but it’s not the most important one,” Bai Xiaofei tried to guide the man as he wiped the sweat on his forehead.</p> 
 <p>“Then what is?” Zhu Chunyang was stunned. He had always thought that he couldn’t earn Tong’er’s favor because she considered him the same as other men. <em>Have I been wrong all this time?</em></p> 
 <p>“Because they feel that they can handle everything without men and that they don’t need a man in their life. Therefore, only when you prove that you can do some things that they can’t, will your problem be solved at its root!” Bai Xiaofei threw out the first bait. “There is a perfect opportunity right now, and as long as you grasp it, even if you don’t end up being a hero in her eyes, you still won’t have to pretend to be caught just to get close to her like you do now.”</p> 
 <p>Just now, when Zhu Chunyang had been able to effortlessly break free from the rope, Bai Xiaofei immediately knew that he had deliberately allowed himself to be arrested.</p> 
 <p>“What opportunity?”</p> 
 <p>Zhu Chunyang took the bait after all.</p> 
 <p>“The border!” said Bai Xiaofei firmly as he stared intently at Zhu Chunyang.</p> 
 <p>“You know about the situation at the border?” Zhu Chunyang looked surprised. From his expression, it was clear that he also knew about the real situation at the border.</p> 
 <p>“What’s so strange about me knowing? Although it hasn’t spread widely yet, that day shouldn’t be far off.” Bai Xiaofei acted like a know-it-all, but he was inwardly astonished. <em>I actually ran into a treasure!</em></p> 
 <p>“If you know about the situation at the border, why would you want me to go there?” Zhu Chunyang’s face was full of surprise.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s heart tightened. <em>Okay, what the hell? What’s there about the border thing that makes you all so surprised? Moreover, why is your surprise different from Ye Xi and the others?!</em></p> 
 <p>Despite a heart full of doubts, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t just ask directly.</p> 
 <p>“What’s wrong? You think it’s already hopeless for the border?” Bai Xiaofei asked in the most nonchalant tone possible with a look of contempt at Zhu Chunyang.</p> 
 <p>“I thought you weren’t a Moonlight person like me. How are you just as optimistic as them? Those women are good at everything, but their intuition in wars sucks. I can assure you that in less than three months, Moonlight borders will definitely collapse!” Zhu Chunyang declared. From his expression, he was not exaggerating at all.</p> 
 <p>“This is why we must go to the border. War has never been something women excel at. Don’t you think this is a great opportunity for us men to change our position in Moonlight?” Bai Xiaofei encouraged</p> 
 <p>However, this did not arouse Zhu Chunyang’s interest at all. “Impossible! Even if you have the will, you don’t have the strength. Men have no right to speak at the borders of Moonlight. You may have a thousand ideas and none of them will even be heard.”</p> 
 <p>These words hit the nail on the head. However, Bai Xiaofei smiled.</p> 
 <p>“I never said I’m going to persuade Moonlight women. I know full well my place. But this doesn’t mean that I have no one to use.”</p> 
 <p>Stunned, Zhu Chunyang dubiously asked, “You have people you can use? Where from?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei spread his arms. “Aren’t there a lot of people here? Do you know about the mountain bandits?”</p> 
 <p>Zhu Chunyang was stunned again, then he burst out laughing as if he had just heard the funniest joke ever. “Brother, did I hear you right? You’re gathering scattered people to fight against the Sacks? You’ve never had official contact with the Sacks, have you?”</p> 
 <p>“I haven’t, but no matter how strong they are, they are also human. As long as they are human, there is a solution. If you don’t even have the courage to try, Moonlight men will forever be the Moonlight men of now. Oh, wait, no. It’s likely they will become Sack men in the future. Besides, if you still want to capture the heart of your Tong‘er and change her opinion on men, this is an ordeal that you have to pass. Of course, if you were only all talk and no action, just pretend you haven’t seen me.”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Bai Xiaofei finished the last sentence, Zhu Chunyang became emotional. He almost roared, “How could it just be all talk?! My love for Tong’er is sincere! I can do anything for her!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s lips curled up. “So, the border?”</p> 
 <p>When the problem returned to where it started, Zhu Chunyang’s temper deflated like a balloon. After long consideration, he let out a long sigh.</p> 
 <p>“You are right. If I can’t change Tong’er’s opinion, she will never even look straight at me,” he concluded with a sorrowful expression and looked up at Bai Xiaofei. “Although I don’t know much about you, I can tell that you’re no ordinary person from the words you’ve said. I’ll take this bet. Let’s just hope you won’t let me down!”</p> 
 <p>Zhu Chunyang’s eyes were suddenly sharp as he said this and the aura he gave off made him look like a completely different person.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I’ve never let anyone down,” Bai Xiaofei declared and raised his hand.</p> 
 <p>With a smile, Zhu Chunyang high-fived Bai Xiaofei before getting straight to business, “Now let’s discuss our current situation.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei took a deep breath and said, “Release all the men and control them!” He turned to walk toward a dark house where captured men were detained.</p> 
 <p>The simple and rude idea shocked Zhu Chunyang. <em>Releasing them is easy, but control?</em></p> 
 <p>Full of doubt, Zhu Chunyang hurriedly followed Bai Xiaofei. At that moment, the latter had already run into the two soldiers guarding the dark house.</p> 
 <p>“Guards! Sound the alarm…”</p> 
 <p>Before the surprised soldiers could finish their words, Bai Xiaofei had rushed up and knocked them unconscious.</p> 
 <p>The road toward liberation started from that moment!</p>
