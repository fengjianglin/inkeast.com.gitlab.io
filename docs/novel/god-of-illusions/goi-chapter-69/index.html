 <p><span style>Qin Lingyan’s group of five couldn’t help but be stunned when they saw Bai Xiaofei and the others enter into a battle-ready state, and they were actually temporarily at a loss for what to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The stance Bai Xiaofei and the others assumed had really shocked them. They’d thought about everything a bit too simply since the beginning, and it was to the extent that they could only face Bai Xiaofei’s string of tricks without the slightest precautions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, the five of them still braced themselves and took their positions, and their reliance was their strength at the Master Rank which was their pride! </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was precisely at the instant the five of them took their positions that Bai Xiaofei crushed two greyish white colored balls at the first possible moment, causing a dense white mist to instantly spread out and hide the 16 of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pay attention to your defenses!” Qin Lingyan had just finished speaking when Xing Nan and Fang Ye who’d memorized their locations launched the first attack within the mist!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, both their targets were He Meng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Protection!” He was an experienced assassin in the end, and He Meng’s reaction far surpassed an ordinary person in speed. At the instant before he was about to be hit, a violet colored glow appeared from the bracelet on his right hand, and then a golden barrier appeared in time to obstruct the attacks that were less than half a second apart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Violet-grade puppet, Bracelet of Protection, it consumed Origin Energy to construct a shield that lasted for two seconds and was capable of resisting attacks that didn’t exceed two times the amount of Origin Energy poured into it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, to He Meng’s surprise, he’d thought that he’d already poured in sufficient Origin Energy, yet his shield had shattered right after it received Fang Ye’s attack!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Watch out for their ranged attacks, it’s very likely that it’s a gun puppet!” He notified them of his findings at the first possible moment, and the five of them swiftly changed their positions so as to avoid being assaulted once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurricane Sword! Skysplit Slash!” The extremely arrogant senior from before had a verdant colored, broad, and thick broadsword, and a strong gale whistled out from his slash and swept straight towards the dense miss that Bai Xiaofei and the others were hidden within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dense mist dispersed completely under the assault of the strong wind, and it revealed the few people that were still within the mist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right at the front was a shield wall that was even larger than a door, and it was precisely the work of Ming One and Ming Two. As for who was still standing behind the shield wall, that wasn’t something the five of them were able to know.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, this didn’t stop Qin Lingyan’s group of five from attacking!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they strode forward, the first to charge over was Qin Lingyan, whereas, Bai Ye and the remaining senior whose name was unknown followed closely behind her. He Meng, on the other hand, had activated the effect of his third puppet, and he gradually concealed himself because his target was Fang Ye!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lingyan held a fiery red colored sword in her hand, and if one didn’t look carefully, it seemed to be slightly similar to Xu Chen’s Crimsonflame Sword. But, the violet colored glow it was suffused with wasn’t something the Crimsonflame Sword that was a red-grade puppet could compare to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crimsonblaze Slash!” Qin Lingyan who charged to the front didn’t have any intention of going around the shield, and she directly utilized her strongest single target attack. Shockingly, she seemed to intend to slash the shield apart!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, unexpectedly, the shield actually split apart itself before her attack descended! On the other hand, Qin Lingyan was utterly unable to stop her attack in time, and she could allow let her attack continue and hit nothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the instant that Qin Lingyan’s figure descended, Ming One and Ming Two stepped aside at the same time before they tossed their shields out. In midair, the shields combined together once more, and this time, they became an enormous dome that completely enveloped all the people that were behind the shield wall. Moreover, Qin Lingyan was within it as well!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Combining together was merely its basic ability, and the true ability of the Ming brother’s combination shield was this ability, the Shield of the Black Turtle!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Ye and the other senior that was following closely behind her cursed in their hearts, and they launched their strongest attacks at the Shield of the Black Turtle right away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Ye’s puppet was a pair of gloves that were coiled by a gentle breeze, and it was similarly a violet-grade puppet. At the instant he launched an attack, a small scale vortex condensed on his fist before smashing heavily onto the Shield of the Black Turtle!</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, the other senior’s main weapon puppet was surprisingly a sledgehammer. After he accumulated enough strength, the sledgehammer carried an enormous might as it smashed down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, right at this moment, a glow attached itself to the Shield of the Black Turtle, and it assisted the shied to resist the first strikes of Bai Ye and the other senior.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Duan Yi’yi and the Rod of Strengthening!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, resist this strike was already their limit, and the Shield of the Black Turtle separated with a crack when Bai Ye and the other senior were prepared to launch an attack, whereas, Ming One and Ming Two that controlled the shield were blasted flying and spat out a mouthful of blood in midair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the arrogant senior swung the Hurricane Sword in his hand towards Ming One and Ming Two that were blasted flying, and it was obvious how ruthless he was!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you f*cking stop!!!” Bai Xiaofei roared furiously as he drew the attention of everyone to himself. At this moment, he was holding Qin Lingyan’s slender neck, and even though Qin Lingyan’s face was covered in embarrassment and indignation, she was helpless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she was beneath the Shield of the Black Turtle, she didn’t even have the chance to react before she was disarmed by their group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ming One and Ming Two landed safely and scrambled to their feet with great difficulty, they silently awaited the changes in the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Watch out!!!” However, before the chip in Bai Xiaofei’s hand could be of any use, Lin Li suddenly exclaimed with shock as a strand of coldness came from behind Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guard!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhu Nuo’s guard effect had just been placed on Bai Xiaofei when an extremely sharp dagger had already pierced into Bai Xiaofei’s back, and the guard effect had merely sustained itself for less than half a second before the dagger moved forward once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, this half a second was already sufficient for Bai Xiaofei to protect his life!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he rolled away in time, Bai Xiaofei’s back was already drenched with blood, whereas, He Meng displayed a ruthless expression from where Bai Xiaofei was standing just moments ago!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, He Meng’s complacency didn’t last for even half a second before an icy cold voice instantly sounded out from behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go to hell!!!” The first person to go berserk from Bai Xiaofei being heavily injured was none other than Lin Li!</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to the original plan, Lin Li wouldn’t make a move unless necessary. But, Lin Li didn’t have the slightest mood to consider all of these, and the Divine Phoenix Feather Dress instantly appeared on her body. Her surging Origin Energy flooded out and raised he Meng up into the air while his limbs were pulled outwards, and he didn’t even have the slightest ability to resist it. Moreover, the strength of this pulling force was growing ceaselessly!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry!” After she realized He Meng was in a precarious situation, Qin Lingyan instantly swung the fiery red sword in her hand with the intention of interrupting Lin Li. But, what she never expected was that Lin Li who was controlling the Divine Phoenix Feather Dress was actually capable of using her hands!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sword wasn’t able to enter attack range when Lin Li had already flashed over to arrive behind Qin Lingyan, and her slender hand grabbed onto Qin Lingyan’s neck before her left leg kicked the back of Qin Lingyan’s leg, causing Qin Lingyan to be blasted out like an arrow. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This unexpected scene caused Bai Ye and the other senior to be completely stunned because both of them were knowledgeable, and they were stunned as soon as they saw the Divine Phoenix Feather Dress.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though they were stunned, the members of the Savage Class weren’t!</span></p>
