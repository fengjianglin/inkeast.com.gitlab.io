 <p>Chapter 890: Seeing Lan He Again!</p> 
 <p>The next day,</p> 
 <p>“Gained anything?” asked Yun Tianhe at the entrance of the Yun residence as soon as he saw Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Stunned, Bai Xiaofei reproached him, nearly shouting, “Big Bro, you couldn’t be so cruel? It’s only the second day after your wedding, and you only care about what I got and stand here in the morning to wait for me?! You keep saying you feel sorry toward Princess Ling Ge, and yet look at what you’re doing now!”</p> 
 <p>If he weren’t afraid of not being able to control his strength, he would have beaten Yun Tianhe up.</p> 
 <p>Being scolded out of the blue, Yun Tianhe was at a loss for words until Mu Yun came out.</p> 
 <p>“Of course he is not so unreasonable. In fact, he was so ‘strong’ last night that Lil’ Sis Ling Ge can’t get up yet. The madam drove him out to take care of her,” Mu Yun helped explain the situation and slightly curtsied to Bai Xiaofei. “Thank you, Xiaofei.”</p> 
 <p>She finally addressed Bai Xiaofei by his suggestion, her tone sincere.</p> 
 <p>Thanks to Bai Xiaofei, Lan Qiushuang accepted Mu Yun and had picked a day for her to marry Yun Tianhe, and was even pleased by how wise Mu Yun acted. In other words, Yun Tianhe not only won two beauties but also avoided a family conflict.</p> 
 <p>In a big clan like the Yun clan, a conflict was not the kind that lasted only one or two days.</p> 
 <p>“We’re all family, no need to say thank you and whatnot. I hope that your wedding will be while I’m still here. I’ve already missed one, and I don’t want to miss the second.” Bai Xiaofei laughed.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Yun Tianhe embarrassedly scratched his head. He had been so resolute to refuse before, then hesitated again and again, but after everything was done, he was actually the fastest to accept the situation and even greatly enjoyed it…</p> 
 <p>That’s humans for you. Their mouths keep saying no but their bodies are very honest!</p> 
 <p>“Can we change the topic? How is it on your side? What have you got?” Getting back to business, Yun Tianhe was anxious. Alongside him, even Mu Yun looked seriously at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“I talked with that puppetsmith who makes the human puppets.” Bai Xiaofei picked the juiciest part of the news to start.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Yun Tianhe was pleased at first, but then shocked and in disbelief when he realized something. “Where is that person then? You couldn’t capture them?!”</p> 
 <p>“Not that. I didn’t even see him. I met the human puppet he controlled and talked to him through it. In addition, I found the place where they forged human puppets. However, I reckon they won’t be using it in the future,” said Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe understood. That puppetsmith obviously had it planned and already arranged a way out, rendering Bai Xiaofei’s efforts futile…</p> 
 <p>“Then what did you talk about? Got anything useful?” Yun Tianhe quickly shifted focus thanks to his strong ability to accept reality. After all, this matter had been troubling them for so long. If Bai Xiaofei really captured the person so easily, he might even feel uncomfortable.</p> 
 <p>“Hard to say if what he said is useful. After all, I am still not sure about his stance yet. Can’t rule out that some of what he said is false,” Bai Xiaofei provided an uncertain answer.</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe was about to ask more questions but Mu Yun stopped him. “This is not a place to talk. Let’s go in. The old master wants to see Xiaofei.”</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe swallowed back his words. He only realized now that he had been keeping Bai Xiaofei at the door, which was considered quite rude.</p> 
 <p>“Lil’ Bro, I’m sorry, I… Let’s hurry in!” Yun Tianhe smacked his own head, his face red in embarrassment. Ever since he met Bai Xiaofei, the steady Yun Tianhe seemed to be asleep and replaced by a clumsy big boy.</p> 
 <p>“Yeah, I was starting to think of finding another place to stay in case you wouldn’t let me in,” teased Bai Xiaofei with a serious face, then ignored the speechless Yun Tianhe and asked Mu Yun, “Sister-in-law, is the old master you just mentioned Senior Lan He?”</p> 
 <p>“Yes, he has been busy with some things before and now is finally free. After the wedding, he took the opportunity to stay, saying that he must see you,” replied Mu Yun calmly as she invited Bai Xiaofei inside. “He should be exercising in the yard. Let us go.”</p> 
 <p>When Yun Tianhe came to his senses, the two had walked far ahead. Watching them from behind, he giggled blissfully. He was happy to have such a good wife and a good brother.</p> 
 <p>“Gramps, no! Here, this hand should slide up slowly, then this hand goes down, and then both hands draw a circle and fold… Right, that’s it!”</p> 
 <p>As soon as the group approached the quarters specially reserved for Lan He, a familiar voice reached Bai Xiaofei’s ears. In the yard, Tan Xin, in her matured form, was directing Lan He to slowly practice a fist technique.</p> 
 <p>“You heartless man, so you still know to come back!”</p> 
 <p>Immediately spotting Bai Xiaofei, Tan Xin leaped into his arm in a flash. The shocked Bai Xiaofei was frozen in place.</p> 
 <p>“What… what’s wrong?” He gulped in bewilderment. The feeling was like being slapped out of nowhere.</p> 
 <p>“Oh, nothing, I just wanted to scare you and see how you would react.” Tan Xin stuck out her tongue, then suddenly grew displeased and said savagely, “I warn you, next time you dare to leave me behind and use Huskie to fool me, I will definitely scare you to death!”</p> 
 <p>In order to ensure the credibility of Huskie, Bai Xiaofei did not tell anyone except Yun Tianhe. Therefore, when many people saw ‘Bai Xiaofei’ turn into Huskie after everything was over, their reactions were quite a sight to behold.</p> 
 <p>Especially Tan Xin…</p> 
 <p>After all, she had constantly pestered ‘Bai Xiaofei’ at the wedding and tried her best to ‘provoke’ him, but Huskie did not dare to be too close for fear of exposing himself. It was quite an ordeal for a dog!</p> 
 <p>“I promise that won’t happen again. I will definitely inform you in advance next time.” Bai Xiaofei raised his hand and swore an oath, but Tan Xin ignored him.</p> 
 <p>“Young man, still remember this old man?” Lan He eagerly called out to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Seeing his ruddy face, Bai Xiaofei knew that losing his ability as a puppet master had not had much impact.</p> 
 <p>“Of course, Senior Lan He.” Bai Xiaofei went up and respectfully greeted him, while Mu Yun and Yun Tianhe bowed.</p> 
 <p>“The little girl is a good one, you can’t wrong her, alright? Don’t be like my grandson, dozens of years old and yet still struggled on such a small matter. Having several concubines is nothing new in Starnet Continent. As long as everyone is willing, right?!” Lan He didn’t forget to jab at Yun Tianhe while advising Bai Xiaofei. To him, Yun Tianhe would always be a child.</p> 
 <p>Glancing at Tan Xin, who was still sulking, Bai Xiaofei leaned forward and whispered to Lan He, “Senior, you weren’t bribed, were you?”</p> 
 <p>“Smelly boy, I’m saying this from the heart. Do you think I can be bought with just a set of fist techniques? I’m a busy man!” Lan He’s face was full of pride as he exposed the content of the bribery…</p> 
 <p><em>Indeed, the older one gets, the younger their soul becomes. To care for your elders, start with doing morning exercises with them, or they might be abducted by another…</em></p> 
 <p>“Oh? Busy with what? I remember you said you wanted to enjoy the life of retirement after returning to Ethereal?” Bai Xiaofei asked.</p> 
 <p>Lan He immediately looked proud. “Aiii, I’d like to, but the younger generations are so useless that I have to deal with everything.”</p> 
 <p>Watching the two whisper to each other, Yun Tianhe started to doubt reality. In his memory, Lan He had always been a strict-looking senior, toward whom he only felt two kinds of feelings: fear and extreme fear. But now…</p> 
 <p><em>What the hell is this?! Lil’ Bro, your friend circle is really too vast! Can you teach me how you do it? I want to learn!!</em></p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe shrieked inside. And then, he saw Lan He and Bai Xiaofei walking into the room shoulder to shoulder, just like two old brothers who had not seen each other in many years…</p> 
 <p>“Tianhe, bring me your father’s best wine and tell the kitchen to cook some side dishes. Hurry on your feet, don’t delay my reunion with Lil’ Brother Bai!” Lan He’s voice coming from the room affirmed Yun Tianhe’s guess…</p> 
 <p><em>Well, they are really old brothers!</em></p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, after Bai Xiaofei and Tan Xin seated themselves, Lan He’s expression became solemn.</p> 
 <p>“Is the situation that serious?” asked Bai Xiaofei as he couldn’t help but frown.</p> 
 <p>“The imperial physician said at most half a month. That’s his limit and also the limit of current medical ability,” replied Lan He with a long sigh, his face sorrowful.</p> 
 <p>To others, the Great Emperor was only a ruler, but to Lan He, he was a life-long brother…</p>
