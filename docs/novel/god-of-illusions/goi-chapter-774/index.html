 <p>Chapter 774: Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill!</p> 
 <p>“How long have you worked for Unify Business? How did you start here?” Bai Xiaofei suddenly asked.</p> 
 <p>Qing Ya, who was ready to introduce the Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill, was stunned but quickly replied.</p> 
 <p>“Less than two years. My brother and I came to Windlove to escape enemy pursuit and became auctioneers of Unify Business by chance. We then climbed step by step to where we are today,” Qing Ya succinctly described her story.</p> 
 <p>Listening to her answer, Bai Xiaofei’s heart loosened. He still had not understood what Unify Business really was, but in any case, from Qing Ya’s words, she and Qing Han were not its core personnel, which meant he could separate them from Unify Business!</p> 
 <p>“What do I need to do if I want to take you and your brother from Unify?” Bai Xiaofei dropped a bomb.</p> 
 <p>The three behind him collectively froze. Did the Young Master come to Windlove to hunt for underlings…?</p> 
 <p>“Young Master Bai, you’re kidding…”</p> 
 <p>“I’m not. I’m very optimistic about both your abilities, and I just happen to need talent. From what I can see, you two have not yet reached the core layer of Unify Business so I’ll grab any chance to take you two away. Believe me, I will provide you two with better development,” Bai Xiaofei seriously expressed his attitude.</p> 
 <p>His Illusion Demon Merchant Group was starving for talent. Feng Wuhen and Lu Lingyun had too much on their plates while it was extremely difficult to find a capable hand. Having only themselves, the two were barely managing.</p> 
 <p>“Very good, Young Master Bai, I will consider your offer. It should be up to my will, right? Now, please let me finish my work.” Qing Ya put on a captivating smile and did not provide a definite answer.</p> 
 <p>Then, she pushed the pill toward Bai Xiaofei and began to explain.</p> 
 <p>“The Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill can definitely be ranked in the top three god-tier pills out of all the known pills on the continent. The number of pills remaining can only decrease, not because there is no recipe or method, but that no alchemist alive has the ability to refine it.”</p> 
 <p>“The effect of this pill lies in the word ‘Rebirth.’ The person who uses it will basically be reborn, and ‘Nine-Turn’ refers to the nine benefits brought along with the rebirth.”</p> 
 <p>“One: cuts off the connection between the puppet master and all of their puppets without any backlash.”</p> 
 <p>“Two: retains the user’s rank, and the pill will turn into nine special energy flows that break through the user’s rank barrier and help them rank up, possibly more than once.”</p> 
 <p>“Three: strengthens physical quality.”</p> 
 <p>“Four: changes the user’s physical characteristics. There is a great chance that it will give the user a special physique.”</p> 
 <p>“Five: enhances the intensity of the user’s spirit as well as their control over puppets.”</p> 
 <p>“Sixth: gives the user one chance to successfully link a puppet while ignoring all the conditions required to link that puppet. Moreover, this link does not count as a normal one, so the puppet won’t occupy a puppet slot.”</p> 
 <p>“Seven: gives the user a special ability called Nine Turns. By activating this ability, the user’s rank will increase by one for a short time. The duration varies from person to person, but after the effect is over, the user will be weakened for a short period.”</p> 
 <p>“Eight: lets the user become a body of all elements that allows them to perfectly manipulate puppets of major elements.”</p> 
 <p>“Nine – also the only negative effect of the Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill: Every nine years, all the energy in the user’s body will dissipate and they will become a completely ordinary person. This will last for three months before their strength will return and repeatedly launch hits on the rank barrier, helping the user advance in power. This side effect will occur nine times in total.”</p> 
 <p>The long introduction made everyone in the room swallow constantly. The three experts’ eyes glowed red with desire as they stared fixedly at the pill.</p> 
 <p><em>This is not a rebirth pill, it’s a godly pill! How can anyone think of putting it up for auction? And you guys gave it away?! How do people’s brains even work nowadays?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Unify Business is really a huge organization. How very interesting that you did not save this kind of thing for yourself.” The first thing that came to Bai Xiaofei’s mind was not who the pill was for, but the particularity of Unify Business.</p> 
 <p>According to Qing Ya, the Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill’s only weakness was the weakening period. For none of their people were willing to use it, they must be extremely apprehensive of this effect.</p> 
 <p>In other words, Unify Business was not monolithic as outsiders thought, and even their biggest boss was worried about the ones below making moves against them.</p> 
 <p><em>Is such an organization really as simple as a mere merchant group?</em></p> 
 <p>Reaching this thought, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but chuckle.</p> 
 <p>“I do not know what our superiors think. We only follow orders, so for us, it is but a pill waiting to be exchanged for Amethyst Coins,” said Qing Ya.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei did not pursue this topic. Obviously, he would not get anything deeper from Qing Ya. To find out what Unify Business really was, he could only explore further himself.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Qing Han had resumed the auction. Bai Xiaofei was quiet this time. After all, the items being auctioned were the pills that he had consigned…</p> 
 <p>The fierce bidding lasted for a long time, during which Bai Xiaofei’s pills were sold out in batches. Auctioned along with his pills were a large number of special pills provided by an unknown person. The second stage became a pill-special sale.</p> 
 <p>“Does each stage have a theme?” Bai Xiaofei asked Qing Ya during the recess.</p> 
 <p>“Yes. Except for the first stage of warming-up, there are five stages, namely Pills, Materials, Puppets, Magical Beasts, and Slaves. Each category has its own finale, and the Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill should have been one of them.”</p> 
 <p>“Slaves?” Bai Xiaofei’s brows were slightly creased. He had never witnessed a slave auction before.</p> 
 <p>“Slave trading is a major feature of Windlove City. Young Master Bai, you haven’t been to the slave market, have you?” Qing Ya was slightly surprised. As far as she was concerned, a rich young master like him should have visited the slave market first.</p> 
 <p>“I have just arrived and haven’t had the time yet. I’m very curious what kind of slaves have the value to be auctioned, and moreover be placed at the very end of the auction,” Bai Xiaofei commented.</p> 
 <p>Then, he boldly used his imagination to answer his own curiosity. As he was thinking, his eyes suddenly widened and his face became ecstatic.</p> 
 <p><em>Perhaps, the solution to my long-standing problem will be found here?!</em></p>
