 <p>Chapter 282: First Generation Core Members!</p> 
 <p>Staring intensely at Bai Xiaofei in front of him, Feng Wuhen’s expression kept changing until after a long silence, he finally uttered, “What makes you think I’ll be persuaded by you? You should know that as long as I want to, I can get a rather high position in Ethereal. “</p> 
 <p>This question might be difficult to answer to others, but Bai Xiaofei had long expected it.</p> 
 <p>“You're totally disheartened by the Ethereal Merchant Group, that’s what. Also, you said that you can get a rather high position, not a position deserving of your ability. Creating an existence that can rival Ethereal from scratch will, one day, allow you to hold your head up in front of all those who are unfair to you. This may be an extravagant hope, but I believe that as long as there is a 1% chance of achieving it, you will not hesitate.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei paused a little as a confident smile appeared on his face.</p> 
 <p>“So, I’ve come, and I believe that you will come with me!”</p> 
 <p>Feng Wuhen fell silent again, it didn’t last long this time as a smile slowly graced his face. At the same time, he extended his right hand very formally.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll be in your care, Boss Bai.”</p> 
 <p>The moment they shook hands, the seed of a commerce empire was planted.</p> 
 <p>Feng Wuhen was a man of action. Having decided to follow Bai Xiaofei, he packed up all his belongings in the Ethereal Pavilion and left a note to the manager before leaving the store with Bai Xiaofei without saying a word.</p> 
 <p>From that moment, the Ethereal Pavilion became an opponent and no longer a friend.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei's mood was exceptionally good. He hummed a little song all along the way back to the Demon of Illusions, looking proud like a baby who had picked up a treasure.</p> 
 <p>“Why do I feel like I was abducted?” Walking behind Bai Xiaofei, Feng Wuhen asked with a wry smile. The words were seemingly joking yet contained real feelings.</p> 
 <p>“It's about the same, and it's very likely that you’ll be sold to me for the rest of your life,” wittily replied Bai Xiaofei as he chuckled and shrugged his shoulders, his posture practically saying ‘So you realize it now? Too late.’</p> 
 <p>Seeing Bai Xiaofei’s extremely flippant act, Feng Wuhen couldn't help but sigh.</p> 
 <p><em>Ah! I may have trusted the wrong person!</em></p> 
 <p>But in actuality, his case didn’t count as ‘trusted the wrong person’ yet. The truly pitiful one was waiting right in front.</p> 
 <p>“Bai Xiaofei!!”</p> 
 <p>Feng Wuhen and Bai Xiaofei were casually chatting when a furious roar echoed ahead. Feng Wuhen instinctively raised his guard, while Bai Xiaofei revealed a smile of a scheme being successfully executed.</p> 
 <p><em>Hehe, that saves the trouble of looking for him.</em></p> 
 <p>That’s right, it was Lu Lingyun who wanted Bai Xiaofei to explain!</p> 
 <p>“Bai Xiaofei, you…”</p> 
 <p>“Let's talk inside. Our people haven’t all arrived yet,” Bai Xiaofei cut off Lu Lingyun before he could finish. “Let me introduce, this is the former head of the Ethereal Pavilion in Starnet, Feng Wuhen. This is Lu Lingyun, the former manager of the Thousand Aroma Restaurant in Starnet.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei moved aside a little as he walked over, giving off the vibe of a matchmaker as he introduced the two, who instantly detected a kindred soul in distress the moment they set eyes on each other.</p> 
 <p>“You too?!”</p> 
 <p>“You too?!”</p> 
 <p>The two men said in unison, and their sympathy for each other deepened. What they didn’t realize was that what they meant by ‘You too’ wasn’t the same.</p> 
 <p>“Let's go and talk with him. You can't hurry, the more anxious you are, the more he’ll keep you in suspense.” What Feng Wuhen said was indeed a fact, and it immediately gained Lu Lingyun’s approval.</p> 
 <p>“Boss…”</p> 
 <p>A sobbing voice rang out. Bai Xiaofei, who still had a smile on his face, froze as a chill ran down his spine.</p> 
 <p>Blinking her red puffy eyes, Rui Mengqi stared at Bai Xiaofei. Something was indescribably pitiful about her grief-stricken face.</p> 
 <p>Of course, if she wasn’t pitiful, who was? She had been expelled, then only managed to find another job with great difficulty, but before the formal commencement, she was expelled again!</p> 
 <p>“Calm down! Calm down! You are not unemployed yet! I’m still paying your salary as usual!” Instinctively taking a step back, Bai Xiaofei hurriedly comforted her for fear that she would go nuts again.</p> 
 <p>Rui Mengqi was indeed easily comforted. As soon as she heard what Bai Xiaofei said, the gloom on her face instantly dissipated and was replaced by pleasant surprise.</p> 
 <p>“Really?! I knew you were the best, boss! “</p> 
 <p>The tears melting into smiles, Rui Mengqi swooped down on Bai Xiaofei for a hug. A proud pair of world-class buns tightly pressed against him, the touch was so soft Bai Xiaofei almost lost control…</p> 
 <p>“If you don't let me go now, you'll really be unemployed!” Unable to escape, Bai Xiaofei hurriedly shouted. If Rui Mengqi were to continue holding on, even he couldn’t guarantee what would happen!</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, the word ‘unemployed’ was more than a fatal strike to Rui Mengqi. Before Bai Xiaofei knew what was happening, she already sprang aside like her tail was stepped on and stared straight at him with innocent eyes. Those eyes clearly said, ‘I am very obedient, you’re not allowed to fire me!’</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei wasn't in the mood to check Rui Mengqi's reaction. He was busy heaving sighs of relief after being let go of. For some reason, though, he felt lost and empty after losing that soft feeling…</p> 
 <p><em>No! This is wrong! Bai Xiaofei! You’re seeking death!</em></p> 
 <p>Hurriedly snuffing out the wisp of emotion that he shouldn’t have, Bai Xiaofei fearfully warned himself. However, the lingering fragrance on his chest kept challenging him…</p> 
 <p>This series of reactions from Bai Xiaofei naturally couldn’t escape the eyes of the two old foxes Feng Wuhen and Lu Lingyun. Exchanging glances, they revealed knowing smiles in unison.</p> 
 <p><em>There is a rock to every scissors!</em></p> 
 <p><em>We must get this little girl under our control!</em></p> 
 <p>Once again reaching a consensus, the two unexpectedly found a way to subdue Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei looked back just in time to catch the ‘profound’ smiles on their faces, and a bad feeling welled up in his heart.</p> 
 <p><em>Motherf*cker, they caught my weak spot!</em></p> 
 <p>At this realization, Bai Xiaofei couldn't help feeling bitter in his heart. How come every time he met Rui Mengqi, there’d be a new ‘surprise’…</p> 
 <p>While Bai Xiaofei was still sighing from the bottom of his heart, a familiar barking sounded. Everyone looked over to see Fang Ye running after Huskie. Upon seeing Bai Xiaofei, Fang Ye's face visibly lit up.</p> 
 <p>“Manager Feng, Boss Lu, Sister Meng Qi!”</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye greeted them one by one. As the only one here who knew all the people in the hall, he didn’t feel awkward at all.</p> 
 <p>“Don't call us that from now on, it's all history.” Bai Xiaofei patted Fang Ye on the shoulder with a sentence that gave Feng Wuhen and Lu Lingyun a dose of acid.</p> 
 <p><em>Your mother, what a trap I’ve fallen into!</em></p> 
 <p>“Well, now that everyone is here, let's go in!” Bai Xiaofei turned around, leading the way to the Demon of Illusions under the gaze of the four.</p>
