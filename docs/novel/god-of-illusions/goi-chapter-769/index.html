 <p>Chapter 769: Is He Really Just Grandmaster Rank?!</p> 
 <p>Unlike Bai Xiaofei, who couldn’t be more relaxed, Snakehead was pacing outside anxiously. He was worried about Bai Xiaofei’s safety.</p> 
 <p>Of course, it was not the kind of worry for friends. If Bai Xiaofei was killed, his mission would fail and the fee Bai Xiaofei had paid would go into the Mercenary Alliance’s funds.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, Snakehead was in a panic. This matter concerned a hundred thousand Amethyst Coins!</p> 
 <p>To Snakehead’s shock, however, not only did Bai Xiaofei come out alive and intact but he was also followed by a respectful Shaman King!</p> 
 <p><em>Am I dreaming? Is that really Shaman King?! How?! And so obedient even! How did he do it?!</em></p> 
 <p>Horrified by all kinds of questions, Snakehead just stood there gawking.</p> 
 <p>“Why are you dazing out? Take me to the next one.” Bai Xiaofei went to Snakehead and patted his shoulder.</p> 
 <p>His soul back in his body, Snakehead wiped his face and the gears in his head started turning again. After ten seconds, he finally recalled what he needed to do.</p> 
 <p>“Who are we looking for next?” asked Snakehead respectfully while his eyes couldn’t help but dart to Shaman King. Seeing the old man’s skeleton-like appearance and feeling his unique icy aura, Snakehead once again confirmed that he was Shaman King, the famous Exquisite Rank puppet master!</p> 
 <p>“Blood Wolf,” replied Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Snakehead immediately started moving.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Shaman King was stunned. <em>I’m not his only target?!</em></p> 
 <p>Pressing down the shock in his heart, Shaman King stepped closer to Bai Xiaofei. “Young Master, with all due respect, are you going to Blood Wolf for…”</p> 
 <p>He stopped in the middle of his words, but that was enough.</p> 
 <p>“Is there any problem?” Bai Xiaofei did not deny it and asked back with a smile.</p> 
 <p>“Young Master, I’m not good in one versus one situations and my abilities are restrained by yours, but Blood Wolf is different. He has grasped Divine Beast Transformation and the Grandmaster Rank’s five abilities to near perfection. Even with both of us together, our chances of winning are still very low…” Shaman King voiced his concern.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s expression didn’t change in the slightest. He waved his hand. “Don’t worry, you won’t even have to do anything.”</p> 
 <p>Just like that, the group quietly followed Snakehead toward Blood Wolf’s residence. Shaman King didn’t speak again, but his feelings kept fluctuating as he looked at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p><em>Was it just a whim that he came to me first, and not that he knew his abilities can restrain me?! Just what kind of puppet master is he? How can a Grandmaster Rank have this kind of power?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Could it be that he’s hiding his real strength?!</em></p> 
 <p>Bothered by all kinds of doubts, Shaman King found himself completely puzzled by this sudden young master. However, following him was his only choice.</p> 
 <p>Moreover, he was actually faintly looking forward to seeing Bai Xiaofei ‘bully’ Blood Wolf, because it would prove that he, Shaman King, was not weak but that Bai Xiaofei was just too perverse!</p> 
 <p>Snakehead didn’t keep Shaman King waiting for long as he soon led everyone to Blood Wolf’s house. Fortunately, Blood Wolf had also stayed home today.</p> 
 <p>However, unlike Shaman King, he was fighting with his old friend, and this old friend was also one of Bai Xiaofei’s targets – Strong Steel!</p> 
 <p>“Young Master, the one who Blood Wolf is fighting is Strong Steel. Among the four of us, their relationship has always been very good. If you fight Blood Wolf, Strong Steel will not sit idly by,” explained Shaman King, who followed Bai Xiaofei in while Snakehead remained outside.</p> 
 <p>“That’s great, saves me a trip,” Bai Xiaofei’s reply rendered Shaman King speechless.</p> 
 <p><em>Oh my great young master! Just what kind of trouble do you want to stir up?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Shaman King, we have always minded our own business.” Seeing Shaman King, Blood Wolf and Strong Steel immediately stopped their spar and nervously looked at the sudden visitors.</p> 
 <p>Although Bai Xiaofei was at the front, it was just impossible to regard him highly given his energy fluctuation was only that of Grandmaster Rank.</p> 
 <p>“Are you two blind? Can’t you see our young master?!” Before Shaman King could answer, Rui Mengqi’s arrogant voice was like a bolt from the blue.</p> 
 <p>“You’re seeking death!” Blood Wolf flew into a rage. A blood-red light flashed on his body as he activated his puppet and he shot towards Rui Mengqi.</p> 
 <p>Rui Mengqi quietly stood still, having no plans to dodge. However, Blood Wolf couldn’t avenge himself from being ‘insulted’ as Bai Xiaofei, who had spiritualized with Blackie, suddenly appeared in his path. As he launched Virtual Reality, a poisonous fog spread and alarmed Blood Wolf, who immediately retreated.</p> 
 <p>“I’m your opponent… No, I’m both your opponent.” Bai Xiaofei smiled as his eyes swept over Blood Wolf and Strong Steel. “My apologies, I haven’t explained my intention yet. I’m here to accept you two as my underlings.”</p> 
 <p>After Bai Xiaofei finished, Blood Wolf and Strong Steel were first stunned, and then burst out laughing.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this scene, Shaman King’s heart was filled with emotions. <em>Oh, how familiar this is!</em></p> 
 <p>“Brat, if you want to die, just say it, this grandpa will fulfill your wish!”</p> 
 <p>Gritting his teeth in extreme fury, Blood Wolf’s aura soared and his body kept flashing with lights that indicated the activation of puppets.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll let you see my Divine Beast Transformation, so consider your death worthy!” saying this, Blood Wolf transformed into a giant wolf with blood-red hair, emitting a steaming breath from the boiling blood in his body.</p> 
 <p>Blood-Devour Wolf King!</p> 
 <p>“What a formidable Divine Beast Transformation you have. I’ll let you see mine.” Bai Xiaofei chuckled. Then, his aura also changed. Moments later, a Blood-Devour Wolf King at least twice as big as Blood Wolf appeared in front of everyone.</p> 
 <p>This was an ability of Virtual Reality, enhanced simulation!</p> 
 <p>“Illusion Stream?!” Shaman King and Strong Steel exclaimed in unison, then shook their heads. A Grandmaster Rank Illusion Stream finding an Exquisite Rank Transformation Stream for trouble was no different than seeking death!</p> 
 <p><em>But wait, the aura he exudes is exactly the same?!</em></p> 
 <p>Full of curiosity, Shaman King and Strong Steel watched closely. From the bottom of their hearts, they refused to believe that Bai Xiaofei had the ability to defeat Blood Wolf.</p> 
 <p>However, the result slapped their faces. After the two wolves collided, the smaller one was sent flying as his energy was absorbed the moment he touched Bai Xiaofei who had Endless State activated. Moreover, a golden flame around Bai Xiaofei’s body nearly cooked him!</p> 
 <p>To top everything off, his raw strength also lost to Bai Xiaofei!</p> 
 <p><em>Is he really just Grandmaster Rank?!</em></p>
