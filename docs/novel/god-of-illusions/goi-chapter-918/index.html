 <p>Chapter 918: The People!</p> 
 <p>“You’re finally here. Do you have anyone who’s good at treatment? Many people here will go cold if they don’t get treated quickly,” said Tan Xin, looking completely fine… if it wasn’t for her wobbling stance…</p> 
 <p>Ling Yue hurriedly supported her, his face apologetic. If it wasn’t for Ethereal, neither Bai Xiaofei nor she would need to risk their lives. Under Tan Xin’s protection, the casualties had been brought down to a minimum. To this end, she took at least a hundred human puppets’ self-detonation head-on!</p> 
 <p>She had really tried her best to hold out until Ling Yue’s group arrived.</p> 
 <p>“Xiaofei was the first to run out, but I haven’t seen him until now. He must be in trouble. And I’m sure he’s here somewhere,” Tan Xin weakly informed Ling Yue.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, just leave it to us!” Ling Yue nodded at once. The only thing he could do at the moment was not to disappoint their efforts!</p> 
 <p>“Your Majesty, you being able to come here is already the best thing that an emperor can do. Please leave it to us from here on and believe in us! We are the best soldiers of the empire!” General Pang stopped Ling Yue before he could rush out.</p> 
 <p>As a former commander under Ling Yue, General Pang knew his ability very well. He had to burn his vitality again if he wanted to fight, which was not what a wise emperor should do.</p> 
 <p>“Men of Ethereal, you are now the empire’s hope. People can die, but the soul of Ethereal cannot fall!” shouted General Pang as he stepped forward. His origin energy surged, and the signal of vitality burning coated his armor with a golden light.</p> 
 <p>Following General Pang, the team of thirty elites made the same choice: they also burned their vitality!</p> 
 <p>Faced with a steady stream of human puppets, this was the only way they could gain some advantage. They were ready to fight until the last drop of their life!</p> 
 <p>Amidst the sounds of fighting that filled the hall, the puppetsmiths were led to gather at a new place under protection. After all, thirty soldiers could do more things than a single Tan Xin could.</p> 
 <p>However, Ling Yue was occupied by his top priority. <em>Where is Bai Xiaofei?!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was extremely uncomfortable at the moment!</p> 
 <p>“How long are we going to stay like this?!” he asked the person in front of him, feeling every second a torment being clueless to what was happening outside.</p> 
 <p>He had been completely isolated by this person, who was, unexpectedly, also an Illusion Stream puppet master!</p> 
 <p>This person had used his ability right before the finale of the auction, so Bai Xiaofei had felt something was wrong at that time as he had only used his ability within this person’s illusion. He then quickly located and teleported to the mastermind.</p> 
 <p>In fact, the person had deliberately let Bai Xiaofei find him in order to launch his second puppet – Cage!</p> 
 <p>This was quite a ridiculous puppet because once used, it would seal both the target and its owner at the same time, disabling their abilities and origin energy. Even the moment the affected thought of attacking, they would instantly lose touch with their five senses!</p> 
 <p>The idea of being trapped by illusions had really not once occurred to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, although this ability is a little too formidable, it has a time limit. You’ll be able to get out soon. However, by then the situation will have reached a state that even you’d be helpless,” taunted the person smugly.</p> 
 <p>“Well, how about we make a bet?” Bai Xiaofei asked.</p> 
 <p>“Oh? Bet what? Or to say, what do you have to wager? It’s not like you’re having an advantage!” The person’s interest was piqued, but he didn’t fall for it. With a light response, the person in front of Bai Xiaofei explained with practical action what was meant by watertight.</p> 
 <p>“Bet I can guess your purpose. If I guess right, you let me out. If I guess wrong, I will leave Ethereal immediately and stop interfering with anything that happens here!” Bai Xiaofei said firmly. This time, he was really betting!</p> 
 <p>“That’s an attractive bet, but unfortunately, I’m not interested. You don’t need to guess at all, I can just tell you what you’ll have to face.”</p> 
 <p>Slowly, the person entered the role of the narrator, a role that Bai Xiaofei always played!</p> 
 <p>“We used the auction to gather the majority of the Holy Mountain’s puppetsmiths to destroy its younger generation as well as its backbone, at the same time putting Ethereal into crisis, making them suffer losses while also bearing the pressure from the whole continent. Conveniently, we will rob this empire of the pride and hope of its people!”</p> 
 <p>His tone laced with zeal, the person seemed to have nearly lost his sanity. Like Bai Xiaofei, he enjoyed the process of explaining his plot, but the difference was that he was morbid and couldn’t wait to express himself for fear that the world wouldn’t see his ability.</p> 
 <p>However, sometimes reality didn’t go as one planned.</p> 
 <p>“Then you may be disappointed. First of all, I can assure you that the majority of the smiths outside are safe. Secondly, those human puppets may be troublesome, but not impossible to resolve. Considering Ethereal’s influence in the Northern Borders, as long as they completely eliminate the human puppets, this crisis will pass. As for your last point, that’s just impossible to achieve. You look down on the people of Ethereal too much.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei smiled and sat back down, no longer seeming anxious as he continued, “Actually, you got the most important point wrong.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the person frowned. “What do you mean?”</p> 
 <p>“Nothing, just telling you that the people of Ethereal will give you a very vivid lesson, one that thoroughly educates your whole Shadow Death!”</p> 
 <p>Although the person never said the organization he belonged to, there was only Shadow Death currently trying to cause trouble in Ethereal. However, as Bai Xiaofei had said, they chose the wrong target. The people of Ethereal were exactly the kind that they couldn’t handle!</p> 
 <p>The values that Shadow Death abandoned were what Ethereal most cherished, so the thinking of Ethereal people was something that Shadow Death would never be able to understand. In other words, Ethereal would never act according to their plot!</p>
