 <p>Chapter 864: Shi Kui!</p> 
 <p>“But let’s take it slow. I haven’t even figured out a single thing about this place yet.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was not infected by Golden Feather’s excitement, even though he could hear that this so-called Fire Separation Formation was nothing simple.</p> 
 <p>“I was too anxious. In any case, you have to find an opportunity to go to the formation core. Once we get there, I will be able to improve your physical quality and perhaps even solve your body’s problem.” Golden Feather’s voice was extremely serious.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s eyes lit up. <em>Oh, to fail over and over again looking for a solution, only to run into it by chance! Will this frustrating problem of mine finally be solved here?!</em></p> 
 <p>His rationality gone with the wind, Bai Xiaofei could not remain calm at all when it concerned his fatal weakness.</p> 
 <p>“Mister Bai? What’s wrong?” Bai Xing could not help but be confused by Bai Xiaofei’s rapid changes in expression.</p> 
 <p>“Ah! Just… This place is a bit beyond my imagination.” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly made up a reason.</p> 
 <p>“Understandable. The two of us were shocked when we first came here as well. This is really a great place for puppet masters,” said Bai Yue with delight.</p> 
 <p>“For puppet masters?” Bai Xiaofei frowned in confusion. <em>Is this not a holy land for puppetsmiths?</em></p> 
 <p>“On the premise that you have a high-ranked smith who is willing to refine a puppet for you,” Bai Yue elaborated.</p> 
 <p>“Tailor-made puppet, huh…?” Bai Xiaofei murmured as he recalled Lin Li’s Thousand Stars, which was the first tailor-made puppet that he came into contact with. However, Feng Wuhen had ordered it tailored-made for Lin Nishang, and Lin Li picked up a bargain being her daughter.</p> 
 <p>“Do you have a request? As members of the Moon Beck Pavilion, we have a chance to order a tailor-made puppet every time we rank up. I happen to have just advanced. If you need it, you can have my chance,” said Bai Xing sincerely, as if she didn’t care about this precious opportunity at all.</p> 
 <p>“No need, really. I have no plans to link a new puppet in the near future,” Bai Xiaofei decisively turned down her offer. He could not afford to owe such a favor. Moreover, he did not think he would lack that kind of opportunity here. Out of the five great divine smiths, he reckoned he had some sort of connections with at least one or two!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei felt smug as he started to look forward to this visit. At that moment, a familiar voice rang out.</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother Fei! It’s really you!”</p> 
 <p>Looking in the direction of the loud voice, everyone saw a half-naked, bronze-skinned Shi Kui fast approach in excitement. With his speed, he could certainly headbutt Bai Xiaofei to death!</p> 
 <p>“Gold Wire!”</p> 
 <p>At that critical moment, Bai Xiaofei decisively opened his puppet space. Without showing up, Golden Feather shot out a gold thread and tightly bound Shi Kui, who fell and rolled to Bai Xiaofei’s feet.</p> 
 <p>Looking at Shi Kui, who was still screaming excitedly despite his situation, Bai Xiaofei heaved a sigh of relief. Meanwhile, Bai Xing and Bai Yue had been stunned silly.</p> 
 <p><em>They know each other, right? Why would he do that?</em></p> 
 <p>The two girls felt that their brain cells weren’t enough to comprehend, but they could see Bai Xiaofei’s smug expression.</p> 
 <p>However…</p> 
 <p>“Let go of Brother Shi Kui!!!”</p> 
 <p>At the moment Bai Xiaofei was about to release Shi Kui, a clear and crisp voice echoed. The next second, a blurry figure rammed straight at Bai Xiaofei without giving him any time to react. He only felt a sharp pain in his stomach right before he was sent flying.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei hurriedly unfurled his purple wings and stabilized his body, but the figure had no intention to stop at all. It shot toward him again.</p> 
 <p>Feeling the hostility from the strange figure, Bai Xiaofei became completely serious. As he concentrated his spirit, he gradually saw clearer. However, by only a little bit…</p> 
 <p>With a rumble, Bai Xiaofei was blasted into the air like a bullet, and his body spun completely out of control!</p> 
 <p><em>Terrifying speed, and terrifying power! Who on earth is this?!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Spiritualize!!” Bai Xiaofei used his ultimate card upon realizing that it was impossible to keep up with the figure’s speed.</p> 
 <p>The purple wings slowly melted into his body and transformed him as the many characteristics of Goldclaw Luan appeared, and one of the strongest characteristics was speed!</p> 
 <p>Feeling his speed rise along with his reaction speed, Bai Xiaofei finally saw the person who attacked him. It was a girl with a ponytail who looked only seventeen or eighteen!</p> 
 <p>Moreover, she was not using any puppets. In other words, this young girl was a martial artist!!</p> 
 <p>A seventeen or eighteen-year-old martial artist who could hammer Bai Xiaofei!!!</p> 
 <p><em>Is this the legendary ‘there’s always a mountain higher?!’ Why didn’t this kind of BUG go to Starnet Academy??</em></p> 
 <p>Despite his astonishment, Bai Xiaofei was not slow to react. Leveling his speed with the girl’s, he wanted to fly to Shi Kui and untie him. After all, this girl only wanted to protect Shi Kui…</p> 
 <p>“Don’t go near Brother Shi Kui!” The girl suddenly erupted again. A red glow enveloped her and her speed soared to a new level!</p> 
 <p><em>She can be even faster?!!!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei, who was beaten flying again while having 80% of the speed of an Emperor Rank Goldclaw Luan, felt that his worldview had been overturned!</p> 
 <p><em>What kind of martial artist is this?! Did you start training when you were still in your mother’s womb?!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Near Brother Shi Kui again and you will die!!!” Standing guard in front of Shi Kui, the girl’s expression was extremely serious.</p> 
 <p>At that moment, Shi Kui whined her name. Turning around, the young girl squatted down. What she did next shocked Bai Xiaofei silly.</p> 
 <p>Reaching out, she snapped Golden Feather’s gold thread, bare-handedly!</p> 
 <p>This time, not only Bai Xiaofei, but Golden Feather also froze. The gold thread was transformed from her feather melted with her golden flame, but it was something that a pair of bare hands should not be able to break easily!</p> 
 <p><em>What the hell is this girl?!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Ran’er, you misunderstood. Brother Fei is my boss and one of my own. It was my fault just now…” Shi Kui uttered.</p> 
 <p>Stunned for half a second, the young girl then retracted the red glow on her body and turned into a meek kitten.</p> 
 <p>“I’m sorry, Brother Shi Kui. I overreacted…” The girl twiddled her fingers together, looking completely different than the monster set on destroying Bai Xiaofei just now.</p> 
 <p>“It’s okay, Brother Fei will understand. He is very magnanimous.” Shi Kui then yelled, “Big Brother Fei, come down quickly! Let me introduce you two!”</p> 
 <p>Recovering from doubting life, Bai Xiaofei descended and was greeted with the young girl’s apologetic expression.</p> 
 <p>“Yan Ran’er, my junior sister,” Shi Kui introduced. “This is Big Brother Fei, the one who I often tell you about, the super invincible one.”</p> 
 <p>Looking at the proud Shi Kui, Bai Xiaofei knew that it was not necessary to ask how the guy was doing. He was clearly in high spirits…</p> 
 <p>“Nice to meet you, Big Brother Bai. Ran’er was wrong just now, I hope Big Brother Fei will forgive me.” Ran’er’s soft voice and gentle appearance made people completely unable to imagine what she did just now…</p> 
 <p>“It’s fine, it was also partly my fault.” Bai Xiaofei coughed to hide his embarrassment.</p> 
 <p>“Huh? If I’m not mistaken, these two pretty sisters are from the Moon Beck Pavilion?” Shi Kui said after quietly observing Bai Xing and Bai Yue for a while. The implicative tone made Bai Xiaofei shudder.</p> 
 <p>“Quit it with your wild thoughts. Xing’er and Yue’er are our Starnet senior sisters. We just happened to bump into each other,” explained Bai Xiaofei seriously.</p> 
 <p>However, hearing the intimate address, Shi Kui’s ill-intentioned smile deepened. “Alright, I understand, that’s Big Brother Fei for you.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei recalled Shi Kui’s words and changed the subject, “Say, your master is…” Since Shi Kui had such a terrifying senior sister, he was curious about their teacher.</p> 
 <p>“Ahem, Big Brother Fei, prepare yourself and don’t be too surprised after I tell you.” Shi Kui cleared his throat only to follow with a bunch of gibberish. Seeing Bai Xiaofei’s cold expression, he hurriedly got to the point, “The number one of the five divine smiths, Pinocchio!”</p> 
 <p>This time, he really surprised Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p><em>The First Godsmith… accepts disciples so casually…?</em></p> 
 <p>“Are you some kind of hidden magnate? Did you just slap money on them after you got here?” Gulping, Bai Xiaofei looked at Shi Kui suspiciously, but no matter how he looked, this fellow was nothing like a rich person at all.</p> 
 <p>“Not to mention a magnate, even the richest person in this world can’t use money to buy my master! As for why I was chosen? Maybe because I am too outstanding!” Shi Kui burst out laughing.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei knuckled his forehead. “Tell the truth!”</p>
