 <p>Chapter 396: Chaos!</p> 
 <p>After the discussion with Gu Heng finished, more people approached Bai Xiaofei, but no one ever mentioned the Thunderstorm Bandits. It seemed that all they cared about was the Feature Locking Pill. Or, even if someone wanted to talk about the bandits, they didn’t have the courage to…</p> 
 <p>As the day proceeded into night and the crowd had gotten past the peak of enthusiasm for chatting, Bai Xiaofei stood up. For that moment, everyone was expectant.</p> 
 <p>Needless to say, the Feature Locking Pill was coming!</p> 
 <p>Sure enough, under the intent gaze of all, a delicate bottle appeared in Bai Xiaofei’s hand. Upon the sight of this bottle, there was a collective sound of gasps.</p> 
 <p>A glass bottle! The kind made especially for storing Feature Locking Pills!</p> 
 <p>“I bet you all can’t wait. Just a moment ago, more than one came to ask me about the Feature Locking Pill. Seems like the ladies present have put a lot of pressure on their male partners, huh? Please try not to do so in the future, ladies, your man doesn’t have it easy,” teased Bai Xiaofei with a smile.</p> 
 <p>The women blushed red while the men sent grateful looks to Bai Xiaofei. Those were the words they never had the guts to say, or else what came next would be a martial art movie on family drama…</p> 
 <p>“Well then, I will not keep you hanging. I’ll explain to you how this Feature Locking Pill will find its owner tonight!”</p> 
 <p>As soon as his voice fell, the errand boys of the Bright Road Merchant House came along wheeling in an intricately decorated box.</p> 
 <p>“There are a total of 100 lots in this box, but there is only one that with ‘Feature Locking Pill’ written on it. Every lady present can draw one lot. Whoever is the lucky one to draw the winning lot takes the pill!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, everyone exclaimed in surprise. <em>Isn’t this a little… sloppy?</em></p> 
 <p>At second thought, though, this was an absolutely equal method, minus the matter of order at most. Thinking this, everyone turned towards Imperial Concubine Qing. There was no suspense that the first person to draw lots was going to be. No one would dare to come up until she did.</p> 
 <p>“That’s too simple. Aren’t you afraid someone is going to cheat? The ability of puppet masters is all-inclusive,” asked Imperial Concubine Qing as if she was worried she would be wronged.</p> 
 <p>“This box is made of special materials that allow it to completely isolate origin and spiritual energy. Each lot is personally written by myself. Before it was brought in, the box had been kept under my guard, and no one except me has the key to open it.” Bai Xiaofei paused a little and returned the imperial concubine’s gaze. “So Your Highness can rest assured that the box will have no problems.”</p> 
 <p>Finishing his words, Bai Xiaofei made an inviting gesture. Under everyone’s gaze, Imperial Concubine Qing slowly walked toward the box.</p> 
 <p>“That’s what you’ve said. If something happens when I draw lots, you will be responsible.” Imperial Concubine Qing slowly reached into the box with a smile. At that moment, for some reason, Bai Xiaofei’s heart suddenly tightened.</p> 
 <p>The next second, five royal guards in the banquet hall fell to the ground at the same time and started to twitch intensely! Then, all the lights went out, and those who went up to check the guards suddenly screamed.</p> 
 <p>“Protect the princes and Imperial Concubine!” shouted Shang Youdao in the dark. Right after that, there were sounds of explosions and weapons colliding.</p> 
 <p>“Woof woof!” Huskie suddenly barked like crazy.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei, feeling a chill running down his spine, instinctively bent back before a sharp pain came from the palm of his hand. Enduring the pain, he grasped the long sword that had cut his hand and yanked it, and a body bumped into him. Without any delay, his left arm wrapped around the attacker’s neck and twisted it. A crack sound rang as the person in his arm limply collapsed.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, Shang Youdao threw out eight glowing balls in Bai Xiaofei’s direction. In the light, Bai Xiaofei just saw a guard shakingly hacking his blade at a shocked Imperial Concubine Qing.</p> 
 <p>“Lower your head!” yelled Bai Xiaofei at the top of his lungs. He immediately rushed at the guard, raising his left arm to block the blade while kicking the guard’s chest. At the same time, Blackie bolted past and its sharp claws slit the guard’s throat.</p> 
 <p>In the next moments, more and more people threw out the illuminating objects, and the banquet hall was lit again. Subsequently, the remaining three guards were also taken down one after another.</p> 
 <p>When their senses returned, the terrified nobles looked around, afraid that there would be more unknown attacks. During the chaos, three guards and two nobles were killed, while seven or eight were injured. Bai Xiaofei’s left arm was nearly chopped off, the blood flowing out dying half of his body red.</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness, are you all right?” Enduring the pain, Bai Xiaofei walked toward Imperial Concubine Qing. The rest of the guards hurriedly over and surrounded her alertly.</p> 
 <p>“Stand down, I’m fine.” Imperial Concubine Qing’s face had turned pale white, but her tone still retained her majesty as she ordered the guards. Tearing off a long cloth strip off her skirt, she bandaged Bai Xiaofei’s arm before hurriedly taking out a pill. “Eat this.”</p> 
 <p>The thick fragrance from the pill clearly identified its value – a grade-five Vitality Pill! Although it couldn’t compare to the Rebirth Pill, the Vitality Pill was a rare panacea for physical injuries.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei took the pill. With the combination of his abnormal physique and the medicine, the wound on his left arm recovered at a speed visible to the naked eye. This incomprehensible scene naturally didn’t escape the eyes of Imperial Concubine Qing. Startled, she wiped the sweat on her forehead and looked up at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Are you all right?” The tension in her voice was extremely out of place with her status. In a daze, Bai Xiaofei almost mistook the person in front of him for someone else.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you, Your Highness, it’s no big deal.”</p> 
 <p>During the few seconds Bai Xiaofei said this, the wound under the bandage had been completely healed, only that no one could tell.</p> 
 <p>By now, the situation was under control, and the five people who signaled the attack were completely surrounded. The rest were controlled by the guards. Everyone’s eyes on them weren’t of trust and peace of mind, but full of vigilance.</p> 
 <p>“No one can leave. The royal troops will conduct an interrogation!” The voice of the garrison commander echoed loudly, putting a stop on the disaster.</p> 
 <p>At this point, Shang Youdao’s heart was frozen cold.</p> 
 <p><em>It’s over, I’m really done for…</em></p>
