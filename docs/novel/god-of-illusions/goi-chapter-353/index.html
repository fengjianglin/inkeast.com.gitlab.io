 <p>Chapter 353: Please Remember Them!</p> 
 <p>“The 200 participants who are leaving this competition have already been decided. However, no matter which of these 500 girls fail to pass this hurdle, I hope all of you here will not have any negative judgment towards them! Everyone on the stage is already outstanding, unable to take a step further is not because they haven’t worked hard. Therefore, I hope that you will be understanding. If possible, I want to hear you confirm this. Here, I thank you in advance.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei bowed deeply to all the audience and did not rise for a long time.</p> 
 <p>Looking at his bent back, the girls’ eyes turned red, and many even shed tears.</p> 
 <p>In fact, Bai Xiaofei didn’t have to do this, because those who failed the first round were likely to have nothing to do with him in their lives. In other words, he was doing all this for complete strangers. It might be too harsh to say so, but this was an indisputable fact.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was not some holy saint, but he could not maintain a heart of stone either. These girls had gathered because of him. Maybe they all had their own ideas, but no one could deny that their efforts had brought him considerable benefits!</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, someone had stood up from their seat in the audience. After the first one was the second, the third… Finally, the countless spectators around the square stood up at the same time and did the same thing as Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>No need for any shouting, this silence said everything that needed to be said!</p> 
 <p>In the end, Bai Xiaofei announced the list, but perhaps what he did took effect because the 200 eliminated girls didn’t feel too dejected. Instead, they used their own positive methods to bid farewell to those who had been both their friends and rivals, who they had fought together for a month.</p> 
 <p>There was almost no one who didn't cry. Women were all made of water, the kind that would flood uncontrollably by a little touch at that…</p> 
 <p>Lin Li was definitely the one who responded most vehemently, crying her eyes out. At the same time, she was also surrounded by the most people. This girl who would never hide her true feelings had been remembered by everyone, and what Bai Xiaofei noticed was that she had grown up again. She was no longer that honest and simple girl who didn’t have any facial expressions, but a normal person who was full of emotions, who would cry and laugh!</p> 
 <p>After the audience left, the 500 girls on the stage also finished their farewells. However, they did not disperse yet because Bai Xiaofei stopped them.</p> 
 <p>“Thanks are not just words, you know. The carnival starts now!” At his words, the whole square began to change dramatically utilizing the power of the formation. “Tonight’s theme is a field bonfire party! Thank you all for your efforts over the past month!”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Bai Xiaofei said this, helpers from the Babel Merchant House and the Amethyst Merchant House poured in, piling up all kinds of high-grade ingredients everywhere. The Thousand Aroma Restaurant even provided several barbecue masters to act as fixed supply points, but many girls chose to do the grilling themselves.</p> 
 <p>In addition, the Crystal’s Longing that Bai Xiaofei asked Shangguan Fan to help him buy had piled up into small mountains. Many girls finally got to eat this legendary fruit for the first time. There was no need to even say anything about the drinks, they were all fine goods from the Multihouse. In short, as long as something was available to buy, Bai Xiaofei wasn’t stingy at all!</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye roughly estimated that Bai Xiaofei spent at least five million Amethyst Coins to organize this bonfire party. Put anywhere, this would definitely be a local-tyrant level party, and when it came from the super miserly Bai Xiaofei, the degree of preciousness of this party was definitely epic.</p> 
 <p>This evening, Bai Xiaofei didn’t stop for a moment. The girls called him out for toast one after another, telling him that he must remember their names.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei really found himself unable to. What’s more, he also dared not to act presumptuously… The whole night, there were always a few pairs of eyes that didn’t leave him for a long time, so Bai Xiaofei didn’t even dare to have any stray actions…</p> 
 <p>After an all-night carnival, Bai Xiaofei and the boys of the Savage Class stayed and guarded. Many girls were dead drunk and Bai Xiaofei didn’t know where they stayed, so there was no other way but to guard them.</p> 
 <p>As for good news, there were some after Bai Xiaofei did his best to promote his own people. Except for the dull-witted Chen Hui, the rest of the animals in the Savage Class had succeeded in getting ‘acquainted’ and should soon be lucky enough to leave the single dog team. It could be said that they didn’t fail Bai Xiaofei’s good intentions.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei’s own affair had turned into a tangled mess. While what happened with Lin Li was still within control, he didn’t know how to face Chu Liuyun…</p> 
 <p>In fact, he had originally planned to announce his relationship with Hu Xian’er at the end of the performance round, but after Chu Liuyun and Lin Li got involved, he had to give up the idea. He was afraid of hurting them. Of course, what had happened already had happened, but if he confessed to another girl right after they had expressed their feelings for him in front of so many people, the damage was likely to be magnified to unacceptable levels.</p> 
 <p>“Being hesitant like this is not like you, Bai Xiaofei.”</p> 
 <p>Seeing Bai Xiaofei sitting in the square and sighing after sending off everyone, the only one who still remained – Hu Xian’er – quietly sat down beside him.</p> 
 <p>“Ehh… You know what I’m struggling with?” With a face full of embarrassment, Bai Xiaofei, who didn’t know how to respond to those words, asked a brain-dead question…</p> 
 <p><em>Aren’t you jumping to your own death by mentioning this?!</em></p> 
 <p>But fortunately, Hu Xian’er wasn’t here to ‘kill’ him.</p> 
 <p>“Seeing you being able to attract so many flowers, I’ll be having plenty of troubles in the future if I don’t know what you’re worried about.”</p> 
 <p>Checkmate in just a sentence.</p> 
 <p>There was no way to answer this! If Bai Xiaofei admitted it, it would be the same as saying he did it intentionally. If he didn’t, that would be trying to make excuses!</p> 
 <p>Every answer led to death, so Bai Xiaofei chose silence. After all, he was still confused with himself.</p> 
 <p>He didn’t want to let Hu Xian’er down, but when facing the other girls, he just couldn’t help it. The feeling of wanting to get close was every man’s instinct, but Bai Xiaofei’s rational mind told him that this instinct was wrong!</p> 
 <p>To put it frankly, his character hadn’t been fully shaped yet.</p> 
 <p>If it was Revelation in Bai Xiaofei’s shoes, the old man would definitely accept everything without hesitation. He wouldn’t care so much. Meanwhile, if it was Liuxia Hui<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>, the guy would definitely draw a line with all other girls in the first place.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei had not yet reached the level of either of those two, and his hesitation was completely understandable for a boy of his current age.</p> 
 <p>If he neither accepted nor refused and just sat on the fence, he’d be a scumbag. However, Bai Xiaofei rejected this judgment about himself in his heart. He felt that he was not that kind of person.</p> 
 <p>Similarly, Hu Xian’er also thought that he wasn’t that kind of person.</p> 
 <p>“Or you can eat it all.”</p> 
 <p>With a smile, Hu Xian’er dropped a ground-breaking sentence…</p>
