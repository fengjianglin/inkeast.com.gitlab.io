 <p>Chapter 808: Faith!</p> 
 <p>“Keep him alive!” shouted Bai Xiaofei as the last survivor of the enemy party struggled to accept what was happening in front of him.</p> 
 <p>The latter was startled awake by his shout. Knowing resistance was impossible as he was alone against a whole group of people, the only choice was to run!</p> 
 <p>Before the poor guy could move his legs, however, a ghostly Wang Hang appeared behind him. </p> 
 <p>“You are too slow.”</p> 
 <p>“Get o…”</p> 
 <p>Before the man could finish his words, Wang Hang chopped down with his palm and he collapsed unconscious.</p> 
 <p>“Xian’er, Brother Linfeng, don’t drop your guard.” Bai Xiaofei said and ran to Wang Hang, then looked at Tan Xin who closely followed him. “All yours.”</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin immediately looked proud. “No worries, this is nothing,” she said and placed her little hand on the head of the unconscious man.</p> 
 <p>The man’s face then twisted a little in pain but he did not wake up from his coma. As the pain gradually heightened, he started to convulse… When Tan Xin finally stopped, the man had stopped moving altogether, only his white rolling eyes divulged the pain he had just undergone.</p> 
 <p>Everyone turned their focus to Tan Xin, who had just gained the information she wanted directly from the victim’s mind. On her often expressionless face, this time her eyes were bulging and her mouth agape as if she had just seen something shocking.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter?!” Bai Xiaofei instantly tensed up.</p> 
 <p>“See for yourself.” Gulping, Xin slowly placed her palm on Bai Xiaofei’s forehead as he squatted down.</p> 
 <p>The expression on his face then turned from nervous to surprise and finally, burning with anger. After Tan Xin took her hand away, his face was completely engulfed in unprecedented fury.</p> 
 <p>“After we go in, do not spare anyone that moves!” The frost in Bai Xiaofei’s voice made all the people familiar with him shudder. He wasn’t like this even when facing Ling Tianxia.</p> 
 <p>“The people inside should be ready to ’welcome’ us. Enter with caution.” Tan Xin was the only one who knew what made Bai Xiaofei furious and also what was inside. The situation was hard to describe in words, the rest needed to go in and see for themselves.</p> 
 <p>With that warning, Tan Xin walked to a clearing and raised a hand. The ground slowly cracked open a gap, revealing a staircase leading down. At the same time, a chokingly strong stench of blood gushed out. Everyone felt as if they were being soaked in a sea of blood.</p> 
 <p>“The mastermind behind this all should be arriving soon. Before that, we shall make a big mess out of this place!” Although his anger had reached its peak, Bai Xiaofei had not forgotten the plan.</p> 
 <p>Walking down the stairs, everyone’s nerves were stretched to their extreme. No one spoke because from the moment they walked down, they felt an extremely oppressive atmosphere!</p> 
 <p>“Something is coming!” alerted Tan Xin halfway through. An energy fluctuation spread out from her and formed a wall of air in front of the group. The next second, they saw a herd of blood-soaked rats surging at them one after another and crashed into the air wall.</p> 
 <p>“Blood Burn Rats?! How can this thing breed to such a large number?!!” Wang Hang couldn’t help an exclamation after seeing the appearance of a large mouse plastered on the air wall.</p> 
 <p>Rat-type magical beasts were typically gregarious, but the Blood Burn Rats were a rare exception since they needed to consume a lot of blood to survive. When their living conditions failed to provide for this need, they would bare their fangs at their own kind.</p> 
 <p>Under normal circumstances, Blood Burn Rats were inferior to even ordinary low-rank magical beasts. However, once given enough blood, their strength could improve without limit. They were a type of rankless magical beasts, either extremely weak or extremely strong!</p> 
 <p>At the moment, the herd in front of everyone was obviously nothing but well-fed Blood Burn Rats! Besides, they seemed to be acting upon someone’s command!</p> 
 <p>“Commander Yu, can you work with me?” the quiet Wu Chi suddenly said and took off his shirt. Under a flow of energy, the Earthcore Armor appeared and covered his body and the Martial Goddess’s Bracer emerged on his right hand.</p> 
 <p>As early as when Wu Chi awakened as a puppet master, his Heavenly Origin Physique and the Concentration Pill had laid a good foundation and promoted him directly to the Master Rank. In the past two years, he had crossed the threshold and became a Grandmaster Rank puppet master, a level that countless puppet masters had only dreamed of!</p> 
 <p>“What do I have to do?” Yu Linfeng never looked down upon Wu Chi at all. After the battle just now, he would not look down upon anyone present. Moreover, it was clear from Tan Xin’s appearance that she could not hold on for long.</p> 
 <p>“Make as many wounds on them as possible!” Wu Chi said as the energy in his whole body surged. What he was going to attempt was no small undertaking!</p> 
 <p>“Leave it to me!” agreed Yu Linfeng immediately. He then went to Tan Xin’s side and unsheathed his slender whip sword. “My lord, remove the air wall. I will take it from here!”</p> 
 <p>However, Tan Xin turned to look at Bai Xiaofei. She knew Linfeng’s ability very well. He could definitely block the rats for a while, but it was only for a while.</p> 
 <p>“Go ahead, guys. I want to watch.” Bai Xiaofei smiled and then looked at Wu Chi. “I can stay here and watch, right?!”</p> 
 <p>“Of course! Not one will slip through!” Wu Chi gazed back with a firm declaration. How could he not understand the meaning of Bai Xiaofei’s question?</p> 
 <p>He wanted to cheer for Wu Chi using his own life!</p> 
 <p>It was no laughing matter to stop so many Blood Burn Rats at the same time. Letting one slip through their defense and their group might just be annihilated!</p> 
 <p>“Linfeng, take over!” Getting Bai Xiaofei’s consent, Tan Xin let go of her worries and removed her faltering air wall.</p> 
 <p>“Fleeting Light!”</p> 
 <p>The moment the air wall disappeared, Yu Linfeng’s whip sword burst with a blinding light that covered the entire area. The wielder himself turned into a streak that rapidly shuttled through the rats, creating a light wall made from nothing but sword aura that forced the rats to freeze for half a second!</p> 
 <p>At the same time, Wu Chi revealed a crazed smile.</p> 
 <p>“Blood Sea Vortex!” Wu Chi activated his Blood Demon at full speed.</p> 
 <p>Thanks to Yu Linfeng, thin cuts had appeared on the majority of Blood Burn Rats. Under the influence of Blood Demon, blood gushed out from those wounds and submerged the rat herd in a sea of blood in less than a moment.</p> 
 <p>The next second, Wu Chi turned into a blood shadow and rushed into the sea of blood. The sea of blood then started to spin at a terrifying speed…</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei stood quietly next to the blood sea, watching everything that happened. Just like Wu Chi had promised, not a single rat slipped out.</p> 
 <p>“You guys go first, I need time to handle this blood sea,” Wu Chi’s heavy voice rang out from the blood vortex. At the same time, the blood sea parted and revealed a path.</p> 
 <p>“You…”</p> 
 <p>“City Lord Tan Xin, you can protect our boss, right?” Wu Chi interrupted.</p> 
 <p>With a complicated expression, Tan Xin decided to keep silent.</p> 
 <p>“It’s okay, just leave this to him. We still have some business to do,” saying this, Bai Xiaofei took the lead and proceeded down the stairs. Hu Xian’er and the rest followed.</p> 
 <p>Without any Blood Burn Rats in their way, the following road was extremely smooth, letting the team quickly pass the long stairs. However, Tan Xin finally couldn’t help it.</p> 
 <p>“Just now…”</p> 
 <p>“You think I don’t know? Although I can’t use my energy to check, it’s not the first day I’ve known Wu Chi.” Bai Xiaofei smiled and looked at the dark space ahead of him.</p> 
 <p>“We have things to do, so don’t let his effort be wasted. Moreover, he won’t lose,” said Hu Xian’er as she came to Bai Xiaofei’s side. The two looked at each other with a smile.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Tan Xin revealed a strange expression. In the end, she lowered her head and clenched her fist. No matter how hard it is, I shall succeed!</p> 
 <p>“Light up!” Turning the mental damage she suffered into power, Tan Xin’s energy surged and lit up the dark space.</p> 
 <p>Despite having known from the memory of the man just now what this place was, she was still as shocked as everyone else when seeing it with her own eyes.</p> 
 <p>Bones, bones everywhere! There were even some with fresh blood on them!</p> 
 <p>Looking around, there were several thousands of lives lying here!</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go, we haven’t arrived yet.” Bai Xiaofei was so furious that his body trembled, but he knew this was not yet everything this place held…</p> 
 <p>While the team proceeded along, Wu Chi had been soaked with blood. However, the blood was not just from the rats but also his own. Moreover, his own blood was trying to flow away from him uncontrollably!</p> 
 <p>“I admire your courage. You actually dared to stay behind after discovering what my puppet is.” Standing opposite Wu Chi was a thin man who was drooling like crazy.</p> 
 <p>“It’s exactly because I know that I need to be the one staying behind!” Inhaling a deep breath, Wu Chi laughed. “After all, only the master of a Blood Demon knows how difficult it is to deal with another Blood Demon!” Saying this, Wu Chi swung his hand. The blood around him mixed with his energy to form a long sword. He grasped it and charged forward.</p> 
 <p>“Combined with the power of Blood Demon to execute energy materialization, huh? I’ve never thought of this before, let me thank you for that!” said the thin man who also swung his hand, and a blood sword identical to Wu Chi’s appeared. The man used the sword to parry Wu Chi’s attack. “Come! Let me see how many more surprises you can give me, and then, let me eat you!!”</p> 
 <p>Thus began the first clash of two Blood Demon masters!</p>
