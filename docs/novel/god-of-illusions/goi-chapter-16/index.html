 <p>“Hi! I’m Xu Chen, we’re classmates from now on so please do take care of me.” After arriving before Xue Ying with a large stride, Xu Chen who wore men’s clothes greeted Xue Ying with extreme fervor.</p>
 <p>A total of four people were following behind Xu Chen, and they were the largest group up to this moment.</p>
 <p>“Even though I’m extremely satisfied with this method of address, but I’m the head teacher of this class.” Xue Ying smiled as she spoke words that stunned Xu Chen.</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Teacher, I didn’t do it intentionally. You just looked beautiful and seemed to be about my age, so I thought….” Even though she was extremely nervous, yet Xu Chen didn’t say a single wrong thing, and every single word she said caused Xue Ying to feel exceptionally happy.</p>
 <p>“It’s fine, it’s fine. I understand.” Xue Ying revealed an expression that said ‘you’re promising’ as she patted Xu Chen on the shoulder, and she didn’t forget to glare fiercely at Bai Xiaofei as she did this.</p>
 <p>“What about all of you? What’re your names?” Xue Ying turned around to look at the others behind Xu Chen, and she revealed the air of a head teacher rather sufficiently.</p>
 <p>“Zhu Nuo, Healing Stream puppet master of the Apprentice Rank. I’m from the Ethereal Empire.” The person that spoke was a gentle and frail-looking young woman. Her beige colored dress was covered in dust, and it wasn’t difficult to imagine how much energy she’d exerted to complete the test.</p>
 <p>“I’m Duan Yi’yi….” A voice that was soft like a mosquito’s buzz sounded out. Standing beside Zhu Nuo was a young woman whose entire face flushed red as soon as she spoke, and her ‘loli’ looks and embarrassed personality suited each other to the extreme.</p>
 <p>“Ming One!”</p>
 <p>“Ming Two!”</p>
 <p>Duan Yi’yi had just finished speaking when two young men that looked exactly alike announced their names one after the other.</p>
 <p>“We’re from the Cloudveil Empire.”</p>
 <p>“Defense Stream puppet masters of the Apprentice Rank.”</p>
 <p>The two of them spoke sentence after sentence at just the right timing, and it seemed as if they were deeply afraid others wouldn’t know they were twins.</p>
 <p>“Alright, go in and get familiar with our class. I’ve committed all of you to memory.” After she casually dismissed the five of them, Xue Ying continued to look towards the direction people arrived from, and the satisfaction on her face was completely proportional to the anticipation in her heart.</p>
 <p>It was exactly because of Xue Ying’s existence that Bai Xiaofei seemed to be unneeded, but Bai Xiaofei still had no intention to leave, and it was even to the extent that from a certain extent, Bai Xiaofei’s anticipation wasn’t lower than Xue Ying’s.</p>
 <p>After all, he didn’t have so many peers in the Gorge of Heroes!</p>
 <p>The remaining people were unable to understand the two of them, but they were extremely skilled at guessing….</p>
 <p>“Wifey, do you think our class monitor is interested in our teacher? Otherwise, why doesn’t he complain about being tired.”</p>
 <p>“No, no. Didn’t you see it earlier, she was obviously teasing the class monitor.” As she slapped Xing Nan heavily on the head, Zhu Si’si corrected Xing Nan’s ‘mistake’.</p>
 <p>“Are relationships between students and teachers allowed in the academy?” On the other side, Wu Chi had already directly marked them as lovers.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know. We’re not from here. Who knows what the ways are here. But, our head teacher really is beautiful, that kid really got lucky.” Mo Ka spoke with a trace of a vulgar expression on his face.</p>
 <p>Even Xu Chen’s group of five that had just sat down weren’t sitting there idly, and they started to communicate in a small area while listening to the discussion between Mo Ka and the others.</p>
 <p>To a certain extent, the entrance test was a method that allowed the children from all over to quickly get to know each other.</p>
 <p>But, the new students after Xu Chen’s group of five didn’t come over in the form of a group any longer, and Xue Ying and Bai Xiaofei received another four new students that arrived sporadically.</p>
 <p>Chen Hui that had an ordinary appearance yet seemed extremely serious on first glance, Qi Wei who was a young woman that couldn’t stop talking, and the wealthy Fang Ye who arrived with his little lackey Wang Hang.</p>
 <p>After these few people arrived, Xue Ying and Bai Xiaofei waited for a long time yet the entire commoner's district seemed to have already quieted down, and it seemed like no one else would be coming no matter how they looked at it.</p>
 <p>“15 people, not bad.” As she stretched herself with extreme satisfaction, Xue Ying’s well-proportioned figure was completely revealed before Bai Xiaofei’s eyes.</p>
 <p>“Little pervert, what’re you looking at?” Xue Ying seized the moment Bai Xiaofei wasn’t paying attention to flash over and stand before him, and then she stretched out her hand to raise Bai Xiaofei’s chin.</p>
 <p>For some unknown reason, Xue Ying felt that she seemed to have already become addicted to teasing Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“I'm looking at you, my boundlessly charming Big Sister Xue.” Bai Xiaofei didn’t have the slightest intention of evading her because he’d come around about it while waiting for his other classmates. If he wanted to avoid suffering a loss from Xue Ying, then he had to fully carry out his third father’s theory.</p>
 <p><i>If one encounters an aggressive woman, then so long as you’re even more aggressive than her, you would have won.</i></p>
 <p>“Hmm, you said something proper for once. Come on, we have all the time in the future.” Xue Ying walked into the classroom that was cleaned by Bai Xiaofei as she spoke, and she swept her gaze past all the students that sat obediently at their seats with extreme satisfaction.</p>
 <p>“From today onward, I’ll be your head teacher. But, I prefer all of you calling me Big Sister Xue because I’m not much older than all of you.” Xue Ying struck the table as she started to put on airs as the head teacher.</p>
 <p>“Nice to meet you, Big Sister Xue!” Xu Chen was the first to shout out, and the group of students that came to realization hurriedly repeated what she said.</p>
 <p>“I know that there’re a ton of rumors going around outside, and they say that we’re the Savage Class that only takes defects that no one wants. But!” Her tone suddenly rose an octave, and it successfully shocked everyone present.</p>
 <p>“I hope that all of you don’t underestimate yourselves. It’s only a prep school class, so all of you being weak now doesn’t mean that all of you will be weak forever. I believe that under my lead, out class will surely be able to go against the tide all along the way! We’ll make everyone hold us in high esteem! Tell me, do all of you have the confidence!?” Xue Ying struck the table abruptly and caused everyone to be startled, and it was to the point that all of them forgot what Xue Ying had said.</p>
 <p>For a time, the entire class fell into an extremely awkward silence, and Bai Xiaofei who sat right at the corner had even started laughing.</p>
 <p>“Bai Xiaofei!” Xue Ying who accomplished the exact opposite of what she desired was instantly furious, but before she could continue to flare up, the tattered wooden door suddenly smashed onto the ground and emitted a muffled sound as it shattered into pieces.</p>
 <p>“Hello…. Everyone.” A disjointed voice sounded out, and everyone in the entire classroom was stunned when they looked over towards the source of the voice.</p>
 <p>All 10 plus of them emptied out everything within their brains yet were unable to find a suitable word to describe the young woman that stood at the door, and even Xue Ying who was exceptionally confident of herself couldn’t help but gulp down a mouthful of saliva.</p>
 <p>The young woman had exquisite looks that seemed as if the heavens had used its own hands to carve her face out inch by inch, and there wasn’t even the slightest bit of it that could be modified. Her slender figure was even more flawless than Xue Ying’s while the white and smooth long legs beneath her short skirt glued the gazes of all the male students to it. Moreover, her slender waist that was completely exposed even added a sense of wild beauty to her.</p>
 <p>“Hello…. Everyone.” The young woman repeated her words once more and pullet the consciousness of everyone back into their minds.</p>
 <p>“Err, hello, hi, you’re?” Xue Ying was a few years older after all, and she was the first to find something that should be said at this moment.</p>
 <p>“Lin Li…. I’ve come to attend classes.” The young woman still spoke disjointedly, and it felt as if she was a puppet that was controlled by someone.</p>
 <p>“Welcome, welcome. You can sit….” Xue Ying started searching through the classroom as she spoke, and in the end, she helplessly noticed that only the seat by Bai Xiaofei’s side was empty within the entire classroom.</p>
 <p>“Sit by Bai Xiaofei’s side.” Xue Ying had practically gritted her teeth as she spoke these words, and at the same time, her sharp gaze fiercely threatened Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, these threats were disregarded by Bai Xiaofei….</p>
 <p>Along with Lin Li walking straight towards Bai Xiaofei, the tail of Huskie who lay on the table started wagging faster and faster.</p>
 <p>“Woof! Woof!” The feelings of an animate puppet and its master were linked, and Huskie’s excited barks were precisely a complete portrayal of what Bai Xiaofei felt at this moment….</p>
