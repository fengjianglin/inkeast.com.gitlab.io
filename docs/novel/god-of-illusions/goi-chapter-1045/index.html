 <p>Chapter 1045: I’m All Ears!</p> 
 <p>“What a youthful spirit!” Gambling Monkey burst out laughing at Bai Xiaofei’s words with an 180-degree turn in his attitude.</p> 
 <p>“That’s what being young is about, no?” Bai Xiaofei also laughed as he looked at Gambling Monkey, matching the latter’s energy.</p> 
 <p>“I like your personality, lad. I don't know what the other groups think, but on behalf of the Babel Merchant House, we’ll do you this favor. No matter how much trouble you stir up in Cloudveil, we will not intervene!” Scratching his chin, Gambling Monkey’s eyes fell upon the dead body of the man representing Unify Business. “As for Unify, we will pay more attention to them. If they really are as you said, Babel will not sit idly by. Anything related to Shadow Death deserves death!”</p> 
 <p>With this declaration, Gambling Monkey stood up. Bai Xiaofei followed suit and slightly bowed to him. “Thank you for your righteousness, Senior. I thank you on behalf of Illusion Demon.”</p> 
 <p>Gambling Monkey smiled and waved dismissively. “Don't mention it. I like making friends but you are the first to be this young. If you have time in the future, come by our Babel. I’ll make sure you have fun!” He then swept his eyes at the other representatives. “Everyone, I will be taking my leave. What you decide later will have nothing to do with me, hahahaha!!”</p> 
 <p>Gambling Monkey’s hearty laughter echoed as he left without looking back. The remaining representatives started to panic. Bai Xiaofei's excuse was completely beyond their expectation and rendered their plans meaningless. Moreover, they did not have the authority to make decisions on behalf of their organizations like Gambling Monkey.</p> 
 <p>“Little Brother Bai, the old man will truthfully report the situation here to Headquarters. As for how it will turn out, it is beyond my control.” Elder Han chose to play safe. It was obvious from his tone that he didn’t want to go against Bai Xiaofei, at least not for the time being.</p> 
 <p>One who is willing to stake everything, fears nothing. That was Bai Xiaofei. When he moved the whole Illusion Demon to Cloudveil, his determination had been shown to surpass everyone else's.</p> 
 <p>“I'm sorry to trouble you to make this trip. When it is all over, this junior will definitely go to the Alchemist Pavilion and pay the seniors of the Devpath Merchant Group a visit.” Bai Xiaofei bowed again.</p> 
 <p>After some more words of courtesies, Elder Han left. At this point, only the representatives of the Amethyst Merchant House, the Violet Moon Group, Multihouse, and the Vivid Wing Chamber remained in the room, with Zhang Yekun of Multihouse being in the most embarrassing position. After all, he came to cause trouble, unlike Gambling Monkey who did out of honest concern.</p> 
 <p>“Pray for your own luck, boy!” Zhang Yekun uttered with a cold snort and left the room.</p> 
 <p>Watching the man leave, Bai Xiaofei shook his head.</p> 
 <p>“May I ask why you’re shaking your head, President Bai?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei's reaction naturally did not escape the attention of the remaining three people, and the representative of Vivid Wing was the most sensitive.</p> 
 <p>“Vivid Wing Chamber, Feng Yi, the little sister of President Feng Luan,” Fang Ye whispered.</p> 
 <p>Smiling, Bai Xiaofei replied, “I just feel sorry for the Babel Merchant House that its Northern Branch president is so narrow-minded.”</p> 
 <p>Feng Yi laughed. “Then, what are you going to do about that, President Bai? I don't think Zhang Yekun is going to say nice things about you when he returns. It's very likely that Multihouse will take action against you. In terms of strength, the current Illusion Demon isn't its opponent, let alone in the territory of Cloudveil.”</p> 
 <p>Facing Feng Yi’s analysis, Bai Xiaofei smiled faintly. “From the moment we set foot in Cloudveil, we’ve already been at a disadvantage. Adding one, or even a hundred Multihouses won’t change anything for us. On the contrary, this will be a huge change for them. When deciding to get involved in an empire’s inner struggle, they won’t have a good end if they aren’t determined enough.”</p> 
 <p>Using Multihouse as the example, Bai Xiaofei ‘kindly’ advised the remaining three organizations, also giving Feng Yi the answer she sought.</p> 
 <p>“That I wish you good luck in this uphill battle, President Bai. Our Vivid Wing Chamber probably will stay out of this matter. Doing business honestly is what we businessmen should do.” Feng Yi curtsied to Bai Xiaofei before taking her leave.</p> 
 <p>“Violet Moon shares the same idea as that of the Vivid Wing Chamber. If it weren't to see President Bai's elegant demeanor, we wouldn’t have come here at all,” said the middle-aged gentleman representing Violet Moon, his scholarly, amiable bearing extremely consistent with his words.</p> 
 <p>“Violet Moon Group, Fan Ziheng, president of their Northern Branch,” Fang Ye quietly informed.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei took a deep breath. With Violet Moon expressing their stand, it was settled that he only had one enemy out of the seven major merchant groups. This was already the best result he had expected!</p> 
 <p>“Thank you for your sense of righteousness, President Fan. If there is an opportunity, this junior will go to Violethorn to thank you again in person.” Bai Xiaofei expressed his gratitude sincerely. How the major merchant groups would perceive this matter would depend entirely on how these representatives would report it. Although he had given them a perfect reason to not intervene, they could just ignore it if they wanted to.</p> 
 <p>“Quite a few promises to pay people a visit you’ve made, lad. It seems that you won't have any time after the matter here ends.” Fan Ziheng burst out laughing.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei smiled wryly. “I really didn't expect that you would all give me face like that. However, I will definitely keep my promises!”</p> 
 <p>Then, the two burst out laughing at the same time.</p> 
 <p>“Well, I won’t delay you. I think Miss Dai has a lot to say, otherwise she wouldn't have stayed until now,” Fan Ziheng murmured with a strange gaze before he left the room.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei's eyes fell on the last representative.</p> 
 <p>There was no need for Fang Ye to make any introduction as very few people in the continent didn’t know her identity – the only daughter of the president of the Amethyst Merchant House, Dai Xiaochan.</p> 
 <p>The president of Amethyst Merchant House had been quite old when his first daughter finally arrived, so using ‘the apple of his eye’ was insufficient to describe his love for her. However, that didn’t spoil Dai Xiaochan and she even became a strong character instead. As long as the Amethyst Merchant House was mentioned, so was her name.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn't expect her to be the representative this time.</p> 
 <p>“Miss Dai, I’m all ears for your wise words.”</p>
