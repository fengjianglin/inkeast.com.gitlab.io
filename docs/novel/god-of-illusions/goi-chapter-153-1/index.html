<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Everyone thought the same thing when they saw Fang Yuesheng’s powerful attack: <em>Bai Xiaofei is finished!</em> Yet when facing such an attack, Bai Xiaofei stuck to his words and did not move a single step. Right as the blade-arms were about to land on his head, he lifted his hands.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had a splendid physique and both his hands were currently fully infused with origin energy. Despite all that, his hands were still nearly slashed apart by Fang Yuesheng’s attack.</p>
 <p>The attack left a deep wound over half of Bai Xiaofei’s palms. However, this was as much as it could do. Fang Yuesheng had no choice but to accept this result facing Bai Xiaofei’s freakish physique.</p>
 <p>“Both your hands are as good as crippled now. Are you going to fight with your mouth next?”</p>
 <p>Fang Yuesheng sneered, looking certain of his victory. In his eyes, Bai Xiaofei was already as good as dead.</p>
 <p>“Did you come from a cave or something?”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei spoke with a shuddering voice, evidently in great pain. A light flashed on his ring and a brocade case fell out. Unfortunately, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t even pick the case up. After being slashed by Fang Yuesheng, let alone exerting some strength onto them, both his hands would hurt with the even the slightest bit of movement.</p>
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei was not alone. When Bai Kai saw this, he ran forward and picked up the brocade case before handing it over to Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>He had initially been grateful for Bai Xiaofei stepping in. But now that Bai Xiaofei had actually received a blow from Fang Yuesheng, this gratefulness had transformed into a deep respect.</p>
 <p>“Open it…and feed me the what is inside!”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei clenched his teeth tightly. Due to the intense pain he was suffering, his consciousness was fading.</p>
 <p>“Let me!”</p>
 <p>The instant Bai Kai opened the case, he was assaulted by a burst of aromatic fragrance. Accompanying the dense medicinal fragrance was the owner of the voice, Hu Xian’er. When she reached Bai Xiaofei, she took the case from Bai Kai and fed the pill to Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“Cripple him!”</p>
 <p>Hu Xian’er ordered solemnly as she fixed her burning gaze on Bai Xiaofei. Under everyone’s stupefied gaze, she pressed her pink and fragrant lips onto his. She had actually…kissed him!</p>
 <p><em>Holy shit!!!</em></p>
 <p>Everyone’s heart pounded madly, thinking that this kiss would have made all of Bai Xiaofei’s efforts worthwhile. Let alone being slashed twice by Fang Yuesheng, all of them would be willing to take on ten slashes from him if they could be at the receiving end of this kiss!</p>
 <p>After a good while, their lips parted. The sensation Bai Xiaofei was all too familiar with helped him regain his concentration. At the same time, the pill he had swallowed started working as his terrible wounds healed at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p>
 <p>Pills were classified into grades of one to nine. Grade nine pills were the highest grade a pill could reach. The pill Bai Xiaofei took earlier was a grade seven Rebirth Pill. &nbsp;Naturally, this pill wasn’t refined by Bai Xiaofei himself. Rather, it used to be Lin Lang’s hidden treasure that had been given to Bai Xiaofei as a token of thanks.</p>
 <p>In less than two minutes, Bai Xiaofei’s hands were already as good as new. A confident smile returned to his face. He could clearly see the complicated way in which everyone was gazing at him. After thinking about it for a while, he understood why they were looking at him like that.</p>
 <p><em>Pfft, what’s the big deal? If you guys knew how Hu Xian’er behaves at night, won’t all of you be so shocked that your jaws would drop to the ground?</em></p>
 <p>With a smile on his face, Bai Xiaofei grabbed Hu Xian’er’s delicate hand and gave her a reassuring look before he strolled leisurely towards Fang Yuesheng.</p>
 <p>“Grade seven pill, Rebirth Pill. It can heal all wounds so long as it’s not a mortal wound. This is one of the benefits of being rich. This is also why I look down on trash like you who act so smug just because you are somewhat strong. You know nothing.”</p>
 <p>After throwing a savage insult Fang Yuesheng’s way, Bai Xiaofei clenched his fists and looked at Fang Yuesheng who looked as if he had just eaten shit.</p>
 <p>“It’s my turn now, right?”</p>
 <p>Fang Yuesheng snorted and activated his origin energy. A layer of bone armor covered his entire body, including his face. However, this transformation had also dulled the sharpness of his blades. This was his defensive form. A Transformation Stream puppet master would generally have three forms of transformation: defensive, offensive, and balanced. However, the first two forms were too specialized, which was why many Transformation Stream puppet masters focused only on the balanced form.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Naturally, this did not apply to an elite puppet master like Fang Yuesheng. Nevertheless, Bai Xiaofei did not think much of Fang Yuesheng’s transformation. After inhaling deeply, the origin energy within him started flowing at a unique beat. This was origin energy resonance!</p>
 <p>Origin energy resonance was one of the battle techniques Xue Ying had taught the Savage Class. By infusing one’s own body with origin energy, one would be able to stimulate the numerous functions the body was capable of. The more robust the origin energy, the longer a person could stay in this form. And the longer one could stay, the stronger its effects would be. Of course, using this technique would cause one to suffer a certain amount of damage as well.</p>
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei’s body could regenerate at a faster rate than the damage caused by this technique. As time passed, Bai Xiaofei’s body started swelling like an inflated balloon. To the others, he seemed to have grown bigger. Under this “illusion” that he had grown, he stepped forward and sent a casual right hook at Fang Yuesheng.</p>
 <p>The force behind Bai Xiaofei’s punch sent a whistling wind straight to Fang Yuesheng’s face. When the wind struck him, a slightly alarmed expression appeared on his previously collected face. Unfortunately, it was too late to be alarmed now.</p>
 <p>With a muffled bang, Fang Yuesheng shot backwards like a bullet. After flying nearly twenty meters, he landed and rolled for quite a long time on the ground. Stupefied. Everyone was stupefied.</p>
 <p><em>Is this still a f*cking Illusion Stream puppet master? Are you sure he’s not a martial artist instead? No, not even a martial artist would be so powerful!</em></p>
 <p>“You may now carry your brainless class monitor back. He really thought I had proposed this way of fighting so I could give him an advantage? He dares to act in such an edgy manner with that level of intelligence? Does he not realize that many people have died because they behaved like that?”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei snorted and clapped his hands in preparation to leave.</p>
 <p>“Die…die…everyone must die!”</p>
 <p>Right this moment, Fang Yuesheng’s shuddering and furious voice rang out. When everyone looked over, Fang Yuesheng was standing up while his entire body trembled. Half his face already deflated from Bai Xiaofei’s punch. He was surprisingly giving off an extremely dangerous feeling despite being heavily injured.</p>
 <p>“Class monitor, you can’t use that move! We still have a match tomorrow!”</p>
 <p>Before Bai Xiaofei could react, Fang Yuesheng’s classmates rushed over and warned him.</p>
 <p>“Piss off! I want him to die! Anyone trying to stop me can die with him!”</p>
 <p>He staggered towards Bai Xiaofei, looking so miserable anyone would feel sorry for him. Surprisingly, Fang Yuesheng laughed sinisterly instead.</p>
 <p>“I like this manly way of fighting that you came up with. Now, it’s your turn to take a hit from me!”</p>
 <p>Fang Yuesheng reverted into his human form and bit down on his left arm. Immediately after, a bizarre undulation spread out of him and his aura rose imposingly.</p>
 <p>“Divine Beast Transformation!”</p>
