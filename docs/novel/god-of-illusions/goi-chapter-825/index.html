 <p>Chapter 825: Wu Chi and Goldie!</p> 
 <p>With the corrosion from the Demonic God of Pain, the barrier collapsed. As he shot toward Tong Fei, the satiated blood cocoon burst open. A golden light sent everything in its wake flying, even the Demonic God of Pain.</p> 
 <p>“How can this small place have a god-tier existence?! God-creation?!!” he shouted in shock.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Tong Fei, who had also been pushed back, stood up with ecstasy. “That’s right, it is god-creation! After I absorb the worm king, I will be a god! And you lot will be nothing but trash then!!”</p> 
 <p>Although Tong Fei was laughing wildly, his heart was full of doubts. <em>Shouldn’t the worm king parasite my body right away? Why did he fly away?!</em></p> 
 <p>However, Tong Fei did not continue to wonder, because he soon saw the reason. The golden glow dissipated and revealed a naked man, who slowly floated up. Tong Fei and the Demonic God of Pain found this person a little unfamiliar, but in his sea of consciousness, Bai Xiaofei smacked his thigh in joy.</p> 
 <p>That man was Wu Chi!</p> 
 <p>“How can this be?!!” roaring in utter agony, Tong Fei collapsed. Wu Chi’s emergence threw all his years of operations and countless efforts down the drain!</p> 
 <p>“This is not what you said. Shouldn’t there be a big enemy for me to deal with?” complained the Demonic God of Pain who had suddenly lost interest, his expression beyond upset. After all, Tong Fei was not enough of an opponent at all.</p> 
 <p>“The unexpected can happen, right?” Bai Xiaofei laughed. He could not be happier. From Tong Fei’s reaction, the worm king was definitely nothing simple, not to mention that it surprised even the Demonic God of Pain. <em>A god-creating precious baby, huh?</em></p> 
 <p>The most important thing was that Wu Chi was fine. For Bai Xiaofei, there was no better news than this.</p> 
 <p>“No! The blood worm is mine!! Mine!!!” Tong Fei roared and rushed toward Wu Chi in desperation. The moment he approached, however, a golden light shot out from Wu Chi and froze him. Then, he slowly melted into blood and flowed into Wu Chi’s body.</p> 
 <p>Only after absorbing Tong Fei did Wu Chi slowly open his eyes. As he descended from the air, the golden light enveloping him also retracted into his body.</p> 
 <p>“This is… What is the situation?” Wu Chi stared down at his naked body in confusion. His last memory stopped at him dragging the other Blood Demon master to death together!</p> 
 <p>“Tch, formidable boy. The power of rules, the body of a god, rare physiques, and talent. Your future is boundless!” For once, the Demonic God of Pain opened his mouth to praise someone. His eyes on Wu Chi were full of yearning.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Fei, what are you talking about?” Wu Chi did not know Bai Xiaofei’s current situation and naturally had no clue who was controlling his body.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, I’ll give this broken body back to you. So boring.” Ignoring Wu Chi, the Demonic God of Pain returned his soul into the sea of consciousness and stood before Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t expect you to keep your word. I thought you would keep occupying my body. After all, I cannot resist at all.” Bai Xiaofei looked at the Demonic God of Pain with a smile, but he was not stupid enough to feel that this fellow was reliable.</p> 
 <p>“That was actually the plan, but I had a sudden change of mind. Perhaps, this body is better with you than me. Moreover, I will come out one day, sooner or later,” said the Demonic God of Pain slowly, his dark pupils flashing a glint that Bai Xiaofei could not understand.</p> 
 <p>Because he had not yet reached that level!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei could clearly feel that the Demonic God of Pain had a purpose, but until he reached the same level, he would not be able to guess what it was. However, Bai Xiaofei did not delve into it. The most important thing now was to get his body back.</p> 
 <p>“By the way, although I was only using the demonic energy in your body, you know your own condition. That you’ve already overloaded your body. After you take over, I’m afraid you’ll be quite miserable with no energy to support your body,” the Demonic God of Pain left a reminder of ‘goodwill’ before sinking into the sea of consciousness, his tone obviously laced with amusement at Bai Xiaofei’s misery…</p> 
 <p>Taking over his body again, the joyous Bai Xiaofei was going to inquire in detail about Wu Chi’s situation when a sharp pain invaded every cell in his body and shot to his brain. Before he could even utter a groan, he fainted.</p> 
 <p>The sudden event stunned Wu Chi. He subconsciously wanted to support Bai Xiaofei, but his reaction was too slow to keep up. However, a blood hand suddenly poked out of Wu Chi’s body and helped Wu Chi finish what he wanted to do.</p> 
 <p>“What the hell?! What’s going on?!” Wu Chi gawked at the blood hand sticking out of his body.</p> 
 <p><em>Blood Demon evolved?! No, even if it did, it’s still just a puppet. How can it act without my control?</em></p> 
 <p>“It’s me,” a baby voice resounded directly in Wu Chi’s mind, scaring him once again.</p> 
 <p>“Who?!!” Wu Chi exclaimed and twisted his head to look all around, but he didn’t even see a shadow.</p> 
 <p>“I’m inside you,” the baby voice rang out again, and then, Wu Chi was forcibly pulled into his own sea of consciousness.</p> 
 <p>Poor Wu Chi followed the footsteps of Bai Xiaofei, getting dragged into his consciousness without any choice at all…</p> 
 <p>Wu Chi’s sea of consciousness was extremely similar to Bai Xiaofei’s, also a blood-red space. However, their sources were different, as that of Bai Xiaofei was the Nirvana Pearl while that of Wu Chi was the golden worm the size of a thumb in front of him!</p> 
 <p>“Nice to meet you, my host, my name is Goldie. I’ve just given myself this name as I thought it would be in line with your style.”</p> 
 <p>Goldie seemed to know every thought Wu Chi had, but conversely, Wu Chi knew nothing about it.</p> 
 <p>“What are you…?” Wu Chi gulped, feeling like his brain was not enough to comprehend the situation. This was a little too uncanny!</p> 
 <p>“Come, let us complete the final ceremony, and you will know what I am.” Goldie floated to Wu Chi.</p> 
 <p>Purely out of instinct, Wu Chi slowly raised his hand and touched Goldie…</p>
