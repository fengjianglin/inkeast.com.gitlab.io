 <p>Chapter 269: Final Round!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was moved. Chu Qingtian's words were tantamount to opening up a new world for him, a world full of business opportunities. Moreover, Bai Xiaofei believed he’d definitely broaden his connections through this activity. The new resources might not be useful during his time in Starnet, but he wouldn’t be staying in Starnet for all his life.</p> 
 <p>However, there was still one final confrontation between Bai Xiaofei and Chu Qingtian before a formal agreement was made – the division of benefits!</p> 
 <p>Pressing down the excitement in his heart, Bai Xiaofei once again entered his fight mode.</p> 
 <p>I got crushed just now because I couldn’t see those things, but now I'm standing at the same height as you!</p> 
 <p><em>So, next is performance time!</em></p> 
 <p>“Sounds interesting, but to be honest, I don't want the trouble.”</p> 
 <p>Chu Qingtian was stunned.</p> 
 <p><em>Not interested?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Humph, more like you don't want to give me a large share!</em></p> 
 <p>How old was Chu Qingtian? He had years of experience, and ever since he had taken over as the vice principal of finance of Starnet, he was exposed to numerous businessmen. Having encountered a similar situation for who-knew-how-many times, how could he not see through Bai Xiaofei’s true intentions?</p> 
 <p>“Bai Xiaofei, we all know too well what kind of person you are. You’re definitely interested, and I believe you’ve already seen the benefits hidden in this!”</p> 
 <p>Chu Qingtian's tone was full of confidence, but what he got in return was only a helpless smile from Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Vice Principal Chu, I'm really not kidding. I'm but a little student. To be honest, if it weren't for the fact that I don’t want to break my promises, I wouldn’t even want to organize any activities within the scope of Starnet. Sometimes, being too outstanding is not necessarily a good thing.” As Bai Xiaofei said this, the wry smile on his face deepened. He didn’t seem to be joking at all.</p> 
 <p>At least, Chu Qingtian’s confidence wavered.</p> 
 <p><em>Could this be true?</em></p> 
 <p>“But since you have embarked on this road, why not make it as excellent as possible? Can you really accept giving the same effort but not striving for the greatest gain?”</p> 
 <p>As his confidence faded, Chu Qingtian’s inducement also gradually became advice.</p> 
 <p>“There are two sides to every coin. The more I gain on one side, the more I may lose on the other. For me, it’s enough after a certain amount of money, maintaining some anonymity is much more crucial. Think about it, if the whole continent knows who I am, how can I continue doing what I want?” Bai Xiaofei shrugged.</p> 
 <p>Chu Qingtian lapsed into silence.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was right indeed. Knowing him and not knowing him were two contrasting states.</p> 
 <p>To make a simple example, when Bai Xiaofei first arrived at the Savage Class, some would be willing to join when he proposed a bet. However, after learning what kind of person Bai Xiaofei was, he only needed to snore and everyone would feel like they were tricked.</p> 
 <p>Strength had never been something Bai Xiaofei relied on.</p> 
 <p>“What if I told you Starnet demanded you to do this?” Chu Qingtian said the last thing he would want to say after being speechless for half a day. These words were equal to putting himself on Bai Xiaofei's chopping board.</p> 
 <p>“Vice Principal Chu, I am already working for Starnet. Don't you know what Vice Principal Luo Xi said to me?”</p> 
 <p>There was no such thing as ‘knowing when it was enough’ for Bai Xiaofei. If he wanted to fool others, he must be able to fool himself first. And currently, the stand he took on was that he really didn’t want to take on this trouble!</p> 
 <p>Otherwise, how could he trick Chu Qingtian? The guy was no fool.</p> 
 <p>“It's not the same. What Luo Xi told you involved things at a very low level, but what I said to you can affect the development of our academy. The contributions they can make for Starnet are entirely different.” When saying this, Chu Qingtian had completely believed Bai Xiaofei’s lies. He couldn’t care less about the division of profit right now, he only hoped that Bai Xiaofei would not continue to refuse!</p> 
 <p>“Vice Principal Chu, if that’s the case, then I’m even less of the person for the job. I really dare not step into this kind of high-level stuff, if I make one wrong move…”</p> 
 <p>“There's nothing to be afraid of. All you have to do is act as a middleman and I'll arrange the rest for you. Anything you don't want to be exposed won’t have to be exposed. It’s fine even if you remain behind the scenes all the way through!” Chu Qingtian interrupted Bai Xiaofei, obviously very anxious.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei complained bitterly in his heart.</p> 
 <p><em>Shit, I overdid it!</em></p> 
 <p>“You really think that’s possible, Vice Principal? No matter where, I will be the most important person. How can I be hidden? However, if you promise me one thing, I’ll consider it.” As the conversation took a sudden turn, Bai Xiaofei's expression became serious.</p> 
 <p>Chu Qingtian was pleased at first, but then he was stunned.</p> 
 <p><em>Damn it, have I been cheated?! Why does it feel like I’ve stepped into a trap?!</em></p> 
 <p>Despite thinking so, Chu Qingtian hesitated upon seeing the expression of being forced on Bai Xiaofei’s face. For the first time in his life, Chu Qingtian was confused by his judgment of a person. At the end of the day, he still didn’t know Bai Xiaofei well enough.</p> 
 <p>If the people of the Gorge of Heroes were here, they’d poke through Bai Xiaofei’s mask in a second. As long as there was a benefit to gain, Bai Xiaofei would definitely flock over. Hiding? That was just impossible alright! If Bai Xiaofei ever hid away, then he was definitely making a detour, and the purpose of the detour was to strike the opponent defenseless.</p> 
 <p>And now, Chu Qingtian had taken the strike head-on!</p> 
 <p>“What is it?” Chu Qingtian asked out slowly, his aura visibly weakened.</p> 
 <p>“After all, I’m a member of the Demon of Illusions, and I haven't made any contribution since I came here, so something small like the monthly payment…”</p> 
 <p>“Waived!” Chu Qingtian responded with a straightforward wave of his hand as soon as Bai Xiaofei expressed his intention. Compared to the income that this activity would generate, the monthly contribution of a department was truly insignificant.</p> 
 <p>However, such a trivial matter in Chu Qingtian's opinion made Chu Liuyun’s group excited beyond comparison.</p> 
 <p><em>Finally, we can stop squeezing our own pocket money!!!</em></p> 
 <p><em>We can eat well in the future!</em></p> 
 <p><em>We can buy things!</em></p> 
 <p><em>We can… We can do a lot of things!!!</em></p> 
 <p>In unison, three pairs of watery eyes from elation directed at Bai Xiaofei, looking at him like they were looking at a savior. After just this one matter, they had already developed a firm belief in Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you, Vice Principal Chu. Then let's talk about the details of our cooperation.” Bai Xiaofei smiled, revealing his fox's tail. This was the point!</p> 
 <p>It was also at this moment that Chu Qingtian realized something.</p> 
 <p><em>Damn, I was really tricked! This brat is too perverse!!!</em></p> 
 <p>“This is my plan: I’ll be responsible for finding investors, and the investment…”</p> 
 <p>“Just split it 50 50, I don't need much. Although I’m the main contributor, I still need to take the academy into consideration, right?” Bai Xiaofei lightly interrupted Chu Qingtian as the latter stared blankly in shock.</p> 
 <p><em>And you said you didn’t care about money?! 50 50?! Why don't you just rob me!</em></p> 
 <p>However, Chu Qingtian could only keep those words in his mind…</p> 
 <p>Final round, absolute victory for Bai Xiaofei!</p>
