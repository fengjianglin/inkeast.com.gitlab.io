 <p>Chapter 713: Is It Over?</p> 
 <p>A torrent of colorful attacks enveloped the demon king, who was unable to move and had no choice but to take them head-on. He roared in pain as wounds started appearing on his body.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, everyone gulped in shock. <em>What kind of body is this?! He only suffered superficial injuries from this level of attack?!!</em></p> 
 <p>“You can’t kill me! When I break free is when you all die! And not only you, everything on this continent will be my food!!” The demon king laughed hysterically when he found that the attacks weren’t fatal. “Weaklings, you lot are! Compared to those people hundreds of years ago, you are too weak! Hahaha!!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, everyone was heavily struck. Were they really just waiting to die at this point?!</p> 
 <p>“Why the f*ck are you spacing out?! You really believe whatever he says?! Can’t you see he’s hurt! Attack his eyes! Hit the weak points!” roared Bai Xiaofei angrily.</p> 
 <p>Everyone was forcefully dragged out of desperation. Returning to their senses, they gathered their strength for the next round.</p> 
 <p>“Hellfire formation!” Ferret reacted the fastest. Gritting his teeth, he took out a red pill and swallowed it. His Hell Realm immediately heated up even more.</p> 
 <p>The Hellfire Brigade also got into formation. In unison, they sat down cross-legged and raised their guns. Fin also pushed his phantom puppet to the highest limit possible. A huge illusory figure appeared in the air and the flames within Hell Realm gathered around it. Then, all the guns combined into a huge version and flew into the hands of the figure. A blinding light shone at the muzzle. The fire around the figure also fused into the gun.</p> 
 <p>During this, attacks against the demon king had never ceased. Despite fighting them at his best, most of his focus was actually on the illusory figure. He felt threatened by it!</p> 
 <p>The threat didn’t keep him waiting. An attack was launched as soon as the charging was completed. A terrifyingly thick beam carrying the energy of the entire brigade as well as everyone’s hope shot out.</p> 
 <p>“Stop!!!” the demon king growled. A terrifying force erupted from his body and shielded him. Stopped by this shield, the beam was fixed in place!</p> 
 <p>“Break his defense!” shouted Bai Xiaofei who immediately rushed forward as a golden flame condensed into a sword in his hand. He stabbed it straight at the demon king’s back.</p> 
 <p>“Seeking death!” roared the demon king. Forced into a corner, he had to spend a part of his energy from his shield to attack Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Without delay, Bai Xiaofei used Invincibility. This was why he didn’t deactivate his Spiritualization with Purple Luan, to fight while not having to constantly fear for his life, instead of being able to ignore an attack from the demon king like now.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was sent flying by the demon king’s attack, but this was after his sword successfully penetrated the latter’s body!</p> 
 <p>The sword that turned into a golden flame ran amok in the demon king’s body and rapidly injured it, but this was far from the end. Jiao He and Fan Xingyu immediately leaped up with their spear and sword, breaking the demon king’s shield that had been weakened by the golden flame.</p> 
 <p>Without the shield hindering its path, the energy beam reached its target. A horrifying explosion drowned everything.</p> 
 <p>Everyone stared intensely at the explosion in expectation. <em>Even if this fails to kill him he should be at least crippled!</em></p> 
 <p>After a long time, the smoke cleared and revealed the demon king. Blood flowed out from a hole the size of a head in his chest, but the flesh around the wound was recovering at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p> 
 <p>The demon king had not only strong defense but also a perverse regeneration ability, which was the main reason why he was able to persist for so many years.</p> 
 <p>“I take back what I just said. I underestimated you lot.” Spitting out black blood, the demon king looked serious, but then he sneered. “However, you no longer stand a chance!”</p> 
 <p>He raised his right hand. In the air, a pitch-dark cloud had condensed from all the fog from the killed undead. Upon the demon king’s call, the cloud flew down and merged into his body. When this process finished, his injuries were also healed.</p> 
 <p>Sweeping his eyes around the crowd, the demon king moved his body. The long-lost sense of his complete power put him in a good mood.</p> 
 <p>“Hundreds of years, these damn chains locked up this mighty one for hundreds of years! Sooner or later, I will kill my way back to the False World and take your dog head!!“</p> 
 <p>Letting out a roar full of resentment, the demon king shook his body, and all the chains piercing him shattered. At the same time, the blood veil above also drifted toward him. After an extremely quick fusion, everyone could feel violent energy fluctuations around him.</p> 
 <p>“It’s time to settle this!” His lips slightly curved up, the demon king appeared in front of Bai Xiaofei in the blink of an eye.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately used Teleportation, only to find that he couldn’t use it!</p> 
 <p>“Teleportation is the ability to jump through space. Now that this king has sealed the entire area, your teleportation is a joke unless you are stronger than me!”</p> 
 <p>With one hand, the demon king lifted Bai Xiaofei. A force as dark as ink gushed out and eroded Bai Xiaofei’s invincible shield little by little.</p> 
 <p>“Let him go!!”</p> 
 <p>The triplets rushed over while opening the mirror world. However, as it attempted to replicate the demon king, the mirror instantly shattered. The triplets spat out blood before falling to the ground.</p> 
 <p>“Delusional worms want to replicate my godly body? But since you care so much about this boy, your relationship should not be so simple!”</p> 
 <p>The demon king raised his other hand. The triplets flew up and slowly drifted towards him.</p> 
 <p>“Say, boy, if I kill these three in front of you and then let you go, will you be living in pain for the rest of your life?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s heart tightened.</p> 
 <p>“I have something you want. If you kill them, I will destroy it!” he said as he looked the demon king in the eyes, successfully stopping the latter’s action…</p>
