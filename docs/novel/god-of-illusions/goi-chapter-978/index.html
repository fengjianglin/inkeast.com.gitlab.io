 <p>Chapter 978: Night Talk, Bai Xiaofei’s Shock!</p> 
 <p>After getting Tan Xin’s ‘permission,’ Bai Xiaofei followed the officer to Ye Qingcheng’s tent, compared with which, his tent was like a tiny country bumpkin in front of a glamorous giant…</p> 
 <p>“Your Majesty, Fickle Bai has arrived!”</p> 
 <p>“Let him in, tell the rest to step down. No need to stand guard.” Ye Qingcheng’s faint voice came out from the tent.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s heart leaped in anxiety. <em>Why would you want to send everyone else away?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Why are you still standing outside? Still scared that I will eat you?” her voice rang out again just as Bai Xiaofei was lost in thought. Unlike the aloof tone she used when speaking to the officer, this time it had a kind of lazy charm to it.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei gulped, mustered up his courage, bit the bullet, and entered the tent.</p> 
 <p>Although the tent had just been set up, a fragrant smell had permeated every corner. Ye Qingcheng, dressed in a loose nightgown, was lying on her side on a fur bench, her almond eyes looking at Bai Xiaofei meaningfully.</p> 
 <p>Who would be able to stand such a sight?</p> 
 <p>“Although I’m not scared that you will eat me, I have a feeling that you’re trying to set me up.” Bai Xiaofei kept his head clear and broke the silence with a solemn expression.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t think so. I’ve always been like this, it’s just that no man has ever seen me. Or, maybe you can teach me how to be in the same space with a man who can stir up half the continent?” Ye Qingcheng’s lips slightly curled up, her eyes emitting an enchanting light that was enough to make any man lose his mind.</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, Bai Xiaofei was an exception.</p> 
 <p>“You didn’t call me here to say this stuff, did you?”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Ye Qingcheng’s expression also became serious.</p> 
 <p>“Actually, I want to answer some questions, since you should have a lot of questions for me,” Ye Qingcheng passed the initiative to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Despite having no idea what she was thinking, her words hit the nail on the head. Bai Xiaofei did have a lot of questions to ask.</p> 
 <p>“Then I will take up on your offer.” Bai Xiaofei cleared his throat as he sorted out his thoughts before getting started. “Let’s start from you guys. What is the ability of you and your sisters? Will it be of help to us?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei recalled his contact with the Ye sisters. While Ye Xi and Ye Qingtong had not shown their abilities, the fact that Ye Qingcheng had entrusted Nie Qing to Ye Xi before she deployed showed that the Moon God Technique was nothing simple.</p> 
 <p>“It’s the Moon God Technique. That’s where our abilities all come from.” Ye Qingcheng had no intention to hide anything. The reason why she had summoned Bai Xiaofei was to make everything clear, or it would affect their subsequent cooperation.</p> 
 <p>The border affair allowed no room for mishaps!</p> 
 <p>“Everyone knows our Moon God Technique is a first-class treatment but isn’t clear about its specific content. In fact, apart from its powerful treatment ability, there is another feature that makes it invincible.”</p> 
 <p>“The Moon God Technique is divided into nine realms. Once cultivated to the seventh realm, it provides the practitioner with characteristics similar to having a special physique. You should have seen Tong Tong’s. She can calm all the elements in her surroundings.”</p> 
 <p>“The characteristic Ye Xi gained is Enlarge, which enlarges the energy ability of a target. For example, when two people with the same level of the Moon God Technique treat a person, her treatment effect can increase to twice as much as the rest of us.”</p> 
 <p>“Qingtong’s characteristic is Absorb, which has the same effect as your Endless State, but her absorption needs to be actively controlled.”</p> 
 <p>“And I, when reaching the seventh realm, got dual characteristics, one is Penetrate, the other is Smash.”</p> 
 <p>Then, Ye Qingcheng made a little demonstration. She reached out her right hand and it went right through the cup on the table in front.</p> 
 <p>“Penetrate can make any part of my body intangible and materialize at will. As for Smash, you should have experienced it. I can’t demonstrate it in my current state,” she said with a sigh and a bitter expression.</p> 
 <p>“Your other personality?” Bai Xiaofei recalled the ice-cold and destructive Ye Qingcheng that he had faced, his brow creased.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, because of an unexpected situation, a part of my strength was sealed. In this state, I can only utilize up to the eighth realm of the Moon God Technique, but once the other me comes out, she can fully utilize all of my strength, as well as the other characteristic, Smash.”</p> 
 <p>It seemed that Ye Qingcheng had quite a thorough understanding of her other personality, even though it was one that she could not freely control.</p> 
 <p>“Why be so detailed? Aren’t you afraid that I have ulterior motives?” Bai Xiaofei was surprised by Ye Qingcheng’s honesty. Any normal person would not be so unreserved about their secrets.</p> 
 <p>“It’s impossible not to be afraid, but for some reason, I just believe in you.” Ye Qingcheng laughed enchantingly.</p> 
 <p>“Erm… Let’s get back to the topic just now. So, what is the situation at the border?” Bai Xiaofei chickened out.</p> 
 <p>“Just as you speculated, and in the worst case possible. There are a total of thirteen fortresses at the northern border. They have been our protection for hundreds of years, but at present, seven have fallen, and the remaining six fortresses are already in jeopardy.” Ye Qingcheng’s expression grew more and more solemn as she spoke.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei was astonished. “And you are still able to keep this kind of news under wraps?!” He didn’t know what else to say. In his view, Ye Qingcheng was putting Moonlight at risk.</p> 
 <p>“Do you think I want to? It’s only been less than a month since the first fortress fell, I never even had the time to react. If this news spreads, what do you think will happen to Moonlight? “</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei’s surprise turned into shock and disbelief.</p> 
 <p>“Seven in under a month?!! Are you sure you’re not kidding me?!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s reaction was not unreasonable. Those kinds of fortresses, let alone capturing them in a month, just climbing them alone one by one would take more time than that!</p> 
 <p><em>Don’t tell me the Sacks have been resting for so many years and have accumulated hundreds of thousands of troops?!</em></p> 
 <p>“You think I’d joke about this kind of issue? I’m afraid the Sacks are no longer the Sacks we know,” muttered Ye Qingcheng with the utmost seriousness.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s expression grew ugly for the first time since he knew of this matter. Obviously, it was not as simple as he imagined!</p>
