 <p>Chapter 994: Moonlight Men!</p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai!!”</p> 
 <p>Quickly recovering from the shock upon seeing a blood-soaked Bai Xiaofei standing horrifyingly still with the support of Mind Sunder, the Black Dragon Swarm bandit’s Second Leader rushed to him. The moment he touched him, Bai Xiaofei collapsed.</p> 
 <p>The Second Leader hurriedly held Bai Xiaofei. After repeatedly checking and confirming that Bai Xiaofei had no fatal injuries, he heaved a sigh of relief.</p> 
 <p>“He’s just drained, nothing too serious,” announced the Second Leader.</p> 
 <p>The people around collectively sighed in relief as well. Only then did they notice the surroundings, and they collectively gasped. <em>Did he kill all these Sacks by himself?!</em></p> 
 <p>Behind Bai Xiaofei, the body of the Sacks soldiers formed a long trail in the direction of Savage Wolf Ridge. Although they hadn’t seen it with their own eyes, they could imagine him pursuing and killing an entire army alone, and it made them gulp hard.</p> 
 <p><em>How did he do that?! Did the Sacks suddenly become cowards?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Let’s get out of here. If the Sacks come back, we won’t be able to stop them!” a bandit said as he looked around apprehensively.</p> 
 <p>These words struck everyone hard.</p> 
 <p>“That’s right, let’s leave first!” agreed the Second Leader after making sure there weren’t any other survivors.</p> 
 <p>With the Second Leader carrying Bai Xiaofei on his back, the group left in the previously agreed direction…</p> 
 <p>On another battlefield, Ye Qingcheng cut down the flag representing the Sacks at the city gate. The Moonlight army had completely retaken Divine Light Fortress. However, their injuries obviously indicated that the battle had not been easy at all.</p> 
 <p>Although there had only been 200,000 enemy troops inside the fortress, the interference from their reinforcements from the several nearby fortresses had been close to put Ye Qingcheng in grave situations. If it wasn’t that they had come with 700,000 troops, Moonlight would certainly have failed…</p> 
 <p>“Divine Light is just the beginning. Next, we shall take back all of our territories and drive the Sacks out of Moonlight forever!”</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingcheng stood on a high tower as her declaration echoed, drawing loud cheers from the troops.</p> 
 <p>However, her heart was filled with anxiety despite the victory. Winning Divine Light was only the first step to restoring the morale at the frontier, and it was equally important to ensure that the morale was stabilized throughout the future. Once any fortress in the rear was lost, their hard work would all go down the drain.</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, her concern was dispelled during the next three days as one report after another arrived, stating that everything was normal and the remaining six fortresses had not seen a shadow of the Sacks.</p> 
 <p>“Your Majesty, judging from the reinforcements of the Sacks we’ve seen so far, they should not have deployed all of their troops. Why aren’t they attacking the rear areas at all?”</p> 
 <p>In Ye Qingcheng’s room, Tan Yueru was voicing her doubts. She had been ready to help the rear and even worried that they had come too late.</p> 
 <p>“Have you forgotten that we still have an army?” Ye Qingcheng reminded.</p> 
 <p>Tan Yueru immediately revealed a disdainful expression.</p> 
 <p>“With just those ten thousand?! The Sacks still have at least 300,000 troops left. If they actually cross paths, I’m afraid those men won’t even be able to stop a single wave of attacks. What can they do? Instead of believing in them, I’d rather believe that the Sacks didn’t move at all.” Tan Yueru made no effort to hide her distrust.</p> 
 <p>“Who knows? Maybe they created a miracle. Isn’t what Moonlight needs now a miracle?” said Ye Qingcheng with a calm smile, before her expression became that of amusement. “How about I give you this chance to witness the miracle? You take some people to have a look.”</p> 
 <p>Tan Yueru briefly frowned at the idea, but she then knelt. “I will do as Your Majesty instructs!”</p> 
 <p>After watching Tan Yueru leave with a smile, Ye Qingcheng sank into thought.</p> 
 <p>Divine Light was only the beginning before the climax of the frontier war. The once-in-a-century unity of the Sacks definitely posed a disastrous challenge for Moonlight.</p> 
 <p>Moreover, after the battle at Divine Light, Ye Qingcheng deeply felt the difference between the current Sacks and the past.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s just hope that senior wasn’t wrong. It’s not enough to rely on Moonlight alone this time…”</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>After the situation at Divine Light stabilized, the Moonlight troops successively returned to their respective fortresses, while Tan Yueru headed toward Brilliance Fortress according to Ye Qingcheng’s instruction.</p> 
 <p>However, what they didn’t know was that Brilliance Fortress wasn’t Bai Xiaofei’s designated goal…</p> 
 <p>“Open the gates! We are Moonlight troops!” shouted Zhuang Shuo toward the watchtower of Divine Light Fortress gates. Behind him were the remaining 600-odd men looking like a group of refugees fleeing from famine.</p> 
 <p>There were few of them who were without injuries, but the exhausting half-month journey didn’t give them the mood to tidy up themselves.</p> 
 <p>“Stop approaching, or we will kill immediately!”</p> 
 <p>The response was immediate, but it was not what Zhuang Shuo wanted to hear.</p> 
 <p><em>F*ck, I risked my life for Moonlight, only to be shut out at the gates now?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Calm down, they don’t know what we have done. Changes take time.” Bai Xiaofei, who was being carried on a simple stretcher, watered Zhuang Shuo’s fury with an indifferent tone.</p> 
 <p>“Lie back down! Keep forgetting that you’re not allowed to move?!” Tan Xin immediately jumped out and pressed Bai Xiaofei back down.</p> 
 <p>After the Second Leader brought Bai Xiaofei back, everyone’s heart ached to see his condition, and only after hearing about what had happened at Savage Wolf Ridge did they know why he wanted to remain until the end.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin, who had been tricked into leaving by Bai Xiaofei, became an entirely different person, currently never keeping her eyes off him.</p> 
 <p>“Good, good, I won’t move. Alright, don’t worry too much, someone will clear our name,” said Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>At that moment, the gates opened and around two hundred armed soldiers marched out, directly surrounding them.</p> 
 <p>Despite Bai Xiaofei’s early warning, the group still felt uncomfortable being treated in such a manner. However, no one lost their temper.</p> 
 <p>“How did you get Moonlight military uniforms? Who are you?!” the garrison captain questioned in a harsh tone. </p> 
 <p>Gritting his teeth, Zhuang Shuo was about to reply when Ye Qingtong stepped out.</p> 
 <p>“We are soldiers appointed by Her Majesty. We have just completed our mission of stopping the Sacks army, currently returning to report,” she said.</p> 
 <p>The soldiers in front of them had no idea the price of such an achievement. From 16,000 people to now only 600, and most were seriously injured, it was not easy for Ye Qingtong to be able to speak so calmly.</p> 
 <p>“Stopping the Sacks’ reinforcements?! Try to make up a better story! Who doesn’t know that in the past few days, all the fighting power of the Sacks has been sent to Divine Light? Don’t think that you can talk nonsense to protect these men just because you are a woman,” said the garrison captain coldly.</p> 
 <p>The soldiers immediately tightened their encirclement with weapons pointing at Bai Xiaofei’s group, ready to attack at any time.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, the men immediately clenched their weapons. There was no fear in their eyes, only a fighting spirit. As long as Bai Xiaofei gave the order, they would immediately attack.</p> 
 <p>“Want to resist?! Capture them!” shouted the garrison captain.</p> 
 <p>“You’d better take back what you just said,” Bai Xiaofei’s icy voice echoed at the same time.</p> 
 <p>Getting off the stretcher, he walked straight to the garrison captain. Tan Xin didn’t press him back down again but supported him right away.</p> 
 <p>“What if I don’t?!” subconsciously retorted the garrison captain, looking at Bai Xiaofei who was full of fighting intent.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll cut you down!”</p> 
 <p>With that, the Bai Xiaofei who seemed so weak a second ago sprinted toward the garrison captain like a gale. Before she could even react, he had pressed her down on the ground.</p> 
 <p>The rest of the group also moved almost right after. Those who were in better conditions rushed straight out and caught the soldiers off guard. In less than 30 seconds, the 200-odd soldiers were collectively disarmed and detained.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, whatever happened to ‘remaining calm?’” Zhuang Shuo burst out laughing.</p> 
 <p>“Have I ever said such a thing? Why can’t I remember? Your ears stopped working, didn’t they?” Bai Xiaofei said with a serious face, then looked at the garrison captain. “You probably don’t know us. Let me introduce myself and the group behind me. We, soldiers of Moonlight, have contributed first-class merit by stopping a 300,000-strong Sacks army!”</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei’s voice echoed in the air, the 600-odd people immediately revealed unprecedented confidence on their faces.</p> 
 <p><em>Yes, that is us! We have created miracles with a force that was dozens of times weaker than the enemy!</em></p> 
 <p>Watching at the side, Ye Qingtong’s sight was blurred by tears, having witnessed for herself how this group of men, who used to tremble upon the sight of women, had completely overcome their fear!</p> 
 <p>From this moment on, Moonlight had real men!</p>
