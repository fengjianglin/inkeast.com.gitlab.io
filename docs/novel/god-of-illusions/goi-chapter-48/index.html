<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>The night was peaceful and Bai Xiaofei slept exceptionally comfortably, and it seemed as if this world was unrelated to him as soon as he got on the bed….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Fei! It’s time to get up!!!” A familiar voice sounded out once again, and Bai Xiaofei jumped right up from the bed this time because the ‘addition’ from yesterday was unforgettable!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he hastily got ready, Bai Xiaofei and the others finally charged into the classroom before the bell that represented classes had started ringing, and at the instant he sat down, Bai Xiaofei actually had a feeling of release.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not having to suffer punishment was really fortunate and delightful….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm, not bad. No one was late today.” As she stood on the lectern, Xue Ying who carried a smile on her face looked extremely terrifying to the 16 people below.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is it? Are your legs sore today?” As soon as Xue Ying finished speaking, everyone revealed pained expressions because their legs weren’t just sore, and after they slept and woke up, every single one of them wished for nothing more than for their legs to be on another’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Sister Xue Ying, you said yesterday that we wouldn’t be running today!” A voice of complaint sounded out as Mo Ka spoke what was in the hearts of everyone because someone would really die if they ran again today….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, I keep my word. Moreover, I’m not the one who’ll be teaching all of you this morning. A teacher in charge of teaching the history of the continent will come over later. Even though it’s boring, don’t let me find out that any one of you was uncooperative during the class!” Xue Ying spoke with a cold expression, causing everyone to instantly cheer up because so long as they didn’t have to run, they were willing to do anything!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right when Xue Ying had just finished speaking, a white bearded old man walked in and greeted Xue Ying before replacing Xue Ying under the gazes of anticipation of everyone present in the classroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello everyone. I’m the teacher in charge of the history classes, Hu Sanduo. I hope we can get along happily with each other during the next three months.” After he spoke some courteous words, Hu Sanduo started his lessons. But, because of the reputation of the Savage Class, he didn’t have a very good attitude towards the 16 of them and it was only limited to carrying out his duty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, to Hu Sanduo’s surprise, there actually wasn’t a single person amongst all the 16 people in the class who wasn’t listening with concentration. Especially their gazes which seemed as if they were looking at their savior was rather baffling to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher Hu, there’s something I don’t understand about the battle between Soarwind and Violethorn.” Bai Xiaofei raised his hand to interrupt Hu Sanduo’s speed. But, Hu Sanduo wasn’t displeased because it was a good thing for a teacher when someone asked a question because it displayed that someone had listened at the very least….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Infinite Mountain Range lays between Soarwind and Violethorn, and it’s utterly impossible to pass through. Moreover, the only pathway through it the Gorge of Heroes at the center of the Infinite Mountain Range. But, I heard restrictions exist all throughout the year there, so it’s utterly impossible for a large army to pass through. How did the battle between them occur?” The bewilderment on Bai Xiaofei’s face wasn’t faked in the slightest. But, all of this wasn’t something he’d heard as his understanding of the Gorge of Heroes was absolutely deeper than anyone present here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“By sea. The Soarwind found a safe route on through the Dead Sea. They went past the Thousand Island Kingdom on the Dead Sea, conquered a few small kingdoms on the way, and then started the war.” Bai Xiaofei sat down after he obtained a satisfying answer, and the entire classroom instantly became lively once he took the lead. Question after question caused Hu Sanduo to beam with smiles because such an effect during class might not even occur in the ‘rich district’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An entire morning of time couldn’t be said to be long or short, and the Savage Class basically spent the entire time amidst sounds of discussion. After they’d experienced the ‘tempering’ from yesterday morning, the history of the continent that others felt was extremely boring seemed simply like a blessing from the heavens to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, a tremendous change had already occurred to Hu Sanduo’s impression of the Savage Class when he left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Fei, how nice would it be if we have such a class every single morning!” As they circled around Bai Xiaofei’s side, Mo Ka sighed emotionally from the heart, whereas, Wu Chi and Shi Kui seconded it at the first possible moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You wish. If you only learn history, then aren’t you afraid of becoming like Teacher Hu Sanduo in the future?” Bai Xiaofei glanced at Mo Ka disdainfully before standing up because he saw Xue Ying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher Hu Sanduo is extremely pleased with all of you, whereas, I’m a person that always makes a clear distinction between faults and merits. So, we’ll go to the 100 Flavor House for lunch later!” As soon as Xue Ying finished speaking, the sounds of cheers rose and fell in the classroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The academy did indeed provide food. But, when compared with the paid food, the free dishes were truly a bit too difficult to swallow. However, a man without money is incapable of anything, and besides Fang Ye, not a single person in the Savage Class was wealthy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, everyone practically raised their hands in approval when someone was treating them to food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right, I’ll take this opportunity to announce that Bai Xiaofei obtained the honor to become our Class Monitor. Moreover, for the sake of displaying his thanks towards the support of everyone, he has decided to pay for this meal.” A second ago, Bai Xiaofei was shouting along with everyone, yet a second later, Bai Xiaofei’s face had already turned black.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He originally thought he could have a great feast and store up some energy for the World Devourer technique, but in reality, not only was he unable to get a free meal, he had to bleed out a massive amount of money….</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was utterly unable to refute the reason Xue Ying had given….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, under Xue Ying’s proposal, the disappointed Bai Xiaofei led the vast group towards 100 Flavor House while taking his time to go over because a place like the 100 Flavor House would never be filled with people like the other places that served food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but sigh emotionally in his heart when coming back to this familiar place, whereas, Huskie who was in his arms was excited to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’re you barking for? You better take it easy when you eat this meal today, otherwise, you won’t have any dog food next month if you make me poor!” Bai Xiaofei slapped Huskie on the head and directly destroyed its dreams of having a feast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello, may I know how many of you there are?” After they walked into the 100 Flavor House, a beautiful young woman walked directly towards them. Those that were able to become attendants here were actually students of the academy, and this could be considered to be one of the unique features of the academy. For the sake of earning sufficient money to pay for their expenses, many students had become workers within the academy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, there was no need to be courteous to seniors in these kind of places….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“17 people and one dog.” Bai Xiaofei who was pushed to the front felt his heart bleeding as he spoke, whereas, the attendant was stunned when she saw Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re that person from two days ago that…!” The senior sister swallowed back the balance of what she was about to say because during that meal where Qin Lingyan treated Bai Xiaofei, it wasn’t just Qin Lingyan who’d remembered Bai Xiaofei, even the attendants of the 100 Flavor House had remembered him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because a person that could eat so much was really something that never seen or heard of….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, we won’t be eating so much this time. There’s no need to worry as it won’t exhaust all of you.” After he ‘consoled’ the attendant, Bai Xiaofei entered into a private room under her lead, whereas, Xue Ying completely made herself at home and took up the menu before ordering a large pile of food without holding back in the slightest….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, we’ve finished ordering. Let’s get to business.” Xue Ying’s expression suddenly turned solemn, and everyone else instantly had a bad premonition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” Bai Xiaofei, the Class Monitor, gulped down a mouthful of saliva before representing everyone to ask this question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you paying now? So we’ll discuss how to help you escape disaster next!”</span></p>
