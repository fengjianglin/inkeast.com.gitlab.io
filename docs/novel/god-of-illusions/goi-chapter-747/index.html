 <p>Chapter 747: The Bai Xiaofei You Know Is Back!</p> 
 <p>“Stop! State your identity!” A big group of soldiers stopped Bai Xiaofei’s party as soon as they approached the city gate.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei looked around and immediately understood. The soldiers did not stop people who were scattered or dressed poorly, but especially targeted big groups. The meaning of this couldn’t be more obvious.</p> 
 <p>“Official, we are a branch of the Illusion Demon Merchant Group and I’m the leader. This is a little gift of gratitude, I hope it can let you enjoy some good wine.” Bai Xiaofei fawningly walked to their captain and, very naturally, put two gold coins in his hand.</p> 
 <p>Looking at the gold coins, the captain’s eyes lit up as his icy expression turned into that of satisfaction.</p> 
 <p>“So it’s the boss of the Illusion Demon Merchant Group branch. Please proceed. If you encounter any trouble in the city, you can always use my name: Qin San.” The captain conveniently offered a favor as he waved Bai Xiaofei’s group along.</p> 
 <p>What he didn’t notice was that at the moment when Bai Xiaofei and he brushed shoulders, a dog paw stretched out from nothingness and slashed with its claw.</p> 
 <p>“I’d be damned, our stingy Brother Fei actually spent his money on bribery!” After entering the city, Mo Ka could not help but diss Bai Xiaofei a little.</p> 
 <p>“And I told you to train your perception.” Wang Hang sneered and pointed at Bai Xiaofei, where everyone saw Huskie proudly wagging his tail while showing off the captain’s coin pouch dangling on his paw.</p> 
 <p>“5 gold and 32 silver, more than twice the return. You have done well. Two gold coins will be used to buy you treats, I’ll help you keep them,” said Bai Xiaofei righteously as he stowed the said two gold coins into his own money pocket.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this scene, Mo Ka’s surprise turned into a sigh. “Ahh, it seems we still have to be careful about Brother Fei!”</p> 
 <p>“Pay attention to your current identity,” whispered Duan Yiyi who came up from behind and shot Mo Ka a glare.</p> 
 <p>Mo Ka immediately fixed his manner. Besides Bai Xiaofei, he currently listened to Duan Yiyi’s words most.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, Young Miss, this subordinate knows my mistake.” He solemnly bowed towards her.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll only give you this one chance. Mess up again and you can pack your stuff!” said Duan Yiyi coldly, fully displaying the bearing of a young miss. As expected of someone who graduated from the acting course with full marks!</p> 
 <p>“Yiyi, do not make a fuss. That is not how a lady should act!” Bai Xiaofei scolded.</p> 
 <p>Duan Yiyi stuck out her tongue. Meanwhile, the rest realized one thing: from this moment on, they had to completely adapt to their new identities!</p> 
 <p>“Fang Ye, take the madams and ladies to find a comfortable inn and check if there are any good business opportunities around while you’re at it. We did not travel thousands of miles to return empty-handed.” Bai Xiaofei looked at Fang Ye.</p> 
 <p>“Rest assured, boss.” Fang Ye respectfully bowed.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei nodded with satisfaction before turning to Wang Hang and Wu Chi.</p> 
 <p>“Wang Hang, Wu Chi, you two follow me. The rest escort the madams and ladies.”</p> 
 <p>With that, the group divided into two. Fang Ye led a large team toward the largest inn in Starflame – the Fragrant House, while Bai Xiaofei took Wang Hang and Wu Chi to the shopping district. Businessmen naturally had to act like businessmen. Moreover, considering the particularity of Blood Diamonds, they should gain something there.</p> 
 <p>After all, those who were watching Starnet also need an appropriate identity!</p> 
 <p>“Fifty thousand gold coins!”</p> 
 <p>“Fifty thousand gold coins for this peak-grade Blood Diamond? You must be out of your mind. One hundred thousand!”</p> 
 <p>“One hundred and twenty thousand!”</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s group had just entered the shopping district when a noisy small stall on the sidewalk attracted their attention. There, they saw a scholarly-looking middle-aged man standing in the center with a glittering red Blood Diamond in his hand, while the people around him were either watching the show or drooling.</p> 
 <p>A peak-grade Blood Diamond, said to be able to turn an ordinary person into a puppet master!</p> 
 <p>After understanding the situation, Bai Xiaofei’s group smiled at each other. Who knew that it would be this smooth?</p> 
 <p>“My friend, that is a peak-grade Blood Diamond. If you sell it somewhere else, the price would be much higher than what you’re being offered.” Bai Xiaofei’s aged voice rang out and penetrated the crowd, immediately calming everyone down.</p> 
 <p><em>You either bid or listen. What’s the point of saying that? Asking for someone else?</em></p> 
 <p>“This brother, I don’t want to do this either, but my friend is trapped in a store. If I don’t bring money back to redeem him, we may not be able to see the sun tomorrow.” The seller was full of helplessness as he looked like he was going to burst into tears.</p> 
 <p>“If you can answer my question, I can help you get through this ordeal,” Bai Xiaofei offered with a smile.</p> 
 <p>The seller immediately perked up his ears and put away the Blood Diamond. If he could, he would very much like to keep it. However, his act made the crazy bidders very unhappy.</p> 
 <p>“Hey! Old man, don’t you have eyes? How dare you ruin…” shouted a crude, burly man.</p> 
 <p>However, the man couldn’t finish his words as Wang Hang had appeared before him in a flicker. Despite not using his puppet, Wang Hang was still extremely fast.</p> 
 <p>“Say one more word, and the ground under you will turn red.” Wang Hang’s eyes were filled with murderous intent.</p> 
 <p>The surrounding immediately turned silent.</p> 
 <p>“Well, now that the trash has shut up, I think we can talk.” Bai Xiaofei smiled, which along with his current appearance made him look especially crafty.</p> 
 <p>The seller inwardly panicked. “What do you want to know?” He gulped, suddenly feeling regret. For some reason, he felt that he would rather have sold the Blood Diamond if he could turn back time.</p> 
 <p>“Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. I am Bai Shicheng<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>, a branch president of the Illusion Demon Merchant Group. Don’t be nervous, my friend, I just want to ask if you have more Blood Diamonds. Our merchant group is very interested in this newly popular item.” Bai Xiaofei took out an Amethyst Card. “This card has five hundred thousand gold coins. If you can give us any useful information, it will be yours.”</p> 
 <p>Looking at the Amethyst Card, the seller swallowed a big mouthful of saliva.</p> 
 <p>Five hundred thousand gold coins, enough to buy three of the peak-grade Blood Diamonds he had!</p> 
 <p>“Come with me!”</p> 
 <p>The seller made up his mind after long hesitation, and then, embarked on a road of no return…</p>
