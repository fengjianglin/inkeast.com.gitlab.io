 <p>Heh! That title caught your attention, didn’t it? :P Well, I’m not kidding! We present to you <a href="https://www.volarenovels.com/novel/rebirth-of-a-fashionista" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">Rebirth of a Fashionista</span></strong></a>!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>Time always went by faster when there was no need to attend classes. In the blink of an eye, three days of steadily accumulating points ended.</p>
 <p>“This is our final match so pay attention. This time, our opponents aren't rookies anymore. Of course, we might not even need to fight at all.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei reminded them before the match. Class 56 was against them this time and they were one of the classes with a Newcomer King. By now, apart from Lin Li, the other eight Newcomer Kings had already been revealed. Each of them had fought in the matches to some extent. However, they only revealed a tiny part of their strength.</p>
 <p>This time, the Savage Class’s opponent was one of the eight classes with a Newcomer King. Tai Shan was the class monitor of this class and an Energy Stream defensive puppet master. Based on his recent performances, he was someone with frightening control over the earth. &nbsp;Similar to the Savage Class, class 56 had won all their previous matches. This was their final match as well.</p>
 <p>Therefore, the chances of Tai Shan going easy on them was slim. Hence everyone was slightly stunned when they heard Bai Xiaofei mention that they might not have to fight. Before long, class 56 walked up as well. They were being led by Tai Shan, the Newcomer King with a sturdy build.</p>
 <p>Now that both parties were present, they agreed to start the match around ten minutes earlier. After stepping into the ring, Bai Xiaofei and Tai Shan flashed a smile at each other.</p>
 <p>“I am Tai Shan. I have admired you for a long time, brother. I never expected our first meeting to be like this.”</p>
 <p>Tai Shan grinned, revealing a row of white teeth.</p>
 <p>“Don’t say that. You are a Newcomer King. I should be the one admiring you.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei laughed and flatteries started pouring out of his mouth as well.</p>
 <p>“Brother, you have been fighting for an entire day, right? I heard from the judge that you guys have basically never left the ring.”</p>
 <p>Tai Shan commented, the expression in his gaze shifted slightly.</p>
 <p>“Still, we are not as ruthless as you, brother. I heard that nobody is even willing to get in your ring. Everyone pretty much gave up without a fight.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>What Bai Xiaofei meant was: <em>You may have been investigating us, but we haven’t been idle either.</em></p>
 <p>“Brother, why don’t we use a different method to determine the winner? Battling it out all the time will only hurt our friendship. This is our first meeting after all.”</p>
 <p>The moment Tai Shan spoke, the members of both classes were stunned. Bai Xiaofei was the only exception. Rather than being shocked, he was overjoyed.</p>
 <p>“Brother, I was about to suggest this as well. I truly dislike fighting. If possible, I would much prefer to settle things in a civilized manner as well.”</p>
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei spoke, his classmates behind him all shot him a look of disdain.</p>
 <p><em>You don’t like fighting? Every time we fight, your punches are the hardest!</em></p>
 <p>“Haha, this is the case of heroes agreeing with each other, then! Brother, what do you propose?”</p>
 <p>Tai Shan’s eyes lit up as he flashed a smile that was as bright as Bai Xiaofei’s.</p>
 <p>“How about a game of rock–paper–scissors?”</p>
 <p>After thinking about it for a while, Bai Xiaofei proposed something that was ridiculously risky. Tai Shan clapped his hands in joy and accepted the proposal.</p>
 <p><em>What the hell? Is this really a decision made by the class monitors of two classes with Newcomer Kings?</em></p>
 <p>“We might as well make it quick and decide the victor with a single round. Are you fine with this, brother?”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei clenched his fist and smiled.</p>
 <p><em>If I’m going to gamble, I might as well raise the stakes!</em></p>
 <p>“Of course I’m fine. This will only make things more exciting!”</p>
 <p>Once again, Tai Shan agreed to Bai Xiaofei’s proposal. The students of both classes felt their brains short circuiting.</p>
 <p><em>What sort of class monitor decides things this way?!</em></p>
 <p>“Rock, paper, scissors!”</p>
 <p>Despite being dissatisfied, everyone still paid close attention when Bai Xiaofei and Tai Shan started their game of rock papers scissors. Within a second, the victor was decided!</p>
 <p>“Thank you for having mercy on me, brother. Do come look for me when you are free. I will treat you to a meal!”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei grinned as he patted Tai Shan’s shoulder.</p>
 <p>“Aaiii, the one who agrees to bet must accept the loss. You did well this time. I hope you will go easy on us when we meet again during the New Student Tournament!”</p>
 <p>Despite what he said, Tai Shan did not look the slightest bit disappointed. It was as if he had already been prepared for this result.</p>
 <p>“Brother, you are saying these words way too early. In fact, I too hope that you will go easy on me when the time comes.”</p>
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei spoke, the judge arrived beside them.</p>
 <p>“Congratulations, class 456. This is the proof of participation that will give your class access to the New Student Tournament. We hope that you will do well.”</p>
 <p>Usually, these words were part of a routine for the judge. However, this time, the judge was very sincere. Even after observing the Savage Class's matches for an entire day, he still wasn't able to get a measure of their true strength despite being a Grandmaster Rank. As such, he spoke very sincerely to them.</p>
 <p>“I hope so as well, teacher.” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>After saying his goodbyes to the judge and Tai Shan, Bai Xiaofei brought the Savage Class to the Hundred Flavor House again. This time, they were celebrating for real. They had now advanced to the next round!</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Fei, do you know that they're going to update the Blossom Ranking?”</p>
 <p>Halfway through the meal, Fang Ye went over to Bai Xiaofei and asked. Bai Xiaofei’s eyes lit up when he heard the question.</p>
 <p>“This is good news. It’s another opportunity to earn big.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei spoke with the smile similar to an unscrupulous businessman. Pride was written all over his face. Unfortunately, his joy was short lived.</p>
 <p>“If nothing unexpected happens, Lin Li, Big Sister Xue, and that Hu Xian’er who has been visiting you frequently will be in the ranking. Moreover, both Lin Li and Hu Xian’er are popular choices for first place.”</p>
 <p>Fang Ye was telling Bai Xiaofei all this in a hush-hush manner. Although it wasn't anything secretive, things would not end well for Bai Xiaofei if Xue Ying and Lin Li heard them talking about Hu Xian'er. Fang Ye was still smart enough to know when to open his mouth.</p>
 <p>“What are you two whispering about? You can't share with us?”</p>
 <p>Xue Ying was an incredibly sensitive person. From their sneaky behavior, she knew they weren’t talking about anything good.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, it’s something not appropriate for you ladies. We’re having a man-to-man talk here.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei raised his eyebrow at Xue Ying with a knowing expression on his face. Xue Ying replied with an incomparably cold snort and they actually escaped from this "crisis". However, it ended up attracting Mo Ka and the other guys' attention.</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Fei, it may be inappropriate for them but not for us, right?”</p>
 <p>“Piss off. What does a wimpy kid like you want to know everything for? Go and eat obediently.”</p>
 <p>After chasing Mo Ka and others away, Bai Xiaofei stopped his discussion with Fang Ye. But he was in no mood to continue eating anymore. He knew better than anyone what the Blossom Ranking was. Anyone in the ranking would attract wave after wave of “attacks” from males. With both Hu Xian’er and Lin Li being new students, the “attacks” from the seniors would be incomparably intense.</p>
 <p>Even now, a lot of well-informed people must have already set their eyes on the two girls.</p>
 <p>“Brother Fei, why don’t we have a talk with Senior Yun? Perhaps we can try to alter their ranks?”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Bai Xiaofei was in deep thought, Fang Ye offered his plan after a short while.</p>
 <p>“No, that's unrealistic. Forget about whether Yun Jingshuang will actually agree to this, the Blossom Ranking is determined through votes. Since everyone will be able to see the results, it won’t be easy to fake it.”</p>
 <p>Despite rejecting Fang Ye's idea, a firm expression appeared on Bai Xiaofei's face. “You don’t have to worry about this. I will be able to solve my own problems.”</p>
 <p><em>I’ll take you on no matter how many of you there are!</em></p>
