 <p>Chapter 336: An Intent Gaze from Yelu!</p> 
 <p>As soon as Bai Xiaofei’s words ended, Huskie beside him immediately barked at the Earthshrew. It was paid to translate, so Huskie would be particularly proactive to take on work every time there was such an opportunity.</p> 
 <p>The Earthshrew was obviously stunned upon hearing what Huskie said and it looked at Bai Xiaofei in panic. In the end, under Bai Xiaofei’s coercion, the Earthshrew spilled everything it knew. Bai Xiaofei did as promised and let it go… into the hands of Xiaoluo and Xiaobu.</p> 
 <p><em>I only said one is to answer questions and the other is to die. I never said I’d let you off after answering! So don’t frame this pure heart of mine. I, Bai Xiaofei, am a man of my word!</em></p> 
 <p>The result of the Earthshrew could be imagined. After it had beaten Xiaobu to such a state, it would be a surprise if Xiaoluo would let it be.</p> 
 <p>“You should have asked all there is to ask, right?” Hu Xian’er walked over with a frown. Xiaobu had just told her everything – She was being targeted by another Emperor Rank magical beast.</p> 
 <p>“If you are referring to Yelu targeting you, I think I know a little more about it than you now.” Bai Xiaofei looked as reassuring as ever with a faint smile on his face. “Let’s go to another place first. We never know if those shrews may have something on their bodies that can reveal our position.”</p> 
 <p>It was never wrong to be cautious because, on this strange continent, you could never guess what strange abilities your enemy might have.</p> 
 <p>It turned out that Bai Xiaofei was right indeed. Shortly after they left, a bright-yellow leopard covered in silver light sped over. Sniffing the stench of blood drifting in the air, it shook its head.</p> 
 <p>“I’m still late. Old Third was right, we can’t put too much trust in those shrews.” A low voice came from the leopard’s mouth, its tone laced with a hint of pity.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei’s group arrived at another location. Xiaoluo and Xiaobu were enclosed in a capsule made of Hu Xian’er’s energy.</p> 
 <p>“Still haven’t found it?” Bai Xiaofei’s face was tense. It was almost certain that Xiaoluo and Xiaobu had been somehow marked by the enemy earlier. Otherwise, it would be nonsense for four Earthshrews to be able to lock on to their location over such a long period.</p> 
 <p>“Found it!”</p> 
 <p>Delight appeared on Hu Xian’er’s sweaty face. At the same time, a sliver of energy was injected into Xiaoluo’s and Xiaobu’s bodies and wiped away the marks made by the golden wolf.</p> 
 <p>“Now we can be at ease.” Heaving a long sigh of relief, Bai Xiaofei’s expression also relaxed.</p> 
 <p>“Shall we go back?” Hu Xian’er cast an inquiring look at Bai Xiaofei after everything was handled.</p> 
 <p>“We’ve come all the way here, plus Xiaoluo and Xiaobu have been hunted like that. If we don’t do anything, they’ll think we are too good-tempered!” With the air of a thug, Bai Xiaofei spat maliciously.</p> 
 <p>“What about the Blossom Ranking? You’re not gonna show up for the next performance?” Hu Xian’er expressed her worries. If the two of them leaving the academy were exposed, it wouldn’t be easy to explain.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, today’s host is Senior Sister Qianye. In addition, there is no one I know in the second batch. It’s all good so long as I give them a bonus at the end,” said Bai Xiaofei frankly. No one could change his determination to get back some revenge with ‘interest’ from the enemy.</p> 
 <p>His ‘an eye for an eye’ motto didn’t only apply to humans.</p> 
 <p>“Then what do you want to do?” Hu Xian’er was a little timorous. The fox clan had always been a fugitive in the Infinite Mountain Range. She had never even thought of fighting back.</p> 
 <p>“We’re going to tell them that we are no pushovers, of course! If they want to touch us, they have to prepare to pay the price! Otherwise, Xiaoluo and Xiaobu won’t have a single peaceful day in the future!”</p> 
 <p>In fact, Bai Xiaofei still had a deeper worry. Today, he and Hu Xian’er had arrived in time, but what about the future? No one could guarantee that it wouldn’t happen again. If Xiaoluo and Xiaobu were really killed because of this, both he and Hu Xian’er would blame themselves for a long time.</p> 
 <p>“Alright! You tell us what to do!” Hu Xian’er made up her mind after considering Xiaoluo and Xiaobu.</p> 
 <p>“We call Xing and Hong over first. The more the merrier!” Bai Xiaofei chuckled, his plan for revenge had begun!</p> 
 <p>“I can call Uncle Feng too, do you want me to?” Hu Xian’er suddenly mentioned a name Bai Xiaofei had never heard of, which stunned him a little.</p> 
 <p>“Uncle Feng is a peak King Rank Wildwind Leopard. He is very strong!”</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei looked at Hu Xian’er saying this with a serious face, a hint of inexplicable jealousy rose in his heart.</p> 
 <p><em>What do you mean very strong? Only peak of the King Rank?! This lord has even schemed the death of an Exquisite Rank big boss!</em></p> 
 <p>Of course, Bai Xiaofei didn’t have the courage to say this out loud.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, it would be better if you can call even more!” Saying words that were against his will, Bai Xiaofei started to bear a grudge for this ‘Uncle Feng.’ There was no other reason, just because the leopard was remembered by Hu Xian’er…</p> 
 <p>Men were selfish. They lingered in various flowers but didn’t want their women to have contact with the opposite sex. This was a bad habit that was hard to change. And Bai Xiaofei was only a normal man. However, he was good at controlling his emotions; moreover, Hu Xian’er had also given him the green light, even though he hadn’t dared to use it…</p> 
 <p>Also, he knew that no other men would have a chance with Hu Xian’er! This wasn’t confidence, but trust!</p> 
 <p>After a long wait, Xing, Hong, and the ‘Uncle Feng’ that Hu Xian’er’s mentioned arrived respectively. Just like Bai Xiaofei was full of alert towards Uncle Feng, the latter was full of hostility towards him.</p> 
 <p>“Xian’er, what is going on with this human?!” Uncle Feng stared fixedly at Bai Xiaofei with murderous intent. “No, that’s not right, why does he have your smell?!”</p> 
 <p>After observing carefully, the murderous light in Uncle Feng’s eyes instantly turned into horror as if he was seeing something absolutely unbelievable.</p> 
 <p>Well, it would still be unbelievable even if admitted out aloud. Who could imagine that a royal magical beast would stoop so low as to give herself to a human puppet master who had just reached the Master Rank?</p> 
 <p>“Uncle Feng, right? Let me officially introduce myself. My name is Bai Xiaofei, Xian’er’s prospective husband.” Walking to Uncle Feng with a big smile, Bai Xiaofei fearlessly held out his hand while declaring his position.</p> 
 <p><em>Old geezer, only I can call her Xian’er! Who told you to run your mouth recklessly? Watch as this lord angers you to death!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s introduction startled Uncle Feng for 5 seconds, emotions constantly changing in his eyes as he stared at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Xian’er, how can you be so stupid! You know…”</p> 
 <p>“Uncle Feng, please don’t say anymore. This is my own business, I believe my choice to be right! You are my only elder, I just want your blessings. Please?” Hu Xian’er interrupted Uncle Feng in a pleading voice.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Hong and Xing, Xiaoluo and Xiaobu gawked in amazement. <em>Is this the legendary ‘meeting the future parents-in-law’?</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was thunderstruck.</p> 
 <p><em>Holy shit, he’s her elder! Thank the stars I didn’t go overboard just now!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei thought as fear suddenly burst in his heart.</p> 
 <p><em>But…</em></p> 
 <p><em>She called him Uncle Feng! Uncle!! What else can he be if not an elder?! Did something go wrong with your brains, Bai Xiaofei?!</em></p> 
 <p>Perhaps this was what they meant by ‘the IQ of people in love always decrease’…</p>
