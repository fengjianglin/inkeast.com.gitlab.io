 <p>Chapter 812: Scum!!!</p> 
 <p>As the message was successfully sent out by Golden Feather, Fang Ye’s group who had been waiting outside immediately grew excited. However, anxiety quickly followed after they listened to the content.</p> 
 <p>They knew they would clash with that organization again, but did not expect it to be this early. Was the world really so small?</p> 
 <p>“Be prepared, this mission has far exceeded our imagination.”</p> 
 <p>Although Fang Ye’s tone was calm, anyone could feel the storm within him, because they were the same!</p> 
 <p>Shadow Death, the thorn in their hearts!</p> 
 <p>Although Bai Xiaofei mentioned that it was merely a guess, he never made random excessive guesses. His telling them about it basically meant he was almost certain.</p> 
 <p>“Old Fang, get it together. Since Boss sent us a message, don’t tell me you don’t know what this means?” Mo Ka patted Fang Ye’s shoulder with a rare seriousness and a stiff expression the same as that year when he had killed his way back to Starnet.</p> 
 <p>Mo Ka’s reminder woke everyone with a start.</p> 
 <p><em>That’s right!</em></p> 
 <p>Since Bai Xiaofei was forced to send a message for help, it meant that they were his only hope. Otherwise, how could he let them move ahead of time? After all, this was not the first task on the list that Bai Xiaofei gave them!</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go, I don’t want to be left behind by our big simpleton Wu.” Xu Chen threw her greatsword on her shoulder with a valiant expression.</p> 
 <p>The group exchanged glances and burst out laughing. Although they didn’t know what had happened, Bai Xiao had said before that in his absence, the Windlove Army would be under Fang Ye’s command. Just like this, the grand force that was supposed to be left for the finish joined the battlefield full of unknowns.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the underground battles had entered a climax. There were few who decided not to fight like Bai Xiaofei and most of them fought with their lives right upon seeing the opponent. Many of those who were supposedly friends even wielded their weapons at each other.</p> 
 <p>They all had the same idea. The more someone tried to hinder them, the greater the benefits that someone wanted to hide from them; in front of benefits, everything else had to step aside!</p> 
 <p>“Where the hell are you?!!” Insta-killing another opponent, Hu Xian’er’s eyes were bloodshot. For Bai Xiaofei’s safety, the only way she could think of was to kill her opponents as soon as possible until she entered the same space as him.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, Hu Xian’er expected too much. Even if she killed everyone, she wouldn’t run into him.</p> 
 <p>Without any hesitation, she passed through the space barrier again. <em>This time, it must be you!</em></p> 
 <p>The light flashed and she entered a new space. The result did not change at all, but the difference was that the new opponent made her pause.</p> 
 <p><em>Troublesome…</em></p> 
 <p>Although Hu Xian’er did not know the person in front of her, she sensed danger from him.</p> 
 <p>“Unify Business is really unreliable, they actually dare to move against us. However, they still underestimated us!”</p> 
 <p>When the man spoke, Hu Xian’er finally remembered who he was. They had met once. As one of the four puppet masters with Tong Fei that went to the slave market, he was, without a doubt, an executive of the All-Around Merchant Group.</p> 
 <p>His name was Ji Xian, a three-aperture Exquisite Rank puppet master!</p> 
 <p>“Oh hey, a high flyer of Starnet, huh?” Ji Xian licked his lips upon seeing Hu Xian’er.</p> 
 <p>In the face of Ji Xian’s provocation, Hu Xian’er’s emotions were completely unmoved. Her energy surged and she charged towards him. <em>No matter who you are, I must kill you!</em></p> 
 <p>Holding the attitude of probing the opponent’s depth, Hu Xian’er did not use Permanence. However, her raw speed at full strength was already extremely terrifying.</p> 
 <p>“Not bad to have this speed at the peak of the Grandmaster Rank, but unfortunately, what my ability restrains best is the speed-type!” Ji Xian calmly said. At the same time, a circle of energy ripples spread from him.</p> 
 <p>Upon being hit by the ripples, Hu Xian’er’s heart tightened. She was too familiar with this type of energy!</p> 
 <p>It was time, and the time flow around her was slowing down!</p> 
 <p>Just like with Hu Xian’er’s Permanence, Ji Xian was not affected by his own time skill. He swung his arm and a sword condensed from energy shot at Hu Xian’er.</p> 
 <p>At that critical moment, Hu Xian’er did not hesitate to launch Permanence. With the collision of the two time forces, the entire space distorted and neither of them could escape. The energy in their bodies started to rapidly drain away, followed by their vitality. It was as if they were being punished by time. Every second felt like years!</p> 
 <p>Aware of this crisis, the two retracted their time energy, and everything around instantly returned to normal, including their bodies.</p> 
 <p>Then, they stood there staring at each other intently as their hearts were both overtaken by a storm. This was their first time meeting an opponent with the same ability. Besides feeling things were difficult, they still felt a lingering fear of what could have happened.</p> 
 <p>If they had been any slower to retract their time force, they would have died!</p> 
 <p>“Without the power of time, you are nothing, am I right?” After the horror, Ji Xian sneered and summoned all of his puppets. Roughly judging their ability from their appearance, his puppets seemed out of tune with the time ability he had just used.</p> 
 <p>This speculation covered Hu Xian’er’s face in frost.</p> 
 <p>“Your time ability is not your own?!” Her voice was as icy as if coming from hell as she immediately recalled the effect of the Blood Diamonds.</p> 
 <p>“Oooh! Not bad. Since you guessed this after seeing my puppets, you must know the effect of the Blood Diamonds. My time ability did come from one, and the little girl who contributed it was about the same age as you!” Ji Xian said with an expression of great enjoyment and licked his lips. “If I am not mistaken, your time ability comes from a special physique. If I also make you into a Blood Diamond, I will be able to advance!”</p> 
 <p>“You can die now!!” Unprecedented fury rose from the bottom of Hu Xian’er’s heart. She finally understood what Bai Xiaofei had felt earlier.</p> 
 <p>The entire All-Around Merchant Group was scum!!!</p>
