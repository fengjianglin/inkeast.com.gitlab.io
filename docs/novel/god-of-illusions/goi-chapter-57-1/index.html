 <p><span style>“Of course, so long as you’re able to tolerate those family members of mine. They’re very troublesome.” The corners of Bai Xiaofei’s mouth couldn’t help but twitch as he spoke because the people in the Gorge of Heroes were a group of people that were cast aside by the continent, and practically every single one of them were driven into a corner and forced to go there in the end, despite Bai Xiaofei actually feeling that they were a group of pitiable people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How troublesome could they be? I’ve seen all sorts of storms.” Xue Ying had a trace of displeasure on her face as she spoke because she felt Bai Xiaofei was turning her down in a roundabout way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All sorts of storms? You’re only a few years older to me. I’ve always been thinking about how you tricked the academy to actually allow you to be a teacher.” Bai Xiaofei finally spoke the words in his heart, and he couldn’t help but feel at ease.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was uncomfortable to keep restraining some words without speaking them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re the one that relied on tricks! I relied on true ability! I believe that the class I lead will surely be able to obtain the first in the New Student Competition this time!” Xue Ying’s tone was filled with confidence, whereas, Bai Xiaofei didn’t refute her this time because he thought so as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Will we still be able to see you again after these three months pass?” For some unknown reason, Bai Xiaofei kept having the feeling that Xue Ying would one day vanish from his life, and this feeling grew stronger the deeper he got to know Xue Ying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course you’ll be able to. I have no intention of leaving Starnet Academy in the short term…. Unless you’re expelled. As she laughed and spoke of an assumption that was extremely likely, Xue Ying turning around and stared right at Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? You can’t bear to part with me after just two days?” Xue Ying’s voice carried a trace of a teasing tone, and Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but blush.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Che, who can’t bear to part with you? I’m only afraid that you won’t be able to find any students that can endure your torture after you leave us.” Bai Xiaofei casually made up an excuse before turning his head around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry. I’ll absolutely not continue being a Headteacher after I finish with your class because one year is enough.” Xue Ying’s face carried a trace of satisfaction as she spoke with a light voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, let me ask you something.” After staying silent for a short moment, Xue Ying suddenly called out to Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go ahead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think I’m a good girl?” This suddenly question stunned Bai Xiaofei slightly, and as he looked at Xue Ying serious gaze, Bai Xiaofei swallowed back the instinctive blow he was about to give her and started contemplating seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I refuse to answer this question. But, if there comes a day where you need my help, then I surely won’t refuse.” As he replied with a similarly serious expression, Bai Xiaofei successfully obtained a slightly good impression. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Sometimes, truthfulness is much more useful than sweet words….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then if I was a fellow student of yours as well, would you be more willing to be with me or Lin Li?” Bai Xiaofei didn’t know what had gotten into Xue Ying, but every single one of her questions was trickier and more excessive than the previous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m more willing to be together with the both of you.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, Bai Xiaofei had spoken the truth once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure enough, all men are rotten. You really have a nice dream there.” His truthfulness this time didn’t obtain Xue Ying’s acknowledgment but received deep disdain from her instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you ever gazed at the stars wholeheartedly?” Bai Xiaofei took the initiative to lead the topic of conversation to the right track, and he asked a question that caused Xue Ying to be slightly stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Ying moved her gaze towards the starry sky and she gradually fell into deep contemplation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I haven’t in the past, but I have now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you have nothing else to do, then gaze at them more. You will feel that there are some people looking at you from there, hoping that you live better as the days go by, hoping that you’re happy every single day.” Bai Xiaofei grinned as he spoke of the little bit of experience he’d summarized himself, and then he stared silently at the stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who do you think is looking at you from up there?” Xue Ying asked with a light voice while a trace of confusion appeared on her face because she didn’t know who she should hope for.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That father and mother of mine that I haven’t seen. Even though they’ve never taken care of me, but I know they surely have their own difficulties.” Bai Xiaofei smiled as he fell once more into silence, and even Xue Ying didn’t make a sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, this time, Xue Ying wasn’t so confused anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai Xiaofei.” Both of them stared at the starry sky for an unknown period of time before Xue Ying suddenly called out to Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Bai Xiaofei who’d been questioned by her to the point of slightly suffering from neuroticism was startled once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you.” Xue Ying lightly spat out two words before a wisp of an alluring blush appeared on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei stared fixedly at Xue Ying and suddenly felt the circulation of blood in his body speed up by at least one level while his intense heartbeat urged him to approach Xue Ying bit by bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Ying had noticed this as well. But, she didn’t avoid him and gradually closed her eyes instead….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under the rays of moonlight, two faces gradually approached each other, and the silent night sky seemed to be building a suitable atmosphere for the two of them until four icy cold lips lightly touched together….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instantly, Xue Ying suddenly jolted awake and stared wide open at Bai Xiaofei who was right beside her before reflexively raising her palm….</span></p>
 <p><span style>A clear and resounding sound reverberated through the night sky. When Bai Xiaofei crawled up from the ground, Xue Ying had already vanished without a trace, yet that icy cold feeling still coiled around his lips….</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Xue Ying who’d fled the scene of the crime was like a madman. She was running madly through the boundless forest, and the strong winds that whistled past her face didn’t lower the temperature of her face in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she stopped running while gasping for breath, Xue Ying’s heart was thumping violently, and even she was unable to differentiate if her heart was thumping from her running or from what had happened earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“AH!!! You aren’t Xue Ying! You’re Blood Shadow!!! You’re Blood Shadow!!! You can’t make a mistake!! Can’t make a mistake!!!”[1. Her name is ‘</span><span style>雪影</span><span style>’ which can be translated to Xue Ying or Snow Shadow, and the Blood Shadow referred to here is ‘</span><span style>血影</span><span style>’. They both sound alike yet are written differently.] As she shouted loudly, Xue Ying finally gradually calmed down. But the content of her screams was something that no one but herself could here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Ying took a deep breath before walking back towards the Savage Class’s campsite….</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sun rose as usual, whereas, Bai Xiaofei who was in the tent had a wet dream for the first time in his life, and the female lead in the dream was….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai Xiaofei, I’ll make you run 20 rounds today if you still don’t get the f*ck out here!” When he heard the voice that was moaning lightly in his dreams roaring his name madly, Bai Xiaofei suddenly jolted awake, and his first reaction was to charge out. But, he felt a slippery feeling before he could even stand up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was impossible for him to go out, so the helpless Bai Xiaofei could only take off his underwear, and it was right at this moment that his tent’s flap was pulled open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai Xiaofei, do you….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei was stunned, and so was Xue Ying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Err…. This…. I…. That….” The tent’s flap was instantly closed. Even until the end, Bai Xiaofei hadn’t said a single complete sentence, whereas, after she closed the tent, Xue Ying instantly adjusted her expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, she overlooked her attitude before she opened the flap of the tent….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Sister Xue? What’s wrong with Big Brother Fei?” Mo Ka who wore a worried expression intended to go over and have a look, but how could Xue Ying possibly allow him to go over?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He had a nightmare. I’ve woken him, and he’ll come out before long.” Compared to Bai Xiaofei, Xue Ying’s lies were truly inferior, but she was lucky that the group of students wouldn’t think too much….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Along with Bai Xiaofei hastily running out of his tent, this incident could be considered to have past….</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, was this really the last time?</span></p>
