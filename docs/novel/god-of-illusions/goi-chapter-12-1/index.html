 <p>“The academy permits teachers to threaten students?” Bai Xiaofei’s brows knit tightly together as he asked rhetorically with a serious expression.</p>
 <p>“The academy encourages teachers to use different methods to teach their own students. I’m completely capable of saying that it was for the sake of tempering your obedience.” Xue Ying used her power for personal use with a serious expression on her face, and it revealed that she wasn’t a simple figure as well.</p>
 <p>“Obedience? Don’t think that I came from some small village and don’t know anything. We’re in an academy, not an army, so why would we need that?” Bai Xiaofei laughed lightly, and his expression seemed to be saying ‘I’ve already seen through you’.</p>
 <p>But, Xue Ying didn’t reveal the slightest panic this time.</p>
 <p>“Yes, you really are from a small village. Could it be that you haven’t heard that more than 60% of those who graduate from Starnet Academy enter the army of the various Empires?” As she returned a disdainful expression to him, Xue Ying finally occupied the advantage for the first time.</p>
 <p>“Hello, Big Sister Xue!” However, Xue Ying hadn’t even enjoyed her complacency when the words she’d looked forward to for so long had drifted out from Bai Xiaofei’s mouth.</p>
 <p>But, for some unknown reason, Xue Ying didn’t feel any delight from Bai Xiaofei’s submission, and she felt frustrated instead.</p>
 <p>However, Xue Ying didn’t have any reason to continue making it difficult for Bai Xiaofei any longer.</p>
 <p>“Clean up the classroom and repair the door before the next student comes in, otherwise, you can wait to receive death!” As she glared coldly at Bai Xiaofei, Xue Ying who followed the principle of creating a reason when she had no reason to make things difficult for Bai Xiaofei had given him a ‘difficult problem’.</p>
 <p>But, the plot didn’t develop towards the direction she envisioned.</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Xue, I’m done.” Bai Xiaofei who wasn’t out of breath or even faintly flushed stood before Xue Ying whose face was ashen, and he’d completed the task with skill and ease.</p>
 <p>Earlier, while Bai Xiaofei was working, Xue Ying had looked out countless times yet not to mention their class, even the entire ‘commoners district’ didn’t have a single visitor.</p>
 <p>“Exactly how good was your results? Could it be that you were the first?” Xue Ying’s voice was filled with disbelief as she scanned Bai Xiaofei who was before her once more.</p>
 <p>“If nothing unexpected happened, then I should be. After all, no one had arrived at the entrance when I entered it.” Bai Xiaofei smiled lightly as he made a slightly modest remark.</p>
 <p>“But, why would the first be sent here? You ought to have gone to the excellent student….” Xue Ying spoked halfway before swallowing the rest because being the Head Teacher of the worst class in the entire academy wasn’t something that deserved to be mentioned frequently.</p>
 <p>But, who was Bai Xiaofei? A few words of Xue Ying’s were already sufficient for him to confirm what he’d suspected for a long time.</p>
 <p>“It’s nothing, I just went to see Vice Principal Luo during the final test.” As he spoke about it casually, Bai Xiaofei didn’t feel too great of a sense of loss because there wasn’t too much difference between a class of excellent students or inferior students to him.</p>
 <p><i>It’s fine so long as I don’t starve to death!</i></p>
 <p>“What about Vice Principal Luo….” As she spoke, Xue Ying’s eyes suddenly opened wide like saucers as she stared at Bai Xiaofei with an expression of disbelief.</p>
 <p>“You’re surnamed Bai yet you actually dared to go see her!!!”</p>
 <p>“Err…. Right, you probably didn’t know….” Her surprised vanished in the blink of an eye as Xue Ying had found an explanation in the first possible moment.</p>
 <p>“It isn’t like how you’re thinking. Someone warned me that she hates people that are surnamed Bai to the extreme.” Xue Ying’s explanation hadn’t even been firmly established when Bai Xiaofei instantly struck an explosive blow to it, causing Xue Ying to be dazed.</p>
 <p>“You knew yet you still went?! Are you an idiot?!” As she looked at Bai Xiaofei as if he was an idiot, Xue Ying had already started to doubt Bai Xiaofei’s intelligence.</p>
 <p>“Don’t you feel that it’s extremely interesting like this?” Bai Xiaofei asked excitedly yet Xue Ying shook her head lightly.</p>
 <p>“Alas…. There really is a generation gap between us.” Bai Xiaofei shook his head as he used this opportunity to strike a heavy blow on Xue Ying.</p>
 <p>But, contrary to his expectation, even though he was able to discern that Xue Ying was still extremely furious, she didn’t flare up, and she forcefully endured it.</p>
 <p>“It’s fine. It isn’t a bad thing for you to have come here. In spite of this classroom looking shabby, your Head Teacher is absolutely the most outstanding!” As she struck her ample chest, Xue Ying’s complacent expression was actually slightly similar to Bai Xiaofei’s.</p>
 <p>“Then if you’re so outstanding, why are you the teacher of this class? I heard from the female senior in charge of registration that this class seems to be called…. The Savage Class?”</p>
 <p>“Nonsense!!!” Bai Xiaofei obtained a reply at the first possible moment, a rather agitated reply.</p>
 <p>“Right, in theory, our class does take the leftovers after the other classes have had their choice. But, results can’t represent everything! Gold can be hidden anywhere, do you understand!?” As she glared angrily at Bai Xiaofei, Xue Ying seemed as if a sore spot of hers had been stabbed.</p>
 <p>But, this anger of hers didn’t last for long because it quickly transformed into an expression of looking at a treasure of inestimable value.</p>
 <p>“Just like you. Your results were clearly the first yet you were sent here because of your ignorance. Trust me, there’ll be more capable people in this class!”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei hurriedly took two steps back as goosebumps arose all over him.</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Xue, I understand now!” After he moved a safe distance away, Bai Xiaofei felt much more at ease.</p>
 <p>“Alright, that’s good.” Xue Ying revealed a satisfied smile as she looked at Bai Xiaofei again.</p>
 <p>“Right, you’re surely extremely formidable since you were able to be the first, right? What ability does your first puppet have? What grade is it?” While she spoke, Xue Ying bent over to look at Huskie who’d always been squatted at the side, and she instantly transformed into a ‘Moe’ young woman while her flawlessly developed figure caused Bai Xiaofei mouth to go dry from the sight of it.</p>
 <p>“It’s so cute. It’s surely at least at the violet-grade, right!?”</p>
 <p>“Err, you might be disappointed….” Bai Xiaofei scratched his head as he revealed a rare blush.</p>
 <p>“It’s fine, it’s fine. Blue-grade is fine as well. What type is the little fellow?” After a moment of embarrassment, Xue Ying changed to a tone of consolation.</p>
 <p>“Illusion Stream!” Bai Xiaofei was extremely fervent as he spoke these two words, and his feeling of pride wasn’t feigned in the slightest.</p>
 <p>But, Xue Ying was utterly stunned when she heard it.</p>
 <p>“A blue-grade Illusion Stream puppet?!!!” All the pleasant surprise on her face froze while Xue Ying’s tone had already completely displayed her current feelings.</p>
 <p>“What? Is the Illusion Stream not good?” Bai Xiaofei had an innocent expression. This was his true thoughts because as far as he was concerned, the Illusion Stream was the strongest.</p>
 <p>“Not good? It isn’t just bad! Amongst all the people I know, there isn’t a single expert that’s from the Illusion Stream! There isn’t even a Master Rank Illusion Stream puppet master amongst them!</p>
 <p>“In my opinion, even if you didn’t ignorantly go to see Vice Principal Luo, you’d be sent here in the end because there would be utterly no one that would choose a puppet master whose first puppet was of the Illusion Stream!” The disappointment on Xue Ying’s face grew more obvious the more she spoke, and it even transformed into despair in the end.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, there’ll be one in the future. There always has to be someone that creates history, right!?” Bai Xiaofei chuckled once again, and he didn’t take Xue Ying’s reaction to heart at all.</p>
 <p>Just like his foster mother had told him, there wasn’t a strongest type of puppet and only puppets that were most suitable to a puppet master! And the Illusion Stream was most suitable to him, Bai Xiaofei!</p>
