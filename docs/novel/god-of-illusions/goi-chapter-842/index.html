 <p>Chapter 842: Have Affinity but no Fate, Ordinary People’s Sorrow!</p> 
 <p>He Chang, whose father ran a small grain shop, should have peacefully lived his ordinary life, got married, and inherited his father’s shop.</p> 
 <p>However, unexpected issues happened.</p> 
 <p>The young master of the largest merchant group in the city set his eyes on the small grain shop and used underhanded means. The shop was gone without He Chang’s father getting any compensation. Not only so, but his father also passed away soon after, leaving only He Chang, who had no idea what to do.</p> 
 <p>He Chang went to the headquarters of the merchant group to settle this account, prepared to die if he had to. Little did he know, there he would meet the love of his life.</p> 
 <p>The young master’s sensible younger sister, Yun Ni, talked to him and helped him get the compensation he deserved. During the process, the young girl unconsciously fell in love with the candid shopkeeper.</p> 
 <p>From then on, they started to keep in contact under the pretext of doing business and did not take long to become an item. However, their good times did not last long as they were discovered by Yun Ni’s father.</p> 
 <p>At first, Yun Ni’s father only gave Yun Ni advice as he did not want her to suffer. As long as she really liked He Chang, they could just recruit him into the family as a son-in-law. He even made his son apologize for what happened to He Chang’s father.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, the couple thought that they would have a happy ending as long as they really loved each other.</p> 
 <p>However, the script did not develop as hoped.</p> 
 <p>One day, Yun Ni’s father suddenly changed his mind and cut off the lovebirds’ connection. He even made it difficult for He Chang and drove him out of the city.</p> 
 <p>Although He Chang did not understand what was going on, he could not let go of Yun Ni. He tried his utmost to see her and got beaten and kicked many times, but never gave up. Until one day, he finally saw her again.</p> 
 <p>Like the hero and heroine in love stories, their love only grew stronger after a long separation. They agreed to meet at the Boundless Flower Sea to get engaged to each other.</p> 
 <p>He Chang was well prepared for this day, and it was indeed as beautiful as their promise. Unfortunately, it was only a sweet dream in the end…</p> 
 <p>After listening to the story, Bai Xiaofei and Tan Xin sank into thought. Finally, Bai Xiaofei smiled.</p> 
 <p>“You two obviously love each other, but can’t be together as the attitude of her family took a 180-degree change. If there is no surprise, I can help you with this,” he said.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, He Chang was struck with delight. “Really?! Brother Bai, you can really help me?!”</p> 
 <p>Feeling alive again, He Chang almost pounced on Bai Xiaofei. However, his joy was quickly replaced by depression.</p> 
 <p>“Ahh… But it’s not possible. Since Yun Ni left, it means that she has made up her mind. She will never change her decision,” he muttered dejectedly.</p> 
 <p>“I saw her expression. She did not want to leave. On the contrary, I think she wants to run away with you even more than you do. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have made such an effort to come here to see you.” Bai Xiaofei looked around. “Since they say this is a holy place for couples, she must have come here with the hope to fill what your love lacks to complete, and in hopes that this legendary place can bring about a turn for the two of you.”</p> 
 <p>Having said that, Bai Xiaofei laughed.</p> 
 <p>“You are very lucky, I am that turn.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s firm eyes gave He Chang hope.</p> 
 <p>“So… what should I do?” He Chang gulped, as the fire in his heart once again ignited.</p> 
 <p>“You don’t have to do anything, just accompany Yun Ni,” Bai Xiaofei said and turned to Tan Xin. “Do me a little favor. It shouldn’t be a problem to catch up with the people who have just left, right?”</p> 
 <p>Without a word, Tan Xin summoned the Windsurfing Ship.</p> 
 <p>Seeing the mighty ship, He Chang widened his eyes and his face was full of astonishment. “You… you… you are a puppet master?!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei did not reply to this. As a puppet master, he really did not feel any superiority in front of ordinary people.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go, we’d better hurry.”</p> 
 <p>After the three boarded the ship, Tan Xin flew it and quickly caught up.</p> 
 <p>Upon sighting the carriage carrying Yun Ni, Bai Xiaofei said, “You two wait here, I’ll go down,” and vanished on the spot.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Yun Ni, who was silently shedding tears, did not notice that a person had appeared in the carriage until he spoke.</p> 
 <p>“Miss Yun Ni?”</p> 
 <p>Startled by the sudden voice, Yun Ni looked up to see Bai Xiaofei. Her eyes were filled with fear, but soon, the fear was replaced by despair.</p> 
 <p>“I have already promised to marry your master. Is there any meaning in you coming here to supervise me?”</p> 
 <p>Yun Ni’s slightly unpleasant response gave Bai Xiaofei new information. It turned out that the other party had puppet masters, which was close to his guess.</p> 
 <p>“I think you misunderstand. I am not from the group you’re thinking of. I represent He Chang,” Bai Xiaofei explained.</p> 
 <p>Upon hearing He Chang’s name, Yun Ni was dumbstruck. Then, she started to scrutinize Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“You don’t have to doubt me. If I’m from that group, I’d have no need to talk to you at all. On another note, I can let you see He Chang right now.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Yun Ni’s suspicion gradually cleared. However, she showed not joy, but rejection.</p> 
 <p>“No matter how He Chang found you, my lord, I am afraid that you will be disappointed. Some things can’t be changed by one person alone. Please tell He Chang to forget me. It is impossible for us,” Yun Ni’s tone was solemn.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei could tell that she was heartbroken by her own words. He said, “Didn’t you make a wish in the Boundless Flower Sea? Don’t you think I’ve come to fulfill that wish? It is difficult for a person to change things, but some people are just capable of such a feat.”</p> 
 <p>Yun Ni froze. She did make a wish, but it was in her heart! How could Bai Xiaofei possibly know?!</p> 
 <p>“Believe me, I have never broken my word!”</p>
