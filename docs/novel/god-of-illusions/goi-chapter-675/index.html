 <p>Chapter 675: Success?</p> 
 <p>Caught between the two options, Bai Xiaofei looked up at the triplets, who had no idea of his struggle as they were immersed in the adaptation to God Control. It had become their consensus to learn the technique as fast as possible to help Bai Xiaofei find a solution to his physical problems in the Holy Snow Mountain.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was deeply touched by their seriousness. Thinking of how there was still a large group of people waiting for his good news at home, he gritted his teeth. </p> 
 <p><em>Damn it! This lord refuses to believe that a technique can ruin me!</em></p> 
 <p>Having made up his mind, Bai Xiaofei memorized the energy circulation route written on the scroll, and then put it back before the triplets noticed what he was going to do.</p> 
 <p>At last, he looked with an aggrieved expression at the thatched cottage where Cang Lan was resting. <em>Just you wait, smelly old man, I will scare you to death!</em></p> 
 <p>Cang Lan’s impact on him was really too deep…</p> 
 <p>Taking the aloof Blackie with him, Bai Xiaofei made his way into the peach blossom forest. After the illusion formation was broken, the place had become a scenic beauty, with the premise that one didn’t go deep into the second layer.</p> 
 <p>“Huskie!” shouted Bai Xiaofei at the top of his lungs upon entering the peach blossom forest.</p> 
 <p>Moments later, a lively Huskie came running with an unfinished Crystal’s Longing in his mouth. The crystals extorted from Bai Xiaofei were the dog’s treasure. He would not eat one unless he couldn’t bear it anymore.</p> 
 <p>Solemnly squatting down to face Huskie, Bai Xiaofei cleared his throat.</p> 
 <p>“I’m going to cultivate an overbearing technique now. If I succeed, the three of us will rise to the top, but if I fail, we are all finished together. Therefore, after I start, you two make sure that I will not be disturbed by anyone. Is that clear?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei, with a rare seriousness, looked at Huskie and Blackie. But what he got in return almost made him vomit blood.</p> 
 <p>Blackie gave him a glare and no other response, while Huskie stretched out his paw.</p> 
 <p>“Since you may die at any time, give me more Crystal’s Longings or we won’t have a chance to eat later.”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Huskie’s voice fell, Bai Xiaofei acted as if he was going to furiously toss the dog.</p> 
 <p>“Go ahead, see who’ll protect you after you throw me. And then those sisters won’t even get to feel the last bit of warmth from your corpse,” Huskie fearlessly said, stopping Bai Xiaofei in the middle of his action.</p> 
 <p>“Fine!”</p> 
 <p>Throwing Huskie on the ground, Bai Xiaofei, panting from anger, took out five Crystal’s Longings while complaining in his heart. <em>Why is Huskie’s intelligence getting higher and higher? At this rate, I’ll be extorted into a poor wretch sooner or later.</em></p> 
 <p>At this thought, Bai Xiaofei looked at Blackie, whose eyes were closed in repose, and a horrifying idea popped up in his mind.</p> 
 <p><em>Don’t tell me that Blackie taught him?! Did I bring a wolf into my house?!!</em></p> 
 <p>Indeed he had, but as far as Blackie was concerned, she was only taking rightful revenge. She would never forget what had happened back in Startnet, and even though she didn’t give up her aloof front despite being under Bai Xiaofei’s roof, there would still be a knot in her heart if she didn’t get her payback.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, she would teach Huskie from time to time. Considering the nature of the student, the process was so hard that she just wanted to claw him to death several times, but the result turned out quite gratifying.</p> 
 <p>The stupid dog had become history, replaced by a brand-new smarter Huskie!</p> 
 <p>However, the result was still slightly off because the only progress Huskie had made was how to extort food from Bai Xiaofei. The rest remained the same, which was why Blackie always shot the dog disdainful eye-rolls. Can’t raise someone up when they are too stupid…</p> 
 <p>With a helpless sigh, Bai Xiaofei stopped himself from guessing further. His current priority was God Control.</p> 
 <p><em>Come! Let’s leave my life to fate!</em></p> 
 <p>Sitting cross-legged, Bai Xiaofei calmed his emotions. The training of catching Snow Moles proved to be of great use with this. He was immediately as calm as still water, and also reduced his energy frequency.</p> 
 <p>Energy from the six store points in his body then flowed toward his heart together, which was extremely dangerous. However, when the energy frequency was reduced to a certain extent, this process was slowed and the risk was reduced as well.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, the tough training Cang Lan had given him could be considered as ‘well-intentioned.’</p> 
 <p>As his energy slowly surged, Bai Xiaofei felt nothing strange at the beginning. However, after the six currents of energy approached the heart at once, it suddenly fluctuated, frightening Bai Xiaofei and making his energy scatter. He spat out a mouthful of blood and fainted…</p> 
 <p>He underestimated how dangerous God Control could be!</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>As time went by bit by bit and life repeated day by day, half a month soon passed.</p> 
 <p>It hadn’t passed without meaning as the triplets had been able to grasp the God Control Technique and passed Cang Lan’s examination.</p> 
 <p>In his words, they could no longer make progress through indoor practice. To advance further, the quickest way was actual combat, and in great intensity at that.</p> 
 <p>The Holy Snow Mountain just happened to be able to satisfy this condition!</p> 
 <p>“Where’s the perv? Why is he missing again?!” Leng Liuying stormed her feet in fury.</p> 
 <p>Her two sisters couldn’t help laughing.</p> 
 <p>“Be considerate. No one accompanied him for a whole day. It’s not easy for him to persist for so long.” Leng Liushuang was the most considerate one as usual, which was why Bai Xiaofei always considered her the weakest link to conquer first. Good people easily got tricked…</p> 
 <p>“You just keep on protecting him. We agreed yesterday that we are going to leave today, and yet he still ran off somewhere. We are always anxious about him, but he is always the least urgent one.” Leng Liuying snorted, already plotting how she should teach Bai Xiaofei a lesson.</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, Bai Xiaofei didn’t keep them waiting for long as he soon appeared in front of everyone.</p> 
 <p>“My bad for making you guys wait,” he apologized with a smile.</p> 
 <p>Leng Liuying was the first to stand up. She viciously looked at him with a humph.</p> 
 <p>“Confess now, what have you been doing?!”</p> 
 <p>However, her query didn’t get her a reply as imagined. Not only did Bai Xiaofei not panic, his smile even grew bigger.</p> 
 <p>“If I said that I went to practice God Control, would you believe it?”</p>
