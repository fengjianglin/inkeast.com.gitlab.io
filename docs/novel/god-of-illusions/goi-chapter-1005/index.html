 <p>Chapter 1005: Versatile Fickle!</p> 
 <p>Bringing the Fickle Army disguised as Sacks soldiers, Bai Xiaofei spent a huge effort to bypass Colorful Star Fortress’ monitoring range and went directly into the core area controlled by the Sacks.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, aren’t we going to Colorful Star Fortress? Why did you go around it?” asked Zhuang Shuo anxiously. Although they had just won a battle, the Fickle Army wasn’t confident to the extent of fearlessness.</p> 
 <p>“Directly infiltrating Colorful Star with just so many of us is a dream. Without a stepping stone, we’d die before we even know it,” replied Bai Xiaofei as he took out a map.</p> 
 <p>While Colorful Star was currently under the control of the Sacks, it had belonged to Moonlight long before that, so Moonlight’s map of the area was much more elaborate than the Sacks.</p> 
 <p>“We are currently standing at one of the three most important routes from the Sacks to Colorful Star Fortress,” Bai Xiaofei started explaining as everyone quickly gathered around him. “We don’t have enough manpower for all three routes, so we can only gamble. This road is the shortest and most convenient one. If they aren’t alert to the point of being heedful in their own territory, we have a high chance of coming across them.”</p> 
 <p>With that, Bai Xiaofei put away the map and looked at Tan Xin.</p> 
 <p>“I know what to do,” Tan Xin said and ran out with her team. In a head-on confrontation, she alone could rival ten, and in an ambush, she could go against an army!</p> 
 <p>“Since it’s a gamble, we have to be prepared for the possibility that we’ll lose. If no one uses this route, we implement Plan B,” Bai Xiaofei continued after Tan Xin’s group left. “Old Zhu, bring some people to scout Colorful Star. I might need you to sneak in and restrain the person in charge of the fortress.”</p> 
 <p>Zhu Chunyang immediately nodded.</p> 
 <p>The only one left, Ye Qingtong, looked seriously at Bai Xiaofei knowing that it was her turn.</p> 
 <p>“Sister Qingtong, you will wander around Colorful Star and kill any patrols you see, then take their place. Use their identity to get into the fortress and lay low until you see my signal. If you can’t get in, then you will have to wait for our news.”</p> 
 <p>With that, everyone was assigned their missions. They exchanged glances, then Zhuang Shuo gulped hesitantly.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, do I still follow you this time?” he asked in a pitiful voice. He also wanted to have his own mission but all that he had done so far was follow Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Otherwise? However, there will be a day that you can decide what to do,” Bai Xiaofei said.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Zhuang Shuo sighed, while Zhu Chunyang and Ye Qingtong immediately understood Bai Xiaofei’s implication and looked at Zhuang Shuo in a different light.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, with you here, that’s impossible.” Zhuang Shuo smiled bitterly as he imagined his gloomy future career.</p> 
 <p>“That depends on your ability. Cut the crap and move. This time we are divided into four groups, so our numbers are our biggest disadvantage. Do not take your opponent head-on unless you have to!” Bai Xiaofei solemnly reminded.</p> 
 <p>Everyone then left with their groups. Bai Xiaofei brought his team to find Tan Xin, who had already arranged her people as well as using her ability of creation to turn the transportation route into a deadly kill zone littered with traps.</p> 
 <p>“Next, we wait.” Taking a deep breath, Bai Xiaofei commanded everyone to hide.</p> 
 <p>Enduring doing nothing while lying in wait was a must-have quality of the Fickle Army. Let alone a day, even if an ambush lasted for days or weeks, Bai Xiaofei still disallowed absolutely any slacking of vigilance. In order to practice this, he had made everyone crawl around a cesspit for three full days! Whenever someone let their guard down just a little, Bai Xiaofei would kick that person down into the pit for a swim.</p> 
 <p>Although this quick method was unorthodox, the painful memory had instilled one thing into the mind of all Fickle soldiers – They must always be on their best when carrying out an ambush!</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, in the main keep of Colorful Star Fortress.</p> 
 <p>A woman who looked to be in her early twenties was sitting quietly in the highest position. Below stood two rows of burly men, none daring to breathe out loud.</p> 
 <p>“What was the situation with Baijiang?” The young woman finally broke the silence.</p> 
 <p>As soon as her voice fell, the big fellow at the very front trembled almost reflexively before stepping forward.</p> 
 <p>“Reporting to Saintess, according to those who escaped and returned, a small army of less than a thousand people sneakily attacked them and led them by the nose the whole time. When they realized what was going on, Baijiang had already died and the fortress was already lost.” The man was sweating profusely, feeling like he was telling a far-fetched tale.</p> 
 <p>A 1,000-troop army emerged victorious over a fortress with 30,000 troops stationed. Even if Baijiang hadn’t been killed, he would be when he returned!</p> 
 <p>“Escaped? And how do those escapees know the specific situation of the opponent?!” The Saintess noticed the key point right away, her voice icy.</p> 
 <p>The man who just wanted to protect his own people knelt down in fear. “Reporting to Saintess, a part of them were captured by the other party, but for some reason, their commander ordered them to be released. The captured ones saw this small army with their own eyes.”</p> 
 <p>The Saintess snorted coldly. “Do you remember what I said after I integrated the tribes?”</p> 
 <p>Her question made the man shake like a leaf. He started reciting with difficulty, “After the great merger, no tribal distinction is allowed. If… if anyone violates this rule, their ears shall be cut off and their eyes gouged…”</p> 
 <p>As soon as he finished, two silver beams shot out. The man shrieked tragically as he collapsed to the ground while hugging his head, and then rolled around in agony.</p> 
 <p>“Since it wasn’t a big mistake, I only took one eye and one ear. If this happens again, I shall take your dog life!” said the Saintess.</p> 
 <p>The man endured the pain and quickly crawled up. “Thank you for your mercy! Thank you for your mercy!!” He repeatedly kowtowed.</p> 
 <p>The Saintess indifferently watched. Then, she slowly sank into thought, her eyes glinting strangely.</p> 
 <p>“Go back and tell the survivors to write a report, especially those who were released. Be as detailed as possible about the situation of that army, especially their commander’s appearance, voice, and name. Do not miss out any information regarding him,” instructed the Saintess.</p> 
 <p>The man retreated with her order.</p> 
 <p>“Anyone else have anything to report?” The Saintess looked at the other men.</p> 
 <p>Despite their extreme fear of her, the men still reported about the affairs they were in charge of. To their shock, the Saintess immediately gave a solution to every problem they encountered until they all retreated with her answers.</p> 
 <p>After they had all left, a young girl who had been standing next to the Saintess came up to her.</p> 
 <p>“Are you worried that this commander is the same person who stopped Ahetu last time?” asked the young girl.</p> 
 <p>The Saintess smiled and her whole aura softened. “No, I’m certain that he is. Creating miracles with a numbers disadvantage and completely unpredictable, can you guess who he reminds me of?”</p> 
 <p>When the Saintess said the word ‘miracle,’ the girl widened her eyes. “How is that possible?! Why would he be here?!”</p> 
 <p>“Who knows? Besides, if it is really him, it may not be a bad thing, but our plans may have to change.” The Saintess sighed and rubbed her temples. The emergence of the Fickle Army gave her a huge headache.</p> 
 <p>“If, I mean, if it’s really him, wouldn’t our next arrangement be…” the girl stopped mid-sentence, not knowing what to say.</p> 
 <p>“If it’s really him, then any adjustments to our plans must not be predictable. Otherwise, he will be able to make close guesses no matter what changes we make. After all, that’s the miracle of a generation.” The Saintess wasn’t stingy with her praise. However, in the face of the ordeal in front of her, she showed nothing but excitement!</p> 
 <p>“In that case, should we recall the reinforcements?” the girl immediately applied what the Saintless just said about not being ‘predictable.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the Saintess became lost in thought.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s wait for their report. Even if it’s him, I don’t believe that he can capture Colorful Star with me here!” she declared with a serious face. She had full confidence in her ability.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, during the half a day that the Saintess waited for her report, the Fickle Army had officially started carrying out their missions. The first to make progress was Ye Qingtong.</p> 
 <p>“Have the bodies been disposed of?” she asked as she changed into the clothes of the patrol that her group had just taken care of.</p> 
 <p>“It’s taken care of, my lord!” replied a soldier.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, be quick-witted. We’ll be watching from nearby. If you’re exposed, run immediately. However, if you get caught, take off this disguise and find a quiet place to hide.”</p> 
 <p>Giving the Fickle soldiers dressed as the Sacks patrol a last piece of advice, Ye Qingtong looked in the direction of Bai Xiaofei and Tan Xin with an anxious heart.</p> 
 <p>“I hope it’s also going well for you guys…”</p>
