 <p><span style>This first time, it was absolutely the first time that Bai Xiaofei had such a deep feeling that his brain wasn’t strong enough, and he experienced despair for the first time.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the f*ck should I say now?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What can I say to make these two happy?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Such a life snatching question shouldn’t exist!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Sister Xian’er, please let me off. I’ll surely give you a satisfying answer once we come into contact for a while longer.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he was truly helpless, Bai Xiaofei could only use his ultimate move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Admitting his mistakes….</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is it not enough that I’ve admitted my mistakes!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I’ll be waiting!” As she spoke word by word, Hu Xian’er’s tone was extremely forced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter what, Bai Xiaofei had temporarily gotten through this barrier, and as for what would happen in the future, it was up to the future Bai Xiaofei because the current Bai Xiaofei didn’t want to strain his brain like that at this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei shot his gaze at the arrogant senior.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Ka and the others couldn’t help but pray in silence for three seconds on behalf of this senior when they saw Bai Xiaofei’s gaze. According to Bai Xiaofei’s temper, he would surely vent all the grievances he felt from Hu Xian’er onto this senior….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, nice to meet you. I still don’t know your name even until now.” Bai Xiaofei’s spirits rose once more as he grinned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tormenting another was Bai Xiaofei’s absolute favorite, and there was nothing that could surpass it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The senior didn’t answer as he stared coldly at Bai Xiaofei, and he seemed as if he was indifferent to death because he would be reborn in the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Bai Xiaofei loved this sort of neither humble nor arrogant expressions….</span></p>
 <p><span style>In merely less than 10 minutes of time, the arrogant senior had collapsed completed, and these 10 minutes were simply like purgatory on earth to him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to the arrogant senior, he was called Zhou Wei, a third year student from the Blade of Concealment. He was from a clan that owned a small mine in Cloudveil Empire, and he’d taken over the work of collecting protection money since he was in the second year up until now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Besides detailed personal information like what colored undergarments he wore, Zhou Wei had even handed over all his ‘illegal proceeds’, and Bai Xiaofei confiscated all of it in the spirit of humanitarianism and only left him with a month’s worth of food expenses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the person who benefitted from this confiscation was only him for now….</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, when Zhou Wei escaped from Bai Xiaofei’s clutches, his tears were flowing uncontrollably, and even he himself didn’t know if he was happy from escaping this sea of bitterness or was he sorrowful from the great loss he’d suffered….</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the hand other, Zhou Wei’s departure proclaimed that all activities for today had ended, and in other words, Bai Xiaofei was finally free!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Truly, Bai Xiaofei felt he would absolutely die young if he continued to be sandwiched between Lin Li and Hu Xian’er, just like Master Yi in the Gorge of Heroes had….</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he lay on his bed like a dead pig, Bai Xiaofei had a long and sweet dream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In his dream, Lin Li and Hu Xian’er were getting along well while he had each of them on one side, enjoying the happiness of having more than one wife. Of course, Xue Ying was there as well. But, for some unknown reason, Qin Lingyan had actually appeared in his dream as well….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Fei? Big Brother Fei? It’s time to get up!” Waking Bai Xiaofei had already become a daily task for Mo Ka, a habit, because asking Bai Xiaofei to wake up himself was basically no different than a dream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Motherf*cker! How many f*cking times do I have to say it!? There are no classes today!” As he glared his eyes wide open and jumped up from his bed, Bai Xiaofei assumed the posture of intending to teach Mo Ka a fierce lesson. But, in the next second, he’d swallowed every single thing he was about to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Yun! What’re you doing here?” As he hastily got off his bed and wore some clothes, the attitude Bai Xiaofei who was slightly ‘overwhelmed by the unexpected favor’ instantly underwent a 180-degree transformation, causing Mo Ka’s heart to ache.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Alas, sure enough, there’s a difference between people!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“The matter is done, and I just happened to have nothing to do. But, I never imagined that even though it’s almost noon, Junior would actually still be sleeping.” Yun Jingshuang chuckled and seemed to carry an extremely charming appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, he was male….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei trembled instinctively and hastily eliminated those inappropriate thoughts from his mind, and then he looked at Yun Jingshuang with a trace of pleasant surprise on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s done so quickly? How many senior sisters were willing to participate?” Bai Xiaofei had never had the extravagant hoped that all the beauties on the Blossom Rankings would agree, and he would be satisfied if just a quarter of them agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“After those that already have their other half, there are another 87 remaining. Amongst them, 32 directly accepted my suggestion, whereas, another 24 are still considering it. Even though the remaining didn’t refuse directly, the possibility of roping them in isn’t great.” Yun Jingshuang reported the detailed amounts, and it caused an expression of delight to appear on Bai Xiaofei’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So many?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Many? I feel that it should be more. Only 30 plus out of 100 were successfully recruited. How can that be many?” Yun Jingshuang revealed a trace of disbelief, but Bai Xiaofei patted Yun Jingshuang’s shoulder lightly instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, you don’t understand men!” If these words were spoken to any other man, Bai Xiaofei would absolutely be mourning as he received a beating, but just happened to be the opposite when spoken to Yun Jingshuang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cheh, who would be willing to understand stinking men?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>These extremely feminine words caused goosebumps to instantly arise beneath Bai Xiaofei’s clothes, whereas, Mo Ka and the others unconsciously took a step back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It couldn’t be helped, this senior was poisonous!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Err, Senior, you don’t have to have such a bad impression of men. Actually, many men are quite good….” Bai Xiaofei stood up for all men in the world while feeling embarrassed to the point cold sweat poured out from his forehead, but what he got in return was a huge eye-roll from Yun Jingshuang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard that you haven’t solved the matter of that little fox and your desk mate, right?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Needless to say, this question caused Bai Xiaofei’s scalp to go numb.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Err, forget it. Senior, let’s continue on out topic from before.” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since you mentioned that, I concede….</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As he raised his head with extreme complacency, Yun Jingshuang carried a trace of delight from victory, and then he withdrew a small book from his storage ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the detailed information about those 32 people. Even though they’ve agreed to your suggestion, but every single one of them have some additional requirements. So, you better pay a visit to every single one of them before you carry out your plan. Otherwise, I won’t take responsibility to clean up after you.” As he spoke, Yun Jingshuang tossed the book to Bai Xiaofei before leaving immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, aren’t you going to stay for a while longer!?” Bai Xiaofei intended to be courteous, but he received a gaze of disdain from Yun Jingshuang instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel uncomfortable staying in this sort of pigsty!” His voice hadn’t finished resounding in the air when Yun Jingshuang had already vanished within the dormitory room while leaving Bai Xiaofei with a shocked expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Fei, do you need someone to accompany you?” Mo Ka revealed a sly smile as he raised his brows at Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think you can? Could it be that you’ve dealt with Zhu Nuo?” Bai Xiaofei rolled his eyes as he spoke with a cold voice, and it caused Mo Ka to instantly become dispirited.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Aren’t you the same with Lin Li and Hu Xian’er….</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Even though he thought like this in his heart, Mo Ka didn’t dare speak it out loud, otherwise, this dormitory room would become purgatory for him….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wu Chi, Shi Kui, let’s go. Mo Ka, you stay behind and take care of the place!” Bai Xiaofei chuckled while Mo Ka’s face instantly darkened….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Fei, you can’t leave me behind!!!”</span></p>
