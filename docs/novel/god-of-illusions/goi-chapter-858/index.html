 <p>Chapter 858: The Ethereal Capital!</p> 
 <p>“Finally!”</p> 
 <p>Flapping his wings in the sky, Yun Tianhe never felt so happy to return to the imperial city.</p> 
 <p>It was not that he missed his home, but that he was really exhausted from all the flying. He had estimated it would take half a month to fly back, but unexpectedly, they took less than ten days – because Bai Xiaofei had never once stopped along the way!</p> 
 <p>What was even scarier was that, when Yun Tianhe was recovering energy, Bai Xiaofei would carry both him and Yun Tianhai!</p> 
 <p>When Yun Tianhe asked how Bai Xiaofei had so much energy, the latter only replied lightly, “Devouring the Heaven and Earth!”</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>“Just how rich are you guys?” Overlooking Ethereal’s imperial city from high up in the sky, Bai Xiaofei gulped. <em>Come on! Isn’t this a little too big?!!</em></p> 
 <p>The size was not even the most outstanding part, it was the fact that the whole city was visibly crowded. The degree of prosperity was at least ten times that of the Snow Kingdom’s capital!</p> 
 <p>“Above average, I guess. We can’t compare with Cloudveil, but the other empires should not have as much money as us,” replied Yun Tianhe nonchalantly as he finally found some confidence in front of Bai Xiaofei. He said, “Let’s go down. The sky above the imperial capital is a no-fly area.”</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe slowly descended, followed by Bai Xiaofei. Upon landing, Bai Xiaofei was shocked again. He had not felt it when he was high up above, but now…</p> 
 <p><em>I’ll be damned!! Does this city wall want to pierce the sky or what?!!</em></p> 
 <p>Even when he strained his neck to the limit, Bai Xiaofei still failed to see what was going on atop the city wall. And the magical rune patterns flashing on the wall were definitely nothing low-grade. Defending the city with this kind of wall, even an idiot would win!</p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai?” Yun Tianhe waved his hand before the dazed Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Returning to his senses, Bai Xiaofei sighed with emotion, “I’ve suddenly realized that my knowledge of this continent is really too meager.” He was now ready to be shocked continuously.</p> 
 <p>“It’s okay, you will get used to it. Things like this aren’t worth mentioning for a genius like you. Don’t underestimate your own value,” said Yun Tianhe. He wasn’t trying to be polite, the value of a top-class puppet master was really much more than even ten imperial cities.</p> 
 <p>“No way. One day, I will get such a big guy for myself.” Bai Xiaofei stared at the wall, his eyes shining with resolution.</p> 
 <p>Seeing him so serious, Yun Tianhe didn’t say anything. He would have despised anyone else who said so, but when it was Bai Xiaofei, perhaps it was really possible…</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go, Brother Bai, this is my territory. And I think Grandfather is definitely looking forward to meeting you,” Yun Tianhe announced and started leading the way.</p> 
 <p>However, upon reaching the city gate, his brows creased.</p> 
 <p>“Hey, isn’t it the First and Second young master of the Yun clan? I even considered skipping today’s duty, but now it seems I have an unexpected harvest!” an extremely vexing voice rang out.</p> 
 <p>“Hai Jun, don’t go too far, or I won’t be polite.” The ever nice Yun Tianhe suddenly turned icy. Obviously, he and Hai Jun did not get along one bit.</p> 
 <p>“Why would you say that, First young master Yun? I always do things impartially. You’ll give this garrison commander face, won’t you?” Hai Jun sneered.</p> 
 <p>Upon the mention of ‘garrison commander,’ Yun Tianhai’s temper immediately cooled down. Unlike small countries like the Ancient Yue, a garrison commander of Ethereal’s capital was no ordinary character. It was the role that commanded the biggest armed force in the imperial city.</p> 
 <p>“Very well then, I shall see what tricks you will play today!” Gritting his teeth, Yun Tianhe quietly stared at Hai Jun, who unexpectedly passed by him and focused on Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“There is, of course, nothing suspicious about First young master Yun, but this little brother looks quite unfamiliar!”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Hai Jun’s voice fell, a group of guards surrounded Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Hai Jun, don’t you dare! Today, if Brother Bai is wronged even just a little bit, I, Yun Tianhe, shall never be done with you!” Realizing that Hai Jun wanted to trouble Bai Xiaofei, Yun Tianhe exploded.</p> 
 <p>However, this was exactly what Hai Jun wanted to see. “I said, I do things impartially.” With a snort, he motioned for the guards to continue.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei, who had been quietly watching, asked, “May I ask, how do I cooperate?”</p> 
 <p>The question stunned the guards.</p> 
 <p>“I know you’re only listening to orders, so rest assured that I won’t hold it against you. Just do what you have to do,” Bai Xiaofei softly comforted them.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the guards were too embarrassed to start checking.</p> 
 <p>“Why are you standing around?! Can’t move?!” Hai Jun turned from smug to furious in a second upon seeing the guards’ action.</p> 
 <p>“Please show your identity certificate and puppets. We need to do a detailed inspection and registration,” said a guard with a troubled expression.</p> 
 <p>“You have all seen my puppets.” Bai Xiaofei pointed to Huskie and Blackie at his sides.</p> 
 <p>Cooperating with him, the two fellows cutely looked at the guards with big eyes.</p> 
 <p>“As for identification, this should do.” Bai Xiaofei took out his Starnet Brilliance.</p> 
 <p>Seeing the token, the guards stood still in shock before quickly saluting respectfully to Bai Xiaofei. “My lord, thank you for your cooperation.”</p> 
 <p>“Wait!” Hai Jun stepped out just as the guards wanted to step back.</p> 
 <p>“Are you blind? You know very well what a Starnet Brilliance means. If you want to die, find another way,” Yun Tianhe said coldly.</p> 
 <p>Hai Jun’s mouth twitched in irritation. He walked to Bai Xiaofei and held out his hand. “I’ve encountered several people who pretended to be the miracle generation recently. Give me your Starnet Brilliance, I need to check it carefully.</p> 
 <p>Two words instantly emerged in Bai Xiaofei’s head. <em>A moron!</em></p> 
 <p>“If I give my Starnet Brilliance to others so casually, I might as well stop being a puppet master. If you really want to check it, I don’t mind you try it yourself.” Bai Xiaofei looked at Hai Jun with a smile as his energy surged.</p> 
 <p>“Oh? Can I take this as you want to make trouble in the imperial city?” Hearing what he wanted to hear most, Hai Jun directly pinned the crime on Bai Xiaofei’s head.</p> 
 <p>“Make trouble?” Bai Xiaofei chuckled. At the same time, Blackie melted into the surroundings as he said, “Believe it or not, I can beat you into a pulp and no one will even notice!”</p>
