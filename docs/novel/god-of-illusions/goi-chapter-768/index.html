 <p>Chapter 768: Repeated Restraint!</p> 
 <p>“It has been a while since the last blind fool came to me looking for trouble,” an eerie voice echoed all around Bai Xiaofei when he had just entered the courtyard. “Young man, out of respect for your laudable courage, I will give you a chance to explain your purpose.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei stretched exaggeratedly. Seeing this, Shaman King, who was hidden in the shadows, nearly exploded in anger.</p> 
 <p>“I’m here to take you in as my underling!” Bai Xiaofei declared.</p> 
 <p>The atmosphere froze for two seconds, and then a cacophony of laughter rang out.</p> 
 <p>“Hahahaha! That’s the first joke I’ve heard in a long time! To show gratitude, I will make you a member of my skeleton army!!” Following the eerie voice that surged with fury, a thick black fog suddenly appeared in the courtyard.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s first reaction was to rush in and find Shaman King, but before he could act, Blackie said something in his mind. He smiled wryly and waved his hand. “Alright then, I’ll leave it to you.”</p> 
 <p>Blackie leaped out from the puppet space into the black fog. Soon after, a pleased meow rang out from the fog.</p> 
 <p>And then, it was a tragedy for Shaman King. The black fog that filled the yard spun out of his control, flowed towards Blackie’s mouth, and was swallowed up in less than three seconds!</p> 
 <p>“How… how is it possible?!”</p> 
 <p>The four-dimensional eerie voice was replaced by an old, shocked one that came out of the house in front of Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Nothing is impossible. As I said, I am here to take you as my underling.”</p> 
 <p>Although Bai Xiaofei himself was a little surprised – after all, he didn’t know that Blackie had such an ability – gaining the upper hand allowed him to maintain his arrogant front.</p> 
 <p>“Brat, it’s still too early to be smug!” Shaman King’s old voice rang out. The next second, a huge puppet over four meters high shot out.</p> 
 <p>Violet puppet, Blood Giant!</p> 
 <p>Yet that was far from the end. A strange fluctuation spread out from within the house, and from under the yard, skeletons rose from the dirt one after another before flocking like crazy toward Bai Xiaofei and Blackie.</p> 
 <p>“Ahhh, why bother? You’ll be one of our own sooner or later.” Bai Xiaofei sighed. As he snapped his fingers, a sky-blotting golden flame appeared. Whether it was the skeletons or Blood Giant, they all turned into wisps of smoke upon contact with this holy phoenix flame that was especially effective versus undead creatures.</p> 
 <p>“You in there, anything else? If not, I’m going in.” Bai Xiaofei clapped his hands as if he had just finished doing something trivial and started to walk towards the house.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Shaman King was stupefied.</p> 
 <p>He could clearly feel that Bai Xiaofei was only a beginner Grandmaster Rank who very likely still had yet to master the first realm. However, the fact that Bai Xiaofei’s abilities restrained all of his made him helpless!</p> 
 <p>He had just used four of his seven puppets, but none of them worked against Bai Xiaofei. Of the remaining three, one needed preparation time, one was his last resort, and therefore, he could only put his hope in the last puppet!</p> 
 <p>Upon this thought, a sneer appeared on Shaman King’s withered face. Then, he pretended to panic as he ran to the back door.</p> 
 <p>However, he was once again struck dumb by Bai Xiaofei’s pursuit, which was not quite the same as he had imagined.</p> 
 <p>Spiritualized with Huskie, Bai Xiaofei teleported in front of Shaman King and slapped him flying. During this brief contact, he had used the energy tactic in God Control to seal the energy store points on Shaman King’s body and consequently imprisoned his energy. It went so smoothly that when Shaman King realized what had just happened, he was already like a fish on the chopping board.</p> 
 <p>“Up until now, you have used four puppets. In most cases, an Exquisite Rank puppet master would have some kind of life-saving means, so you probably still have two puppets in reserve. However, from my experience with undead-type puppet masters, their puppets usually operate in a chain, so one of your two reserved puppets needs to cooperate with the previous four.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei paused and revealed a frightening smile.</p> 
 <p>“Does that mean you have a puppet that can kill with one blow? You pretended to flee, and when I chase after you, you’d give me that final blow?“</p> 
 <p>Hearing Bai Xiaofei conclude, cold sweat streamed down Shaman King’s face like a waterfall.</p> 
 <p><em>Not a word is wrong! Is this boy really human?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Who… who are you!? This old man has never provoked you! If you let me go…”</p> 
 <p>“Shh!” Bai Xiaofei cut Shaman King off. “There is no enmity between us. I have already told you my purpose. It’s you who started the fight. I just conveniently used that chance to educate you a little.”</p> 
 <p>Smiling, Bai Xiaofei picked up a stone and fiddled with it.</p> 
 <p>“You have three seconds to consider, be my servant, or die!” His voice was extremely icy by the last word.</p> 
 <p>In just three seconds, countless thoughts flashed through Shaman King’s mind.</p> 
 <p><em>Would I rather die than be humiliated? No way! My life is my own!</em></p> 
 <p><em>But if I yield, all face will be lost!</em></p> 
 <p><em>If I lose my life, what’s the use of face?</em></p> 
 <p><em>But what will this boy make me do?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Could it be that I have to accept this fate?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Time’s up!”</p> 
 <p>“Shaman King greets the Lord!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had just raised his hand when Shaman King kowtowed to him.</p> 
 <p>“Just call me young master, no need to be so polite. Don’t worry, you won’t regret following me. However, remember, don’t test me or have any ideas you shouldn’t have, or you’ll die a very ugly death!” Bai Xiaofei uttered malicious words with a face full of smiles.</p> 
 <p>The old Shaman King gulped repeatedly. He had really lived several decades in vain, being bullied by a boy to this extent! He had no face to face his ancestors!</p> 
 <p>“How long are you going to kneel? We still have more stops to visit!”</p> 
 <p>While Shaman King was still grieving in his heart, Bai Xiaofei had already walked away with Rui Mengqi.</p> 
 <p>“Wait for me, Young Master! This one has to pack up!”</p> 
 <p>Shaman King was quite fast to adapt to his new role, so much so that Bai Xiaofei was surprised.</p> 
 <p>A big shot in Windlove? In actuality, he was only a normal person who prioritized his life above all, even more than those who struggled to survive in this city.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll give you five minutes!”</p>
