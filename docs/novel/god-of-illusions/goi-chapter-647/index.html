 <p>Chapter 648: Intel always has to be Tricked out!</p> 
 <p>The instant Bai Xiaofei squatted down, the fox smelled a distinct scent of magical beasts from him. It wasn’t from contamination but something from within his blood. However, she was sure that the being in front of her was a human and not a transformed magical beast!</p> 
 <p>Such a situation was beyond the fox’s cognition, so she could only keep an eye on him and see what he wanted.</p> 
 <p>“I will destroy this cage. How you run after depends entirely on you, but take my advice and don’t run too early, because I have something to do in a while. If you run too early, you may ruin my plan. You can understand what I say, right? If yes, nod your head,” Bai Xiaofei said solemnly, but the fox did not respond at all.</p> 
 <p>Looking at the vigilant fellow, Bai Xiaofei sighed helplessly. It was too difficult for a magical beast who had been caught by humans to believe a human.</p> 
 <p>Thinking this, Bai Xiaofei stretched out his hand.</p> 
 <p>The fox instinctively moved back while shielding her children. However, unlike what she thought, Bai Xiaofei didn’t hurt them but grasped the cage’s iron bars. Activating Devouring the Heaven and Earth and accelerating the Endless State, he cleanly absorbed the energy sealing the cage in less than two breaths.</p> 
 <p>After making sure that there were no other mechanisms, Bai Xiaofei pulled apart the bars.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, the vigilance in the fox’s eyes dispersed into confusion. She couldn’t understand why a human wanted to save her.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t look at me like that. Unlike what you may think, I have a good relationship with fox-type magical beasts, so I’m saving you.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately understood the fox’s gaze and directly answered her doubts, only that she didn’t understand what he meant.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, you can go at any time. That window shouldn’t be able to stop you. But mark my words, don’t leave too early. If someone comes in, I know it’s not hard to create an illusion that you are still caged with your ability.” Bai Xiaofei clapped his hands and stood up.</p> 
 <p>Right at that moment, he received another message from Blackie.</p> 
 <p>“Well, I should go. See ya!” Bidding goodbye to the fox, he pushed the door and went straight to the room next to Jackdaw.</p> 
 <p>This time, he didn’t knock at the door or try to be careful. He just walked right in.</p> 
 <p>There was still a lingering scent of the Soul Stealing Incense that had just burned out. Six people in the room were sleeping like dead logs, there wasn’t even any snoring.</p> 
 <p>Blackie emerged from a corner and leaped onto Bai Xiaofei’s shoulder.</p> 
 <p>“It’s just the last step now. I still have to trouble you.” Bai Xiaofei grinned and poured his energy into Blackie. After the cat melted away again, his appearance rapidly changed. Just a few seconds later, a ‘Jackdaw’ was standing in the room.</p> 
 <p>Then, with Blackie’s ability, Jackdaw’s room door disappeared, and the room Bai Xiaofei was in became the one at the end of the corridor. Finally, Blackie jumped onto the shelf and used the feather she had snatched from the frightened Frost Crow King earlier as the medium, transforming into an identical crow.</p> 
 <p>After finishing all the steps, Bai Xiaofei transformed into Jackdaw in sleepwear. He opened the door open and called out to the guard.</p> 
 <p>“Get me Deputy Leader.”</p> 
 <p>The guard immediately moved. Before long, a well-dressed deputy leader gently knocked on the door.</p> 
 <p>“Head, it’s me, Qiu Feng.”</p> 
 <p>When Deputy Leader Qiu Feng’s voice called out, Bai Xiaofei tensed up.</p> 
 <p>He couldn’t help it. There was no way he wouldn’t be nervous! Jackdaw Mercenary Group’s deputy leader was an Exquisite Rank expert. One small mistake and he might just lose his life here!</p> 
 <p>“Come in.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing Jackdaw’s faint voice, Qiu Feng opened the door and entered the room.</p> 
 <p>“What’s so important that you have to wake me up in the middle of the night?”</p> 
 <p>Qiu Feng directly sat down opposite Bai Xiaofei. Clearly, his relationship with Jackdaw was more than just close.</p> 
 <p>“Old Zhu just came and found that a black cat got into my room. The more I thought about it, the more I felt that something’s off, so I decided I won’t sleep tonight. Staying awake by myself is too boring to sleep, though. I can only drag you down with me,” Bai Xiaofei said and pulled out a jar from under his seat.</p> 
 <p>“How about a drink?”</p> 
 <p>He chuckled and took off the paper sealing the jar. Qiu Feng, who was getting angry, immediately calmed after smelling the thick aroma.</p> 
 <p>“Heck! You hid it deep enough, I didn’t know you have this kinda good stuff!” He grabbed the jar from Bai Xiaofei’s hand and drank a mouthful. “Refreshing!”</p> 
 <p>Laughing out loud, Qiu Feng then drank another mouthful.</p> 
 <p>“Bastard, leave me some!” Bai Xiaofei yelped as he snatched back the jar, acting like a miser.</p> 
 <p>“Tch, stingy doesn’t look good on you. I’ll give you back a better one later.” Qiu Feng rolled his eyes, his face full of contempt.</p> 
 <p>“Good wines are rare treasures. What do you have to give me back?” Bai Xiaofei retorted without mercy before drinking two mouthfuls himself, but his heart was dripping with blood.</p> 
 <p>This was the wine he had specially bought to bribe Cang Lan!</p> 
 <p>“Do you think our plan will go smoothly this time?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was still wondering how to lead the topic when Qiu Feng took the initiative and did him a big favor.</p> 
 <p>“Who knows? One step at a time. I’m actually more worried about the situation in the Holy Snow Mountain.” Bai Xiaofei sighed.</p> 
 <p>Qiu Feng chuckled. “Heh. What’s wrong now? You are the one who was determined to come here after hearing that it might be related to The Ruins. Why are you chickening out now when we are just one step away?”</p> 
 <p>Qiu Feng’s teasing rendered Bai Xiaofei speechless in shock.</p> 
 <p><em>The Ruins?! The Holy Snow Mountain has something to do with The Ruins?!</em></p> 
 <p>Astonishment rose in Bai Xiaofei’s heart and he was secretly feeling jittery.</p> 
 <p>He had heard Lei Shan mention The Ruins more than once and had crossed paths many, many times with things and people that came out from that place. No matter what it was, anything that had to do with these two words would become complicated.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, it was impossible for Bai Xiaofei not to get excited when he heard about The Ruins, especially when it was so close at hand.</p> 
 <p>“Who told you that I’m chickening out?! What do you know?! This is called being careful!” Bai Xiaofei grabbed the jar that Qiu Feng had just robbed during his brief trance and poured it into his mouth. Only drinking could hide the shock in his heart at this moment.</p> 
 <p>Their conversation had just begun!</p>
