 <p>Chapter 876: Become Sworn Brothers!</p> 
 <p>“Aunt Lan, feel free to tell me!”</p> 
 <p>Looking at the troubled Lan Qiushuang, Bai Xiaofei thumped his chest. Little did he think that this action would bring him the biggest headache ever.</p> 
 <p>…</p> 
 <p>“Was I too quick to make a promise, Huskie? I shouldn't have taken on this job!” Bai Xiaofei left Lan Qiushuang's room with a bitter face.</p> 
 <p>Huskie remained silent. <em>How the heck can this godly dog understand your human matters?</em></p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai! You came out!” Yun Tianhe immediately came up, obviously having been waiting outside all the time. However, seeing Bai Xiaofei come out ‘intact,’ his face was filled with astonishment.</p> 
 <p>“My mother didn't make it hard on you?!”</p> 
 <p>“No.”</p> 
 <p>“She didn't ask you strange questions?!”</p> 
 <p>“No.”</p> 
 <p>“Then what did she say?!”</p> 
 <p>“She expressed concern for me.”</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe was in utter disbelief, while Bai Xiaofei’s expression was plain as if he had never eaten salt in his entire life.</p> 
 <p>“Heaven, that is outlandish! Let alone you, even the royal family can’t ever get anything good out of my mother!” Yun Tianhe exclaimed in amazement.</p> 
 <p>Looking at him, Bai Xiaofei felt a headache. <em>He’s clearly such a perfect person. Why can't he get over such a small ordeal?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Brother Yun, how about we become sworn brothers?” he suddenly uttered.</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe was shocked. <em>No way! Mother definitely said something strange to him!</em></p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai, what are you up to?” asked Yun Tianhe in confusion.</p> 
 <p>“You want the truth?” Bai Xiaofei asked back.</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe immediately nodded.</p> 
 <p>“The truth is that Aunt Lan has decided to accept me as a godson. Moreover, after getting to know more about you from her, I realized that we met too late and that my life lacks a brother like you,” said Bai Xiaofei solemnly. In fact, most of it weren’t lies –</p> 
 <p>They really met each other too late! If Bai Xiaofei knew he had such a brother, he would have wanted to grow up together with him…</p> 
 <p>“God… godson?!!” yelped Yun Tianhe as he gawked at Bai Xiaofei like a monster. In his impression, one who could get on his mother’s good side did not exist in this world.</p> 
 <p>Shockingly, such a person was standing in front of him!</p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai, as long as you promise me one thing, you can even be my big brother!” After a long shock, Yun Tianhe gulped and his eyes glinted strangely.</p> 
 <p>“Why do I have a bad feeling about this?” Bai Xiaofei was exceptionally sensitive.</p> 
 <p>Seeing he had a chance, Yun Tianhe immediately inched closer. “Brother Bai, as long as you tell me how to conquer my mother, you are my big brother!”</p> 
 <p>Staring at Yun Tianhe, who looked almost like Huskie when asking for dog treats, Bai Xiaofei suddenly realized something.</p> 
 <p><em>No matter how formidable you are, there is always a person in this world who can make you a chicken!</em></p> 
 <p>“This may vary from person to person. Although I don't think you have hope like me, I promise to protect you in front of Aunt Lan.” Having grasped Yun Tianhe’s weakness, Bai Xiaofei confidently raised his eyebrows and declared.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Yun Tianhe didn't even take half a second to think before he grabbed Bai Xiaofei’s arm and ran out like he was flying, all the way to the back garden.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai, here. This is the place with the best feng shui in our house. Some things should be done sooner rather than later!” Yun Tianhe said as he set up ceremony food. Then, he noticed the stunned look on Bai Xiaofei. “What's wrong, Brother Bai? Don’t tell me you’re changing your mind!”</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe was as if a different person. Looking at him, Bai Xiaofei smiled from the bottom of his heart and knelt down in front of the ceremony offerings.</p> 
 <p>“I, Bai Xiaofei, though not born on the same day as Yun Tianhe, swear to take him as my brother. Where I am present, his path shall be smooth. I shall be at his beck and call. Whoever offends him shall be my arch-enemy, and whoever has his favor is my friend to protect! If I violate this oath, dead is what I shall be!”</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe was stunned to see Bai Xiaofei so decisive. Then, he quickly knelt beside Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“I, Yun Tianhe, though not born on the same day as Bai Xiaofei, swear to take him as my brother to share happiness and sufferings. Even if the world changes, this oath shall remain true. If I violate this oath, my bones shall break and my flesh shall burn!”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Yun Tianhe finished, the two kowtowed heavily.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei knew that Yun Tianhe only agreed because he had the corresponding value and identity, but this did not give his heart any knots. Rather, it made him happy, happy that he had the value commensurate with his brother!</p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai…”</p> 
 <p>“We are sworn brothers now. You can’t call me like before,” Bai Xiaofei cut off Yun Tianhe.</p> 
 <p>“Of course not, my good lil’ brother.” Patting Bai Xiaofei on the shoulder, Yun Tianhe laughed heartily. Although he had no idea what Lan Qiushuang and Bai Xiaofei had talked about, he was delighted to harvest the miracle of Starnet as his sworn brother.</p> 
 <p>Little did he know that he fulfilled Bai Xiaofei's long-cherished wish by calling him that…</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother.” Bai Xiaofei grinned to his ears.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go, Lil’ Brother, I will take you to see the world today.” Yun Tianhe hugged Bai Xiaofei's shoulder with a smug smile.</p> 
 <p>“Let me guess, you are going to take me to the Moon Beck Pavilion, aren’t you?” Bai Xiaofei chuckled.</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe was stuck. “You can't read minds, can you?” He gulped and looked at Bai Xiaofei like a monster.</p> 
 <p>“I can’t, actually, but because of my affair, the Performer List competition was halted for a month and the girls who were supposed to compete had to delay. Now that I’ve returned, it should proceed as normal. And, Big Bro, if I remember correctly, you have your favorite among the competitors,” said Bai Xiaofei as if he had conducted a long and thorough investigation.</p> 
 <p>“Lil’ Brother, why do I suddenly have a bad feeling?” Staring at Bai Xiaofei, Yun Tianhe had the feeling that he had jumped into a trap…</p>
