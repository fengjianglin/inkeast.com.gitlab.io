 <p>Chapter 662: World View Overturned!</p> 
 <p>“Wake up, perv!”</p> 
 <p>Leng Liuying’s wake-up call was flamboyant as always. The instant her foot was about to step on his face, the sleeping Bai Xiaofei sprang up.</p> 
 <p>It had taken so much energy to study the formation that Bai Xiaofei had fallen asleep on the ground without knowing. The sun had now climbed to the peak when he opened his eyes.</p> 
 <p>“Damn, it’s already noon?” Bai Xiaofei patted his groggy head. Then, he smelled a familiar aroma. Leng Liushuang never disappointed, especially when it came to food!</p> 
 <p>“What’s the hurry? We have to wait for Grandpa to come back before we can eat!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei couldn’t lift the tray lids as Leng Liuying slapped his hand away. He instantly looked like he had suffered a great injustice.</p> 
 <p>“Hungry…” Donning a pitiful expression, he looked sadly at Leng Liuying, but only earned a cold humph from her.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t you have dry rations? Eat that if you’re hungry.”</p> 
 <p>It was no use pretending to be pitiful in front of Leng Liuying. Moreover, whenever she was around, the other two would not pity Bai Xiaofei either. They didn’t want to be caught red-handed by Leng Liuying and became her topic to be poked fun of. No one wanted to carry the responsibility of spoiling Bai Xiaofei!</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, I’ll endure.”</p> 
 <p>Rubbing his growling stomach, Bai Xiaofei gave up the idea of eating dry rations. With Leng Liushuang’s masterpieces right in front of him, he wouldn’t even glance at the dishes of the Thousand Aroma Restaurant or the Hundred Flavor House.</p> 
 <p>“When will the smelly old man come back? Cold food tastes bad,” complained Bai Xiaofei after waiting for a while, doubtlessly scheming again.</p> 
 <p>This time, however, Leng Liuying didn’t counter him because Leng Liushuang beat her to it.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, Grandpa will never let the food cool. As long as the meal is prepared, he will definitely come back as soon as possible,” she said with a grin. Her lovely look made Bai Xiaofei’s heart quiver.</p> 
 <p><em>They are sisters, how is the difference so big?!</em></p> 
 <p>Inwardly complaining a little, Bai Xiaofei’s eyes unconsciously drifted to Leng Liuying.</p> 
 <p>The latter immediately rolled her eyes at him. She knew what he was thinking without him having to say it out loud. After all, this was not the first time she had heard it, and it would not make her change her own character!</p> 
 <p>However, if the three sisters were all like Leng Liushuang, Bai Xiaofei would have been able to eat them clean already…</p> 
 <p>“I advise you, although Grandpa looks informal, he cares about how others address him. He is different from the principal and Master Revelation,” Leng Liuli informed with a serious expression.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was stunned.</p> 
 <p>“Really? But he looked like he enjoyed it.” Despite saying this, Bai Xiaofei instantly pictured that moment when Cang Lan bombarded him. He subconsciously trembled.</p> 
 <p><em>Don’t tell me that old man was so serious because I called him smelly old man…? So narrow-minded?</em></p> 
 <p>“No way. The last time someone said something wrong, grandpa was angry for three days. In the end, he battered all the puppets of that person until that person fell from Grandmaster to Master!” said Leng Liushuang.</p> 
 <p>Leng Liushuang never lied, so her information made Bai Xiaofei gulp in fear.</p> 
 <p><em>Dang, I really can’t call people whatever. What would I do if the old man misleads me when he teaches me?</em></p> 
 <p>“Alright, I know. I will never say nonsense in the future.” Bai Xiaofei held up his hand and made a vow.</p> 
 <p>However, the triplets didn’t say anything in response. Their expressions grew even more serious. The correct words to describe them now would be ‘as silent as snowflakes in the night.’</p> 
 <p>“What nonsense?”</p> 
 <p>Cang Lan’s emotionless voice rang out from behind Bai Xiaofei. Cold sweat instantly ran down the latter’s back.</p> 
 <p>“Gramps, you are back!” The moment Bai Xiaofei turned around, his expression had also perfectly undergone a 180-degree transformation. The word ‘ingratiating’ was written all over his face.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t try to kiss ass, I don’t let myself be pushed around!”</p> 
 <p>Cang Lan coldly snorted and walked around Bai Xiaofei to the stone table. As soon as he saw the food, the frost on his face dissipated into joy.</p> 
 <p>“Tsk, Shuang’er’s cooking has improved again. I didn’t have time to comment yesterday.”</p> 
 <p>With that, he contentedly picked up the chopsticks. The triplets immediately surrounded him, massaging his shoulders, pouring wine, and serving food. Such a level of enjoyment struck Bai Xiaofei dumb.</p> 
 <p><em>I have never been treated like this!!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Grandpa, has your strength risen again? Why does it feel like your aura is different from before?”</p> 
 <p>There were actually times that Leng Liuying could be sweet. If he wasn’t seeing it with his own eyes, Bai Xiaofei wouldn’t believe this even if there was a knife at his throat!</p> 
 <p>“It’s nothing, nothing at all. I only gained two more two puppets. My aura can’t increase from just that.” Cang Lan smiled from ear to ear. Talking did not affect his speed of eating at all.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei was secretly cursing him from head to toe.</p> 
 <p><em>You butt, didn’t you say you don’t like flattery?! Why are you laughing so happily now! Discrimination! This is discrimination…</em></p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei had to stop after a while, because he was too hungry to even think!</p> 
 <p>While he could endure it, it was a different matter when someone was eating to their heart’s content right before one’s eyes. One would find that they could not endure at all…</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei could no longer bear it. Gritting his teeth, he walked straight to the stone table, sat opposite Cang Lan, picked up a pair of chopsticks, and started eating.</p> 
 <p>His sudden action startled everyone. They immediately had different reactions.</p> 
 <p>Leng Liuli’s brows slightly creased with a hint of worry. Leng Liushuang carefully looked at Cang Lan, already thinking of how she should appease him. Leng Liuying was as if watching a show, smiling while waiting for Bai Xiaofei to be handled.</p> 
 <p>However, Cang Lan’s reaction was outside everyone’s expectations. Instead of getting angry, he smiled at Bai Xiaofei and even put a piece of meat in Bai Xiaofei’s bowl.</p> 
 <p>“Eat more. Your next days won’t be easy.”</p> 
 <p>Looking at the smiling Cang Lan, Bai Xiaofei’s heart jerked. <em>The hell? What’s the old man up to?!</em></p> 
 <p>Despite the terror in his heart, though, Bai Xiaofei absolutely didn’t dare to say it out loud. Quickly putting on a smile, he clipped the meat and stuffed it into his mouth.</p> 
 <p>“Gramps, you can rest assured…”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s words hadn’t finished when his whole face distorted in a bizarre manner. The next second, he shot up from his seat.</p> 
 <p><em>Spicy!!! Too damn spicy!!!</em></p> 
 <p>“How’s it? Devil pepper tastes quite good, doesn’t it?” Cang Lan burst out laughing in utter joy.</p> 
 <p>His whole body taken over by the spiciness, Bai Xiaofei naturally didn’t have the heart to listen to what Cang Lan said. He poured out a myriad of items from his storage ring until he found a pill and shoved it in his mouth…</p> 
 <p><em>Smelly old man! Toying with me?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Very good! This lord shall play with you!!!</em></p>
