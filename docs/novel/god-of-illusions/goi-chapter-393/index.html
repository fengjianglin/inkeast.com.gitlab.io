 <p>Chapter 393: A Capital City in Crisis from All Sides!</p> 
 <p>He Tian’s arrival and departure were so abrupt that after Bai Xiaofei returned to his room and brooded all night, he still couldn’t figure out the guy’s stand on the matter.</p> 
 <p>A man who had a close relationship with the Thunderstorm Bandits, also who could openly stand next to a prince, as well as a senior who was at least a Master Rank. What role did he play in this?</p> 
 <p>Was he one of the Thunderstorm Bandits?</p> 
 <p>No, if that was the case, he didn’t have to expose himself. That was just meaningless.</p> 
 <p>Did he merely want to help Bai Xiaofei?</p> 
 <p>Not likely. This kind of school-mate relationship was too illusory for a person of such status to personally seek out and say all that to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>This was Bai Xiaofei’s first sleepless night without coming up with anything useful. Early the next morning, he released his Doublet Bird. He had given the other one of this pair to Hu Xian’er, the only girl he deemed suitable to keep it.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t expect it to be used so quickly. What the Doublet Bird delivered this time was his request for help. He wanted more information on He Tian, and Starnet kept records of its graduates. If He Tian hadn’t lied, he would be able to dig deeper into this man.</p> 
 <p>However, this took time. Such a long distance would take the Doublet Bird at least three days, so Bai Xiaofei had no choice but to wait. And he was already lucky enough. At least he still saw some hope and could muse on the clues he got, while the rest of the people waiting on this mission had nothing else to do. Unlike Bai Xiaofei’s group who could enjoy the exotic scenery, those people who wandered all year round found no attraction in Nabu City.</p> 
 <p>Time passed little by little in boredom. Just when Bai Xiaofei was about to get new information brought back by the Doublet Bird, something happened at the Bright Road Merchant House – A mercenary team wandering around the city was massacred in broad daylight!</p> 
 <p>No one knew who the culprit was. When they were found, their bodies were already cold. A team of one Master Rank and seven Proficient Rank puppet masters quietly became history just like that.</p> 
 <p>All of the other teams in the city panicked. The next victim might just be themselves!</p> 
 <p>Shang Youdao’s door was almost broken as everyone urged him to quickly take action or at least solve the crisis inside the city. To sum up, waiting in peace had now become an extravagant hope for Shang Youdao. In desperation, he once again turned to Bai Xiaofei, the only lifeline he had.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei’s only response was to keep waiting.</p> 
 <p>There was no doubt that the culprit was the Thunderstorm Bandits, and their purpose was very obvious, which was to make those teams force Shang Youdao’s hand. As long as Shang Youdao remained still, the Thunderstorm Bandits would kill again until he could no longer hold on.</p> 
 <p>However, Shang Youdao must hold on!</p> 
 <p>Finally, the helpless Shang Youdao chose to implement Bai Xiaofei’s previous idea. In order to stabilize the uneasy crowd staying in his merchant group, he took out a large sum of money. While this method was akin to adding water to soup to delay boiling, he was betting on the chance that the Thunderstorm Bandits would lose patience before him, the signal of which would be them killing again!</p> 
 <p>Now, they were competing on who would lose their cool first.</p> 
 <p>After the murder, the thing that surprised Bai Xiaofei most was that the government gave no response despite the fact that people had died. Nabu City was the imperial city of this kingdom, yet nobody cared when someone was killed. This could only mean one thing: the higher-ups instructed for no interference.</p> 
 <p>Reaching this conclusion, Bai Xiaofei set his eyes on the royal family.</p> 
 <p>Both the existence of He Tian and the reaction of the royal family showed that there was something off with the royal family. What Bai Xiaofei lacked now was an opportunity to get in contact with them. He had a feeling that as long as he found out what was going on in the imperial city, the problem of the Thunderstorm Bandits would be resolved!</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t find this window of opportunity…</p> 
 <p>At the moment, the imperial city was like being shrouded in thick fog and Bai Xiaofei was a man who was looking for flowers in the fog. He knew how to find flowers, but the thick fog veiled his way. However, sitting around doing nothing was not his character. After thinking all night, he went to Shang Youdao.</p> 
 <p>If one made a list of the people Shang Youdao wanted to see most, Bai Xiaofei’s name was definitely at the top!</p> 
 <p>“You have something?” Shang Youdao’s question was destined to have no answer. He currently had completely lost the calm at the beginning. It seemed that he had thought everything to be too simple at that time.</p> 
 <p>“President Shang, don’t ask this question. Would I look like this if I have something new?” said Bai Xiaofei with a bitter smile, pouring cold water on Shang Youdao’s heart.</p> 
 <p>“So you came to me…?” asked Shang Youdao slowly, his brows furrowed.</p> 
 <p>“I need to get in contact with the royal family. You must have a way. If anything, your Bright Road is the top merchant group in Ancient Yue.”</p> 
 <p>Upon Bai Xiaofei’s words, Shang Youdao seemed embarrassed.</p> 
 <p>“There are ways, but I don’t have a stepping stone. The royal family is very practical. They won’t show unless they see enough benefits.”</p> 
 <p>At this, Bai Xiaofei thought for a moment before gritting his teeth. “The Feature Locking Pill should be enough as a stepping stone, right?”</p> 
 <p>Shang Youdao’s eyes immediately shone. “You have a Feature Locking Pill?!”</p> 
 <p>“I do, but since I’m using it for you, you won’t let me give it for nothing, right?” Since Bai Xiaofei had to take this loss anyway, he didn’t want a complete loss. Every bit counted…</p> 
 <p>Shang Youdao naturally understood what he was getting at. He was sure that Bai Xiaofei was very impatient about this matter as well, so he had no plans to pay in full.</p> 
 <p>“Our current liquidity isn’t…”</p> 
 <p>“Twenty spear puppets, no bargain. Pay within half a year.” Having no interest in wrangling, Bai Xiaofei stated his price, which was already a great concession from him.</p> 
 <p>“Deal!” Shang Youdao agreed straight away.</p> 
 <p>In fact, he would still accept even if Bai Xiaofei set the price a little higher. It was no longer a question of whether the item in his hands could be delivered. If the present deadlock was unbroken, the existence of the Bright Road Merchant Group would probably be at risk.</p> 
 <p>“I want to contact as many people as possible, that should be no problem, right?” Bai Xiaofei put forward his final request.</p> 
 <p>Shang Youdao’s response was a confident smile. “It may trouble me if you demand something else, but this? With the Feature Locking Pill in the bargain, I can pull all the nobles in the imperial city over!”</p> 
 <p>A grand event was about to begin!</p>
