<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>The rhythm of love blossomed through the night….</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sun rose in the sky, and the morning sunlight slowly shot down through the cracks between the leaves. While he embraced a delicate figure that was warm and supple, Bai Xiaofei turned around to see Hu Xian’er who was curled up by his side with extreme satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She possessed an exquisite figure and had faint smile on her face, and her balanced and long breath blew on Bai Xiaofei’s chest. Hu Xian’er who seemed obedient like kitten was extremely different from the formidable Transformation Stream beauty in Bai Xiaofei’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, this difference caused Bai Xiaofei to be unable to restrain himself….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like Hu Xian’er had said herself. She’d allowed Bai Xiaofei to know what he’d done to her. But, everything had arrived too suddenly to Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was sudden to the point that Bai Xiaofei was slightly caught off guard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he pulled up the blanket that covered the two of them, Bai Xiaofei lightly kissed Hu Xian’er on the cheek.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No matter what, I’ll take care of your future!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>While he thought like this in his heart, Bai Xiaofei tightened his embrace, and the supple feeling he felt caused bai Xiaofei to be unable to help but be dazed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please, no more….” When she felt an unusual feeling on her body, Hu Xian’er faintly opened her eyes captivating eyes, and she looked at Bai Xiaofei with a slightly pitiable expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, she wanted to teach Bai Xiaofei a lesson. But, after it started, the person that was taught a lesson in the end was her instead because Bai Xiaofei who possessed that Origin Core was utterly not someone an ordinary person could compare to….</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the very least, she who was a magical beast was unable to endure Bai Xiaofei’s ‘limitless exploration’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is a normal reaction, I don’t have any other intentions….” Bai Xiaofei’s tone carried a trace of embarrassment as he moved lightly, whereas, Hu Xian’er revealed a grin of happiness as she tightened her arms around Bai Xiaofei’s neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll satisfy you after I’ve become slightly stronger.” As she lay by Bai Xiaofei’s side, Hu Xian’er spoke lightly by Bai Xiaofei’s ears, and it caused Bai Xiaofei to be restless once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hu Xian’er seemed to be very satisfied with Bai Xiaofei’s reaction, and the smile on her face couldn’t help but deepen slightly as she entered into Bai Xiaofei’s tight embrace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who could have imagined that such a warm coupled would have actually got along with each other like strangers before last night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sure enough, those words of legend are true.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There’s nothing that is….</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he gradually calmed down, Bai Xiaofei started to recall the scenes during every encounter they had, and he couldn’t refrain from laughing when he recalled some things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’re you laughing at?” Hu Xian’er frowned slightly as she crawled up from Bai Xiaofei’s embrace because she was able to discern that Bai Xiaofei was laughing at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because I suddenly understood some things, and I felt I’m so stupid. So, I laughed.” Bai Xiaofei’s words couldn’t be considered to be a lie. But, Hu Xian’er didn’t have any intention of letting the matter go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speak! What was it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your reaction when you met me in the past. I was curious why you would act like that in the past, and now that I think of it, you were jealous….” Bai Xiaofei’s laughter received a cold grunt of resentment from Hu Xian’er.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Can’t I? Could it be that you wouldn’t be jealous in my place!? Not only did you not acknowledge what you did, you even had so many little girls by your side!” Hu Xian’er stared right at Bai Xiaofei as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now, how do you intend to deal with that little follower and beautiful teacher of yours?” Hu Xian’er carried a slight grin on the corners of her mouth as she gave Bai Xiaofei a question worthy of the Olympics….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hu Xian’er’s ‘sense of smell’ was really extremely ferocious, and she directly found two of his weak points and caused Bai Xiaofei to be stunned on the spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Li was fine because her reliance of Bai Xiaofei came from her simple character, and Bai Xiaofei would be able to lead her to the right path with some hard work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, that complicated relationship with Xue Ying….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? You’re unable to part with them? You want women both left and right?” As she spoke, Hu Xian’er’s voice turned cold. Selfishness was a similarity of all women, and magic beasts were no exception.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No! No! No! I absolutely don’t have such intentions! But….” The brain of Bai Xiaofei who was always deceiving others suddenly experienced a short circuit, or perhaps, he was truly unable to bear lying in front of Hu Xian’er.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But what?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei let out a long sigh and decided to be honest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin Li only has pure reliance towards me, and she has no idea of the matters between man and woman. But, I didn’t know the relationship between you and me before this, and during that period of time, some things happened between me and Big Sister Xue….” Bai Xiaofei’s tone carried a trace of hesitation as he slowly spoke of everything that had happened between him and Xue Ying, and he didn’t conceal anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei who was already prepared to enter the execution grounds welcomed a pleasant surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know my true identity?” She didn’t make it difficult for Bai Xiaofei at the first possible moment, and Hu Xian’er suddenly asked a question that caused Bai Xiaofei to be slightly stunned instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think I know what you want to say. But, I don’t really mind.” Bai Xiaofei spoke honestly, and Hu Xian’er grinned when she heard this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I still want to tell you.” Her face carried a trace of persistence as she looked right at Bai Xiaofei. At the same time, she held Bai Xiaofei’s face and made him look right at her as well. “I’m not human, and I’m a magical beast. Have you heard of the Phantom Fox?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Bai Xiaofei was mentally prepared, he was still instinctively stunned when he heard Hu Xian’er say this herself.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is moving towards having a wife that’s a fox demon!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I haven’t heard of a Phantom Fox, but I know that you’re mine.” Bai Xiaofei gulped down a mouthful of saliva before quickly adjusting himself to this revelation, and his ability to pick up girls instantly rose to the limit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm, your reaction isn’t bad, I’m very satisfied. But, I’m not trying to scare you, and I’m speaking the truth because I don’t want to lie to you.” Hu Xian’er chuckled happily while revealing a trace of playfulness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But, your strength….” Bai Xiaofei spoke of the bewilderment in his heart because magical beasts that could take human form had strengths equivalent to Timeless Rank puppet masters. But, Hu Xian’er was only at the Master Rank right now….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A secret technique of the Fox Clan allowed me to take human form in advance. The bodies of humans grow much more swiftly, so for the sake of being able to quicken the time needed to gain a foothold in the Infinite Mountain Range, my younger sisters and I chose this path.” Hu Xian’er spoke seriously, and she had entirely no intention of concealing anything from Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sometimes, magic beasts were really much simpler than humans. So long as they’d decided on a person, they would absolutely not conceal anything. Even if it was a secret that might put them in danger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I really profited this time. Isn’t this equivalent to possessing great backing in the Infinite Mountain Range?” Bai Xiaofei changed the topic to a faraway topic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t joke around. I told you all of this because I want to tell you that I actually don’t have much time to be by your side because humans won’t accept a magical beast like me, whereas, the Infinite Mountain Range won’t accept a human like you. But, I don’t regret it. So, even though I’m really unwilling, I don’t mind you keeping the company of other humans.” As she stared fixedly at Bai Xiaofei, Hu Xian’er spoke the words in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, Bai Xiaofei instantly jumped up, and his eyes carried a trace of firmness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I, Bai Xiaofei, sweat that the situation you spoke of will absolutely not occur. If humans don’t accept you, then I’ll kill all the humans that go against you. If the magical beasts don’t accept me, then I’ll conquer the Infinite Mountain Range with you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hu Xian’er started smiling once more as she looked at Bai Xiaofei who was speaking seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe in what you said. But, that needs time, and I don’t want you to be alone for so long….” Hu Xian’er spoke with a faint voice. At this moment, Bai Xiaofei felt that he’d been completely conquered….</span></p>
 <p><span style>What more could a man ask for with a girl like this?</span></p>
