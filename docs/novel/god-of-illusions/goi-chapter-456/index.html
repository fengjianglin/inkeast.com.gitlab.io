 <p>Chapter 456: If There is a Next Life…</p> 
 <p>“How long can he hold on?”</p> 
 <p>A group of people crowded in Bai Xiaofei’s room as he lay in bed, his remaining time decreasing with every second. The question was asked to He Rushi by an anxious Bai Ye sitting at the bedside.</p> 
 <p>“I am only an alchemist, not a doctor. I can’t provide a specific time, but according to his rate of decline, he only has 20 days at most,” replied He Rushi solemnly. Everyone was instantly dispirited.</p> 
 <p>Twenty days, too short to seek anyone for help…</p> 
 <p>“He can only last so long with his physique?” There was disbelief in Bai Ye’s voice. He had seen Bai Xiaofei recover from injuries, and how they healed at a speed visible to the naked eye left a deep impression on him.</p> 
 <p>“If it weren’t for his special physique, he wouldn’t be able to last three days. Also, at the moment of the explosion, there was a special force protecting him, or else he would have already been dead,” explained He Rushi, fearful of what could have happened. “If he hadn’t survived, the detonation of two Master Rank puppet masters at the same time would have killed even us.”</p> 
 <p>That was Tang Bing’s plan. He had planned his revenge after discovering that Chu Yue’s puppet had such an ability. A pity for him that he failed at the last step.</p> 
 <p>“There must be a way, right? If you need any kind of help at all, just say it!” Gu Heng immediately asked, looking even more anxious than Bai Ye.</p> 
 <p>“There is, but only if you have a grade-eight or above pill of the vitality type. Can you find even one?”</p> 
 <p>This was tantamount to a bucket of cold water that doused the fire of hope in everyone’s hearts. Vitality pills from grade-eight up were simply something so priceless that no one would put up for sale. Not to mention a little kingdom like Ancient Yue, even Starnet would require a certain amount of time to get its hands on one.</p> 
 <p>“Is there no other possibility?” Yun Mo frowned. He didn’t want to stand and watch Bai Xiaofei, who had helped his wife out, slowly die.</p> 
 <p>“If there is, I would have said it.”</p> 
 <p>Everyone fell silent. After looking at Bai Xiaofei, whose face was full of pain while in a coma, they shook their heads helplessly.</p> 
 <p>“I can save him!” Just as the atmosphere hit rock bottom, a crisp voice rang out.</p> 
 <p>Everyone looked over in the direction of the voice. At this moment, Nie Qing’s face was full of seriousness and determination.</p> 
 <p>“This is not the time for you to mess around!” roared Fang Lei before the rest could ask what she meant. At the same time, Qing Shuang and Xia He repeatedly tugged on her clothes and kept shaking their heads at her.</p> 
 <p>“You know very well if I am messing around!” Staring fixedly at Fang Lei, Nie Qing did not budge. At her retort, Fang Lei was flushed with anger as he was rendered speechless.</p> 
 <p>“If you really have a way, I beg you, please save him. As long as you are willing to, I, Bai Ye, will accede to your any request!” Bai Ye walked to Nie Qing and solemnly cupped his fist.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t need you to promise me anything. I’m not saving him for the sake of anyone else,” declared Nie Qing calmly and walked towards the bed. Then, she looked back and said coldly, “Everyone leave except for Third Brother. When I cure him, I can’t have too many people around.”</p> 
 <p>Yet no one moved.</p> 
 <p>“Why, do you have other ways or just want to watch him die?” This time, Nie Qing successfully threatened everyone. Everyone withdrew except for the Thunderstorm Bandits.</p> 
 <p>“In any case, I thank you!” at the door, Bai Ye said to Nie Qing. Before she could retort again, he walked out.</p> 
 <p>With this, there were only the Thunderstorm members in the room.</p> 
 <p>“You don’t have to persuade me, I have already decided,” Nie Qing preempted before Fang Lei and others could speak, shoving their words back down to their stomachs.</p> 
 <p>“Lil’ sis, there must be some other way. Why don’t we wait? His body is not going to collapse now, we still have a chance before that happens!” He Rushi tried reasoning, his attitude was completely different from just now.</p> 
 <p>“So we can get a grade-eight pill within twenty days? Or there will be a miracle and he suddenly recovers? The judgment was made by you, Third Brother, and you are the worst liar of us all. Do you think you can deceive me?”</p> 
 <p>When Nie Qing finished, He Rushi lapsed into silence. He had already done his best…</p> 
 <p>“Then, you’re not even considering us? If you save him, what about us? Have you considered our feelings?” Xia He stepped forward. Unlike He Rushi, she chose to persuade with sentiment.</p> 
 <p>“This is what we owe him. If it weren’t for him, Sis Qing Shuang couldn’t have gotten the Skypatch Pill and even we couldn’t have been able to retreat under those circumstances. Now it is time to give it back to him.” Having calmed down, Nie Qing turned into that Imperial Concubine Qing, organizing her thoughts particularly orderly.</p> 
 <p>“Even if it is owed to him, it is me who should pay it back. We must make it clear in such a time like this!” Qing Shuang sprang up emotionally. If Nie Qing made this choice because of her, she would loath herself for the rest of her life.</p> 
 <p>“If you can, of course, it is best for you to be the one to do it. But do you have this ability now?” Nie Qing’s words rendered Qing Shuang speechless.</p> 
 <p>Indeed, she did not have that ability.</p> 
 <p>“Moreover, you guys should already know why I want to save him.” This time, there was a tenderness in Nie Qing’s voice that stopped them from persuading her any further.</p> 
 <p>“Lil’ sis, you and he actually…”</p> 
 <p>“We have discussed this many times. You want to bring it up now?” Nie Qing cut Yun Mo off.</p> 
 <p>“Fine, we won’t stop you!” Fang Lei finally opened his mouth, dropping a bomb that made everyone dumbstruck, even Nie Qing was no exception.</p> 
 <p>“However, don’t you have anything to say to us?”</p> 
 <p>Looking at Fang Lei, whose eyes were red, Nie Qing fell into a long silence. At that time, their eyes all turned red.</p> 
 <p>“Everyone, thank you very much for taking care of me for so many years. I have never been able to make any great contributions to our group, but this time, I think I have made up for all those years. I believe that he will be a great help to the Thunderstorm Bandits in the future. I also hope that you guys can step out when he needs help.”</p> 
 <p>Two lines of glistering tears streamed down from Nie Qing’s eyes.</p> 
 <p>“If there is a next life, I hope I will still be a member of the Thunderstorm Bandits!”</p>
