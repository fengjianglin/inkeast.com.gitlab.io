<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>“Err, Boss Bai, what should we do?” Bai Xiaofei’s words had moved the nine class monitors because there weren’t many in the ‘commoner’s district’ that were like Fang Ye, and most of them came from families that didn’t possess much resources. Some even had to rely on completing assignments to earn money in order to survive in Starnet Academy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, the existence of the protection fees was like a vampire that kept causing a person to be in a weakened state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, that was the reason why they had such intense reactions when Bai Xiaofei mentioned the protection fees.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s very simple, join the New Student Mutual Aid Community I’ve established!” Bai Xiaofei grinned and stunned everyone once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“New Student Mutual… Aid Community?” They gulped while displaying their bewilderment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s very simple. Just pay membership fees equivalent to half the protection fees every single month, and then leave those people that come to ask for protection fees to me. The first month is a trial period, and there’s no need to pay any fees!” As he threw out another benefit at them, Bai Xiaofei had moved all these nine class monitors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At any rate, they didn’t have to take any risks because Bai Xiaofei would be there even if the sky were to collapse!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then…. Do we have to do anything?” The voice of one of the class monitors was already trembling slightly from his excitement because he originally thought that he was coming here to be tormented by Bai Xiaofei, yet never had he imagined that a pie would suddenly fall on his lap!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Convince the members of your classes and publicly proclaim your membership to the New Student Mutual Aid Community. After that, you only have to come when called. Everyone, this isn’t difficult, right?” The nine class monitors fell into silence as soon as Bai Xiaofei finished speaking. Everyone was willing to enjoy the benefits but proclaiming their membership would cause them to bear a risk, and risk was something that no one was willing to bear, especially when things could go bad at any moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As far as they were concerned, there was an extremely high chance that things would go bad for Bai Xiaofei!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, there’s no need for all of you to think.” Bai Xiaofei spoke once more as he looked at the nine of them who were hesitating, and his face still carried a slight smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t forget that we still have quite a few Collective Classes together. I can cooperate with all of you and put on a show if you join, and I’ll try my best to help all of you gain a place in the various streams. Conversely, I probably don’t have to tell all of you what will happen, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Threats! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Undisguised threats!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, this wasn’t everything that Bai Xiaofei intended to say, because there was still candy at the end of the rod….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Reality that can’t be refused is right before all of you. But, all of you can think for a moment. If this community continues to exist, then all of you will be the first batch of members, and it’s impossible to rely on just our class to manage all the new students. So….” Bai Xiaofei stopped halfway and looked silently at the nine class monitors, whereas, the three seniors on the ground were slightly dazed when they heard this.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Does this new student want to raise hell?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Bai, I’ll do whatever you say!” Finally, the first person to make a stand appeared, and the others followed on because once someone took the lead, they were unable to endure the dual pressures that came from the rod and the candy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s your name?” After he obtained the agreement of everyone, Bai Xiaofei looked at the class monitor that was the first to make a stand, and it caused the class monitor to reveal an excited expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Yun. Boss Bai, you can call me Little Jiang.” Jiang Yun spoke rather humbly, and he seemed like he was determined to be Bai Xiaofei’s lackey….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll give you an assignment. Hang the three of them on our roof, and then ask the members of your classes to spread this matter. The louder the better, and it’s best if the entire new student dormitory area finds out about this. After that, tell what I told all of you earlier to those interested new students, and those students that you pull into the community will be under your management.” Bai Xiaofei spoke line after line, and the nine class monitors stared their eyes wide open and gulped down mouthfuls of saliva in unison after they finished hearing what Bai Xiaofei said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There wasn’t a very deep impression in their minds towards the other things but hanging those seniors outside….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Bai, we can do everything else, but about these seniors….” Jiang Yun had a hesitant expression, and what he got in return was Bai Xiaofei’s calm stare. This time, Bai Xiaofei didn’t speak a single word, whereas, Jiang Yun’s expression changed repeatedly while being stared at by Bai Xiaofei before he gritted his teeth fiercely after some time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I’ll do it!” Along with Jiang Yun making a decision, the three seniors on the ground instantly revealed expressions of terror.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, it still couldn’t be discerned….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t you dare! If all of you….” They hadn’t finished speaking when the nearby Wu Chi and the others had already taken the initiative to swarm over, and then a wave of bangs resounded out….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, they’re behaving themselves now. Toss them out. Wu Chi, Shi Kui, Mo Ka, you three follow them, and teach them how to behave if they dare misbehave.” As soon as Bai Xiaofei spoke, the three seniors that intended to rise in revolt instantly became dispirited because the three people Bai Xiaofei mentioned were the three that struck them the most ruthlessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words, they were already affected psychologically….</span></p>
 <p><span style>The nine class monitors agreed successively before running out hastily because they had to spread this explosive news at the first possible moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was said to only be Bai Xiaofei’s plan earlier, then this plan had become the common mission of these 10 classes because Bai Xiaofei had forcefully roped them together!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The rest of you go with Xing Nan. You’ll similarly be in-charge of spreading the news, but the method will be different. Your assignments are to build up the situation!” As Bai Xiaofei spoke, the figures of Xing Nan and the others tensed up.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Our assignment is here!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Firstly, place an assignment on the Bounty Rankings, and the target of the bounty is me!” As soon as he finished speaking, Xing Nan and the other stared their eyes wide open. </span><i><span style>He’s placing a bounty on himself?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>But, even though they were puzzled in their hearts, they didn’t ask because they knew Bai Xiaofei surely had his own plans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The content of the bounty will be that the New Student Mutual Aid Community I’ve established has severely affected the old ‘order’. Second year students are already incapable of dealing with it, so it’s a request for help from the students from the third and fourth years.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as Bai Xiaofei finished speaking, all their eyes lit up in unison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At first glance, Bai Xiaofei seemed to be making trouble for himself. But, once news of this bounty was to be spread, the beneficial effect it brought was absolutely greater than its disadvantages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“After you’ve dealt with this, all of you can start spreading the news. The more people who know the better. It’s best if all the new students are able to find out before tonight.” As he stared fixedly at them, Bai Xiaofei’s seriousness far exceeded any occasion in the past, and he wasn’t even this serious when planning against the Earth Dire Bears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry Big Brother Fei. It’ll absolutely not be a problem with Qi Wei present!” Wang Hang replied, but he realized he’d said something wrong as soon as he finished speaking. Unfortunately, it was impossible to take back what he’d said….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wang Hang, I’ll remember this, and you have to give us brothers an explanation once you’ve completed this assignment. I never imagined that you concealed it so deeply!” Bai Xiaofei patted Wang Hang on the shoulder as he spoke, and he revealed a sly smile that caused his seriousness from a second ago to be completely destroyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“NO! No! no! It isn’t like you’re thinking….” In terms of assassinations, Wang Hang was absolutely formidable, but if it was in terms of lying, then he was obviously a newbie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know it isn’t like what I’m thinking, and it’s like what you’re thinking. All of us understand. Go on quickly because time won’t wait for anyone. What if Qi Wei’s taken away by someone else?” The opportunity to explain didn’t exist when one was before Bai Xiaofei….</span></p>
