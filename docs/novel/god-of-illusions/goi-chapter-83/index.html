 <p><span style>“Senior, do you know my name?” The seniors that were already dazed revealed blank expressions when they heard Bai Xiaofei’s question, and they became fearful in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the f*ck, he wouldn’t be the friend of some big boss, right?!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Impossible, all of them have already notified us!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re….” The senior asked weakly and was prepared to apologize because he couldn’t afford to offend a formidable figure for this little bit of protection fees.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai Xiaofei.” Bai Xiaofei grinned, causing the three seniors to be stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They weren’t shocked by Bai Xiaofei’s name, but they were searching their brains to see if this name was mentioned by any of the big bosses in the academy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, I remember now! You’re that kid who had a bounty placed on him by the Goddess of Ice!” One of the seniors that stood at the back revealed an expression of sudden enlightenment, and he pointed at Bai Xiaofei while crying out loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha! So it’s you, that kid that doesn’t know what’s good for him! And I was thinking you would be some extraordinary figure! You’ve exhausted all my f*cking patience!” The senior in the lead sneered before a light flashed on his hand, and his puppet gloves appeared on his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alas, looks like all of you haven’t done your homework!” As soon as Bai Xiaofei finished speaking, the nearby Mo Ka instantly crushed a light white colored ball in his hand, causing a ball of white mist to instantly spread out before the three seniors could make a move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, stinkweed’s effect was much better, but this thing was formally prohibited from being utilized within the dormitory because the side effects were too strong!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, the mist was already sufficient for the few of them!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clanking sounds resounded out without end. The three seniors had even taken out their defensive puppets within the mist. However, under the circumstances that their vision was completely cut off, the gap between their ranks had become infinitely closer. Moreover, in a place like a dormitory room where even turning one’s body required effort, it was a competition of whose physique was better! And the physique of the members of the Savage Class was very good!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve got one!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve got one as well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve got the last one!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the mist, Wu Chi, Xing Nan, and Shi Kui’s voices resounded out successively, and the sounds of fighting stopped along with this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mo Ka, open the window!” Along with a gust of wind surging into the room, the dense mist was quickly dispersed completely, and the scene within the room was sufficient to cause anyone who saw it to fall into endless reverie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Besides the three seniors that were pressed down on the ground, Bai Xiaofei and the others had taken off their shirts, and nine shirtless men caused this place to not seem like a dormitory room but a bathhouse….</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, the three seniors who lay on the ground suddenly understood something.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No wonder they were able to distinguish who their companions were….</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Do all of you know what you’re doing? Even if you’ve controlled us. There’ll only be more people that will come after us because it isn’t the three of us that are collecting this protection fees! Let us go now and all of you might be able to survive!” The senior in the lead didn’t have any intention of being afraid because as far as they were concerned, Bai Xiaofei and the others hadn’t thought things through, and so long as they explained it clearly….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A resounding slap reverberated within the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Looks like our seniors don’t understand the current situation, so help them sober up.” Bai Xiaofei was the first to start and the other eight of them surrounded the three seniors….</span></p>
 <p><span style>After extremely tragic shrill cries resounded out, the three seniors were completely swollen all over, and their fearless gazes had transformed into gazes that tried to avoid Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Dammit, this fellow is a moron!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Isn’t he afraid that others will look for trouble with him?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why are all these kids so strong?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Are they really f*cking new students?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Various thoughts and complaints surged into their hearts. But, the three of them didn’t dare speak a single word because they would truly be idiots if they spoke at a time like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t care who is standing behind all of you. But, from today onwards, the protection fees of the new students will absolutely not fall into your hands!” Bai Xiaofei laughed coldly before receiving the jade tokens Wu Chi, Shi Kui, and Xing Nan had taken from the three seniors, and he didn’t hesitate in the slightest to transfer all the Starnet Stones within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you only know that Qin Lingyan placed a bounty on me, but all of you don’t know why she removed the bounty, right?” As he spoke, the senior in the lead instantly revealed a terrified expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, it was impossible to see what expression he had with the current state of his face….</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he left them with boundless space to think, Bai Xiaofei didn’t continue explaining but lifted up the bed that had already been pushed down and sat down slowly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Prepare yourselves as we’ll be having guests right away.” As soon as he finished speaking, Mo Ka and the others took action once again. This time, they know who Bai Xiaofei was speaking of because it was almost noon….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Time flowed by second by second, and for the first time in their lives, the three seniors that were bound together felt that the passage of time in the new student area was so unbearable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, they had the impulse to cry now! After all, this opportunity to collect protection fee was something they’d exhausted a great deal of effort to win over….</span></p>
 <p><span style>God damn it, have you ever seen someone who fought for the opportunity to be bashed!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, when the three seniors were on the verge of collapse, the guests Bai Xiaofei spoke of had arrived. But, unknown to them, their nightmare had only just begun!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei’s words during the Collective Class yesterday had entered deep into the minds of the students in the other classes, so as soon as the time arrived, none of them dared go against Bai Xiaofei’s intentions, and all nine of them arrived without exception.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, at the instant they arrived at the entrance, all of them were stunned without exception.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Firstly, they never expected that there would be so many people in Bai Xiaofei’s dormitory room, and secondly, they were dazed by the bound seniors on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s going on?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“The dormitory room is too small, yet there are too many people. So, everyone just make do slightly. Mo Ka, make way for them.” As they watched the ability of Bai Xiaofei, the auras of all of them who originally didn’t know his ability weakened slightly, and their obedient appearances could compare with Huskie’s appearance before women.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do any of you know these seniors?” Bai Xiaofei pointed at the three seniors on the ground as he asked, and then the nine of them glanced over before shaking their heads in unison.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>They’ve already been beaten to such an extent, so I wouldn’t f*cking recognize them even if I did know them!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“They came to collect the protection fee, but my hands were slightly itchy, so I made them stay behind. Do all of you think what I did was right?” Bai Xiaofei’s expression remained the same as he spoke, and the nine class monitors gulped in unison upon hearing what he said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They’d imagined that Bai Xiaofei had great ability, yet they never imagined he would actually be so bold. </span><i><span style>He actually did this to the seniors that came to collect the protection fees, then what about the consequences?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Is this question very difficult to answer?” Bai Xiaofei pursued an answer, causing the nine class monitors that hadn’t cleared their thoughts to gulp down a mouthful of saliva once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Bai, this…. We….” One of the class monitors mumbled, but he was unable to express anything complete.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I make the protection fees reduce by half, do all of you think it’s good or bad?” Bai Xiaofei wouldn’t stop before shocking everyone to death, and he’d successfully accomplished his goal of shocking everyone!</span></p>
