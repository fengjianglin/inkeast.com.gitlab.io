 <p>Chapter 879: Ambush!</p> 
 <p>“Then tonight, I…” His face full of frustration, Yun Tianhe accepted his fate.</p> 
 <p>“It can’t have been easy for Princess Ling Ge to leave the palace once. Moreover, she did so for you. Even if you only regard her as a sister, accompany her well tonight. No matter what she wants to do, you are not allowed to refuse!” Bai Xiaofei advised with a serious face, as if Yun Tianhe was not in his thirties, but was only three years old…</p> 
 <p>However, compared with Bai Xiaofei, Yun Tianhe was indeed a novice in dealing with women. After all, Bai Xiaofei had gone through hundreds of such ‘battles!’</p> 
 <p>After making arrangements for Yun Tianhe, Bai Xiaofei received Mu Yun’s invitation to the top floor of the Moon Beck Pavilion to enjoy the stars.</p> 
 <p>Looking up at the galaxy high above, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help recalling a certain matter…</p> 
 <p>“Sister-in-law, if two people are in completely opposite parties, do you think they can still be together?” he asked Mu Yun.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Mu Yun smiled softly, “If there is love, what is impossible?”</p> 
 <p>Silence ensued. Gradually, Bai Xiaofei smiled.</p> 
 <p><em>No matter what, I will turn you into a normal person! Even if I have to bleed myself dry!</em></p> 
 <p>“Sister-in-law, what do you know about Princess Ling Ge?” Bai Xiao went back to business. After all, he had promised to solve Yun Tianhe’s problems.</p> 
 <p>“Tianhe once told me that he saved the princess’ life when she was very young. At that time, the princess vowed to marry him when she grew up. He only thought of it as a joke, but surprisingly, she never forgot it even after so many years. What happened today is expected,” Mu Yun said slowly. It was impossible to discern her feelings from her manner.</p> 
 <p>“What do you think of this matter, Sister-in-law?” Bai Xiaofei asked again, his eyes couldn’t help falling on Mu Yun’s smiling face.</p> 
 <p>“For Tianhe, this is a rare opportunity. As we all know, Princess Ling Ge is the apple of the emperor’s eye and doted on by all of her brothers. As far as the situation in the capital is concerned, no matter what choice Tianhe makes, he will always have a safe way out if he gains the support of Princess Ling Ge,” Mu Yun analyzed.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was secretly startled. He knew that Mu Yun was no ordinary woman, but he did not think she would have this kind of vision!</p> 
 <p>“However, although I haven’t known Big Brother for long, I can tell that he is not the kind of person that’s casual in love, let alone a sycophant. Seeing how he’s so infatuated with you, I am afraid this is more a curse than a blessing.” With a long sigh, Bai Xiaofei turned his head away.</p> 
 <p>“I did have such worries as well, but not anymore.” Mu Yun looked at Bai Xiaofei with a captivating smile. “Now that Tianhe has you, I believe that you can help him solve this problem because I can see that he is willing to listen to you. As for me, I don’t value an identity that much. I’m already satisfied to be able to share his worries,” Mu Yun took the initiative to say what Bai Xiaofei wanted to hear most before he could even ask. If he wanted to achieve the best of both worlds, Mu Yun’s attitude was very important!</p> 
 <p>“Sister-in-law, you are a great person. I believe my brother will be very happy in the future.” Bai Xiaofei smiled heartily, and the topic ended.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Yun Tianhe was doing his best to accompany the little devil who gave the whole imperial city a headache – Princess Ling Ge!</p> 
 <p>The number of people who weren’t afraid of her could be counted with one hand, and only in front of Yun Tianhe would she become a meek kitten.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Tianhe, when will you ask my father to marry me? Ling Ge can’t wait.” Holding Yun Tianhe’s arm, Ling Ge stared at him with a pout, obviously intending to take special measures if Yun Tianhe did not give her a satisfactory answer.</p> 
 <p>“Ling Ge, in fact…” Yun Tianhe just wanted to turn her down as he had always done before, but Bai Xiaofei’s warning instantly surfaced in his mind.</p> 
 <p>“In fact, what?!” Ling Ge’s voice was icy, the word disappointment written all over her face.</p> 
 <p>“In fact, I don’t think this is the right time. The Great Emperor is sick and the human puppet matter is giving me a headache. I really have no energy to think about love and stuff,” Yun Tianhe tactfully dodged the question.</p> 
 <p>“That is to say, you will propose once those things are over?!” Ling Ge’s disappointment was instantly replaced by surprise and delight and a smile bloomed on her face.</p> 
 <p>“We’ll have to wait and see. None of them are easy to deal wi…” Yun Tianhe suddenly stopped mid-sentence as his whole body tensed. He pulled Ling Ge behind him and shouted, “Who is there?! Show yourself!”</p> 
 <p>His only answer was two charging figures!</p> 
 <p>“Clowns!”</p> 
 <p>With a cold snort, Yun Tianhe moved. In order to protect Ling Ge, he had chosen to replicate Bai Xiaofei’s Purple Luan and activated Invincibility to shield them. At the same time, he used this opportunity to catch the two attackers.</p> 
 <p>“So you know you can’t use puppets against me. But do you really think I’m nothing without my puppet?!” Yun Tianhe said. Then, the sounds of bone being crushed resounded as his grip tightened.</p> 
 <p>The two attackers instantly lost consciousness from the pain.</p> 
 <p>However, this was only the beginning. After Invincibility timed out, four people shot out, still using no puppets at all!</p> 
 <p>This time, Yun Tianhe held Ling Ge up with one arm and told her, “Hold on tight to me!” Then, a long spear appeared in his hand as he turned to the attackers. “Since you want to fight with me, I will satisfy your wish! Good luck against my father’s Bright Moon Spear!”</p> 
 <p>With that, Yun Tianhe shook his wrist and the Bright Moon Spear instantly manifested a spear shadow that blocked two attackers. However, the other two took this opportunity to slash at Yun Tianhe’s back.</p> 
 <p>“Roaming Dragon Style!” Origin energy poured into the Bright Moon Spear. When Yun Tianhe let go, the spear seemed to come to life as it flew behind him and beat back the two attackers before returning to his hand.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, more assassins poured out from the dark, which made Yun Tianhe look troubled. If he was alone, the number of enemies would not be a problem at all. However, he had to ensure that Ling Ge was unscathed, thus 80% of his strength couldn’t be used.</p> 
 <p>After several rounds, Yun Tianhe suffered more and more injuries as one assassin after another emerged. The enemy clearly did not want him to make it out alive.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the city patrol was as if off the clock collectively, not responding at all despite the commotion.</p> 
 <p>“Yun Tianhe, today either you die or she dies. Choose one!”</p> 
 <p>The assassins suddenly stopped. While they seemed to be giving Yun Tianhe a choice, this was actually directed to Ling Ge.</p> 
 <p>Looking at the injured Yun Tianhe who was heavily panting, Ling Ge decisively broke free from his arms. “You have saved me once, this time I will save you!” she declared and stood protectively in front of Yun Tianhe. “If you must take a life, then mine should be more expensive!”</p> 
 <p>Ling Ge was determined. Compared with death, she was more afraid of losing Yun Tianhe.</p> 
 <p>“Ling Ge! You can’t!!! If anything happens to you, the whole imperial city will be turned upside down!!” Yun Tianhe struggled to stand up, but his injuries did not allow him.</p> 
 <p>“You want me to watch you die?!” Ling Ge shouted back.</p> 
 <p>“If it’s Princess Ling Ge, we don’t dare to do it ourselves. Here, do it yourself.” One of the assassins threw his dagger at Ling Ge’s foot and waited quietly.</p> 
 <p>“Our time is limited. If you don’t finish in five seconds, we won’t be polite!” The assassin leader pressed.</p> 
 <p>Ling Ge immediately picked up the dagger before looking back at Yun Tianhe.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Tianhe, I know you are tired of my pestering, but what can I do? I just love you too much. But you won’t have to worry about it anymore. Ling Ge will wish you happiness in heaven!” she said and sliced toward her own neck.</p> 
 <p>The moment the blade was about to connect, however, it turned into dust.</p> 
 <p>“Although I’m not clear about the situation, it’s not quite right for so many of you to bully two people,” a crisp voice called out. From the shadows, a girl who looked seventeen or eighteen walked out and looked disdainfully at the assassins.</p> 
 <p>The assassins had no habit for nonsense. Seeing the situation go south, they immediately split into two groups and rushed out – one toward the girls and one toward Yun Tianhe.</p> 
 <p>“Looking down on me, aren’t you?!” The girl snorted and swung her left hand. A series of black chains flew out and trapped the assassins. When she gripped her hand the next second, hair-raising screams rang out from within the chains.</p> 
 <p>Just one attack and all the assassins were killed!</p> 
 <p>“There’s more of you? Don’t run now.” The girl did not stop after handling all the assassins present. Her left hand waved again and more chains flew, pulling out seven or eight more assassins hiding in the dark.</p> 
 <p>“Leave one alive!” Yun Tianhe hurriedly cried. Unfortunately, he was too late…</p> 
 <p>“Sorry, my hand was too quick.” Clapping her hands, the girl walked to Yun Tianhe and Ling Ge, ignoring the vigilance on their faces as she said, “ Since I saved you, you should repay me, right?”</p> 
 <p>Ling Ge once again stood in front of Yun Tianhe and solemnly promised, “As long as there is something in the imperial city that you want, I will have it delivered immediately. Even if this city doesn’t have it, I will get someone to find it for you.”</p> 
 <p>However, the girl’s next sentence made Yun Tianhe’s heart leap to his throat.</p> 
 <p>“Tell me where Bai Xiaofei is!”</p> 
 <p><em>An enemy?!</em></p> 
 <p>That was the first thought that came to Yun Tianhe’s mind when he saw the girl’s serious expression…</p>
