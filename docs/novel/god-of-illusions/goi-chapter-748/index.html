 <p>Chapter 748: Official Contact!</p> 
 <p>Leading the way for Bai Xiaofei’s group of three, Liu Heng secretly felt uneasy. He had thought that Bai Xiaofei was his lifeline, but as time passed, doubt kept spreading in his heart.</p> 
 <p><em>Could this old guy have ulterior motives? But, if so, what is his intention? Does he really just want to purchase Blood Diamonds?</em></p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, Liu Heng couldn’t figure out no matter how hard he thought. After all, Bai Xiaofei himself had not expected that he’d meet someone useful so quickly.</p> 
 <p>Still, Liu Heng had no other option as his creditor did not give him much time. If he delayed any longer, his good friend might turn into a cold body.</p> 
 <p>“A casino of the Babel Merchant House?” Wu Chi sneered upon arriving at the destination.</p> 
 <p>No wonder the guy was in such a hurry. To be able to open casinos all over the continent, the Babel Merchant House relied not only on its economic power but also its absolute first-class ability to chase debts. The most obvious demonstration was that in recent years, no one dared to renege on the debts they owed the Babel casinos.</p> 
 <p>“We just wanted to let out some stress, but…” Liu Heng was embarrassed. It was not a glorious thing to gamble oneself into debt, especially up to this life-threatening state.</p> 
 <p>“It’s fine, that’s understandable.” Bai Xiaofei smiled and walked first into the casino.</p> 
 <p><em>Those who have hobbies will also have weaknesses. Since you like gambling, I will let you gamble until you can’t get rid of me!</em></p> 
 <p>Liu Heng despondently followed Bai Xiaofei all the way to the ‘reception room’ used to receive debtors, who were, of course, not treated very well there.</p> 
 <p>“It’s been an hour. It seems that your friend doesn’t want you to have this finger!”</p> 
 <p>“No, no, no! Please don’t! AHHH!!!”</p> 
 <p>The group had just approached when a tragic scream came out from the reception room. Liu Heng rushed in and saw that his friend had lost a finger.</p> 
 <p>“Old Song!” Liu Heng hugged his companion, who was dripping with cold sweat.</p> 
 <p>“You bastard, didn’t you say you would come back in half an hour?! ” Old Song screamed as he resentfully glared at Liu Heng. “My finger is f*cking gone!!”</p> 
 <p>In fact, they would have been able to leave if Liu Heng gave the Blood Diamond to the casino, but they only owed fifty thousand gold coins while the value of the peak-grade Blood Diamonds was significantly higher. Therefore, Liu Heng was unwilling to use it to clear their debt and tried to sell at a higher price.</p> 
 <p>“Shut it. This is not a place for you to quarrel. Either pay up or pay with yourselves. Two puppet masters can still sell for fifty thousand gold coins,” said the high-ranked staff coldly while fiddling with the finger that had just been snapped from Old Song’s hand.</p> 
 <p>“How much do they owe? I’ll pay for them.” Bai Xiaofei walked in and took out his Amethyst Card.</p> 
 <p>“So you have someone to pay your bill, huh? Not much, just fifty thousand gold coins.” The staff’s attitude did a 180-degree change.</p> 
 <p>“This is a one-time card with five hundred thousand gold coins in it. Exchange the surplus for chips and give them to my friends.” Bai Xiaofei handed the card over without blinking. Any sum with gold coins as the unit was nothing to him. In Starnet, he earned his money in Amethyst Coins.</p> 
 <p>The Babel casino was fast. It was not long after they received the card that 450,000 gold coins worth of chips were placed in front of Old Song and Liu Heng.</p> 
 <p>“If you can win back what you lost, pay me back. If you lose it all, let’s treat it as my meeting gift to you,” said Bai Xiaofei as he walked to Old Song,</p> 
 <p>Old Song’s instinctive reaction was to refuse. After all, he had just met Bai Xiaofei, and he still knew that there was no such thing as a free lunch. However, the chips were too tempting!</p> 
 <p>“I just met him. He is the boss of a merchant group that’s interested in trading Blood Diamonds,” Liu Heng explained after Old Song looked at him questioningly.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Old Song instantly accepted the chips and looked at Bai Xiaofei. “Alright, boss. No matter what, I’m very happy to be your friend!” He laughed, then his face suddenly twisted in pain after he touched the wound on his left hand.</p> 
 <p>“Wu Chi, give this friend a Muscle Revival Pill.”</p> 
 <p>Upon Bai Xiaofei’s order, Wu Chi took out a Muscle Revival Pill refined by Mo Ka and handed it to Old Song.</p> 
 <p>“Then, we will wait for your good news at the teahouse outside.”</p> 
 <p>With that, Bai Xiaofei left with Wu Chi and Wang Hang.</p> 
 <p>In the room, Liu Heng and Old Song stared blankly at each other. Happiness came a little too suddenly!</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei’s group settled in the nearby teahouse.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, aren’t you worried that the two of them will take the money and run? It’s not much money, but the important thing is where can we find Blood Diamonds if they run?” Wang Hang frowned in confusion.</p> 
 <p>“I might worry if it’s only Liu Heng, but that Old Song guy is an out-and-out gambler. He won’t miss the chance to latch on to a wealthy boss.” Bai Xiaofei savored the tea.</p> 
 <p>Wang Hang and Wu Chi kept their eyes on the casino opposite. Before long, a dejected Old Song and Liu Heng came out and quarreled at the door for a while. Old Song, clearly the winner of the quarrel, started walking toward the teahouse.</p> 
 <p>“My friend, over here.” Bai Xiaofei laughed joyously upon seeing Old Song come in.</p> 
 <p>Old Song hurriedly walked over with Liu Heng and sat down after exchanging courtesies.</p> 
 <p>“Let me introduce myself. I’m Bai Sicheng, a branch president of the Illusion Demon Merchant Group. Our business is on the rise, so we’ll trade for whatever makes good money. I originally came here to look into Starnet Stones, but I didn’t expect to meet you,” Bai Xiaofei briefly stated his purpose.</p> 
 <p>Old Song’s heart was put at ease. <em>He’s really a businessman!</em></p> 
 <p>“What makes you think we can provide Blood Diamonds? Just because of the peak-grade Blood Diamond that Liu Heng showed you?” Old Song voiced his last doubt.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei laughed. “I didn’t say that. I just don’t want to miss any chance, and now it seems that I made the right bet, didn’t I? My friend, gambling is in the nature of businessmen!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s perfect answer completely persuaded Old Song, who then straightened himself and got down to business…</p>
