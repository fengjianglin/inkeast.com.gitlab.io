 <p>“Big Sister Xue, I'm utterly incapable of giving you an answer to this question. With two drop dead gorgeous beauties like the two of you before a person's eyes, how could anyone make a comparison? Every single second of time would be used to admire the two of you.” Bai Xiaofei revealed a silly expression of someone that had just seen beauty which he’d learned from Fei Gou and Chu Gan, and it caused a smile to bloom once more on Xue Ying’s face.</p>
 <p>“Alright, alright, I won't make it difficult for you, and I'll let you off today because your mouth is so sweet.” Xue Ying revealed a satisfied smile as she turned around and left while pulling Lin Li along, and she didn't give Bai Xiaofei any further opportunity to take advantage of them.</p>
 <p>“We’ll go change and come over right away. You return to the classroom first. Hold on if anyone comes, and if you can't hold on, then I'll rush back to bury you.” Her teasing voice was still reverberating in the air when the figures of Xue Ying and Lin Li had vanished without a trace.</p>
 <p>For some unknown reason, Bai Xiaofei actually had a faint feeling of emptiness after the two of them left.</p>
 <p>“Alas, no wonder Third Father said all women are venomous. Can I be considered to have been poisoned?” Bai Xiaofei revealed a doubtful expression towards himself as he looked at the direction Xue Ying and Lin Li vanished towards before entering into slight contemplation.</p>
 <p><i>Whose poison have I been poisoned with?</i></p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei thought for a long time yet was unable to come to a conclusion, so he simply gave up this question that he was utterly incapable of figuring out before running towards the direction of the classroom.</p>
 <p><i>It's time to greet the storm!</i></p>
 <p>After he returned to the empty classroom, Bai Xiaofei felt a slight and indescribable sense of loss for some unknown reason.</p>
 <p>Perhaps it was because he hadn't seen so many people of the same age at the Gorge of Heroes. Even though they’d only been separated for less than half a day, Bai Xiaofei had already started to slightly miss those noisy students from his class.</p>
 <p>There was still another 20 minutes of time before class ended normally, and Bai Xiaofei who was bored to death started playing rock-paper-scissors with Huskie.</p>
 <p>Of course, the wager was Huskie’s dog food….</p>
 <p>After all, during the time he was threatened by Xue Ying earlier, Bai Xiaofei had promised an entire five days of double dog food for Huskie, and if he wasn’t able to win this back, Bai Xiaofei would probably spit blood from the amount Huskie would cost him.</p>
 <p>So, an extremely strange scene played out in the empty classroom. Two Bai Xiaofeis were sitting facing each other and started to play rock-paper-scissors with each other….</p>
 <p>Even though Huskie was Bai Xiaofei’s puppet, yet Huskie who was ‘well experienced in the ways of battle’ didn’t lose at the first possible moment, and only another 10 minutes remained before classes ended when Bai Xiaofei had won all the dog food back.</p>
 <p>“Good luck next time. I believe you’ll be able to defeat me one day.” Bai Xiaofei rubbed the head of Huskie that carried a wronged expression as he forcefully suppressed his impulse to roar with laughter.</p>
 <p>He loved Huskie’s stubbornness to always agree to play with him even after losing every single time….</p>
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei didn’t get to be happy for long when a wave of extremely noisy footsteps outside the classroom sounded out abruptly, and he could discern just from the sound that there were no less than 10 people!</p>
 <p>Since they had such a force, he didn’t have to think to know what they’d come for….</p>
 <p><i>“F*ck, that unreliable Xue Ying wouldn’t be seizing this opportunity to f*cking trap me, right?” </i>Bai Xiaofei suddenly recalled the meaningful smile Xue Ying revealed before leaving, and a drop of cold sweat couldn’t help but flow down from Bai Xiaofei’s forehead.</p>
 <p><i>Motherf*cker! Looks like I can only rely on myself for this first round!</i></p>
 <p>When he thought up to here, Bai Xiaofei didn’t wait for that group of people to charge over and acted a step earlier, and he kicking apart the wooden door that had been shattered countless times before this.</p>
 <p>“Dammit! Who’s making such a clamor outside? Don’t you know I have a f*cking bad mood!?” His extremely domineering appearance instantly shocked all the 10 plus seniors outside, but their courage instantly returned to them once they noticed the uniform that represented new students on Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“You’re Bai Xiaofei, right?!” The person in the lead was a senior from the Sword of Assault that wore a first year’s uniform, and the group of students that followed behind him were similarly first year students.</p>
 <p><i>Looks like the first wave is only the weakest wave. </i>Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but look down upon these people in his heart when he thought up to here.</p>
 <p><i>You’re only first year students. If you were second year students, then perhaps I would be slightly afraid of all of you. First years are only dogs at the lowest level like new students.</i></p>
 <p>“So what if I am, so what if I’m not? All of you have come here because my wife has probably resorted to some tricks again, right? Let me think…. The Bounty Rankings?” When facing Bai Xiaofei who was calm like Mount Tai, the mentality of the first year student in the lead instantly weakened slightly. No matter if it was Bai Xiaofei’s attitude or what Bai Xiaofei had said, it was truly unlike a new student, and it seemed even more like a veteran like them who’d been moving around in the academy for some time.</p>
 <p>“You know about the Bounty Rankings?” Zhao Han spoke with a tone of slight disbelief, and Bai Xiaofei was the first person he’d seen who was able to be so composed after being placed on the Bounty Rankings.</p>
 <p>“You should be asking who my wife is at a time like this, right?” Bai Xiaofei spoke casually before turning around and shouting towards the classroom. “Huskie, bring me a chair.”</p>
 <p>After a short moment, Huskie who still maintained Bai Xiaofei’s appearance walked out while carrying a chair, and it stunned everyone outside the door once again.</p>
 <p><i>Mimicry!</i></p>
 <p><i>It really is Mimicry!</i></p>
 <p><i>The rumors outside were actually true!</i></p>
 <p>“Fellow Seniors, I’m sorry but my body hasn’t been too well for these past two days, so I’m unable to stand for long. Moreover, all of you don’t seem like you have any intention of leaving right away, so I can only say sorry.” Bai Xiaofei seemed as if he completely didn’t take the 10 plus people before him seriously, and he sat down as he spoke in a manner that seemed extremely like the boss of a gang.</p>
 <p>“You and Qin Lingyan….” The tone of Zhao Han who was in the lead couldn't help but become slightly weaker, and in connection with this, the people that were following by his side had started whispering in discussion as well.</p>
 <p>As far as they were concerned, they’d already become the sacrifices of Qin Lingyan’s ‘domestic affairs’.</p>
 <p>“Arranged betrothal at childhood. One of the reasons I came to study here was to see my future wife, yet I never imagined that we would get into a fight.” Bai Xiaofei sighed as he spoke, and he revealed a helpless expression.</p>
 <p>A simple few words directly caused all 10 plus of them to enter into a muddled state. <i>So do we carry this assignment out now or not?</i></p>
 <p><i>If we don't, then wouldn't we have skipped class earlier for no reason?</i></p>
 <p><i>If we do, then what if the two of them make up? With Qin Lingyan’s connections, wouldn't killing us be a matter of a few minutes?</i></p>
 <p>For a time, a dilemma lay before all of them.</p>
 <p>“You said you were betrothed to Lingyan at childhood? Then why don't you tell us where she's from and what her background is?” A voice that was extremely familiar to Bai Xiaofei sounded out from within the crowd, and it instantly caused Bai Xiaofei’s heart to go partially cold.</p>
 <p>Subsequently, the crowd split apart before an 'old friend’ walked out with a face covered in smiles.</p>
 <p>Bai Ye!</p>
 <p>“Not bad, not bad. Bai Xiaofei, you're absolutely the boldest new student I, Bai Ye, have ever seen, and you even dared to make the false into something true before over 10 seniors. I hope you’ll be able to be so bold in the future as well!” Bai Ye utterly didn't give Bai Xiaofei the time to explain before passing judgment and placing the lid on the coffin. On the other hand, the others instantly found their confidence with the support of his words.</p>
 <p>Moreover, rage from being tricked by Bai Xiaofei came along with this confidence!</p>
 <p>“Everyone, I don’t have to say any further right? No matter if it’s for the sake of personal grudges or for the sake of completing the assignment. I presume that everyone will absolutely not disappoint me.” As soon as he finished speaking, Bai Ye moved to the side, and in the next second, all 10 plus of them withdrew their puppets at practically the exact same time before charging towards Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“Let me see who dares lay a hand on him!” Right when disaster was about to descend upon him, a beautiful figure descended from the skies and gave rise to a wave of air that directly blew down the group of people that were in the front.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was almost in tears when he saw Xue Ying’s familiar figure!</p>
 <p>From fear….</p>
