 <p>Chapter 629: Struck at A Glimpse!</p> 
 <p>The fast pace of the fight didn’t give everyone much time to stay in their stupor. Less than a second after his armor shot out, An Yue moved.</p> 
 <p>The audience then instantly understood what An Yue aimed to do!</p> 
 <p>A part of the disintegrated armor collided with An Ming’s ice spikes and completely nullified them, while the other scattered parts formed a ranged attack at him. However, this attack looked rather weak. It wasn’t difficult for a Proficient Rank to avoid it, so An Ming shifted slightly.</p> 
 <p>Yet, this seemingly insignificant action made several people’s faces change.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei laughed. An Yue had perfectly applied what he had taught him to actual combat. Meanwhile, Liu Rushi was anxious. As a Grandmaster Rank, he would be beyond useless if he didn’t realize the danger An Ming was in!</p> 
 <p>However, An Ming couldn’t see those reactions. All he could see at that moment was An Yue’s point-blank fist!</p> 
 <p><em>Bang!</em></p> 
 <p>An Yue’s right fist made heavy contact with An Ming’s nose. The latter felt a sour wave rushing up his nose before tears and snot flowed out.</p> 
 <p>And that was only the beginning! While An Ming was still dazed by the punch, An Yue grabbed his hand that was holding the short blade and jerked, immediately followed by a palm to his chest. An Ming’s hand instinctively loosened from the pain. Before he realized it, An Yue had tossed his dagger far away…</p> 
 <p>‘All puppet masters have a common weakness, that is, they rely too much on their puppets. Many are the most vulnerable when they just get separated from their puppets.’</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s teachings still echoed in An Yue’s ears. Looking at the flustered An Ming, he got first-hand experience of that lesson. A rain of punches then fell upon An Ming, and every time his fist connected, An Yue secretly felt a wave of pleasure.</p> 
 <p>For so many years, An Ming used his identity of the eldest prince who was ahead of the rest in strength to beat them up in the name of teaching them. An Yue was the one who had suffered the most. The backlog of emotions for so many years now exploded!</p> 
 <p>“Stop!” Liu Rushi finally couldn’t bear to watch anymore. At this rate, An Ming wouldn’t be able to even stand on the enthronement, let alone take the throne.</p> 
 <p>Accompanied by Liu Rushi’s shout was his deadly fire ring that flew out. He didn’t dare to kill An Yue, but it was still possible to ‘slip up.’ At worst, he’d just use the excuse that he was too anxious to save An Ming.</p> 
 <p>However, his reaction was within Bai Xiaofei’s expectations. A pair of purple wings unfolded on his back and he appeared on the path of the fire ring. Like at the banquet, he easily caught it with his bare hand.</p> 
 <p>“The old teacher jumps in after his disciple loses, huh?” Bai Xiaofei sneered. Liu Rushi’s face twitched.</p> 
 <p>“Explode!” shouted Liu Rushi.</p> 
 <p>The fire ring in Bai Xiaofei’s hand quickly heated up. When Bai Xiaofei reacted, it was already the start of the explosion…</p> 
 <p>BOOM!</p> 
 <p>With Bai Xiaofei at the center, a powerful heatwave spread, kicking up thick smoke and sending An Yue and An Ming flying.</p> 
 <p><em>Let’s see how you’re still alive after this!</em> thought Liu Rushi smugly while he swallowed back the blood that had rushed to his throat. Although this was a skill that his puppet enabled and not self-explosion, this skill caused heavy damage to the user. Therefore, Liu Rushi barely used it. However, every time he did, it never let him down!</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, he was disappointed this time…</p> 
 <p>After the smoke cleared, an unscathed Bai Xiaofei looked at Liu Rushi with a slight smile. The violent explosion didn’t even damage his clothes.</p> 
 <p>“Nice, but unfortunately its user isn’t very good at timing.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t attack back but only casually ridiculed Liu Rushi. It was this sentence that made Liu Rushi spit out that mouthful of blood…</p> 
 <p>“Tsk, what’s wrong? You must be overstrained. Where’s An Ming? Help your master down and get him treated quickly, prolonged internal injury will affect the body!” Bai Xiaofei said.</p> 
 <p>Everyone’s eyes fell on An Ming, who was struggling to crawl up. He looked even worse than Liu Rushi.</p> 
 <p>“Bai Xiaofei! You bully… “ Liu Rushi viciously shouted, but only halfway through, he froze as if seeing a ghost.</p> 
 <p>Liu Rushi wasn’t the only one. Apart from An Bang Ting, the rest shared the same reaction.</p> 
 <p>“It’s no wonder that you have the three ladies covered up, Brother Bai. They turn out to be such striking beauties. If I’m not mistaken, they must be from the Kingdom of Snow,” An Bang Ting broke the silence and also let Bai Xiaofei understand what was going on.</p> 
 <p>The explosion didn’t hurt the audience, but it blew away the turbans and veils covering the Leng triplets, revealing their appearances.</p> 
 <p>As far as their looks were concerned, each of them was enough to make countless people covet them, not to mention that it was identical triplets. Especially just now, they had different expressions that gave people different feelings despite having the same faces. This was their greatest charm…</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother An has sharp eyes. They are indeed from the Kingdom of Snow. We were actually on our way there to find a senior when passing by Tranquil. Originally, we didn’t want any delay, but your warm invitation and your rare Downwind Boat kept us.”</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei spoke, the triplets had put on their veils. However, their stunning looks had been deeply imprinted in everyone’s mind.</p> 
 <p>“So I have affected Brother Bai’s business. Please rest assured that when this matter is over, the Downwind Boat will be yours!” With a wave of his hand, An Bang Ting promised away his precious treasure that was yearned by many. As for An Ming being beaten and Liu Rushi deliberately hurting people, he acted as if he hadn’t seen anything and had no plans to mention it at all.</p> 
 <p>Similarly, Bai Xiaofei was not stupid. He did not resume the topic that An Bang Ting was obviously avoiding.</p> 
 <p>“It seems today’s assessment will end ahead of schedule, but I believe that you have seen what you want to see.” Bai Xiaofei laughed.</p> 
 <p>An Bang Ting laughed as well. “The assessment is over, but it should be time for a meal together, don’t you think?”</p>
