 <p>Chapter 746: Preparation!</p> 
 <p>The group unwillingly prepared to sleep in the wild for the night.</p> 
 <p>After drawing lots, Mo Ka and Wu Chi were chosen to stand guard. The only thing they gained the next morning were dark circles around their eyes…</p> 
 <p>“We can’t take the carriages here on out. From now on, we are a small team from the Illusion Demon Merchant Group. The Blackscale Horses are too eye-catching.” After breakfast, Bai Xiaofei made an announcement that made everyone’s heart sink.</p> 
 <p>While by their estimation they should have arrived at Starflame City the previous day, it was calculated based on the speed of Blackscale Horses. Without the carriage, it would already be quick if they could arrive before noon today.</p> 
 <p>Moreover, according to Bai Xiaofei’s plan, they were going to take the long, remote route…</p> 
 <p>“Brother Fei, didn’t you say we’ll go around Starflame City? Why can’t we put away the carriages after that?” Shi Kui looked at Bai Xiaofei with a pitiful face.</p> 
 <p>Wu Chi and Mo Ka followed and made the same expression. Bai Xiaofei found them extremely cringy.</p> 
 <p>“I’ve changed my mind. Starflame City is now the place we must visit. If we avoid it, it won’t be easy to find another clue.” Bai Xiaofei grinned as he extinguished the fire of hope in the three guys’ hearts. It was obvious from his expression that the matter was not negotiable.</p> 
 <p>“Look at you three big men, isn’t it just walking a little?” Xu Chen snorted. Carrying her big sword, she marched forth while shouting, “Little Ye, lead the way!”</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye immediately ran ahead. Being away to help with Illusion Demon, he had made Xu Chen wait for a long time. Now, it was an opportunity for him to redeem himself.</p> 
 <p>Those who were not single tried to hide their laughter, while the single ones like Wu Chi and Shi Kui… were forced to eat a mouthful of <a href="https://www.purpleculture.net/dictionary-details/?word=%E7%8B%97%E7%B2%AE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dog food</a>.</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother Fei, be honest, what do you think of this mission? I heard the academy originally planned to raise it to SSS rank. Are you not worried at all?” Chen Hui came to Bai Xiaofei’s side and solemnly asked in a low voice.</p> 
 <p>Over the years, he was the one who had changed the most among the Savage Class, initially trying to defy everyone to currently willing to listen and follow orders.</p> 
 <p>“What can’t be solved when we are together, right, my Energy Stream Master Rank puppet master friend?” Bai Xiaofei patted his shoulder without giving a direct answer.</p> 
 <p>Sometimes, it gave the best hope to remain vague. After all, Bai Xiaofei could feel that the situation was not simple, just like every one of his previous experiences.</p> 
 <p>Time passed amidst the whining of the guys. However, in fact, the distance could only be regarded as a warm-up for the current Savage Class, who never stopped training according to what Xue Ying had taught. Physical fitness was always one of the main focuses.</p> 
 <p>It was worth mentioning that Luo Han, who appeared so delicate, did not fall short of the Savage Class members at all and even looked more energetic than them. In addition, she mingled well with the group, not only chatting happily with the girls but also could occasionally respond to the class clowns’ jokes.</p> 
 <p>As a result, everyone secretly labeled her as ‘not simple’!</p> 
 <p>“Finally!!” Seeing the outline of Starflame City from a distance, Wu Chi jumped in excitement.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei came to a stop. “Well, it’s time to prepare,” he said.</p> 
 <p>In a fiery flash, Golden Feather appeared beside him in her human form.</p> 
 <p>“Aunt Gold, please.”</p> 
 <p>“I got you.” Golden Feather waved her hand.</p> 
 <p>A sea of flame then enveloped everyone. When the flame dispersed, everyone’s appearance had changed.</p> 
 <p>“This is too damn awesome!!” Wu Chi touched the stubble on his face and was amazed by how real it felt.</p> 
 <p>“Just a little spell. Although my power is limited, I’ve recovered some abilities during this period. This spell can’t be seen through by anyone whose spirit is lower ranked than me.” Golden Feather smiled as her words shocked everyone.</p> 
 <p>This was not the first time that the Savage Class had seen Golden Feather. After returning from the Holy Snow Mountain, Bai Xiaofei had introduced her to them, the important part being her identity as he did not hide the information about the other world.</p> 
 <p>There was no harm in knowing such a thing. It could even broaden their horizons. The Starnet Continent was not the only one, beyond their world were even more worlds!</p> 
 <p>“Aunt Gold, you know other spells?! Doesn’t that mean Brother Fei will be invincible in the future?!” Mo Ka inched close to Golden Feather with sparkling eyes, hopeful to learn something from her.</p> 
 <p>“Not really, it can’t exceed certain limits you know. The power I can exert mainly depends on Xiaofei’s strength. These small tricks don’t mean much in actual combat.” Golden Feather was modest, but it was because she didn’t know enough about Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>For him, all those seemingly useless little tricks actually made it possible to be invincible. Fighting had never been his first choice. Why use brute force when you could solve problems with your brain?</p> 
 <p>“Alright, this stops here. If you don’t want to have lunch outside as well, you’d better move now. Also, pay attention to your identity after entering Starflame City. Don’t let what you learned in our camouflage course go to waste.” Bai Xiaofei’s voice had become older to match his present appearance of a middle-aged manager with a big belly that was similar to Chu Qingtian.</p> 
 <p>The rest also had new identities. Lin Li, Hu Xian’er, Luo Han were obviously the boss’ wives from their outfits, while Fang Ye was their steward.</p> 
 <p>Wang Hang, Wu Chi, Shi Kui, Ming One, Ming Two, and Xing Nan were dressed as guards and all looked of different ages. Chen Hui was the only one who retained the identity of a puppet master. For a caravan, the existence of a puppet master was essential.</p> 
 <p>Duan Yiyi and Zhu Nuo were assigned identities closest to their real age as Bai Xiaofei’s daughters. Xu Chen, Zhu Sisi, Qi Wei, and Rui Mengqi were dressed as maids. Rui Mengqi was well acquainted with this identity, while Zhu Sisi and Qi Wei adapted quickly. Only Xu Chen looked down at her maid’s outfit with a frown.</p> 
 <p><em>Why can’t I be a bodyguard?! Are you looking down on women?!</em></p>
