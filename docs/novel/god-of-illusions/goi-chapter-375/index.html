 <p>Chapter 375: Problem of the Century!</p> 
 <p>After Yun Jingshuang and Han Qianye left, Bai Xiaofei’s pace slowed to a crawl for the rest of the road. Despite him deliberately stalling for time though, he still couldn’t cook up a decent resolution for the present deadlock. He considered hiding, but he knew the result of that would be worse than anything else.</p> 
 <p>As Yun Jingshuang had said, the Demon of Illusions was currently very lively! And this ‘liveliness’ definitely didn’t just include the original residents. Bai Xiaofei didn’t even dare to think of everyone that would be there.</p> 
 <p>The greater the expectation, the greater the disappointment. If he counted less than the actual number, preparations would be inadequate…</p> 
 <p>“Damn it! You’re finally back, Xiaofei! There would have been a fight soon if you didn’t return!” Yun Sheng’s anxious voice rang out while Bai Xiaofei was still in a daze. It wasn’t difficult to judge the situation from his tone. The word ‘fight’ made Bai Xiaofei shudder.</p> 
 <p><em>If those fight, it’d be a battle of the century!</em></p> 
 <p>“How many are there?” Bai Xiaofei asked weakly as his heart leaped to his throat.</p> 
 <p>“Eh… this… I didn’t count, but quite a few!” After pondering for a moment, Yun Sheng simply gave up on counting and pulled on Bai Xiaofei’s arm. “You’ll know when you go in. Anyway, you can’t run. Since you’ll have to face this sooner or later, just go and have a look!”</p> 
 <p>That was the truth, Bai Xiaofei could not escape!</p> 
 <p>Letting Yun Sheng drag him all the way, Bai Xiaofei arrived at the dining place, which had become an exhibition hall of beauties at the moment. Looking around, there was no one there who wasn’t pleasing to the eye…</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er, Chu Liuyun, the Leng sisters, Lin Li, Xue Ying, Qin Lingyan, Zhen Qi, and even Rui Mengqi who was there to watch the show. Everyone was sitting there quietly, drinking tea, chatting in groups of two or three, or simply had their eyes closed in wait.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, you are back!” exclaimed Rui Mengqi in delight, as everyone looked over.</p> 
 <p>The feeling of being the focus of all attention made Bai Xiaofei’s scalp tingle. If being watched by a beautiful woman was a blessing, what about being watched by a group of beautiful women?</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei couldn’t explain it in words, but it was definitely no blessing.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, did you take your medicine? Are you sick? Let me check!” Rui Mengqi, as always, failed to read the room. As she talked, she didn’t even give Bai Xiaofei a chance to react and just rushed over anxiously. Then, in front of all eyes, she gently touched Bai Xiaofei’s forehead then her own before a pleased look appeared on her face. “Mhm, our boss really behaved and took his medicine. There’s no problem at all!”</p> 
 <p>Rui Mengqi gently patted Bai Xiaofei on the head, and this intimate action immediately drew a series of murderous glares. Unfortunately, the girl didn’t feel anything at all while Bai Xiaofei took this attack head-on!</p> 
 <p><em>Oh f*ck, nooo! You can be my ancestor, alright?! Just please, stop trying to get me killed!</em></p> 
 <p>With an intense urge to cry, Bai Xiaofei hurriedly organized a speech as he gently removed Rui Mengqi’s hand.</p> 
 <p>“I’m fine. Now I have something to deal with, just quietly wait aside, okay?” Trying to say this as calmly as possible, Bai Xiaofei never feared more that Rui Mengqi would act up again.</p> 
 <p>For once, Rui Mengqi actually nodded. However, she had already done more than enough damage. When Bai Xiaofei looked around at the rest of the people in the room, if looks could kill, the dagger-like glares were enough to kill him several times over…</p> 
 <p>“Err… well, long time no see.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei forced out a greeting, but no one responded. The embarrassment with a capital E was suffocating.</p> 
 <p>“Say, the second round will start tomorrow, I bet you are all well-prepared!”</p> 
 <p>Still no response even though Bai Xiaofei mentioned an important topic.</p> 
 <p><em>Angels, please help!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Master, what do I do in this situation?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Anyone, please light a way, anything!!!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei felt that he was going crazy. However, not to mention going crazy, even death might not be enough as a punishment in this situation…</p> 
 <p>“Can… can I say something?” At a dead end, Bai Xiaofei risked his life to ask a question that he shouldn’t have asked at all.</p> 
 <p>However, this time he did get a response!</p> 
 <p>“You should be able to guess why so many people have gathered here,” said Hu Xian’er lightly, her aura was completely different from when she was alone with him.</p> 
 <p>If it weren’t that everyone knew she was a freshman, it would be totally believable to say she was a fourth-year senior!</p> 
 <p>“Can I not attend this meeting? But I promise I’ll help you all find the right partner!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei vowed, only to earn even colder stares.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, alright, I didn’t say anything!” There was no need for the girls to express their opinions, Bai Xiaofei himself chickened out.</p> 
 <p>Throwing away the subjective factors, if Bai Xiaofei were to choose a person from this group as his helper, he would definitely choose Qin Linyan because she was the weakest. As for Zhen Qi, she was out of his consideration. Her purpose of coming here was only to ask Bai Xiaofei to help arrange for some teammates. Although she was called here by Hu Xian’er, it was Bai Xiaofei’s idea.</p> 
 <p>However, it was now impossible for him to only consider only objective factors. To put it bluntly, this was a competition, one where the girls competed for influence!</p> 
 <p>And it was one that only did harm to Bai Xiaofei. No matter who he chose, he would be in the wrong! Moreover, Bai Xiaofei could not run. It was clear that escaping this one would only bring him endless suffering in the future. So, it was obvious what he had to do. He must come up with a perfect solution without hurting anyone – Not participating in the competition was the best choice!</p> 
 <p>Now, what he needed was a reason to quit. A reason that didn’t look like escaping but could actually help him escape.</p> 
 <p>However, this was easier said than done. Where on earth could he find such a reason?</p> 
 <p>“I know that my participation will have a great influence on the results, and I don’t want any of you to be eliminated in the second round, so I need you to understand your current situation first. That is, who are you looking for in the other two grades?” His voice serious, Bai Xiaofei chose to play dumb.</p> 
 <p>Since I can’t think of a good reason, I’ll just go the roundabout way!</p> 
 <p><em>You guys want to compete? Then I’ll pretend I don’t know! I’ll just treat this from an objective point of view! I don’t believe you guys would dare to express your true thoughts!</em></p> 
 <p>And it turned out that Bai Xiaofei made the right gamble, nobody was going to speak out about it.</p>
