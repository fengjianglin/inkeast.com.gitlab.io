 <p>Chapter 294: Energy System Test, Feng Wuhen’s Astonishment</p> 
 <p>Looking at Wu Chi kneeling in front of him, Bai Xiaofei felt a kind of panic he’d never felt before.</p> 
 <p>“The heck?! If you don't get the f*ck up, I’m leaving!”</p> 
 <p>This ceremonious action was so much for Bai Xiaofei that his head stopped functioning for a moment. There was gold under every man’s knees<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>, and this was the kind of gold Bai Xiaofei couldn’t afford!</p> 
 <p>“Brother Fei, hear me out first, okay?” With rare stubbornness in his eyes, for the first time, Wu Chi refused to comply with Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Then stand up and say it!” Bai Xiaofei wanted to pull Wu Chi up, but the latter was dead set on resisting. In the end, Bai Xiaofei compromised, “30 seconds. If you don't stand up in 30 seconds, don't ever see me again!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Wu Chi's eyes immediately shone and his usually witless mouth instantly turned into a machine gun.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Fei, I don't know what to say to express my gratitude, but from now on, my life will be yours, completely. If you want me to go east, I will never go west. Whoever you want me to beat up, I will beat them to near death!” Speaking until here, Wu Chi suddenly got stuck despite his excitement and the fact that he still nursed a full belly of words to say.</p> 
 <p>Yet, no matter what, he couldn't voice anything. Excitement didn’t enrich one's lexicon, illiteracy was just that scary!</p> 
 <p>“30 seconds is up,” announced Bai Xiaofei indifferently as he looked at Wu Chi in a way that allowed no opposition.</p> 
 <p>The next second, Wu Chi sprang up because if he didn’t, he might just be down on the floor for the rest of today.</p> 
 <p>“Stop all that nonsense, damn it. Thank the stars that there is no one else around, or else if I’d become the public focus again. You think I don’t have enough trouble already?” Bai Xiaofei slapped Wu Chi heavily on the head. Wu Chi foolishly smiled and didn’t say a word to rebut.</p> 
 <p>In fact, he wanted to, but he dared not. Moreover, he didn't know how to put it in words. There were too few people who could outspeak Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Let's go, time to buy puppets for our idiot puppet master.”</p> 
 <p>Casting Wu Chi a glare, Bai Xiaofei walked towards the stairs. Feng Wuhen followed with a chuckle. Still with a big smile on his face, Wu Chi was quick to react this time and didn’t fall behind, only that his face wasn’t very pretty-looking while smiling right after just bawling like that.</p> 
 <p>Just as the trio was walking upstairs, the receptionist just now was leading a mustached downstairs, seeming to be in quite a hurry. They were apparently surprised upon seeing the trio.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Wei.” Feng Wuhen broke the awkward atmosphere with an embarrassed smile.</p> 
 <p>The person in front was the president of the Ethereal Pavilion branch in Starnet – Wei Feng.</p> 
 <p>“Are you returning?” With a hint of displeasure in his tone, Wei Feng looked at Feng Wuhen plaintively, the kind of look that a wife would give her husband when he didn't come home for a long time.</p> 
 <p>“I'm just here to buy something, I have no other intention,” said Feng Wuhen as his expression gradually relaxed. As Bai Xiaofei had said, he had to face the Ethereal Pavilion sooner or later.</p> 
 <p>“You’re not here to cause a ruckus either, right?”</p> 
 <p>Wei Feng’s question brought a pained smile to Feng Wuhen’s face.</p> 
 <p><em>Cause a ruckus? Are you for real?</em></p> 
 <p>“We’re really just here to buy puppets,” Feng Wuhen emphasized as his expression faltered a little. Wei Feng noticed this and immediately laughed out loud.</p> 
 <p>“I'm just kidding, just say what you want. It’s not like you don’t know what we have here.” What Wei Feng said was true, Feng Wuhen knew much more clearly than him about the current inventory of the pavilion.</p> 
 <p>However, Feng Wuhen didn’t choose anything and turned to Wu Chi. They still didn’t know what the puppet preference of the main character of this visit was.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Wu Chi, you don't have a puppet yet. What stream do you plan to go with?”</p> 
 <p>A century-old problem had been raised. This question was enough to torment countless people who had just become puppet masters, especially those with decidophobia.</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, Wu Chi had no hesitation. He had fantasized about this day time and time again, so he had long thought about what kind of puppet master he wanted to be.</p> 
 <p>“If possible, I want to continue my previous melee combat style, and because I have the Heavenly Origin Physique, I don't have to worry about origin energy consumption, so the puppet just has to be strong enough. On this basis, the preferred order is Energy Stream first, Transformation Stream second, and Onslaught last.”</p> 
 <p>Wu Chi said a string of words in an orderly way and successfully stunned Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p><em>Way to go! When did he consider things so clearly?</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei who had ‘surprise’ written all over his face didn’t know that Wu Chi’s decision came from over ten years of accumulation. Yearning for something over ten years, even a fool would consider it clearly.</p> 
 <p>“In that case, there are a few puppets suitable for you, but you have to do a test first.” Another test again, but Wu Chi didn’t at all find what Wei Feng said troublesome.</p> 
 <p>If he needed to do a test, then it must be the energy test – his first priority type.</p> 
 <p>The excited Wu Chi was taken to a testing room again, only that this one was on the second floor, and the room was more delicate.</p> 
 <p>“Go in. When I say start, unleash your origin energy and don't stop until I tell you to.” Wei Feng took on the role of host and gave Wu Chi the final instructions.</p> 
 <p>Under the expectant gazes of Bai Xiaofei and Feng Wuhen, Wu Chi's test officially began. Abundant origin energy surged out. After Wu Chi became a puppet master, his level of control over origin energy rose at least several notches!</p> 
 <p>To say he had a good foundation wasn’t just an exaggeration!</p> 
 <p>As origin energy flooded out, the originally dark room lit up in an instant as all kinds of colorful light spots rapidly rotated around Wu Chi. Gradually, some spots grew further away from him while some flew closer. Among them, the closest one was a blood-red spot which in the end even stopped rotating and fell right on his hand.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this scene, Feng Wuhen who was standing on the other side of the glass, instantly stared with wide eyes, and then dully looked at Wei Feng next to him.</p> 
 <p>“That doesn't represent that thing, does it?” There was panic in Feng Wuhen’s voice, while Wei Feng nodded with a solemn expression.</p> 
 <p>“There is no need to ask when you know better than I what puppets are stored in our warehouse,” stated Wei Feng coldly. A difficult look also appeared on Feng Wuhen’s face.</p> 
 <p>“What's the matter? Is there a problem?” the nervous Bai Xiaofei immediately asked. He didn't want any accident to happen to Wu Chi, or else he’d greatly regret it.</p> 
 <p>“If you regard it as a problem, it’s not really a serious one, but if you don’t see it as a problem, it is a bit too fatal. To put it simply, it’s a hidden danger.” Even when Feng Wuhen explained it so vaguely, he still seemed very hesitant.</p> 
 <p>“You can come out.” Wei Feng was indifferent. He just called Wu Chi out.</p> 
 <p>The test was over. The rest would depend on what choice Wu Chi would make.</p>
