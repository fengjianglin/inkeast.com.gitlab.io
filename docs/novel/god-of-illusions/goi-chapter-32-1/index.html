 <p>“I do want to leave, but I can’t leave her behind, right?” Bai Xiaofei had a bitter expression of being stuck between a rock and a hard place. Logically speaking, having a beauty in his arms was something he ought to be extremely joyful about, but he was really unable to feel happy with Xue Ying present here.</p>
 <p>“Then follow me and bring Little Li Li to the infirmary. This is a really beneficial job, so you wouldn’t be unwilling, right?” Xue Ying chucked, and she could even compete with Bai Xiaofei when being indecent.</p>
 <p>“It would be even better if you didn’t go….” As he muttered in a low voice, Bai Xiaofei carried Lin Li up onto his back.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t that Bai Xiaofei didn’t want to hold her in his arms like a princess but Lin Li was already completely fatigued, and her entire body was limp to the point of being impossible to hold up….</p>
 <p>“Let’s go!” Xue Ying carried a trace of excitement that seemed to come from nowhere as she led the way, and she completely disregarded Bai Xiaofei’s bitter expression.</p>
 <p>But, not long after, Bai Xiaofei had a bad premonition.</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Xue, are you sure you know where the infirmary is?” Bai Xiaofei asked with a tone that didn’t seem questioning, whereas, Xue Ying’s reactions were really just as he expected — she was slightly stunned because her beautiful face instantly flushed down to the neck.</p>
 <p>“How could I possibly not know!? I’ve only not been there before! The academy’s handbook says that the infirmary is by the Furnace of Agarwood, so I’ll be able to find it sooner or later!” Xue Ying turned around and glared fiercely at Bai Xiaofei, and her gaze carried the meaning that said ‘I’ll kill you if you speak any further’.</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Xue, I can stroll around with you but you have to consider Lin Li. If we continue searching blindly like this, then she’ll probably wake up herself in a while….” At the critical moment, Bai Xiaofei resolutely took out his shield, and needless to say, this shield was effective indeed.</p>
 <p>After pouting her lips and staring at Bai Xiaofei for a long time and after a moment of conflict, Xue Ying finally made a compromise.</p>
 <p>“Alright, I’ll go ask someone!” Xue Ying left Bai Xiaofei and Lin Li on the spot before instantly vanishing without a trace.</p>
 <p>Presently, it just happened to be the time for afternoon classes, so there weren’t many people outside. But, luckily, Xue Ying’s speed was sufficiently swift, and she found someone very quickly….</p>
 <p>“Ah!!! Big Sister! Big Sister, I was wrong!!!” As he waited, Bai Xiaofei suddenly heard a pair of extremely miserable shrill cries, and he hesitated for a moment before hurriedly carrying Lin Li on his back before running towards the direction the shrill cries came from.</p>
 <p>In next to no time, Bai Xiaofei saw a scene that wasn’t much different to what he’d expected.</p>
 <p>“Who did you call Big Sister!? Am I that old!!!?” Muffled bangs of fist and foot ‘colliding intimately’ with bodies sounded out repeatedly, and two second year students that were beaten to the point of being in disorder were curled up on the ground.</p>
 <p>“Enough, enough! Big Sister Xue! If you hit them anymore, it’ll cost them their lives!” Bai Xiaofei carried Lin Li on his back while trying his best to charge over with the swiftest speed he could bring forth and rescue these two seniors from calamity.</p>
 <p>“Didn’t I ask you to go ask for directions? Why…. Why….” As he looked at the miserable state of the two people on the ground, Bai Xiaofei was actually temporarily at a loss for how to describe this scene….</p>
 <p>“These two little brats tried to flirt with me. Don’t you think they deserve a beating!?” Xue Ying that was panting with rage was very much alike to a little child. At the very least, she wasn’t the slightest bit domineering as she was during classes.</p>
 <p>“Them being able to flirt with you is a good thing!” Bai Xiaofei wouldn’t stop without shocking everyone with his words. As soon as he spoke, Xue Ying’s fist has already been swung up yet at the second before it was about to smash onto Bai Xiaofei, a sentence that changed Xue Ying’s decision was spoken in time.</p>
 <p>“That means that Big Sister Xue looks young like a junior sister, so the seniors dare to flirt with you. Otherwise, if they took you as a teacher, then how courageous would they be to dare to flirt with you?” A tempest was instantly calmed yet Bai Xiaofei’s cold sweat had already flowed down from his forehead.</p>
 <p>This was like the saying, to be in the king’s company was tantamount to being in the presence of a tiger, and he could be considered to have experienced the feelings of Mo Ka and the others….</p>
 <p>“Fine, I’ll leave the rest to you. I’ll go back and get my clothes first so as to avoid some ignorant little kids killing my mood.” As she spoke, Xue Ying who only wore the tight black clothes she used during training ran away like a wisp of smoke, and she completely forgot the passed-out Lin Li who was still on Bai Xiaofei’s back.</p>
 <p>“Err, Senior, I’m sorry. My class’s head teacher is like that, and she cares especially about her age.” After he sent Xue Ying off, Bai Xiaofei heaved a long sigh of relief, and then he turned around to look at the two seniors that were beaten to the point of being in disorder and started to clean up after Xue Ying….</p>
 <p>“It’s fine, it’s fine. We actually ought to thank you.” A senior that could be considered to be sober stood up hastily, and it was utterly impossible to see exactly what expression he revealed at this moment because of his facial features that were completely warped. But, the trace of gratitude in his tone wasn’t fake.</p>
 <p>If it wasn’t for Bai Xiaofei, then really might have perished here today….</p>
 <p>“Why don’t… all of us go to the infirmary together?” Bai Xiaofei’s tone carried a trace of a probing intention and didn’t directly ask for directions. After all, these seniors were already in this state, so they probably were unable to go anywhere else.</p>
 <p>“Good, good, good!” The sober senior kicked his companion as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Get up Fat Dog. She has left already, so there’s no need to play dead.” The senior that was called Fat Dog staggered up right away, and his pair of sneaky looking eyes carefully looked towards the surroundings before he heaved a long sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>“F*ck you, Bamboo! How many times have I told you? I’m f*cking called Fei Gou, not Fat Dog![1. Fei Gou sounds exactly like Fat Dog in Chinese.]” Fei Gou who stood up instantly started grumbling, whereas, the nearby Bai Xiaofei broke out into cold sweat.</p>
 <p><i>Trash Dog…. Fat Dog….[2. Same as before.]</i></p>
 <p><i>There doesn’t seem to be anything that sounds nice….</i></p>
 <p>“Alright, alright, alright. Trash Dog, Trash Dog. Whatever you say. Let’s go quickly so that our junior doesn’t laugh at us.” After he yielded, the thin senior called Bamboo turned to look at Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go, junior brother.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, alright.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei hurriedly replied before slightly adjusting the position of Lin Li on his back, and then he followed behind Fat Dog and Bamboo.</p>
 <p>Maybe it was for the sake of repaying Bai Xiaofei’s ‘life saving’ grace, Bamboo and Fat Dog’s fervor all along the way caused Bai Xiaofei to feel his scalp go slightly numb.</p>
 <p>From the basic construct of the academy up until various strange and odd gossip, their quantity of ‘knowledge’ was simply vast like the ocean….</p>
 <p>But, Bai Xiaofei learned something. Besides those things that Bai Ye had told him in the past, there were many things that were still extremely useful to a new student like Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>However, when Bai Xiaofei heard of one of these gossips, a strand of coldness instantly crawled up his neck.</p>
 <p>Because this gossip was related to him!</p>
 <p>No, precisely speaking, this was already not a piece of gossip, and it was a bloody fact!</p>
 <p>After numerous incidents were spread out and under Qin Lingyan’s hard work, Bai Xiaofei’s name had already been hung high above on the Bounty Rankings of the academy….</p>
 <p>“Err, Senior, what’s this Bounty Rankings?” Bai Xiaofei held a perturbed feeling in his heart as he asked with a light voice.</p>
 <p>He knew that the incident that occurred last night would have huge consequences, yet he never imagined that these consequences would seem to have slightly exceeded the scope of his control….</p>
