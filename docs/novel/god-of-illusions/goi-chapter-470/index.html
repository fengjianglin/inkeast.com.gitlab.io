 <p>Chapter 470: Huskie is not a Husky?</p> 
 <p>As Huskie turned into a white light that merged into Bai Xiaofei’s body, Bai Xiaofei, whose body was already bigger than that of his peers, soared in size as if injected with hormones. In a blink of an eye, he became a little giant!</p> 
 <p>In addition to getting bigger, his body gained non-human characteristics, such as pointy ears, gray fluff, longer fingers, and sharper, harder nails. The most incredible was that his body proportion had changed and his limbs were obviously much longer than that of human beings.</p> 
 <p>After this transformation, Bai Xiaofei finally realized that he had misunderstood something for more than ten years.</p> 
 <p>Huskie wasn’t a dog…</p> 
 <p>It was a wolf!</p> 
 <p>This begged the question, how could it have been regarded as a husky<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span> for so long?</p> 
 <p>This actually dated back to when Bai Xiaofei had first been taken to the Gorge of Heroes. It all started with a sentence from his First Father: “This husky looks quite delicious!”</p> 
 <p>From then on, everyone thought that Huskie was a husky, and so it was raised as a husky and played around with the other dogs in the Gorge of Heroes all day long. Over time, even Huskie felt that it was a husky…</p> 
 <p>Therefore, up to now, the Huskie who had never grown much had always been treated as a husky…</p> 
 <p>However, after using the Spiritualization Art, Bai Xiaofei understood that Huskie was a wolf, one of noble blood at that! This secret art allowed access to all the abilities of the magical beast before it was made into an animated puppet, and what appeared in Bai Xiaofei’s head at the moment were countless abilities!</p> 
 <p>Mimicry was only one of Huskie’s relatively low-level abilities. Unfortunately, Huskie in its puppet state could only strengthen this one ability…</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, all those abilities didn’t go to waste. Bai Xiaofei was glad that he had decided to learn the Spiritualization Art from Old Man Gu Xing. Otherwise, Huskie’s other abilities would have been completely buried!</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the onlookers were completely floored. They didn’t know what abilities Bai Xiaofei inherited from Huskie, but they could see very clearly that he had transformed!</p> 
 <p><em>Isn’t this the ability of the Transformation Stream?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Didn’t they all say that he is a puppet master of the Illusion Stream?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>What the hell is this?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Dual-stream puppet master?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Even if he is a dual-stream, it still can’t be the Transformation Stream! How do you even complete a Divine Beast Transformation without gathering seven puppets first?!</em></p> 
 <p>As astonishment rose from the bottom of everyone’s hearts, Zhu Guang grew solemn. He had battled puppet masters of the Transformation Stream before. As long as he tested out Bai Xiaofei’s ability, he would have an 80% chance of winning!</p> 
 <p>“I don’t have much time. Let’s start!” said Bai Xiaofei in a low voice as he instantly entered his combat state.</p> 
 <p>Zhu Guang’s heart suddenly tightened. He instinctively activated the defensive barrier on his armor, which, however, did nothing.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had already appeared behind him, and on his hand… no, claw, was a deep black light. The claw went through the defensive barrier and grabbed Zhu Guang’s neck. The next second, a powerful force threw Zhu Guang into the air.</p> 
 <p>An old common adage: a target in the sky that couldn’t fly was the same as a sitting duck.</p> 
 <p>However, Zhu Guang, who was ranked 25th on the Combat Ranking, realized the crisis he was in and immediately launched his strongest attack. His sword sliced out and his body started to rotate like a spinning top. He used this attack to defend, and he achieved his purpose. Bai Xiaofei didn’t dare to approach him.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei accurately calculated his landing spot. The moment Zhu Guang landed and his rotation stopped, Bai Xiaofei had already approached him. It was too late to react. A hook from Bai Xiaofei sent Zhu Guang flying like a kite with a broken string.</p> 
 <p>“Mad Blade Body!”</p> 
 <p>Completely abandoning his previous plan, Zhu Guang launched his trump card in mid-air. The strange blade in his right hand turned into a ray of light and melted into his body.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, Bai Xiaofei, who had leaped after Zhu Guang, slammed his fists into the latter’s stomach and smashed him into the ground.</p> 
 <p>“Wolf Meteorite!”</p> 
 <p>After the blow in mid-air, Bai Xiaofei was shrouded in a black halo and his body crashed down with a tremendous force. A rumble echoed as a shockwave caused the onlookers to stagger. When the dust cleared, Bai Xiaofei was standing quietly in the deep pit that he created, and Zhu Guang was standing at a distance with fear in his heart.</p> 
 <p>Right at that moment, Zhu Guang had thrown out the strange blade in his hand and teleported away, or else the battle would have been over now.</p> 
 <p>“I’m not going to deal fatal blows. Why would you hide? The blade that you just absorbed must have strengthened your defense,” Bai Xiaofei said and paused a little. “So that means you want to be bullied by me for a little longer?”</p> 
 <p>Before his words finished, Bai Xiaofei had already disappeared. Zhu Guang suddenly felt a dangerous chill and hacked his strange sword backward.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei didn’t appear behind him as he had imagined.</p> 
 <p>“Senior, where are you chopping at?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei wore a faint smile as he patted Zhu Guang’s shoulder. However, Zhu Guang’s response wasn’t very friendly. A dazzling light shone from the strange sword, so bright that it blinded everyone around.</p> 
 <p>The next second, Zhu Guang wielded the sword at Bai Xiaofei. However, when it connected, it didn’t feel like cutting flesh but just air.</p> 
 <p>“That’s a fake, Senior.” Bai Xiaofei appeared and patted Zhu Guang on the shoulder again.</p> 
 <p>“Ghost Sword Body!” Zhu Guang finally couldn’t stand it anymore. With a cruel determination, he used a skill that he hadn’t quite mastered yet – both blade and sword melded into the body at once.</p> 
 <p>The blade was to strengthen the defense and the sword was to strengthen his offensive ability. With both merged into the body at the same time, Zhu Guang’s state reached its peak!</p> 
 <p>And what Bai Xiaofei wanted to see was his peak!</p> 
 <p>Grabbing Zhu Guang’s fist that came at him, Bai Xiaofei used overwhelming force to stop him from advancing a step. At this point, Zhu Guang was completely thunderstruck.</p> 
 <p><em>How can he catch my punch with both my blade and sword merged with me?!</em></p> 
 <p>Zhu Guang went blank, but Bai Xiaofei didn’t. Having caught the attack, he kicked Zhu Guang’s stomach heavily. This sent him flying back at least 30 meters. This time, Zhu Guang hit the ground and didn’t get up again.</p> 
 <p>Not only did Bai Xiaofei catch the punch strengthened by the Ghost Sword, but he also broke the defense strengthened by the Mad Blade. Previously, he deliberately went easy so as to completely defeat Zhu Guang physically and mentally!</p> 
 <p>“Senior, it seems that I won.”</p> 
 <p>Slowly walking towards Zhu Guang, a faint smile hung on Bai Xiaofei’s face.</p> 
 <p>Zhu Guang endured the pain and looked up. There was a dull light of despair in his eyes. He had lost, he had completely lost…</p>
