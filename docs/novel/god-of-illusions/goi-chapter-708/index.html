 <p>Chapter 708: Seeing Jackdaw!</p> 
 <p>Following Yue Xiaofei, the growing team proceeded to save another small team of three while also resurrecting more and more undead. By the time Bai Xiaofei felt that it was enough, the number of people had reached over 500.</p> 
 <p>Sometimes, it was not necessarily a good thing for a team to have many people. Despite all being saved, the newcomers obviously had less sense of belonging to the team. In other words, they were not very obedient. However, Bai Xiaofei didn’t worry too much. They would be after one or two died.</p> 
 <p>After being informed of the risks, no one had any objections to attacking the demon king. Of course, this was also because Bai Xiaofei did not tell them how powerful the devil was. As far as they were concerned, the demon king’s underlings were only undead and the demon king himself was at best peak Exquisite Rank or a little higher. They all thought he wouldn’t be able to survive the siege of so many people. Otherwise, some would have run away the moment Bai Xiaofei put forward the plan…</p> 
 <p>The team advanced rapidly in the direction of the demon king. The closer they got, the higher the frequency of encountering skeletons and undead. Gradually, there started to be casualties.</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, no one had complaints toward Bai Xiaofei, and even many even began to listen to his command as he had expected. At the same time, he did not disappoint them. Although the whole team wasn’t completely united at heart, he still managed to keep the number of casualties as low as possible.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, three other huge teams had been formed in two other different directions.</p> 
 <p>One team was the joint force of the Martial Artist Alliance and the Puppet Master Alliance. Their cohesion had been greatly improved and since then had attracted people outside their organizations.</p> 
 <p>Another team was the Jackdaw Mercenary Group. Since they had many people from the start and many were experts, they assembled quickly and were the strongest among all the teams.</p> 
 <p>The last one was similar to Bai Xiaofei’s group, which was completely composed of guildless people. Similarly, they also had elected a leader. However, this person’s identity was quite surprising – he was not a native of the continent, but a resurrected undead.</p> 
 <p>To complete the resurrection without the help of Bai Xiaofei meant he had killed at least several hundreds of people!</p> 
 <p>Killing hundreds of people and then gathering his own prey into a team was enough for anyone to marvel at.</p> 
 <p>“Captain! Someone’s coming!” Finishing a skeleton off with a shoulder-throw, Qiu Feng suddenly looked serious.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Jackdaw had noticed this even before he was informed.</p> 
 <p>“Captain Jackdaw, long time no see.” One became different when they gained confidence. Regarding experts, the ones standing around Bai Xiaofei were no weaker than Jackdaw’s group.</p> 
 <p>“Oh? Have we met?” Jackdaw frowned. He wasn’t blind. He didn’t know Bai Xiaofei, but he still could see that the people around him were not ordinary.</p> 
 <p>“Captain, it’s him who killed our squadron!” one person suddenly yelled. The information made the already tense atmosphere even more volatile.</p> 
 <p>“It’s normal that a busy person like you tends to forget things, but we did meet,” said Bai Xiaofei nonchalantly. He was the only one among everyone present who hadn’t entered a combat stance.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t care if we did, but now that we have, don’t you think you should give me an explanation? After killing my people, you don’t think that I will make a mountain into a molehill, do you?” said Jackdaw. The Frost Crow King on his shoulder cawed and a chill spread.</p> 
 <p>“No need to be tense, Captain Jackdaw. I am not looking for trouble, and now is not the time for us to kill each other.”</p> 
 <p>Jackdaw’s frown deepened at Bai Xiaofei’s reply. No matter how he looked at it, Bai Xiaofei was obviously looking to start a fight. <em>But what did he mean by that?</em></p> 
 <p>“Not the time to kill each other, huh?! You really don’t take yourself as an outsider!” Jackdaw snorted.</p> 
 <p>His Frost Crow King immediately understood. It opened its mouth and shot an ice arrow at Bai Xiaofei!</p> 
 <p>Quick, accurate, and cruel. This attack was only to probe Bai Xiaofei’s strength, but Jackdaw’s probing was certainly deadly!</p> 
 <p>However, the attack didn’t have any impact as a slash of Fan Xingyu’s sword dissipated it into nothing.</p> 
 <p>“You don’t have to test us. Since I dare to stand in front of you, it means I have enough confidence to protect myself. I, Bai Xiaofei, can’t do something like standing still to welcome death.” Bai Xiaofei smiled as if what had just happened was not a big deal.</p> 
 <p>“Oh? Then I really can’t imagine why you have to bring so so many people.”</p> 
 <p>Realizing that the other party was a tough one, Jackdaw grew cautious. If they fought, a crushing victory was impossible. Even if he won, it would be a tragic victory that he didn’t want.</p> 
 <p>“I came here with a message for you.” Bai Xiaofei then briefly explained the situation with the demon king before concluding, “That’s all the information I have. To some extent, we are now in the same boat. The only way we can get out of here is to cooperate!” Bai Xiaofei stared intensely at Jackdaw.</p> 
 <p>After a long silence, Jackdaw slowly opened his mouth.</p> 
 <p>“You think I will believe you?” A snort clearly expressed his refusal.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t be so quick to refuse. I just came to inform you, I don’t plan to get a reply from you yet.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s ambiguous attitude threw Jackdaw’s party in confusion. <em>Bringing so many people just for a message?</em></p> 
 <p>“I don’t have an answer for you, but I hope that when you leave this damn place, you will still be intact!”</p> 
 <p>Jackdaw’s threat could not be more obvious, but Bai Xiaofei’s endurance was beyond his expectation.</p> 
 <p>“That won’t be your problem, Captain. Now that I have completed my purpose of coming here, the rest is up to you. I believe that you are not an unreasonable person, and I believe that you will make a smart decision.” Finishing his words, Bai Xiaofei turned to leave.</p> 
 <p>“Do you really think that I’m afraid of fighting you?!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei looked back at Jackdaw who was gritting his teeth, with a smile.</p> 
 <p>“If you must try, I don’t mind complying!”</p>
