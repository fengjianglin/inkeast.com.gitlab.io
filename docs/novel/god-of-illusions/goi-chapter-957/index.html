 <p>Chapter 957: Nie Qing!</p> 
 <p>“Remember when Tang Bing controlled your body to self-detonate?”</p> 
 <p>Ru Heshi’s words guided old memories back to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“At that time, you survived on your props as well as physical quality, but it was only enough to keep your life hanging by a thread. The Violethorn girl returned to her kingdom to find a way to cure you, but we all knew that you would have been dead by the time she came back. So, our little sister used a puppet that she secretly linked behind our back, Sacrificial Redemption.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was stunned to hear the puppet’s name. Sacrificial Redemption was a puppet very famous for its story.</p> 
 <p>Its creator had created it to save her sweetheart, but the price of using this puppet was one’s life force!</p> 
 <p>The puppetsmith never welcomed her own happiness after. Facing the old and weak her, her sweetheart chose to run away. After that, she committed suicide…</p> 
 <p>“Where is Qing’er?!” Bai Xiaofei immediately asked as Nie Qing occupied his entire mind.</p> 
 <p>“Calm down, I haven’t finished yet,” said Ru Heshi.</p> 
 <p>The man’s relaxed nature nearly drove Bai Xiaofei mad, but he could only listen quietly.</p> 
 <p>“I’m sure you’re curious why she looked normal when you saw her after you woke up. Because she didn’t want you to see her old, so she took a poison pill.”</p> 
 <p>When Ru Heshi mentioned this, the Thunderstorm Bandits all had sad expressions on their faces, while Bai Xiaofei stood still in shock.</p> 
 <p>“A Final Radiance Pill, which recovers the user’s youth for seven days, after which their life force will rapidly drain away. Theoretically, this is guaranteed death!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei’s mind went blank. Then, the scenes from that time flashed one after another.</p> 
 <p>Why Nie Qing suddenly changed her mind and insisted that he accompany her for six days… Why she had never said anything about the future, and never slept during those six days… And why she, who had always been a little aloof, suddenly became so bold…</p> 
 <p>All of his doubts were cruelly answered at this moment…</p> 
 <p>“However…” Ru Heshi added just as Bai Xiaofei started to despair.</p> 
 <p>“However, what?!” Bai Xiaofei’s eyes lit up with hope.</p> 
 <p>Listening intently, those two words were what Bai Xiaofei absolutely wanted to hear most now!</p> 
 <p>“However, what happened was different from what we all expected. After the seven-day period, her vitality began to leave her body, but another flow of life force surged within her and offset the pill’s effect. Although this force was barely sufficient, it preserved her life.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei grabbed Ru Heshi’s arm as if clinging to his salvation. “What must I do?! Where is Qing’er?! She can still be saved, right?!”</p> 
 <p>“I’ll tell you everything, just calm down!” For once, Ru Heshi lost his cool demeanor.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei’s anxious reaction somewhat pleased the Thunderstorm group. <em>At least this brat still has some conscience!</em></p> 
 <p>“Alright, alright. Please proceed, Brother He.” Bai Xiaofei admitted his wrongs, feeling full of guilt toward this group of people.</p> 
 <p>Ever since he last parted with them, it had been years. During this, they had been suffering for his mistake, but he had been oblivious to it all. Such a debt could never be repaid…</p> 
 <p>“We finally found a way to prolong her life. As long as we can supply her with a large amount of life force at once, she will be able to recover. However, the only thing that can satisfy this condition is the legendary Revival Grass.”</p> 
 <p>“We followed the information on the Revival Grass to the Moonlight Empire just as it was in trouble, so we became mercenaries and helped out. The emperor agreed that as long as we solved her problem, she would tell us the location of the Revival Grass and in the meantime, she would help preserve Qing’er’s life with her Moon God Art.”</p> 
 <p>With that, Ru Heshi exhaled a long breath.</p> 
 <p>“Well, I’m done,” he concluded and quietly looked at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“So we just need to get that Revival Grass, right?” asked Bai Xiaofei after completely calming down, realizing that being anxious would be useless.</p> 
 <p>“That’s right, but we have been here for over a year without gaining any information. It seems that only the emperor knows where it is.” Qiu Mumu shrugged with a helpless sigh.</p> 
 <p>“As long as someone knows, I will definitely get it,” Bai Xiaofei declared with a dead serious expression. The debt he owed, he would be the one to pay it back!</p> 
 <p><em>Nie Qing, just you wait! How dare you lie to me?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Don’t be so sure. Do you know what kind of demands the emperor had for us?” Fang Lei finally opened his mouth again, but his tone had softened.</p> 
 <p>“She said that you’d get the grass once you solve Moonlight’s border issue, right?” said Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The Thunderstorm group was stunned.</p> 
 <p>“How do you know?” Qiu Mumu exclaimed.</p> 
 <p>“I thought it was only hearsay, but now it seems that Bai Xiaofei really deserves his reputation!” Qing Shuang chuckled.</p> 
 <p>Behind Bai Xiaofei, Zhu Chunyang’s eyes widened as he yelped, “Wait?! You are Bai Xiaofei?! The one from Starnet Academy?!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Yun Mo looked strangely at him. “You don’t even know who he is and you still followed him? Brother, he may just sell you and you’d still happily count the money for him!”</p> 
 <p>Everyone burst out laughing, not just because of Zhu Chunyang’s foolish reaction, but also because the burden weighing on them for so long had finally been handed over to the debtor.</p> 
 <p>“Everyone, it has been my negligence, but please believe me,” declared Bai Xiaofei, his eyes bright and resolute. “I will definitely bring Qing’er back!”</p>
