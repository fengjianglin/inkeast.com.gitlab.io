 <p>Chapter 646: Long Time No Cooperate!</p> 
 <p>“Stop! Who goes there?!”</p> 
 <p>A ‘drunken’ Bai Xiaofei staggered up to the fourth floor. He had just topped the stairs when a roar resounded. Looking in that direction, he saw an uncle in martial clothes glaring at him with a dignified expression.</p> 
 <p>“What… ‘s the deal, is this inn… your house or what?!” Bai Xiaofei shouted back.</p> 
 <p>The uncle revealed a look of contempt at the drunk-looking guy reeking of alcohol.</p> 
 <p>“This floor has been rented out by our Jackdaw Mercenary Group. Do not proceed, or I won’t be polite.” The uncle drew the machete at his waist, ready to act if he were to hear a wrong word.</p> 
 <p>“Tch! Jackdaw Mercenary Group? You think you’re big? If this lord wants, I can rent out this whole inn. Don’t want me to proceed? See if you can stop this lord!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei staggered toward the uncle. The moment he approached, the uncle pushed him. A ‘fragile’ Bai Xiaofei conveniently flopped and knocked down a flowerpot nearby. The breaking sound alarmed the people in the nearby rooms as seven or eight people instantly rushed out.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter?!”</p> 
 <p>A scarred-face rushed over. The uncle, whose face had just been very hostile, immediately cupped his hands and bowed.</p> 
 <p>“Reporting to Squad Leader, it’s just a drunkard who insists on coming up to the fourth floor. I lightly pushed him and he fell.” The uncle gave a brief summary of the situation.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei scrambled up from the ground and squinted at the squad leader before staggering toward him.</p> 
 <p>Unlike the uncle, the squad leader wasn’t rough with Bai Xiaofei. Instead, he stretched out his hands to support him. The moment he touched Bai Xiaofei, the squad leader slightly exerted some force, but Bai Xiaofei’s body was jelly and he did not feel any powerful energy fluctuations.</p> 
 <p>“Little brother, you’ve drunk too much. What’s your room? Let me send you back. There’s nothing to see here, only a bunch of crude men. It won’t be good if they accidentally hurt you.” The squad leader’s voice was gentle.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei didn’t seem to appreciate it.</p> 
 <p>“Nonsense! Who’s drunk?! This lord, a thousand cups, still not drunk!” He broke free from the squad leader and flailed around. “Tell you, my dad is merchant group president, very rich! Don’t mess with me!”</p> 
 <p>At Bai Xiaofei’s chaotic shouts, some people were starting to lose patience and wanted to teach him a good lesson. However, the squad leader stopped them.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, yes, yes, you are definitely not drunk, Young Master. Anyone can be drunk but you. But it’s getting late now, you should go back to rest. How about I accompany you to a drink tomorrow?” The squad leader tried his best to control his tone.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei laughed and turned to the fierce uncle just now. “See how well your boss can talk. Someone like you can only be a subordinate for your whole life.”</p> 
 <p>The uncle opened his mouth to retaliate but was stopped by the squad leader.</p> 
 <p>“I remember your words. I will come up for a drink tomorrow. If you don’t drink, I will be really, really rude!” Bai Xiaofei waved his arms dismissively. “Don’t send me, I’m not drunk!”</p> 
 <p>He then staggered his way downstairs. A disordered series of heavy and shallow steps ensued.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t you know that one less trouble is better than one more? It’s just an inexperienced smelly boy, is it worthwhile to start a fight with him? Our squad is here to protect Leader and clear up unnecessary troubles for him. What you did was just adding more trouble!”</p> 
 <p>The squad leader coldly lectured after Bai Xiao disappeared. The uncle repeatedly nodded in agreement while cursing Bai Xiaofei 180 times over and over in his heart.</p> 
 <p>“Continue to guard. If you see anyone again, keep your mouth clean. We are a mercenary group, not bandits!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing the squad leader reprimand from upstairs, Bai Xiaofei smiled. <em>It seems Jackdaw is really here!</em></p> 
 <p>After the bicentennial celebration, Xiong Shou had sought out Bai Xiaofei right after his recovery to apologize for his previous rudeness, and made a promise that he would repay Bai Xiaofei one day.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei naturally wouldn’t be courteous. He accepted the apology and conveniently started a conversation with Xiong Shou. One of the topics was the nine major mercenary groups. After all, Xiong Shou was in this circle and as the leader of Berserk Bear, the accuracy of his information was more convincing than anyone else.</p> 
 <p>The Jackdaw Mercenary Group was the one highlighted by Xiong Shou. Jackdaw, the leader of the group whose main puppet was a gold-grade animated puppet – a Frost Crow King, excelled in cold-weather combat. His three deputy leaders were also powerful experts. Apart from the main team led by Jackdaw himself, the mercenary group had six squads, each led by an Exquisite Rank expert, and all of the squads were already full.</p> 
 <p>To sum it up, the Jackdaw Mercenary Group was definitely a strong armed group. They certainly came to the Holy Snow Mountain with absolute determination to win!</p> 
 <p>However, this wasn’t Bai Xiaofei’s consideration. Between him and such a large organization like Jackdaw was a gap so huge that it was impossible to even have the same goal. Even if he planned to enter the Holy Snow Mountain, he would at most try for small benefits, while what Jackdaw wanted was to completely conquer that cave!</p> 
 <p>But since they had crossed paths, Bai Xiaofei naturally wanted to scrape something out of them. He wouldn’t let them leave so easily!</p> 
 <p>“Long time no cooperate. Don’t you let me down!” Bai Xiaofei stroked Huskie’s head. The latter eagerly nodded.</p> 
 <p>“Of course, when has this mighty dog disappointed you?!” said the poor Huskie with his head held high, obviously knowing nothing about his true identity.</p> 
 <p>And Bai Xiaofei naturally wouldn’t tell him. If this fellow knew that he was actually a formidable wolf-type magical beast, his arrogance might just pierce the sky. Compared with wolves, dogs were much easier to raise!</p> 
 <p>“Yes, yes, you are the best. Let us start!” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly flattered.</p> 
 <p>At the side, Blackie’s dark pupils flashed with disdain, but Bai Xiaofei and Huskie had long been accustomed to this kind of look…</p> 
 <p>As origin energy slowly poured into Huskie’s body, the puppet turned into a light that melted into Bai Xiaofei’s body. His appearance began to rapidly change.</p> 
 <p>When the light dissipated, Bai Xiaofei had been replaced by the earlier ‘squad leader’!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s previous act hadn’t been just some simple probing. His real purpose had always been this…</p>
