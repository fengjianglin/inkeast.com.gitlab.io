 <p>Chapter 727: Teaching A Lesson!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately panicked under their intent gazes. He did not know much about Bryne and therefore could not imitate the guy at all. He was already easily exposed, not to mention that the ones he was facing were the triplets who had known Bryne since childhood.</p> 
 <p>“You have some guts! You even dare to trick us now?!” Leng Liuying pulled Bai Xiaofei by the ear.</p> 
 <p>“I’m wrong, I’m wrong alright?! I didn’t want to, but I wouldn’t be able to get here if I didn’t do it!” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly admitted his wrongs and deactivated Mimicry.</p> 
 <p>Seeing his familiar face, the triplets’ eyes reddened and they threw themselves into his arms.</p> 
 <p>After appeasing them, Bai Xiaofei explained his plans. Without any surprise, the girls all expressed their willingness to go with him. However, Leng Liushuang looked hesitant, which did not escape his notice.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter, Liushuang?”</p> 
 <p>Leng Liushuang was not good at hiding her emotions. Startled by his question and then flustered by the inquiring gazes from three pairs of eyes, she voiced her concern, “I met Father and mentioned you, but he didn’t seem to regard you very highly. I’m afraid that you will not get your desired results after going to the capital.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei smiled.</p> 
 <p>“This is a problem I have to face sooner or later. No matter how badly my future father-in-law disdains me, I will try my best to convince him. Give me some trust, alright?”</p> 
 <p>His confident smile dispelled Leng Liushuang’s fear. With a bright smile, she nodded strongly.</p> 
 <p>“Shall we leave now?” Leng Liuying was a doer. Her excited expression vividly displayed her mood.</p> 
 <p>“Of course, but before leaving, we’ll give Orton and his son a big gift!”</p> 
 <p>As a familiar sleazy smile appeared on Bai Xiaofei’s face, their hearts thumped wildly. They also wanted to teach Orton a lesson but didn’t know how. They believed that Bai Xiaofei would have a way. Their trust in him was almost blind.</p> 
 <p>With the help of Blackie, Bai Xiaofei took the triplets away and they got on the Downwind Boat.</p> 
 <p>“The three princesses have been taken away!!!” Bai Xiaofei suddenly shouted. And then, the boat rode the wind and flew towards the north peak of the Holy Snow Mountain.</p> 
 <p>Orton, who was keeping a watchful eye on the area, immediately responded upon being notified. He and his son led the Snow Lion Corps and chased after the boat. As all kinds of attacks never ceased along the way, the Fei tokens became the best shield for the three sisters.</p> 
 <p>Just like that, they led Orton’s army by the nose all the way to the north peak, where the bleak cold wind blowing on his face gave Bai Xiaofei his first experience of a natural force that could discourage even Exquisite Rank experts. Compared to such natural power, that of humans was nothing but a joke.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei did not turn back, and Orton behind him did not stop chasing.</p> 
 <p>“Want to use the wind to escape? This old man shall see who will give up first!” Orton snorted and turned to his soldiers. “Formation!”</p> 
 <p>The shield formation that had held against the demon king once again made an appearance. The cold winds were blocked and could not hurt the soldiers at all, only slowing them a little. However, the speed reduction was not much compared to Bai Xiaofei’s boat.</p> 
 <p>The distance between the two sides kept getting shortened. When Orton thought victory was in the bag, Bai Xiaofei suddenly stopped.</p> 
 <p>“Marshal Orton, I really appreciate your cooperation. If you didn’t chase after me, the backhand I arranged may have been wasted,” Bai Xiaofei shouted.</p> 
 <p>Orton was confused, but he soon was given a practical explanation!</p> 
 <p>“Marshal Orton, I hope you can remember this lesson. See you in the capital!” Bai Xiaofei’s energy suddenly surged and the God Control Technique instantly displayed its might in a series of explosions.</p> 
 <p>As early as when he had entered the Holy Snow Mountain, Bai Xiaofei had the ‘A’ group do something that he had never told anyone else about. Now, the answer was revealed: they had been burying puppets, and the location was a place where the snow was thick and easy to fall off!</p> 
 <p>This was Bai Xiaofei’s preparation for enemies that he might not be able to beat. While explosions of white puppets might not make any impact on such enemies, the avalanche caused by them would be another case!</p> 
 <p>Amidst rumbling noises, the snow on the peak rolled down with momentum stronger than the charge of 100,000 troops together. Orton gawked in shock.</p> 
 <p>“Block!!!” he roared and personally joined the formation.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei steered the Downwind Boat in another direction. As its name implied, the boat was faster when flying in the direction of the wind. On the north peak of the Holy Snow Mountain where the winds were so strong that they formed energy attacks, the Downwind Boat turned into a flash of light.</p> 
 <p>On the boat, the triplets were laughing hysterically. They always knew that Bai Xiaofei had many sinister ideas, but the result was still beyond their expectations. The avalanche would not kill Orton and his Snow Lion Corps, but as a lesson, it was enough!</p> 
 <p>Moreover, by the time Orton finally crawled out from the snow, they would have already flown far away. It was absolutely impossible for him to catch up.</p> 
 <p>Having gotten his revenge, Bai Xiaofei soon reunited with Cang Lan’s group who were waiting.</p> 
 <p>“Why did it take you so long? You didn’t alarm that smelly boy Orton, did you?” Cang Lan complained with a frown.</p> 
 <p>The triplets were barely holding back their laughter. Bai Xiaofei did more than just ‘alarm’ him!</p> 
 <p>“Don’t you worry. Let’s go. Orton won’t be able to catch up for a while.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei waved his hand. The huge team then marched toward the capital of the Snow Kingdom.</p> 
 <p>Looking at the direction of the imperial city, Bai Xiaofei took a deep breath. <em>No matter how dangerous that place is, this lord will come and have a look. My future father-in-law, your son-in-law is coming!</em></p>
