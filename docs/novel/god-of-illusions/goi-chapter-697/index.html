 <p>Chapter 697: Ruins or Graveyards?</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t know how long he was unconscious, but he was sure that he was the first one to wake up.</p> 
 <p>Because when he did, he was greeted with pitch-dark darkness as quiet as death.</p> 
 <p>He took out an origin lamp. Yellow light illuminated the surroundings as he poured his energy into it. The sight made his heart turn cold in dread.</p> 
 <p>Bones! There were bones everywhere!</p> 
 <p>If Bai Xiaofei had been wondering what the eerie chill around he felt the moment he woke up with was, then he now knew the answer. It was a similar chill as that from the second layer of the Falling Flower Formation – the hatred and grievance from the dead.</p> 
 <p>His mouth twitching as he realized this place was dangerous, Bai Xiaofei scanned the area. He quickly found Leng Liuli, who had fallen together with him.</p> 
 <p>“Liuli, wake up!” He called and poured his origin energy into her body.</p> 
 <p>Leng Liuli gradually regained consciousness and groggily looked around. Like Bai Xiaofei, she was alarmed by what she saw.</p> 
 <p>“Where are the others?” she asked, but Bai Xiaofei could only shake his head helplessly.</p> 
 <p>“I haven’t seen them, we are the only ones around here. However, they should be with Golden Feather, so they won’t be in any danger for a while,” Bai Xiaofei comforted both Leng Liuli and himself, otherwise, he might lose his mind from being haunted by pessimistic guesses.</p> 
 <p>“What… is this place?” Temporarily putting aside her worry, Leng Liuli looked around again and instinctively shuddered from the biting cold.</p> 
 <p>“If I’m not wrong, this should be The Ruins. Not sure if this is the one our elders had been to, though.” Bai Xiaofei frowned as he said the worst possibility.</p> 
 <p>If this was really The Ruins that Lei Shan and the elders had told him about that was extremely difficult to survive in, then their situation had gotten very complicated…</p> 
 <p>Before he had seen The Ruins, he wanted to know the real face of it more than anyone else, but now that he was in it, he finally knew how naive he had been. This was the kind of curiosity that could cost him his life!</p> 
 <p>“Has that voice sounded again?”Leng Liuli asked.</p> 
 <p>“I haven’t seen anything else alive except the two of us.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei shook his head and summoned Huskie. He didn’t dare to even relax. If necessary, he would fuse with Huskie right away.</p> 
 <p>“Take this. If something happens and I can’t save you in time, you will only have yourself to rely on.” He gave one of his Starnet Brillances to Leng Liuli, then looked at Huskie. “Can you find the others?”</p> 
 <p>Huskie could feel Bai Xiaofei’s state of mind, so it didn’t make any unreasonable demands this time and immediately ran around the area. Bai Xiaofei and Leng Liuli waited in place. Huskie soon returned, but unfortunately didn’t bring back any good news. Right at that time, a familiar roar echoed again. Unlike before, they heard it very clearly this time.</p> 
 <p>After a long silence, Bai Xiaofei gritted his teeth and his eyes grew resolute.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go!”</p> 
 <p>Leng Liuli was stunned, but she quickly understood what he meant. Her instinct was to stop him, but her mind dismissed the idea. She knew why Bai Xiaofei was desperate to the point he would take this risk – it was the only way to find the others.</p> 
 <p>Given a situation where everyone was separated, they needed a common reference to gather, and that roar was the only reference!</p> 
 <p>No matter how dangerous it was, they had no choice.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei and Leng Liuli believed that the others would think similarly. Moreover, they hadn’t been far from each other when they fell, so they should not be far from each other now. If they headed towards the same point, they should be able to see each other along the way and then they’d have a choice whether to go deeper in or leave.</p> 
 <p>“Alright!” said Leng Liuli after thinking it through.</p> 
 <p>As they hit the road, those in the underground ruins with the same idea also headed toward the direction of the roar. However, the majority were with the purpose of seeking wealth in big risks, which was just human nature…</p> 
 <p>“There’s something!”</p> 
 <p>As they carefully moved forward, Huskie suddenly jumped out. A little later, he returned with a strange, round item in his mouth.</p> 
 <p>Receiving the item, Bai Xiaofei and Leng Liuli inspected it. It was a bracelet adorned with a piece of transparent glass, felt heavy, and emitted faint energy fluctuations.</p> 
 <p>Unable to figure out what the item was after half a day, Bai Xiaofei used his energy to probe it. Suddenly, the item burst with a bang, frightening them into bouncing away instantly. However, nothing else happened except that a pile of items appeared on the ground.</p> 
 <p>Carefully inching close, Bai Xiaofei squatted down in front of the pile. He didn’t recognize many of the items, but it was still possible to make rough guesses. After classifying the items, the two were surprised.</p> 
 <p>The contents of the bracelet were quite… complete.</p> 
 <p>Food, daily necessities, special props usable by anyone, cold weapons, and even special weapons that could resonate with origin energy. All of these things had one feature in common, they were not from the Starnet Continent.</p> 
 <p>“So, the treasures that they got from the ruins are actually from these storage items?” Bai Xiaofei deduced from what he had learned.</p> 
 <p>He had made a correct guess. However, Lei Shan and the others didn’t get their storage items as easily as him, they had to put their lives on the line.</p> 
 <p>“So, where are these things from?” Leng Liuli’s brows creased in confusion.</p> 
 <p>“Golden Feather said the Starnet Continent is not the only world. If I guess correctly, this bracelet is a storage prop of another world and their owners ended up here for some reason. They landed in Starnet and died here after a grand battle, and their grand-scale battlefield has become what we call The Ruins!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei deduced with a glint in his eyes. A question that had been bothering him for a long time was now partly solved.</p> 
 <p>“In that case, Grandpa wanted us to come here to find if there’s something in storage props like this that can solve your problems?” Bai Xiaofei wasn’t the only one that could make good guesses, only that Leng Liuli put most of her focus on him.</p> 
 <p>“That should be why!” Bai Xiaofei excitedly stood up and looked at Huskie. “From now on, find any items like this ring. Whether I can deal with my big trouble depends on you!”</p> 
 <p>For once, Bai Xiaofei’s tone was sincere and so Huskie gave him face.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, as long as you don’t cut off my treats, this god dog promises to collect everything for you!” Huskie reassured and happily skipped away.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go, leave the storage things to Huskie. Our priority is to find the others!”</p> 
 <p>Once again setting off, the two picked up speed. There were definitely other people than just them who had discovered the secrets of the storage items. Before long, these underground ruins would be very lively!</p> 
 <p>“Give up that thing and we’ll leave you alone! Otherwise, you know what will happen!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei suddenly heard an icy voice, but the speaker didn’t seem to notice the two of them.</p> 
 <p>Looking over, the two saw about seven or eight people surrounding another group. From their manners, they seemed to be apprehensive towards the people that they surrounded even though they obviously had the upper hand.</p> 
 <p>“If you are not afraid of death, then come. I can’t kill you all, but it is no problem to take one or two to hell with me.” The voice that replied was ruthless and he sounded like the kind that was good at manipulating people’s hearts as well.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei’s attention wasn’t on this, but on the identity of the person. It was A’First!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei thought he could be a fisherman this time, but now this plan had fallen through. Carefully checking out the opponent group, Bai Xiaofei was relieved after making sure that there was no one of Exquisite Rank and above. It made the situation much easier.</p> 
 <p>“Let me see who dares to touch this Qiu Feng’s friends!” With the help of Huskie, Bai Xiaofei transformed into Qiu Feng again and walked straight out with Leng Liuli.</p> 
 <p>His sudden appearance obviously startled the opponents, and after seeing his face, they panicked even more.</p> 
 <p>Aside from the reputation of the Jackdaw Mercenary Group, Qiu Feng’s strength alone was no joke seeing how he was able to get to the position of deputy head. He alone could annihilate them and it was only a matter of how long it would take.</p> 
 <p>“The mighty deputy leader of Jackdaw Mercenary Group is involved with thieves? You must be joking, Deputy Leader Qiu Feng.”</p> 
 <p>Just when Bai Xiaofei thought he was going to resolve the problem, the only woman among the opponent group suddenly spoke and turned the tables.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the ‘A’ group was still in a daze, wondering when they ever had contact with the Jackdaw Mercenary Group, and had a friendly relationship at that…</p> 
 <p>They couldn’t be blamed. Leng Liuli was now in her true appearance, which they hadn’t seen before since the triplets had been covering their faces after entering the snow mountain.</p> 
 <p>“Do I look like I’m joking? I said they are my friends, so they are. As for how I’m involved with them, you think I’m someone who needs to report to you?” Bai Xiaofei got closer and closer to them as he spoke.</p> 
 <p>The opponents assumed fighting stances, ready to fight him.</p> 
 <p>“Deputy Leader Qiu, you’d better stop there!” the opponent leader finally blurted out under the pressure of the atmosphere.</p> 
 <p>At that moment, Bai Xiaofei revealed a strange smile.</p>
