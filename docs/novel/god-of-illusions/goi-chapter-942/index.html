 <p>Chapter 942: Ye Xi’s Scheme</p> 
 <p>“Why do I feel that if we keep moving at this speed, the capital will have already been lost by the time we arrive?”</p> 
 <p>It was another seven days of a boring journey, with the motorcade occasionally stopping by cities only to restock. Tan Xin felt like she couldn’t take it anymore. If it weren’t for Bai Xiaofei, she would have walked off in a rage.</p> 
 <p>“Wars aren’t that simple. Even if the Sacks have been planning for a long time, Moonlight isn’t a soft persimmon they can squeeze as they like. Let alone just a few days, after months or even years, Moonlight will not fall.”</p> 
 <p>After the experience in Ethereal, Bai Xiaofei had gained a brand-new understanding of the empires. If they wanted to, they could assemble a terrifying force in an instant.</p> 
 <p>“You are quite optimistic about these women, huh? I warn you, you are not allowed to get entangled with the emperor after we reach the imperial city!” declared Tan Xin. Even though still far away from the capital, she was already on the alert.</p> 
 <p>“You are too optimistic about me. She is an emperor and I am a servant.” Bai Xiaofei smiled wryly. He really harbored no strange ideas for the Moonlight emperor who he had never even seen before…</p> 
 <p>“As if Ling Yue isn’t an emperor. He’s fifty and yet still regards you as his brother and good friend. The Moonlight emperor is only a royal sister in her thirties. It’s not impossible for her to make you marry into her family,” Tan Xin retorted.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was speechless for a while as he had nothing to refute this. He coughed awkwardly. “It is Moonlight’s common mindset that men are inferior to women. I’m afraid this idea has penetrated into the marrow of the emperor. I even suspect that she likes women… So, you can rest assured.”</p> 
 <p>At that moment, a voice rang out, saving him by the bell.</p> 
 <p>“Fickle Bai, Master Ye summons you!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei hadn’t spent the last seven days idly. After helping with some chores along the way, he successfully made himself a staff member of the presiding officer and now knew her name – Ye Xi.</p> 
 <p>“Wait, I’ll go with you!” Tan Xin immediately followed. She could clearly feel that Ye Xi had gradually been warming up towards Bai Xiaofei. This could be seen from how frequently she summoned him lately.</p> 
 <p>“My lord, Fickle Bai is here.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei and Tan Xin were led to the front of the team where Ye Xi rode. The two quickly tried to catch up with her. Seeing them, Ye Xi slowed down.</p> 
 <p>“Up ahead is the Black Dragon Swarm, which we must pass through in order to arrive at the capital on time. However, a notorious band of bandits lives there, and our people are no match for them. Any suggestions?” asked Ye Xi aloofly.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin snorted. “Isn’t this what you should consider? Why ask my Lil’ Bai? He is <em>my</em> servant, not yours!” she said as she stood protectively in front of Bai Xiaofei as if fearing that Ye Xi would do something to him.</p> 
 <p>“I considered and decided to call him. Don’t forget your present status. I can lock you up and ‘escort’ you to the capital that way,” said Ye Xi.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin was one-hit KO’ed. If they really started a fight, they would be in a difficult position as their ability to seal energy was absolutely no joke.</p> 
 <p>“It’s only some bandits. I don’t believe they are a match for a group of Exquisite Rank puppet masters. I alone can destroy them!” Tan Xin immediately changed the subject.</p> 
 <p>If this were somewhere else, there would be no problem with what she said. But…</p> 
 <p>“Those bandits have been in contact with the Sacks and have acquired the same ability as the Moon Shadow Army.”</p> 
 <p>The Moon Shadow Army, the blanket title of all the corps guarding Moonlight’s northern borders, represented the highest combat power of the empire. Anything under this title automatically had an extraordinary status.</p> 
 <p>“That means we can’t use force. I’ll just go,” Bai Xiaofei finally found the opportunity to speak, and he said exactly what Ye Xi wanted to hear.</p> 
 <p>“That’s what I think as well. As long as you handle this matter, I’ll make sure what you said in Indigo City will never be known to anyone else,” Ye Xi was straightforward to agree.</p> 
 <p>Although Bai Xiaofei didn’t care much about this, he was very interested in the Black Dragon Swarm. <em>To be able to contact the Sacks, they must have been from the border, but retired Moonlight soldiers would never become bandits… If they are men, I must meet them.</em></p> 
 <p>“I’m going with you!” Tan Xin immediately said, her face stubborn.</p> 
 <p>“What for, my dear master? To drag my feet? Without the ability of creation, you are just a big little girl.” Bai Xiaofei stroked her head with a smile that allowed no rebuttal.</p> 
 <p>“But…”</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, even Shadow Death can’t hurt me. How can I be troubled by some mountain bandits?” He interrupted her and then gave her a quick hug. “Wait for me, I’ll be back soon.”</p> 
 <p>Then, he jumped on the horse prepared by the soldiers and galloped into the horizon.</p> 
 <p>“Is he really your servant? Your relationship…” Ye Xi repeated the question she had asked more than once.</p> 
 <p>And as always, Tan Xin’s answer was a cold snort. “Why does it have to be like yours? I prefer it this way!” With that, she returned to her carriage.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Ye Xi’s confidant came up to her and asked tentatively, “My Lord, we don’t actually have to pass through the Black Dragon Swarm…”</p> 
 <p>“Without a test, how will we know how capable he is? Besides, we can afford to waste this short time. Just make up for it by hurrying later. If he is really such an excellent tool, my sister will be very happy.” Ye Xi’s lips curled up and her eyes flashed with a cunning glint.</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>The Black Dragon Swarm was quite different from the barren land that Bai Xiaofei had imagined. After passing by the stone tablet engraved with the three words ‘Black Dragon Swarm,’ filling his vision was a lush area of towering trees covering the sky. It was nothing like what normal land in the north should be.</p> 
 <p>“Boy, before you proceed, state your intention!” a faint voice rang out soon after Bai Xiaofei started shuttling through the forest.</p> 
 <p>His first reaction was checking the energy in his body.</p> 
 <p><em>No restriction. It seems that not everyone in the Black Dragon Swarm has that ability.</em></p> 
 <p>“An inexplicable reason led me here. I would like to pay your leader a visit.” Bai Xiaofei cupped his hands in greeting.</p> 
 <p>The next second, two slim figures jumped down from a tree, stood stiffly in front of him, and started scrutinizing him.</p> 
 <p>Seeing them, Bai Xiaofei suddenly had the feeling of seeing his long-lost lover.</p> 
 <p><em>Men! Not the fragile kind at that!</em></p>
