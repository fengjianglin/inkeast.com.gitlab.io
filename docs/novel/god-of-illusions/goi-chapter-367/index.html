 <p>Chapter 367: The Unexpected Chu Liuyun!</p> 
 <p>Staring at Bai Xiaofei for half a day, Lei Min’s eyes changed again and again. In the end, she gave a long sigh.</p> 
 <p>She gave up.</p> 
 <p>In front of Bai Xiaofei, who had his own ideas, there was nothing she could say.</p> 
 <p>“I only hope that everything you just said wasn’t just to get away with it. I will believe you this time, Bai Xiaofei. If I ever learn that your future practice is different from what you said today, I will definitely take a trip out of Starnet!”</p> 
 <p>Lei Min didn’t voice the latter half of the last sentence, but Bai Xiaofei could fill it in himself.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, Big Sis Lei, I won’t give you the chance to kill me.” Smiling, Bai Xiaofei relaxed. Since he successfully persuaded Lei Min, that meant his idea had no problem. As to whether it could be done, he had 99% confidence!</p> 
 <p>The remaining 1 percent was reserved for special circumstances.</p> 
 <p>“Go see the two girls. To be able to confide in me about those things, it took them a lot of courage. This is also a test for you, go and prove to me what you just said. If you can be true to your words, I will admire you!”</p> 
 <p>After leaving those words, Lei Min turned to leave. There was a hint of helplessness in her posture.</p> 
 <p>She could no longer interfere in the world of young people. The passage of time spared no one.</p> 
 <p><em>That’s right, who is ever spared by time…?</em></p> 
 <p>After Lei Min left, Bai Xiaofei stood on the spot and took a deep breath. As Lei Min just said, he could not hide from this…</p> 
 <p><em>Since it’s impossible to hide, let’s go ahead! Dragging is not my style!</em></p> 
 <p>Thinking this, Bai Xiaofei smiled and set out towards the dorm.</p> 
 <p>“Sister Liuyun, are you inside?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei gently knocked on Chu Liuyun’s door. Sitting on the bed, Chu Liuyun instantly sprang up. Her pretty face was red to the ears and the intense heartbeats made her have a feeling of suffocation.</p> 
 <p>She didn’t take the initiative to find Lei Min. She had been a little too bold in her performance which caused Lei Min to come to the door and in the end, she could only admit it.</p> 
 <p>In fact, even she herself didn’t know when she had fallen.</p> 
 <p>Perhaps it was Bai Xiaofei’s calmness when she first saw him; perhaps it was the miracle he created at the New Student Competition; perhaps it was when he became a member of the Demon of Illusions, giving her hope and unloading her burden; or perhaps it was his intense feelings in the Di Jiang incident…</p> 
 <p>In short, when Chu Liuyun finally noticed her feelings, she found herself already unable to break away. Unconsciously, seeing Bai Xiaofei had become her biggest expectation in the day. That was why she had planned her performance that way.</p> 
 <p><em>If there are 100 steps between us and I take that first, hardest step, will you finish the other 99?</em></p> 
 <p>Now was the time to discover the answer! After a long time, when Chu Liuyun finally calmed herself a little, she slowly opened the door.</p> 
 <p>“You… Come on in…”</p> 
 <p>The moment she finished those words, Chu Liuyun felt herself burning once more. The little calm she had just regained turned into a violent sea and her heart thumped even more intensely than when she had heard the knocks…</p> 
 <p>Smiling, Bai Xiaofei slowly entered Chu Liuyun’s room. Looking around curiously, he found that there was definitely a difference between girls and boys. Compared with Chu Liuyun’s, his room was simply a pigsty… Especially the different smells left him embarrassed.</p> 
 <p>If here was a light fragrance that made people relaxed and happy, then there in Bai Xiaofei’s room it was…</p> 
 <p>Forget it, no need to affect the mood and say it out loud, someone still needed to maintain his grand image!</p> 
 <p>After sitting down, Bai Xiaofei was silent for a long time before he suddenly looked up at Chu Liuyun, who looked like a shy little girl. “Sister Liuyun, how much do you think you know about me?”</p> 
 <p>This question stunned Chu Liuyun a little.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know much, but I’m sure that you are a person worthy for any girl to entrust her life with!” It was unknown where Chu Liuyun found the courage from, but she stared at Bai Xiaofei with shining eyes and said this. However, she was still a little scared and used ‘any girl’ instead of ‘I.’</p> 
 <p>“This may be the most exaggerated praise I have heard since I came to Starnet, but I’m really sorry, I don't think I'm worthy of your evaluation.” Bai Xiaofei tactfully blocked Chu Liuyun’s advance with a silly smile.</p> 
 <p>”Whatever, as long as I think you live up to it.” Seemingly determined, Chu Liuyun continued her onslaught.</p> 
 <p>“Say, Sister Liuyun, can you not stand while we speak? It’s making me uncomfortable.” His brows slightly wrinkled, Bai Xiaofei put a wry smile on his face.</p> 
 <p>His sudden change once again stunned Chu Liuyun, but she soon revealed a beautiful smile. Perhaps this sleazy personality of his was also a point that attracted her. She had seen too many decent, proper people.</p> 
 <p>“So, are you going to have a long talk with me?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s teasing helped Chu Liuyun to calm considerably. She sat down opposite him, her hands holding her pretty cheeks as she tilted her head at him.</p> 
 <p>Elegance sometimes posed a strange temptation to men, just like how Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but swallow when looking at Chu Liuyun right now.</p> 
 <p>“Sister Liuyun, in fact, my situation may not be as simple as you think. You must know Hu Xian’er?” Afraid that saying too much would cause Chu Liuyun to misunderstand, Bai Xiaofei got straight to the point.</p> 
 <p>However, he didn’t expect her response.</p> 
 <p>“Of course I know her. Why do you think I would dare to do that in the performance round? I got an okay from Lil’ Sis Xian’er, or else, with her strength, I won’t even have a chance to fight back,” said Chu Liuyun, full of smiles, rendering Bai Xiaofei frozen on the spot.</p> 
 <p><em>The heck??! What the heck is this?! They had a meeting?! When?? What did they talk about? Why didn’t Xian’er tell me?!</em></p> 
 <p>A series of questions flooded Bai Xiaofei’s mind, followed by a myriad ‘What the f*ck?’s</p> 
 <p><em>Who said I’m the one to take the initiative? Why do I feel like fat meat delivered right to the hunter’s door?!</em></p> 
 <p>For a moment, Bai Xiaofei was at a loss for words.</p> 
 <p>“Then…”</p> 
 <p>“There’s no ‘then.’ I’ve thought it over and I just don’t want to have any regrets. My brothers never stop finding me more and more sisters-in-law anyway, so I’m used to it. Not to mention Xian’er is much easier to get along with than my sisters-in-law,” Chu Liuyun interrupted Bai Xiaofei as she leaned over the table between them and stared at him, her pair of almond eyes flashing with pride. “So, anything else you want to say?”</p> 
 <p>Looking at the Chu Liuyun in front of him, Bai Xiaofei swallowed with difficulty.</p> 
 <p><em>What else can I say? You already said everything!</em></p> 
 <p>“No… none at all…” Bai Xiaofei squeezed out a few words.</p> 
 <p>The instant he finished, Chu Liuyun revealed a bright smile.</p> 
 <p>“Then, it’s time for you to pay your debts!”</p> 
 <p>Chu Liuyun domineeringly hooked Bai Xiaofei’s chin, and her tender lips printed on his without any hesitation…</p>
