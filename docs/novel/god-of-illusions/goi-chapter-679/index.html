 <p>Chapter 679: Poor Bandits…</p> 
 <p>The five people didn’t stray far from each other while searching for Bai Xiaofei so that they could quickly assist each other once they found him. Although Bai Xiaofei was only a ‘Master Rank’ puppet master, they didn’t underestimate him.</p> 
 <p>This was a basic rule of bandits. Once they acted, they tried their very best. After all, the number of those who drowned in shallow water wasn’t small.</p> 
 <p>However, what the five could never have expected was that it was not shallow water they were dealing with, but an ocean trench!</p> 
 <p>Looking at the nearest person, Bai Xiaofei teleported and appeared behind him, doing a hand-chop to his neck. Without any suspense, the man fell unconscious. His appearance was then assumed by Bai Xiaofei fused with Blackie.</p> 
 <p>“Old Fifth, how’s your side?” a person close to him shouted as soon as Bai Xiaofei appeared.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was quite an expert in dealing with this kind of trouble. “Nothing yet, that fellow may have a puppet that can conceal him!” he shouted back.</p> 
 <p>The person immediately seemed troubled. After some struggle, he yelled toward the leader, “F*ck it! We can’t let that fat sheep run away! Boss, use that thing!”</p> 
 <p>At the moment he turned his body, his brother ‘Old Fifth’ approached him quickly.</p> 
 <p>“No rush, I’ll use it after we are certain we can’t find him, or it’d be wasted if that boy has no money left on him.” The boss obviously wanted to profit bare-handed, seeming to very much cherish ‘that thing.’</p> 
 <p>“That f*cker, where can he run…”</p> 
 <p>As the other man mumbled to himself, Bai Xiaofei had quietly gotten near and startled him.</p> 
 <p>“Damn it! Old Fifth, don’t scare me like that!”</p> 
 <p>The man reached out to slap Bai Xiaofei’s head, his face full of displeasure. However, his hand did not land on Bai Xiaofei as imagined but was grabbed by the latter and swung up.</p> 
 <p>With a loud noise, the man was knocked unconscious by the shoulder throw before he knew what happened.</p> 
 <p>However, such a noise could not escape the ears of the other three, who quickly turned to check. What they saw was only an escaping figure.</p> 
 <p>“Over here!” Bai Xiaofei shouted at the top of his lungs while pretending to be injured.</p> 
 <p>The Grandmaster Rank immediately summoned his puppet – a light blue rope.</p> 
 <p>“Go!”</p> 
 <p>The rope flew out and turned into an ice-blue python in mid-air, chasing after the escaping figure. The other two people had also called out their puppets, one was a speed-type Melee Stream that quickly gave chase, and the other a Ranged Stream that attacked to hinder the figure.</p> 
 <p>Seeing that all three were focused on Blackie, Bai Xiaofei slightly shook his head and prayed for half a second for these people. <em>How did such idiots get into this profession? How stupid must the people you robbed be?</em></p> 
 <p>With mock-sympathy for these five people, Bai Xiaofei retreated half a step. The next second, his leg whipped full-force at the air in front of him.</p> 
 <p>Just when the three people wondered why their Fifth Brother was acting so strangely, Bai Xiaofei teleported behind the bandit leader! And everyone then knew who the leg-whip was for…</p> 
 <p>Without any time to react, Bai Xiaofei’s leg struck the boss’s torso, breaking several ribs and sending the bandit leader flying like a sandbag.</p> 
 <p>That was just the beginning. In order to ensure that the guy had lost his fighting capacity, Bai Xiaofei summoned Purple Luan. A pair of wings appeared and started flapping, allowing him to catch up with the flying bandit leader. Another leg-whip launched at the guy, smashing him onto the ground.</p> 
 <p>Slowly descending, Bai Xiaofei glanced at the half-dead bandit leader with a smile.</p> 
 <p>What Xue Ying had taught him never failed. No matter how strong a puppet master was, they were useless if they didn’t have the chance to use their puppet. Only a strong body could help one avoid this dilemma!</p> 
 <p>Thinking of Xue Ying, Bai Xiaofei zoned out for a brief second.</p> 
 <p>Right at that moment, the attacks from the Ranged Stream puppet arrived. If the other bandits hadn’t realized by now what was happening, then they would be beyond useless. Their speedy response somewhat saved their reputation as professional bandits.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, it was all pointless. Since Bai Xiaofei gave up hiding, it meant he already felt there was no need to hide. His right hand raised, easily smashing the seemingly fatal attack into nothingness.</p> 
 <p><em>Deflected, just like that?! How?!</em></p> 
 <p>The Ranged Stream puppet master gawked in shock. Such an action was beyond his cognition, even Exquisite Rank experts shouldn’t be able to do it!</p> 
 <p>In fact, this could only be blamed on his attack being pure energy. After all, Bai Xiaofei could take on even Cang Lan’s energy attack, not to mention a puny Master Rank puppet master. It was merciful enough that he even raised his hand to brush it off. Otherwise, he’d be scared to death if he saw Bai Xiaofei stand unscathed after it hit him.</p> 
 <p>While the Ranged Stream puppet master was still in shock, Bai Xiaofei shot at him. His previous training came in handy as his burst of speed exceeded even that of the speed-type Melee Stream puppet master, let alone that the target was only a scared-silly one.</p> 
 <p>Easily putting down the puppet master, Bai Xiaofei looked up at the last one.</p> 
 <p>Looking at Bai Xiaofei and the demonic smile on his face, the man stopped in his rush and slowly collapsed to the ground. It was impossible to beat Bai Xiaofei…</p> 
 <p>At this point, the bandit group of five was completely annihilated. Bai Xiaofei didn’t give anyone a chance to fight back!</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, you guys are still useful to me, so I won’t kill you. Go and carry your brothers over. I have something to tell you.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s words ignited a light in the eyes of the remaining person. Not dying was already the best result.</p> 
 <p>Little did he know that in this world, there was a manner of living worse than death…</p>
