 <p>Chapter 527: Three Schools of Thought in the Globe Merchant Group!</p> 
 <p>Facing a suddenly serious Bai Xiaofei, Ling Tianxia didn’t show any suspicious reactions and the tension on his face was exactly what a president would have when he heard something inconducive to his merchant group.</p> 
 <p>“Little Brother, just say it. If this information can help the Globe Merchant Group, I will definitely repay you!” Ling Tianxia stressed each word. Bai Xiaofei couldn’t detect any flaws from his response.</p> 
 <p>“If you say so, then I won’t hold back!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei paused and took a deep breath before narrating the story of Ancient Yue from the beginning to the end while maintaining a close eye on Ling Tianxia’s reactions. However, he didn’t once gain any useful information.</p> 
 <p>At least as far as Bai Xiaofei could tell, Ling Tianxia really knew nothing about it.</p> 
 <p>“Those stupid bastards!!! Do they want to make the Globe Merchant Group the target of the whole continent?!! If they want my position of president, they can just ask!!!”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Bai Xiaofei finished the story, Ling Tianxia slapped the table in front of them. The whole table was reduced to powder the instant his palm touched. Powder, not pieces!</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Bai Xiaofei’s mouth twitched. <em>A subtle threat by displaying his might? Or is it something else?</em></p> 
 <p>“You still don’t have complete control over your puppet even now?” Lei Shan sighed and slightly waved his hand. The three cups that survived the attack floated slowly towards their respective users.</p> 
 <p>Compared to the Globe Merchant Group, Lei Shan obviously cared more about the condition of his disciple. His words also answered Bai Xiaofei’s doubts. Ling Tianxia hadn’t destroyed the table on purpose, he just couldn’t control his ability.</p> 
 <p><em>But what is this ability?! How can a table be smacked into fine powder?!</em></p> 
 <p>Trying to contain the shock in his heart, Bai Xiaofei once again looked at Ling Tianxia, the president who had shaken him with more than just his shocking looks, so much so that many of Bai Xiaofei’s previous ideas were overthrown.</p> 
 <p>“I’m sorry, Teacher, this disciple is incompetent…” Ling Tianxia immediately lowered his head at Lei Shan’s reprimand. Perhaps the old man was the only person in this continent who could make him do this.</p> 
 <p>“Aiii, I don’t blame you. So many years have passed and I still haven’t found a fix for your physical problems, not to mention that now is not the time to worry about this. You’d better discuss with Xiaofei about the Ancient Yue matter. One of our students died in that incident. Everyone is demanding an explanation from your Globe Merchant Group.” After confirming that the matter had nothing to do with Ling Tianxia, Lei Shan immediately relaxed and his tone regained confidence. He could now comment on this matter which he hadn’t dared to bring up at the start of the meeting.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, teacher. I will provide a satisfactory explanation!” promised Ling Tianxia with a hint of anger in his voice as he lowered his head again. He just wanted to return to his merchant group and handle the group of masterminds behind the Ancient Yue incident.</p> 
 <p>One should stabilize the inside before developing the outside, but it seemed that Ling Tianxia failed the former.</p> 
 <p>“I’m tired, I’ll go back to rest. You two chat,” Lei Shan said and stood up. Before Bai Xiaofei and Ling Tianxia could say anything, he had already left the office despite his seemingly leisurely pace.</p> 
 <p>When there were only two people left in the room, Bai Xiaofei’s vibe changed again. When Lei Shan was here, he actually had scruples!</p> 
 <p>“Senior, from what you said, there seems to be some disharmony within the Globe Merchant Group?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei knew that this kind of problem touched the bottom line of an organization, especially for merchant groups who attached great importance to confidentiality, but he still asked. He knew that if Ling Tianxia wanted to continue to maintain his image, he would definitely answer this question!</p> 
 <p>Sure enough, Ling Tianxia first sighed before starting to speak.</p> 
 <p>“I shouldn’t reveal this to an outsider, but since Teacher is willing to believe in you, Little Brother, I guess it’s fine to tell you.”</p> 
 <p>Ling Tianxia stopped to organize his thoughts before continuing.</p> 
 <p>“As you’ve said, there are actually quite a lot of disputes within major merchant groups. The Globe Merchant Group naturally can’t avoid this. All of us were good brothers who traveled the world and fought together, but when the interests are big enough, this kind of brotherhood will become so meager that it’s ridiculous.”</p> 
 <p>“I don’t have accurate information about the other merchant groups, but as far as the current situation of the Globe Merchant Group is concerned, it is divided into three main factions.”</p> 
 <p>“There are a total of 18 executives including me, among which seven fully support me. My idea, like what I mentioned, is to strengthen the relationships with the high-ranking people of various kingdoms and consolidate the foundation of the Globe Merchant Group, thereby achieving further development.”</p> 
 <p>“However, this idea seems a bit too conservative to the rest. They feel that with the current strength of the Globe Merchant Group, more radical means can be adopted to catch up with the Amethyst Merchant House and even exceed them by a huge gap.”</p> 
 <p>“And those people are divided into two factions. Six of them approve of achieving regional monopoly by suppressing and absorbing small businesses, so as to achieve steady progress of the branches and look down at the kingdoms instead of letting them limit us!”</p> 
 <p>Reaching this point, Bai Xiaofei was already gawking wide and gulping hard. The second type of people already opened up a new world for him, overturning the idea of establishing good relationships with kingdoms that Ling Tianxia had just taught him before. It turned out that when something was executed to the extreme, it could even break through that limit to a new level!</p> 
 <p>At the same time, Bai Xiaofei was extremely curious about the last faction. If the second one was already so thrilling, what would the third one be like?</p> 
 <p>“This second school of thought can still be considered decent. Although their path is a bit radical, it won’t affect the foundations of the Globe Merchant Group, while the third group is the most likely to be behind the Ancient Yue event!” Ling Tianxia grew emotional at the mention of this.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s brow furrowed tightly. Regardless of whether this matter had anything to do with Ling Tianxia, those people had definitely played a part!</p> 
 <p>Which was to say, Chu Yue’s death was on them!</p> 
 <p>“This third school of thought is ‘risky investment’!” Ling Tianxia said this between gnashed teeth, his body trembling. If it wasn’t that the table was already gone, there would have been another slap.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei frowned.</p> 
 <p><em>Risky investment? What does that mean?</em></p>
