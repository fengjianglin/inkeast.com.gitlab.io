 <p>Chapter 270: What He Fears is that the Beauties are all Charming Demons!</p> 
 <p>“Other than the investment …”</p> 
 <p>“I’ll make plans for everything else besides the investment before noon. Don't worry, it will certainly satisfy you, Vice President Chu. As for the profit division, let’s do 50 50 after the expenses are deducted. Since this is a rare occasion to contribute to Starnet, I won’t be selfish,” Bai Xiaofei interrupted Chu Qingtian again with an aura that he already had everything planned out, which made Chu Qingtian even more sure that he had been tricked! However, there was no medicine for regret in this world…</p> 
 <p><em>Sure enough, this brat Bai Xiaofei must always be guarded against!!!</em></p> 
 <p>“So…”</p> 
 <p>“That’s right, apart from introducing new investors and announcing Starnet’s opening to the outside world, you don’t need to worry about the rest, just leave them all to me. I’m not good at cooperation. If others interfere, I will easily make wrong moves,” threatened Bai Xiaofei with an amiable face.</p> 
 <p>Chu Qingtian couldn’t even say the word ‘no.’ This bitter feeling of being forced to suffer in silence reminded Chu Qingtian of that night…</p> 
 <p>“What you just…”</p> 
 <p>“What I said just now was true, that’s the kind of person I am. Either I don't do it or I’ll do it the best I can, so you don't have to worry, Vice Principal.” Bai Xiaofei was like a mind-reader. He knew what Chu Qingtian was going to say from just a few words.</p> 
 <p>And every answer was impeccable!</p> 
 <p>Hearing Bai Xiaofei’s solemn nonsense of comfort, Chu Qingtian still felt a little better. At least Bai Xiaofei was trying to save him some face, right?</p> 
 <p>“Representatives of major businesses will be in place by tomorrow night at the latest. Prepare well. How much we can get will depend on how much you can gouge from them!” With a reluctant sigh, Chu Qingtian gave up on struggling.</p> 
 <p><em>50 50 then so be it! Still better than nothing, isn't it?</em></p> 
 <p>It wasn’t that Chu Qingtian didn’t want to fight for more benefit, but that he didn’t think he could compete with Bai Xiaofei in this state. Instead of adding to his own displeasure, he might as well be a straightforward person!</p> 
 <p>“Rest assured, I'll gouge them so well they’ll cry!” Chuckling, Bai Xiaofei once again wore the shady expression that made people want to beat him up.</p> 
 <p>“Then, I'll wait to see you make a killing.”</p> 
 <p>With a hint of reluctance, Chu Qingtian held out his right hand to Bai Xiaofei. The light grip of both hands formally announced the cooperation between an old and a young fox. There was no need for a contract as Chu Qingtian was confident that Bai Xiaofei wouldn’t dare to pull a trick on this one unless he didn’t want his academy life anymore.</p> 
 <p>After Chu Qingtian left with extremely complicated feelings, the girls, who had been trying to control their excitement, finally couldn’t hold back.</p> 
 <p>In the blink of an eye, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t even figure what was happening when he was already pressed down on his chair, surrounded.</p> 
 <p>“Xiaofei, have you had enough for breakfast? If you haven't, I'll make you a new meal!” Leng Liushuang gently kneaded Bai Xiaofei's shoulders with just the right amount of force. Bai Xiaofei instantly relaxed.</p> 
 <p><em>Her massage technique is not inferior to her cooking! Anyone who gets to marry Leng Liushuang is hitting the jackpot!</em></p> 
 <p>“Want me to accompany you back to sleep? I said I’d warm your bed, but I’ve never done it once. How about we do it right now?” Leng Liuying was as bold as ever, sensually teasing Bai Xiaofei while rubbing his thigh, those few words from her successfully provoking his heart.</p> 
 <p>He wasn’t afraid of being surrounded by beauties, what he feared was that the beauties around were all charming demons!</p> 
 <p>Not to mention Bai Xiaofei, even a young monk might not be able to stand it! Especially with Leng Liuying's hand occasionally nearing his forbidden area…</p> 
 <p>“If you have any wishes, I can help you achieve them all…” Chu Liuyun, pressing down on his leg, seemed to be affected by Leng Liuying as well. Her beautiful eyes had light flowing in them as her lip-biting made Bai Xiaofei involuntarily swallow a mouthful of saliva.</p> 
 <p><em>What’s going on today? Did they take aphrodisiacs together?!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei thought, but his body was very honest. It made no resistance and was just quietly enjoying…</p> 
 <p>“Mmm, it’d be nice to have more of these massages in the future. Also, there are still quite some dirty clothes, underpants and socks in my room, if you guys have time…”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei hadn’t finished when the six hands that had just brought him incomparable pleasure suddenly exerted force, and the next second, a miserable howl flew out from Bai Xiaofei's throat…</p> 
 <p>“OWWWW! It hurts! Senior sisters, I know my wrongs, alright?!”</p> 
 <p>Unable to be mighty for more than three seconds, the pleasure also didn't last three seconds, and now Bai Xiaofei finally knew what was meant by ‘disaster came from the mouth.’</p> 
 <p>Indeed, one should never be too smug.</p> 
 <p>Three different cold snorts rang out. The three girls with an originally good service attitude stopped at the same time.</p> 
 <p>“Little Feifei, taking a mile is not so easy! Try to learn your lesson this time, okay?” Chu Liuyun bent down and gently poked Bai Xiaofei's forehead. Face to face at close range, she threatened him in a voice that didn’t sound very threatening.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei had chosen to shut down his auditory sense, keeping only his sense of smell and vision active. Chu Liuyun’s body fragrance frantically drilled into his nostrils and captured his thoughts. When he shifted his line of sight, two white hemispheres at the neckline of the uniform fastened his gaze.</p> 
 <p>A bite of the apple makes one yearn for more. Bai Xiaofei, who had experienced the taste of women, knew full well where the stunner in front of him was the most attractive…</p> 
 <p>“Hey, I’m talking to you!” The unsuspecting Chu Liuyun couldn’t tell that something was off with Bai Xiaofei. As he didn’t respond, her cute lips pouted in anger.</p> 
 <p><em>Oh heavens! She’s gonna kill me at this rate!!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei's ears remained in an inactive state. A long period of silence and uncontrollable gulping sounds finally clued Chu Liuyun into realizing that something was wrong with Bai Xiaofei. When she followed his line of sight and looked down at herself, her pretty face instantly flushed red.</p> 
 <p>“Very well! You little rascal!”</p> 
 <p>One hand blocked the scenery in front of her chest, and the other twisted Bai Xiaofei's ear. In pain, Bai Xiaofei's hearing finally returned to normal.</p> 
 <p>“Ow ow ow! Sister Liuyun! I can explain!” he whined as his face was instantly filled with injustice.</p> 
 <p>The expression of injustice naturally didn’t escape Chu Liuyun’s eyes, and it was exactly this that took her fury to another level.</p> 
 <p><em>Hah?! Taking advantage of me and yet you feel wronged?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Very good! I'll listen to what you have to say!” Chu Liuyun’s face was cold, but her tone didn’t sound angry at all.</p> 
 <p>“Well, I was just thinking about something and was distracted. Do you believe me?” His face bitter, Bai Xiaofei reluctantly made up an excuse, hoping that Chu Liuyun could be a fool for once.</p> 
 <p>However, she was not the only one present.</p> 
 <p>“Lies!” A shout from Leng Liushuang knocked Bai Xiaofei into the abyss.</p> 
 <p>“That’s right, that’s a lie. You were clearly staring at Sister Liuyun’s chest!” said Leng Liuying as she got behind Chu Liuyun, her soft hands instantly wrapping around the latter’s attractive ‘buns.’<br> “But it feels really good. Do you wanna try?”</p> 
 <p>“Liuying, you’re asking for a beating!”</p> 
 <p>The violated Chu Liuyun instantly switched targets. Having narrowly escaped, Bai Xiaofei quickly heaved a sigh of relief.</p> 
 <p><em>No wonder it's called the Demon of Illusions. This place is really full of demons!</em></p>
