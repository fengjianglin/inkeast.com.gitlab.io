<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>Wu Chi and Xu Chen were the first to charge forward, and when Bai Ye and the other senior recovered from their shock and moved to defend, they were already incapable of posing any threat to the two of them and were beaten back at practically the first possible moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Wang Hang and Zhu Si’si instantly erupted. They charged towards the senior that held the Hurricane Sword from both left and right and at the same time, whereas, Shi Kui and Qi Wei who were slightly slower had selected Qin Lingyan that had just been thrown out by Lin Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire Savage Class seemed as if they’d taken drugs collectively, causing their attacks to pour down like a ceaselessly flowing river, and they didn’t give all the seniors the slightest chance to retaliate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Meng who was still in midair was already on the brink of his limit because the attack from the Divine Phoenix Feathered Dress had never stopped for a moment!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right at this moment, Fang ye who felt it was already the best opportunity fired!</span></p>
 <p><span style>His target was precisely He Meng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Injuring all ten of a person’s fingers is inferior to chopping a single finger off. &nbsp;Everyone else had the possibility of resisting, but as far as everyone was concerned, He Meng was already a piece of meat on the chopping block!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was precisely this piece of meat on the chopping block that caught everyone off guard!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Meng’s fourth puppet, the Chains of Purification!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It exhausted Origin Energy to remove all effects of control of a puppet on him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he purified himself, the skill that arrived subsequently was He Meng’s teleportation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>His target, Fang Ye!!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the others that were taking a beating passively had erupted with their second and third puppets. In the blink of an eye, Wu Chi and the others had changed from the suppressors to the suppressed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, their true target had already been placed on Fang Ye since the moment he shot the first bullet because a Ranged Stream puppet master that was capable of breaking open the Origin Energy defensive shield of a Master Rank puppet master was like a fish bone stuck in their throats, and they would be in danger at all times if they didn’t remove it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now, this threat was gone!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At least, Qin Lingyan’s group of five thought in this way because how could a Ranged Stream puppet master possibly win when approached by an Assassin Stream puppet master?</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, reality exceeded their expectations!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Especially He Meng, he was slightly dazed at this moment because the situation after he teleported over was simply exceedingly different from his expectations!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen Hui and Mo Ka were on both sides of Fang Ye, and they pounced over at the instant He Meng appeared!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, He Meng’s first reaction was that they were only two new students that weren’t even at the Master Rank, so how could they possibly be a match for him in close combat? And He Meng only realized he was wrong at the instant the collided with them!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was deeply wrong!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When compared with Chen Hui and Mo Ka, the close combat techniques he possessed were simply like the difference between a full time professional and a part time employee!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Especially Mo Ka’s character of taking advantage of opportunities to strike a heavy blow. Chen Hui was in charge of drawing his attention from the front, whereas, Mo Ka only struck at his weak spots!</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the entire process, Fang Ye didn’t even turn around, and his eyes that were looking for an opportunity had never moved an inch. Moreover, he’d launched an attack!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The energy bullet shot out explosively, and Bai Ye who was in battle with Wu Chi and Xu Chen hadn’t taken the slightest precautions towards this, causing it to be too late when he realized what had happened!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Solid Wall!” Bai Ye activated the effect of his fourth puppet, the Solid Wall Necklace, and took Fang Ye’s attack head on. At the same time, a tempestuous storm arose in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He Meng actually didn’t deal with that puppet master with a gun puppet?!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could it be there’s another Master Rank puppet master?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As countless thoughts flashed within his mind, Bai Ye had completely withdrawn his thoughts of underestimation towards the Savage Class, and he started to take precautions against Fang Ye while dealing with Wu Chi who was before him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lingyan and the others naturally noticed Bai Ye’s situation, and they couldn’t help but shoot a questioning expression towards the place the bullet shot over from.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t just Bai Ye who didn’t understand, all four of them who were still in the main battlefield was unable to understand what had happened!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give it your all!” As her expression darkened instantly, Qin Lingyan spoke the common thoughts that everyone had.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before they came here, Qin Lingyan had instructed them to just teach Bai Xiaofei and the others a lesson and to try not to injure the others or cause any irreversible outcomes. But, now it would seem like if they didn’t give it their all, then not to mention teaching Bai Xiaofei and the others a lesson, it would be a problem for them to even withdraw uninjured!</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, Qin Lingyan’s words at this moment were no different than a removal of a seal!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next second, Origin Energy fluctuations that far exceeded everyone from the Savage Class stretched out, and in the blink of an eye, the four of them had reclaimed the initiative!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since they were able to be brought over by Qin Lingyan, none of them was a weakling, and the weakest amongst them had attained the Origin Energy Control level of the Master Rank! At this moment, all of them had precisely utilized the Origin Energy Control level at this moment!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Retreat!” Bai Xiaofei who’d been helped out of a predicament noticed all this. Even though it was slightly troublesome, but it was entirely within his expectations because there were numerous Master Rank puppet masters in the Gorge of Heroes, so how could he not know what they were capable of?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Along with Bai Xiaofei’s order, everyone besides Lin Li didn’t continue fighting and immediately crushed the mist bombs that Bai Xiaofei had utilized earlier in exchange for some time to breathe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin Li, I’m fine! Calm down!” Bai Xiaofei’s voice sounded out once more, causing the berserk Lin Li to gradually calm down along with it. At the same time, the ran over to Bai Xiaofei’s side at the first possible moment and checked his injuries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll kill them!” Lin Li’s tone was exceedingly icy cold, and the serious expression on her face wasn’t faked in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no need for that. We aren’t mortal enemies. Moreover, don’t you believe me?” bai Xiaofei tried his best to make his voice gentler as he consoled Lin Li because he’d experienced it once before as Lin Li had already gone berserk once when they encountered the Earth Dire Bears for the first time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Li glanced at Bai Xiaofei’s hand which he placed on her shoulder and her Origin Energy fluctuation calmed down along with this. Presently, Lin Li was far from attaining the ability of Origin Energy Control, so controlling a gold-grade puppet beyond the limit was harmful to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Skysplit Slash!” The senior that held the Hurricane Sword executed this move once more, and the impetus of the strike was at least two levels higher than before, causing the dense mist that suffused the entire battlefield to be blown away along with this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, He Meng who knew he was unable to accomplish anything over where Fang Ye was had already executed his teleportation ability to return to the other four.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The greatest difference between puppets and ordinary equipment or tools was the cooldown period of skills. The cooldown period between usages of tools was normally extremely long because it required time to replenish its energy. But, puppets were different, one only needed sufficient Origin Energy and one could activate the ability of puppets at will!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the precondition was sufficient Origin Energy. Normally, the more extraordinary the ability was, the more Origin Energy would be consumed when activating the puppet. For example, He Meng’s teleportation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai Xiaofei, I withdraw my mistaken views from before. You’ve really made me look at you in a different light. But, there’s one thing that’s impossible to change.” Qin Lingyan paused for a moment, and then her already terrifying Origin Energy fluctuation rose once more!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you will surely be the losing party today!” Her voice hadn’t finished resounding in the air when Qin Lingyan’s group of five had moved into formation before charging towards Bai Xiaofei at the same time. In the beginning, they intended to completely subdue the Savage Class, but now, they wanted to capture the leader first!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, right at this moment, Bai Xiaofei revealed a smile, a smile that said everything was ready.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Sister Lingyan, I would really be unable to refute you if you said these words two minutes earlier.” Bai Xiaofei completely disregarded the approach of Qin Lingyan and the others, and he spoke while seeming to be self-absorbed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But now, you have no chance!”</span></p>
