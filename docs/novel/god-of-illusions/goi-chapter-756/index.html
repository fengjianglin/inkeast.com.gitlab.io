 <p>Chapter 756: Sharp Test!</p> 
 <p>The wait wasn’t prolonged. That evening, Bai Xiaofei received an invitation from Boss Tong. However, the messenger was not Heartless, but an underling who was originally under Old Song.</p> 
 <p>“Where is Boss Song? Why didn’t he come?” Bai Xiaofei immediately sensed something wrong.</p> 
 <p>The messenger looked troubled by his question.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Bai Xiaofei smiled and did not make it hard for him. “It’s all good, you don’t have to answer if it’s not convenient. Just take me there.”</p> 
 <p>Heaving a sigh of relief, the messenger turned around to lead the way. Behind him, Bai Xiaofei signaled Fang Ye with his eyes. Getting the hint, Fang Ye stepped back and whispered something to everyone.</p> 
 <p>Boss Tong’s invitation was to a banquet, so it was obviously meant for the whole group.</p> 
 <p>Starflame was not a big city. Before long, the party arrived at the inn where Old Song’s group had been staying. Despite being very familiar with it, Bai Xiaofei had to pretend as if this was his first time coming there.</p> 
 <p>“I have been traveling on business for so many years, but this is the first time I have seen a party host refusing to come out and greet the guests he personally invited! Even if your big boss doesn’t want to, Boss Song should not lack the time too!” Bai Xiaofei’s expression sank as he stood at the inn entrance.</p> 
 <p>However, never could he expect that the moment he finished speaking, a figure bolted at him.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei instinctively wanted to defend, but he held himself back. Wang Hang, who stood right behind, did not disappoint and managed to block the attack.</p> 
 <p>A crisp metallic sound echoed as two daggers struck each other. Seeing his attack fail, Heartless vanished on the spot.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s group was startled. It was an assassin-type ability!</p> 
 <p>“Ice!” Chen Hui reacted quickly. His Snowfreeze Pearl appeared and the temperature around dropped sharply.</p> 
 <p>An assassin in a vanished state would not be affected by attacks but must exit that state to do anything else. As Chen Hui had frozen the whole area around, Heartless would take damage the moment he showed himself.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, except for Bai Xiaofei and his guards, Hu Xian’er’s group retreated in panic. Duan Yiyi tightly held Lin Li as tears streamed down her face.</p> 
 <p>Knowing that he could not continue to attack, Heartless backed out and appeared behind Boss Tong who had just walked downstairs.</p> 
 <p>“My bad, Boss Bai, given how unique our industry is, being extremely cautious is a must. If you have been offended, please forgive me.” Boss Tong walked to Bai Xiaofei and extended his right hand. “Very nice to meet you, I am Tong Fei.”</p> 
 <p>Looking at Tong Fei’s hand, Bai Xiaofei sneered.</p> 
 <p>“Forgive you? I can. But your subordinate attacked me and my family, you think I can let that slide? Or do you think my people can’t handle your men?” said Bai Xiaofei indifferently in an experienced manner, which he did not have to pretend. He had been through many waves and storms.</p> 
 <p>Heartless was but a Grandmaster Rank assassin. Bai Xiaofei had traded blows with a monster that rendered even Legend Rank experts helpless.</p> 
 <p>“I will definitely give you satisfactory compensation. What do you think of a five-percent discount?” Tong Fei smiled, completely unaffected.</p> 
 <p>“Eight percent!” Bai Xiaofei did not hesitate to add three whole percent.</p> 
 <p>Businessmen only sought profit, which Bai Xiaofei interpreted to the fullest as it was in his nature…</p> 
 <p>“Alright, good, eight percent it is!” Tong Fei laughed loudly. Upon the agreement, he finally got to shake Bai Xiaofei’s hand.</p> 
 <p>“The banquet is ready upstairs. Please honor it with your presence, or else I will be ashamed by my rude reception.” Tong Fei gestured with his hand, thus concluding the first storm.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei smiled. Although he knew that the test would definitely not be this simple, there was nothing he could do but react spontaneously.</p> 
 <p>After everyone was seated, the two parties started to assess one another. Hu Xian’er’s ‘family’ group would glare at Tong Fei with resentment and at Heartless with a hint of fear.</p> 
 <p>Observing their reaction inadvertently, Heartless concluded –</p> 
 <p><em>Impeccable! They are really ordinary people!</em></p> 
 <p>“Boss Tong, Boss Song should have told you about my requirements. I can’t come to this banquet for nothing today, and moreover, you just made a promise. There shouldn’t be any more accidents, right?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei emptied all of his trivial thoughts and got straight to the point. At this moment, doing business was his only purpose. To deceive others, he must deceive himself first.</p> 
 <p>“Of course not, we warmly welcome all business partners, not to mention a rising star like the Illusion Demon Merchant Group. The scope of our cooperation can be expanded indefinitely, and I am very happy to be the middleman. It is beneficial to us all.” Tong Fei also assumed his business manner, but still looked at Bai Xiaofei with a hint of examination.</p> 
 <p>“The scope is not a problem. You should have guessed the purpose of our group. Since we dare to stand out, we definitely have built a strong enough foundation to.” Bai Xiaofei smiled confidently. His Illusion Demon had officially entered the second stage, ready to meet the suppression from the eight major merchant groups.</p> 
 <p>“Then, I propose a toast to Boss Bai in advance and wish us an endless stream of money in the future!” Tong Fei laughed joyously and drained his cup.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei also drank his wine. To his shock, right after he put down his glass, an acquaintance was hauled into the room.</p> 
 <p>It was Old Song, covered in blood. Compared with his previously high-spirited appearance, Old Song could be said to be tragic at the moment. No one knew what Heartless had done to him, but one thing was for certain that he was now absolutely ruined.</p> 
 <p>“What is the meaning of this?” Bai Xiaofei’s expression became icy. This was not just a test, but a threat!</p> 
 <p>“He disobeyed the rules and colluded with outsiders to harm his own people. This is only a small punishment. I have him brought here as an apology to Boss Bai as I don’t know if he might have done anything that offended you,” Tong Fei worded it tactfully as he looked closely at Bai Xiaofei for a reaction.</p> 
 <p>However, he was disappointed again. Bai Xiaofei never took Old Song seriously.</p> 
 <p>“If he really did, do you think he can live until you come to deal with him?” Bai Xiaofei retorted with an unfriendly question.</p> 
 <p><em>Threaten me? I can be your ancestor in this field!</em></p> 
 <p>“It was ignorant of me. I hope you can forgive me, Boss Bai.” Taking a loss, Tong Fei smiled fawningly. Then, he glared at Heartless. “Why are you standing around? Hurry and take him away, don’t let him ruin the atmosphere!”</p> 
 <p>With Heartless taking Old Song away, the series of tests arranged by Tong Fei ended. Facing Bai Xiaofei, he finally assumed a real attitude of cooperation. Their communication could officially start!</p>
