 <p>Chapter 1021: Divide and Change!</p> 
 <p>“Oh? You’re still dissatisfied? The First Elder is dead, the Saintess obviously favors you, and your son is in charge of the Guard Team. Barbaric Godism might just be yours in the future.” The Second Elder shook his head. Compared with the Third Elder, his present situation was quite difficult.</p> 
 <p>“You only saw what’s on the surface.” The Third Elder smiled bitterly as he filled a cup for the Second Elder.</p> 
 <p>Already drunk, the Second Elder drained the cup without thinking. The Third Elder immediately refilled another cup for him. Unlike the Second Elder, he was becoming gradually sober thanks to the effect of the pill he had just taken.</p> 
 <p>“Then tell me, what’s under the surface?” The Second Elder’s mouth had grown a little crooked and he had started to slur.</p> 
 <p>“Although I helped the Saintess before, she is not my people after all. Once she has a taste of power, I’m afraid that you and I will end up like the First Elder one day,” said the Third Elder.</p> 
 <p>The Second Elder was startled. In the end, he also revealed a bitter smile. “Even so, what can we do? We are like fish on her chopping board, we can’t beat her.” He had already accepted his fate.</p> 
 <p>“What if I tell you that I can restrain her?” The Third Elder suddenly became serious.</p> 
 <p>The Second Elder widened his eyes. “How!?”</p> 
 <p>“The wall has ears. Come closer.” The Third Elder looked around carefully.</p> 
 <p>The Second Elder leaned toward him.</p> 
 <p>“It’s very simple, all you need to do is… fulfill me,” the Third Elder whispered.</p> 
 <p>The Second Elder was stunned by this answer. At that moment he was caught off guard, the Third Elder punched at his ribs, sending him flying with the crunching sound of bones breaking.</p> 
 <p>As the Second Elder scrambled up, he spat out a mouthful of blood. The punch had impacted the majority of his internal organs!</p> 
 <p>“If you let me kill you, my strength will advance and I won’t have to be afraid of that stupid Saintess,” the Third Elder finally revealed his true motive.</p> 
 <p>The pain and shock woke up the Second Elder from his drunken stupor, but it was already too late.</p> 
 <p>“How can you have such power?!” Struggling to stand, the Second Elder was confused. In his cognition, even if he was caught off guard, the Third Elder couldn’t have injured him to this degree!</p> 
 <p>“Since you’re going to die now, I guess it doesn’t hurt to tell you.” The Third Elder walked toward the Second Elder. “The First Elder died by my hand!” With that, he accelerated…</p> 
 <p>After killing the Second Elder, the Third Elder sent a signal, and Bai Xiaofei, who had been waiting outside the residence, was inwardly delighted.</p> 
 <p>“You know what to do,” he said to the Guard Team behind him and left the scene.</p> 
 <p>The next second, the five hundred guards poured into the Second Elder’s residence and started a massacre.</p> 
 <p>By dawn the next day, the extermination of the Second Elder’s branch had been known by the whole of Barbaric Godism. As Qiu Muxue was celebrating this benchmark victory of their plan, she was asked for an audience by the Fourth and Fifth elders.</p> 
 <p>“Can’t sit still now that their backbone is gone, huh?” Bai Xiaofei exchanged a smile with Qiu Muxue and stretched his body. “Let’s go and see them. If there is no surprise, we will have one less trouble tonight as well.”</p> 
 <p>Victory was close at hand…</p> 
 <p>…… </p> 
 <p>“Honorable Saintess, we know we shouldn’t bother you, but…”</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know anything about what happened to Second Elder,” Qiu Muxue cut off the Fourth Elder.</p> 
 <p>Thus, the speech the two elders had prepared was rendered useless.</p> 
 <p>“I have no reason to cut off my own hand. You all chose to support me, so do you think it’s necessary for me to do such a stupid thing? Or do you think killing him will do me any good?” Qiu Muxue continued, not giving them time to think.</p> 
 <p>After half a day, the Fifth Elder stuttered, “Then… Second Elder… he…”</p> 
 <p>“I’ll send people to investigate. However, think for yourself. Who benefits from the Second Elder’s death? Moreover, with his strength, no one in Barbaric Godism can kill him in a one-on-one fight,” said Qiu Muxue indifferently, simply implying that more than one elder had colluded to kill the Second Elder.</p> 
 <p>The two elders subconsciously looked at each other, and then fell silent.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll say this again, I won’t add new elders, so ultimately, all of those rights are yours. For me, it doesn’t matter how many elders there are, as long as you don’t meddle in my business,” Qiu Muxue added.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the two elders panicked.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, I’ve said everything there is to say. If there is nothing else, please continue to prepare for my takeover ceremony the day after tomorrow. From now on, you two and the Third Elder will be responsible for the Second Elder’s work,” Qiu Muxue concluded the conversation and waved her hand to dismiss them.</p> 
 <p>The two elders wisely retreated.</p> 
 <p>However, unlike the intimacy with which they had first arrived, they were quiet on the way back, inadvertently glancing at each other warily.</p> 
 <p>To add oil to the fire, Bai Xiaofei performed another show after they returned to their residence. He transformed into the Fourth and Fifth Elder, each time inviting the Third Elder out for a meeting at different places. He didn’t talk about anything special, as the aim was only to let the confidants of the Fourth and Fifth Elder see their ‘secret’ meetings.</p> 
 <p>When this news reached the ears of the Fourth and Fifth Elder, Bai Xiaofei sent people to deliver the final blow. In the name of one, he asked the other to meet outside in the evening. After that, he had the soldiers who had been taken into forced labor to spread a rumor: ‘After tonight, we will lose another elder!’</p>
