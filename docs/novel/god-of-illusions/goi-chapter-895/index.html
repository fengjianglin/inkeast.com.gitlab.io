 <p>Chapter 895: Avoiding Me?!</p> 
 <p>“Boss, that’s what he said! We are scared!”</p> 
 <p>After leaving Bai Xiaofei waiting in the room, the two guards immediately ran to where their leader hid after receiving their secret signals earlier.</p> 
 <p>This was not the first time that someone from above had come to check before. When it was not the emperor, the leader always found a reason to hide. This time, however, he realized there was a problem.</p> 
 <p>“You two go and gather the people. If he asks why I’m not present, just say that I was called away by the First prince and that I will go to find him. That young greenhorn wants to boss the Imperial Guard around? Humph, he thinks I don’t have a backer?!” With a cold snort, the leader walked out.</p> 
 <p>After the leader left, the two guards hurriedly went to the deputy leader and explained the situation.</p> 
 <p>The deputy leader’s attitude was completely different from that of the leader. After hearing the news, he immediately gathered everyone. Before long, Bai Xiaofei came out to see a dispirited array of soldiers, causing him to nearly curse out loud.</p> 
 <p><em>This is Ethereal’s steel guard?! Is their fame overblown?!</em></p> 
 <p>Dispirited soldiers and loose discipline, a perfect contrast to the Yun private army. If he wasn’t standing in the Imperial Guard’s grounds, Bai Xiaofei really couldn’t believe that this was the army that the Ethereal emperor regarded as a treasure.</p> 
 <p>“Where is your commander?” Enduring the anger, Bai Xiaofei asked the deputy commander with a clouded face.</p> 
 <p>The latter immediately stepped forward with cupped hands and reported what he knew, “Reporting to Overseer, the leader was summoned by the First prince for business.”</p> 
 <p>“Did he tell you that himself?” Bai Xiaofei snorted.</p> 
 <p>The deputy commander hesitated.</p> 
 <p>“What’s wrong? Don’t tell me that the deputy commander of Ethereal’s Imperial Guard does not dare to speak the truth! Is that how you are responsible for His Majesty?!” Bai Xiaofei’s cold voice echoed.</p> 
 <p>“Reporting to Overseer, this subordinate is rarely concerned with the Imperial Guard’s affairs and a very small part of the Guard reports to me. As for where our leader has gone, I did not hear it from him!” reported the deputy commander honestly after looking troubled for a while. At the same time, he inwardly made a decision, <em>‘If this is an opportunity, then I will seize it! If not, then I’ll quit this place!’</em></p> 
 <p>“Aren’t you the deputy commander? If I remember correctly, the Imperial Guard only has one deputy commander. You’re telling me the deputy commander isn’t concerned with his own group’s affairs?!” Bai Xiaofei inquired.</p> 
 <p>With a pained expression, the deputy commander simply let it go, “Yes, Overseer, my position only exists in name. The reason why I can stay is because some people want to disgust me.”</p> 
 <p>“In that case, the smog here has nothing to do with you?” Bai Xiaofei suddenly laughed.</p> 
 <p>The deputy commander was flustered. “Overseer… You…” he stuttered, unsure if he should continue after this sudden change and even regretted what he had said a little.</p> 
 <p>“Answer me, how much does everything here have to do with you?!”</p> 
 <p>Facing this question, the deputy commander clenched his jaws and uttered, “I swear on my head that it has nothing to do with me!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s smile deepened as he said, “Very well, tell me your name.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing the change in his tone, the deputy commander was inwardly delighted. <em>Did I make the right bet?</em></p> 
 <p>“My name is Tian Hai!” he excitedly reported.</p> 
 <p>“Tian Hai, right? From today, you are the commander of the Imperial Guard. In the next two weeks, you will be assisting me with fixing the troops. During this period, we won’t be participating in any palace affairs.”</p> 
 <p>After shocking the soldiers with his announcement, Bai Xiaofei took out the imperial edict, which clearly stated that he held the right to appoint and remove anyone in the Imperial Guard!</p> 
 <p>“If you have any objection, step forward and voice it. This is your last chance to withdraw, which you will get a settlement fee if you do. Otherwise, you will be required to report anything unusual that you have seen or done here. If you are honest, I will let bygones be bygones!”</p> 
 <p>It was not a complicated speech, but the hearts of the whole imperial guards were thrown into disarray. Everyone was at a loss.</p> 
 <p>By this point, the followers of the original commander could no longer sit still. They secretly took out their message props…</p> 
 <p>“If you guys continue what you’re doing, you will be punished for leaking military secrets!” Appearing in front of a person who was about to tip off the former commander, Bai Xiaofei lifted him with one hand.</p> 
 <p>No one saw clearly how he had appeared in front of the guard. The entire group of Master Rank to Exquisite Rank puppet masters were rooted to the spot in shock.</p> 
 <p><em>This kid… What is his rank?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Mas… Master… I know… I know my mistake!” Feeling death creeping near as he was choked beet-red, the soldier hurriedly admitted his wrongs.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei put him down with a snort and declared, “You all have another minute to consider. Those who decide to stay best think about what they want to say next. When it comes to certain things, those who say later might not have anything useful left to say.”</p> 
 <p>“You all understand?! You’d better confess all the stupid things you have done. You all know what your current identity means to you!” Tian Hai added.</p> 
 <p>However, it was clear that few bothered to listen to him. Bai Xiaofei shook his head. <em>Looks like it’s not just only the commander that needs to be changed!</em></p> 
 <p>“That old man still regards such a mess as a treasure. Did his age get to him?” Bai Xiaofei secretly despised the Ethereal emperor a little.</p> 
 <p>However, there were things that even the emperor didn’t know. In front of the emperor, the leader of the Imperial Guard did a good job. Moreover, he had established wide connections in the palace with painstaking efforts, therefore no one exposed his shortcomings. Over time, the Imperial Guard deteriorated to this state.</p> 
 <p>However, a cat couldn’t be bagged for long, what it lacked was only a chance to be exposed. And this chance had come, and fiercely so!</p> 
 <p>After one minute, none of the soldiers present left, but everyone’s face displayed hesitation.</p> 
 <p>“Well, time’s up. Who wants to go first?” Bai Xiaofei scanned the soldiers with a demonic smile.</p> 
 <p><em>Bastard, you want to avoid me? Then I’ll just turn you into a turtle that’ll never come out of his shell!</em></p>
