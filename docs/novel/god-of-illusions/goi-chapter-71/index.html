 <p><span style>As soon as Bai Xiaofei finished speaking, a wave of extremely clamorous noises suddenly sounded out from within the thick forest, and it seemed like an enormous army was crushing its way through!</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a time, Qin Lingyan and the others revealed expression of shock at the same time. With their understanding of the Infinite Mountain Range, it was obvious to them what this sort of clamorous noise meant!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sure enough, calamity descended after a short moment!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Extremely strong Demon Apes ran out one after the other from within the forest, and it was exceedingly obvious that their target was the two parties in battle!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Demon Apes were Brilliant Rank Magical Beasts that lived in groups, and their leader was at least at the Spiritual Rank!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go, let the Savage Class retreat first! Senior, you return to the academy to get reinforcements!” Qin Lingyan reacted at the first possible moment, and she took all the responsibility at the first possible moment. Her final sentence was spoken to He Meng because he possessed the swiftest speed amongst everyone present.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, in the next second, a scene that stunned them appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shrewd of apes actually stopped in unison after encircling everyone, and they looked fiercely at everyone just like that. Subsequently, a Demon Ape that looked much larger than the other apes walked over slowly to stand before Bai Xiaofei and lowered its head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yuan, I’m sorry for troubling you.” Bai Xiaofei smiled kindly to the leader of the Demon Apes called Yuan, and after he received the excited reply of Yuan, he then looked towards Qin Lingyan others that stood in the center.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry for shocking you, Senior Sister. Your words really moved me, thus so long as you’re willing to admit defeat, it will end here today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earlier, Qin Lingyan’s instinctive reaction was to protect everyone from the Savage Class while she stayed behind to cover their retreat. These actions of separating private from public interest was sufficient to cause anyone to feel admiration, including Bai Xiaofei….</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, the reason the shrewd of Demon Apes were willing to listen to Bai Xiaofei was because of fate that tied them together. At that time, the shrewd of Demon Apes were being pursued by two Enlightened Rank magical beasts, and Bai Xiaofei had appeared along with Huskie when the leader, Yuan, was driven into a corner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Thunder Devouring Tiger ascended the stage once more and Bai Xiaofei successfully scared the two Enlightened Rank magical beasts back, allowing him to win the good impression of the shrewd of Demon Apes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason Bai Xiaofei was willing to lend a hand was because his Fourth Mother had once told him that ape type magical beasts had always sought to repay the kindness of others, and they were the easiest for humans to communicate with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why Bai Xiaofei would take the risk to stand out when he encountered a shrewd of Demon Apes that were in danger, and now it would seem like his actions were worth it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Besides that, Huskie wasn’t with Bai Xiaofei at the beginning because he’d gone to talk with Yuan. Humans had human speech, and beasts had beast speech, so Huskie was absolutely the most qualified translator for Bai Xiaofei….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You called them over?” Qin Lingyan had a slightly strange expression, and it was impossible to discern if it was rage or something else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Exactly. After all, Senior Sister only said that teachers can’t participate, but you never mentioned magical beasts.” Bai Xiaofei grinned as his sly nature was completely revealed once again, and Qin Lingyan was cursing madly in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I didn’t say so!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But which normal person would think that you’d seek the help of magical beasts!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>You had so many magical beasts to help you, yet you fought with us for so long? Were you playing tricks on us to have fun?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Countless thoughts gushed into her mind, and Qin Lingyan couldn’t help but feel frustrated. She’d originally thought she’d come to teach Bai Xiaofei a lesson this time, but now it would seem like she’d still fallen into Bai Xiaofei’s trap….</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, who could do anything about this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei was like a box full of traps! And one after the other came out from him, so who could be on guard against them all!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Sister Lingyan, actually, the misunderstanding between us isn’t something that can’t be explained. Once I get back, I’ll immediately declare that everything that had happened in the past was done by me and me alone before apologizing. Moreover, I won’t speak a single word about what happened today. Of course, I hope that seniors can keep some things a secret for us as well.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei appeared to be extremely sincere, and even though he’d gained the upper hand, he didn’t have the intention of crushing all five of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a time, Qin Lingyan went silent, whereas, the other four looked at Qin Lingyan instead, and they silently awaited. Moreover, even He Meng was no exception.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was extremely unwilling, but it was utterly not a problem for so many Demon Apes to tire him to death. Besides that, even if he was killed and the academy wanted to investigate this matter, Bai Xiaofei wouldn’t be the one that was blamed….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But, we’ve lost this battle, right?” Everyone was stunned as soon as Qin Lingyan spoke because no one knew what these words of hers meant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Sister, you underestimated your enemies. Your impression of all of us is still stuck at a group of new students at the Apprentice Rank. But, you overlooked that we would improve. At the same time, you didn’t consider the arrangements I might make. Otherwise, even if we did improve, so long as you didn’t allow me to choose the venue of the battle, then the combat strength all of you revealed earlier isn’t something we can deal with.” Bai Xiaofei didn’t answer Qin Lingyan’s question directly, and he made an objective analysis instead. The expressions of everyone eased up slightly at the instant Bai Xiaofei finished speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a very good answer indeed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He admitted the facts yet didn’t harm the dignity of Qin Lingyan and the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t allow me to find out that you used my name to trick and mislead others again!” Qin Lingyan made a compromise with a cold voice, and the rock in everyone’s hearts was put down. Only He Meng still stared fixedly at Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike Qin Lingyan, his hatred came from being played the fool….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t have to worry about this, Senior Sister. Tricking and misleading people is something only someone that doesn’t have a stable foundation would do, but I have one now, so there’s no need to do such things any longer.” Bai Xiaofei grinned as he gazed at the members of the Savage Class in the surroundings, and all of them started smirking successively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They knew that Bai Xiaofei was talking about them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I hope you’ll remember. Let’s go!” She didn’t reveal a friendly expression to Bai Xiaofei during the entire process before she led the others to leave through the path the Demon Apes had opened up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei was utterly not worried they would play any tricks because the Demon Apes wouldn’t give them the chance at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After their figures completely vanished from their fields of vision, it was unknown who started it, but the sounds of cheering were like an infectious disease that resounded out in the entire group, causing even the Demon Apes to roar excitedly along with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Magical beasts were just so simple. After they took you to be their friends, they would be happy when you’re happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go to the infirmary?” As she looked extremely nervously at Bai Xiaofei, the thing Lin Li was thinking about still remained at Bai Xiaofei’s injuries, but what she got in return was an extremely gentle gaze from Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, my life is hard as a rock. How could a small injury like this possibly affect….” He hadn’t finished speaking when Bai Xiaofei fell straight towards the ground and directly into Lin Li’s embrace, causing him to have an intimate encounter with some pair of soft things. Unfortunately, he was unconscious at this moment….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai Xiaofei!” Lin Li exclaimed with shock at the first possible moment. But, before the members of the Savage class could even come over, a figure had instantly charged to their sides and her anxiousness wasn’t the slightest bit inferior to Lin Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me see!” The person that had arrived was precisely Xue Ying. She’d been accompanying Lei Shan at the scene during the entire battle, and she’d charged over at the first possible moment when she saw Bai Xiaofei faint.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He has lost too much blood! Stop the bleeding and prepare to return to the academy!” Xue Ying who’d always been calm had instantly become fluttered, and she only calmed down when Lei Shan’s steady voice resounded out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leave him to me.”</span></p>
