 <p>Chapter 822: Battle on the Surface!</p> 
 <p>“Youngsters, don’t forget about us oldies.”</p> 
 <p>After the Savage Class, Shaman King’s trio, who had been beaten until now, also rose.</p> 
 <p>They had originally only obeyed under the intimidation of Bai Xiaofei’s strength, but after being together for so long, they were swayed little by little – not by something unrealistic as personal charm or the warm family atmosphere. It was the Savage Class’s potential!</p> 
 <p>To put it bluntly, the three settled down in Windlove City because it was lawless and the only place in the continent that accepted them. After all, who could bear being relentlessly hunted?</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei’s group let them see the possibility of leaving the hellhole called Windlove. Therefore, they fought this battle as an investment.</p> 
 <p>They could see that Bai Xiaofei was a man with a strong purpose, but he also had his weaknesses. He would return one’s favor according to the price one paid for him. This made this battle a great opportunity for the trio. As long as they survived, they would be able to leave!</p> 
 <p>Fail to grasp this opportunity, and their old bones might be really useless soon.</p> 
 <p>“Cut the crap, old man, and say you’ve found out,” said Blood Wolf coldly. He refused to hear the word ‘oldie’ used on himself…</p> 
 <p>“Do it while you fight!” Xu Chen took the lead and rushed out, followed by Qi Wei, who had been unusually quiet. Their energy erupted into speed and they turned into two streaks, one ice-blue and one fiery red, instantly becoming a highlight of the battlefield.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Chen Hui, who was also an ice attribute, did not attack, but set his sights on Qi Wei. He knew that his ability to control elements could not compare to Lin Li. With her on the battlefield, his ice ability could at most be counted as support. Since that was the case, he might as well make his support more meaningful.</p> 
 <p>And the ability of Qi Wei’s fourth puppet was Ice Absorption!</p> 
 <p>“Icy Shock!” Chen Hui showed no intention of cherishing his origin energy. He simply used his most malicious monomer attack that had the biggest consumption.</p> 
 <p>Upon striking Qi Wei, the supposedly fatal attack turned into a tonic. The pattern on her ice armor became more intricate and even her breathing was laced with ice shards.</p> 
 <p>“Li Li, work with me!” Xu Chen shouted. Her response was the surrounding fire elements flocking toward her. Under this reinforcement, Xu Chen again stood on the same level as Qi Wei right as they were about to approach one of the ‘Ling Tianxias.’</p> 
 <p>On another side, Xing Nan, bearing almost no resemblance to his original self, had appeared beside another ‘Ling Tianxia.’ In complete contrast to everyone’s image of him, this time Xing Nan chose close combat. His enlarged black pupils occupied his whole eyes, making him look like an emotionless machine. His speed, strength, and endurance had risen to an unreasonable degree. More importantly, he was immune to physical damage!</p> 
 <p>Ling Tianxia’s sonic attack happened to be an extremely rare case of the Energy Stream that dealt physical effects. Which meant that the current Xing Nan was invincible against him!</p> 
 <p>Taking on another ‘Ling Tianxia’ was Shi Kui wielding his huge hammer. Unlike the others, he was not special. However, his hammer was…</p> 
 <p>In the class war that year, Shi Kui made his reputation with his hammer. After that, he had realized he could take a road that none other had taken.</p> 
 <p><em>They can strengthen themselves using puppets, but I can strengthen my hammer!</em></p> 
 <p>So, how special was Shi Kui’s hammer now?</p> 
 <p>When he held it, all energy attacks from opponents would be absorbed by the hammer. It then would be able to refine itself and make corresponding changes according to the absorbed energy. From physical attacks, the hammer could reflect the damage. In addition, Shi Kui was able to finely manipulate even its size after over a year of arduous practice.</p> 
 <p>The fourth ‘Ling Tianxia’ was entangled by Ming One and Ming Two. Holding their shield that had been reinforced to the violet grade and with perfected cooperation, the duo was as tough as a roach. Back in Starnet, they once sought Lei Shan to help them test, and the result was that they defended against Legend-Rank power attacks for 30 seconds, uninterrupted!</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the trio of Shaman King had engaged another ‘Ling Tianxia.’ One would think it was no different from seeking death for three Exquisite Ranks to take on a Legend Rank, but that was not the case.</p> 
 <p>Shaman King’s voice rang out in everyone’s mind.</p> 
 <p>“From these six, I feel the same energy as me. This person you know may have died and what we see is only a kind of undead power. Although I don’t know what the puppet responsible for this is, as long as it is an undead-type, it has a weakness.”</p> 
 <p>Shaman King paused as what he was disclosing was equal to baring himself, and everyone who was listening could easily use this to kill him later.</p> 
 <p>However, he still continued, because he believed that this would be counted into his contribution!</p> 
 <p>“Spiritual link. As long as the spiritual link is broken, the bodies will lose control and become useless. There are many ways to break the spiritual link. I’ll tell you only two that are most suitable for our current situation.”</p> 
 <p>“First, using energy-type area-of-effect attacks continuously. This will impact the stability of the spiritual link, and when used long enough, will break it.”</p> 
 <p>“Second, find the core of the spiritual link and destroy it, which I am doing. Believe me, I will find it soon!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, everyone smiled. <em>Already dead, huh? How can I lose against a corpse!?</em></p> 
 <p>Thanks to the guidance of Shaman King, everyone found what to focus on. However, they knew that they had to finish in ten seconds. Zhu Nuo and Duan Yiyi had acted, and the two could only guarantee their damage immunity for ten seconds!</p> 
 <p>“Luo, Xia, take the Windlove Army and leave. This place is going to become hell,” in the air, Lin Li said coldly.</p> 
 <p>She had thought that her elemental attack was restrained by Ling Tianxia, but after Shaman King’s information, she understood. While Ling Tianxia was indeed able to restrain her, the current opponent was not Ling Tianxia. Ten seconds for a full-power output was enough!</p> 
 <p>Luo and Xia released their feathers and controlled them to pull the Windlove soldiers out of the battlefield.</p> 
 <p>The next second, Lin Li’s hell descended!</p>
