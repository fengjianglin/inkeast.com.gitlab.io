 <p>Chapter 574: Calculating; Bai Xiaofei’s struggle!</p> 
 <p>The tail of the road was unexpectedly easy as there were neither magical beasts nor Shadow Death assassins. They seemed to have no further intention to pester the Starnet people. There was no movement detected all the way until they arrived at the periphery of Starnet.</p> 
 <p>“The magical beasts are gone, it seems that they don’t plan to participate further.”</p> 
 <p>Yun Jingshuang’s conclusion relieved Bai Xiaofei. The existence of Kuang Ta had always weighed on his mind, but now it looked like this imminent danger had backed down after suffering huge losses.</p> 
 <p>And this was indeed true, Kuang Ta was scared!</p> 
 <p>Luo and his King Rank Scary Demoness leader were killed, You Feng was beaten back, Yan was seriously injured, the magical beasts under him suffered enormous losses, and even his exclusive bodyguards the Hurricane Steel Elephant group was wiped out. After all, several other bosses in the Infinite Mountain Range were watching. He was afraid to lose everything if he kept fighting, and once this happened, he might just become the next Fox clan…</p> 
 <p>Moreover, Bai Xiaofei’s group had reached the vicinity of Starnet. As far as Kuang Ta was concerned, it was only a matter of time before Lei Shan was freed. Even if he killed some more humans, he definitely would not escape death once Lei Shan came out.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, he took his underlings and retreated!</p> 
 <p>Now, Kuang Ta regarded the mysterious man’s instigation as a trap, using him as cannon fodder. The best proof was the casualties on his side as well as the Starnet people’s absolute refusal to yield…</p> 
 <p>This unexpected outcome was precious to Bai Xiaofei, but even so, he did not feel one bit lighter. According to the news brought by Hong and Xing, Ling Tianxia was keeping guard near Starnet. He couldn’t make good use of Lei Shan’s information either. Among so many people present, no one had the ability to restrain Ling Tianxia’s sound skill.</p> 
 <p>In other words, Bai Xiaofei could only try to avoid confrontation with Ling Tianxia. He had a feeling that even Lan He’s group of Exquisite Ranks was no match for him!</p> 
 <p>“What do you plan to do?” asked Yun Jingshuang slowly as he looked at Bai Xiaofei, who was lost in thought. Everyone around perked up their ears. How they were going to fight this tough battle all depended on Bai Xiaofei’s decision!</p> 
 <p>“The plan remains unchanged, killing is only secondary. It’s impossible for us to wipe out all the people from Shadow Death and the Globe Merchant Group. What we have to do is break the God Sealing Formation so that our people can leave the academy to meet up with us!” Bai Xiaofei said with resolution. This resolution spread to the whole group.</p> 
 <p>“Little Brother, just tell us what to do. This old man has bowed to very few people, and you are one of them now. From now on, my life is yours!” Lan He was the first to express his stand. His words were quite weighty in this group.</p> 
 <p>“You humble me, Senior. I am but a selfish boy. Starnet has special significance to me, and everything I do is just my duty.” Bai Xiaofei was modest for once, but no one took it seriously anyway.</p> 
 <p>“How are you going to break the God Sealing Formation? If you want to try to find its matrix, I’m afraid we may not be able to persist.” Yun Jingshuang raised an unavoidable problem.</p> 
 <p>“Can you work out its location too?” Frowning, Bai Xiaofei looked at Heartseer who was squatting in a corner, a hint of expectation in his voice.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, Heartseer had to let him down.</p> 
 <p>“Sorry, I’m not omnipotent. This is not my area of expertise, so the probability of error is very high. Moreover, I’ve read about this formation in a codex in the Revelation Pavilion. As a pseudo-god formation, this thing can conceal itself. Even Master Revelation may not guarantee that he can pinpoint it.”</p> 
 <p>At Heartseer’s honest answer, everyone’s heart sank. But then he spoke again.</p> 
 <p>“But according to the codex, the requirements for accommodating this formation are very high. Not only does the area have to meet a certain terrain shape and also the shape of a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Regular_hexagon_as_intersection_of_two_triangles.png/440px-Regular_hexagon_as_intersection_of_two_triangles.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hexagram</a>, but also takes a long time to set up. Maybe you can try to find it from this aspect.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s brows creased even more in consideration. After a long time, his expression suddenly froze.</p> 
 <p><em>Long time to set up…</em></p> 
 <p>“You thought of something useful?” asked Yun Jingshuang upon noticing Bai Xiaofei’s expression change.</p> 
 <p>Everyone immediately paid attention, while in Bai Xiaofei’s eyes there was hesitation and pain that they couldn’t understand.</p> 
 <p>“I may know where the formation base is…” he slowly uttered, once again adding wood to the fire of hope in their hearts.</p> 
 <p>“Really?!” Yun Jingshuang couldn’t help but exclaim, but he quickly collected his emotions. Walls had ears. He had been keeping check on the surroundings, but who could guarantee that no one could bypass his Celestial Eye?</p> 
 <p>“Look at this.” Picking up a branch, Bai Xiaofei swept out a clear patch on the ground and started to draw. “This is the square layout. There are actually many spots that meet the said conditions, but taking into account the aspect of a hexagram, we can rule out quite a few.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei simply marked the starting points for the hexagram on the schematic diagram of Starnet Square, then looked at everyone.</p> 
 <p>“If I had to choose one of these points, I would choose this one.” Pointing to the area connecting the square to the main entrance, Bai Xiaofei’s eyes sparkled with confidence. “The matrix base will definitely be protected by the enemy, and there is no guard that’s more reliable than Ling Tianxia himself. According to the position of the hexagram, the remaining eleven points should be arranged like this.”</p> 
 <p>Starting from Ling Tianxia’s location, Bai Xiaofei quickly drew a big hexagram. Everyone looked at the simple drawing and gulped. Only Heartseer frowned.</p> 
 <p>“Although this seems reliable, have you ever thought about the possibility of a false matrix? As long as one of the twelve points remains unbroken, the Sealing God Formation can continue operating as normal. Ling Tianxia is very likely to use this as a cover and trick us into thinking that he is guarding the final point, making us overlook the real one and luring us to die at the same time. If you don’t have a more convincing reason, this is no different than a gamble.”</p> 
 <p>Heartseer’s reminder poured cold water on everyone’s heart.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei wasn’t surprised by this question, but the struggle on his face showed that he was not very willing to answer it.</p> 
 <p>However, it was impossible not to answer.</p> 
 <p>“You said it takes a long time to prepare the formation, which means the person who prepared it cannot be an outsider. In other words, there is a mole in Starnet, one with a high degree of freedom at that.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei paused, and the struggle on his face became agony.</p> 
 <p>“I think… I know who this mole is…”</p>
