 <p>Chapter 391: Cut-off Clue and the Mystery Man’s Visit!</p> 
 <p>Looking at the incomplete corpse on the ground, Bai Xiaofei’s face couldn’t be uglier. The duck that was right at his mouth about to be eaten was blown up like this, yet he still had no clue on who caused it. He had really taken a huge loss!</p> 
 <p>“Don’t feel bad, there will be more opportunities…” Qin Lingyan came over and comforted when she saw Bai Xiaofei’s expression, but unexpectedly, he smiled.</p> 
 <p>“Bad? Why would I feel bad? Now this is interesting, isn’t it? Our trip would be for nothing if the opponent is too weak.” He didn’t sound convincing at all, saying that between gritted teeth.</p> 
 <p>Qin Lingyan didn’t say anything more. Words were useless at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go back and see if there are any gains on the merchant group’s side.” This was Bai Xiaofei’s only expectation left at present, even if he knew that it might end up undesirable…</p> 
 <p>Sure enough, when they returned, Shang Youdao was waiting anxiously with a heavy expression. It didn’t look like there was any good news at all. And his face sank even more when he saw that Bai Xiaofei’s group came back empty-handed.</p> 
 <p>“Didn’t catch up?” Shang Youdao asked, disappointment written on his face.</p> 
 <p>“We caught up and captured them. They even admitted that they belonged to the Thunderstorm Bandits.” Upon Bai Xiaofei’s words, the disappointment on Shang Youdao’s face instantly turned into delight.</p> 
 <p>“And then? Why didn’t you bring them back?”</p> 
 <p>“But they were merely abandoned chess pieces. Someone came out of nowhere and killed them before I could get any useful information.”</p> 
 <p>These words sent Shang Youdao’s mood on a sharp drop.</p> 
 <p>“Our side is even worse. Although I arranged rescue for those groups, I still didn’t get anything either. The other party was too strong. Most died in vain.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s arrangement was actually perfect, they couldn’t have expected that the opponent would choose to kill their own people to silence them…</p> 
 <p>“Although there is no gain, we can be certain that there are no moles in your merchant group, or else they wouldn’t be exposed today.”</p> 
 <p>Despite the clue being silenced in the end, it was undeniable that the Thunderstorm Bandits were threatened in today’s battle. If that captain’s mouth had been faster, the situation wouldn’t be like this now.</p> 
 <p>“Even so, I still have my reservations. After all, we can never be too careful.” Shang Youdao still persisted in the possibility of a mole. This was a habit he had developed in the many years of doing business.</p> 
 <p>“I’m just saying. I can’t change what you want to think.” Bai Xiaofei shrugged and made no further comment.</p> 
 <p>“What are we going to do next?” Glossing over the topic, Shang Youdao asked the questions he cared most about.</p> 
 <p>“Are you in a hurry? Does this thing need to be sold within a certain time?” Bai Xiaofei asked back.</p> 
 <p>Shang Youdao was stunned. “No…”</p> 
 <p>“Then you should calm down. The Thunderstorm Bandits just wish that you’d hurry up and send it out of the city. Why do you want to satisfy them? The body count so far isn’t enough for you?”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Shang Youdao fell silent. Indeed, he had been a little too urgent.</p> 
 <p>“During this period, try to relax. It’s useless to worry about something like this. As for those who are here for the mission, think of something to calm them down, like giving them money or a reasonable explanation or something. Don’t let them cause a ruckus, or we’ll have more troubles.” After giving Shang Youdao a reminder, Bai Xiaofei turned to leave. But halfway through, he suddenly looked back. “By the way, President Shang, although it’s very unlikely you will answer, I still want to ask. Can you tell me what that item is?”</p> 
 <p>Shang Youdao’s face tensed and he chose silence.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, I will know sooner or later.”</p> 
 <p>Leaving behind the Shang Youdao who couldn’t come up with a reply, Bai Xiaofei’s group left his room.</p> 
 <p>“So our clues are cut off,” Qin Lingyan suddenly said along the way. The other three couldn’t help but look at Bai Xiaofei. What they wanted to hear most at this moment was something positive.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, cut off, and completely at that. I can’t even find a point to start at now,” Bai Xiaofei’s answer immediately silenced them. False hope it was…</p> 
 <p>“Then, we really have to wait?” Qin Lingyan frowned.</p> 
 <p>“Yeah. What else can we do besides wait? Now we see who can hold their breath longer. Anyway, we are here for the mission. Whatever the end result is, it has no effect on our interest. Shang Youdao can wait, why can’t we?”</p> 
 <p>In the face of the suddenly calm and carefree Bai Xiaofei, Qin Lingyan was at a loss for words. Different from him, she wanted to complete the mission as soon as possible.</p> 
 <p>As for the other three, it didn’t matter to them. They would be happy to finish this quickly, but it also seemed like a good idea to hang out in the city longer as a perfectly justifiable excuse to be lazy. Starnet was only so big and they already knew every corner, while Nabu City was a completely new world to them.</p> 
 <p>“But…”</p> 
 <p>“There’s no but. Don’t be in such a hurry. This is a rare chance we get to come out, so let yourself relax. Don’t you girls like shopping? Although Ancient Yue is only a small kingdom, this Nabu city shouldn’t be inferior to even Starnet’s commercial districts, right?” Bai Xiaofei interrupted Qin Lingyan with a smile, then turned to Bai Ye. “Senior, I’ll leave this arduous task to you! You must do your best to accompany our Big Sis Lingyan.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s bold words earned strange looks from Chu Yue and Zhao Tiantian, but the looks were directed at Bai Ye and Qin Lingyan.</p> 
 <p>“Okay! I shall complete this task!” Bai Ye responded with a foolish smile, but it didn’t last for two seconds before a cold glance from Qin Lingyan scared it out of him.</p> 
 <p>Seeing that the atmosphere was growing weird, Bai Xiaofei hurriedly made an excuse to flee the danger zone. Chu Yue and Zhao Tiantian wisely followed, leaving Bai Ye to be the only victim.</p> 
 <p>“If you don’t want me to tell everyone about your affairs, know your place. There is absolutely no possibility between the two of us!” spoke Qin Lingyan coldly after everyone else left, but Bai Ye seemed to have long been accustomed to her threat.</p> 
 <p>“It’s normal for friends to go shopping together, right? Didn’t you say you wanted to fix my mindset? Now is a good chance!” Bai Ye chuckled. He finally learned the art of being thick-skinned from Bai Xiaofei…</p> 
 <p>While these two were arguing, an absolutely unexpected guest found Bai Xiaofei. It was the mysterious man who had followed Third Prince Gu Li!</p> 
 <p>“Mind if we have a talk?”</p>
