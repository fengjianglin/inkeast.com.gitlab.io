 <p>If one asked Bai Xiaofei what was the best thing to do in life, the answer he would give right now was sleeping! One would never know how precious sleep was without first experiencing sleeplessness. After staying in the illusionary realm for an entire day, he was completely exhausted by the time he left, and when he saw the pitch-black sky of the outside world, an intense feeling of sleepiness assaulted him.</p>
 <p>Thus, he slept until noon the next day. His roommates weren’t any better off, and each of them slept soundly like a pig. Therefore, when Bai Xiaofei woke up, everyone else in his room was still sleeping.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had yet to fully open his eyes when Fang Ye’s exasperated voice rang out, “Big Brother Fei! Big Brother Fei!”</p>
 <p>Then, the door of dorm room 807 was harshly pushed open, and Fang Ye and Wang Hang charged inside.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei looked at Fang Ye and drowsily asked, “What’s going on? Why are you shouting?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The principal is looking for you!”</p>
 <p>There was no denying the weight behind this seemingly simple announcement. Bai Xiaofei, however, merely gave an indifferent groan in response.</p>
 <p>“Oh, it’s grandpa? It’s not like this is my first time meeting him. What’s the rush? I will go later. Is that fine?” Bai Xiaofei spoke unhurriedly as he started to leisurely put on his clothes.</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Fei, it’s not the same this time. Apart from the principal, the three vice principals are also there! Your master is there as well!” Fang Ye said, anxiety written all over his face. It was obvious that Lei Shan was looking for Bai Xiaofei for a different reason this time. This lineup was sufficient to scare a majority of Starnet Academy people into wetting their pants. Therefore, Fang Ye was already handling this very well by only just shouting.</p>
 <p>“Shit! Is Vice Principal Luo there as well?” Bai Xiaofei totally ignored the other names, but if Luo Xi was there as well, he had to treat it differently. The contrast in his attitude before and after realizing Luo Xi was there was very clear. Like a fully powered robot, he was fully dressed in the span of two breaths. He then rushed out.</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Fei, they are in our classroom!” Fang Ye’s shout came from behind, and Bai Xiaofei waved his hand in acknowledgement before vanishing from Fang Ye’s sight.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had no choice but to act this way. In this world, every single thing had its own weakness. In Bai Xiaofei’s case, his weakness was Luo Xi. He travelled so fast that he took only five minutes to cover a distance he would normally need twenty minutes to travel.</p>
 <p>When he reached the classroom, the lineup shocked him yet again. Apart from the Savage Class students who were still in dorm room 807, all the other Savage Class students were standing here. All of them looked nervously at him.</p>
 <p>He swallowed and asked meekly, “Did I oversleep and miss something? Why is everyone so serious?” His brain worked hard trying to recall if he had recently done anything wrong.</p>
 <p><em>I can’t think of anything! I’ve been a good boy!</em></p>
 <p>“I don’t know what’s going on, but the principal and them have unnatural expressions. Be obedient when you enter the classroom. Don’t act like you normally do.” Xue Ying walked towards Bai Xiaofei, solemnly reminding him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei rearranged his facial expression then nodded. Next, he walked to the door, took a deep breath, and slowly placed his hand against it. The instant he pushed it open, he felt several gazes as sharp as a sword land on him. He gulped instinctively before looking into the room.</p>
 <p>It was as Fang Ye had said. Lei Shan, Chu Qingtian, Jing Chen, and Luo Xi – the academy’s four big shots – were present. As for Revelation, he was leaning at a certain corner of the room, seemingly without the intent to say anything.</p>
 <p><em>F*ck! This geezer is as unreliable as usual!</em></p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei inwardly cursed and slowly walked towards Lei Shan.</p>
 <p>“Grandpa, I haven’t done anything wrong recently. Is there a need to gather such a lineup before summoning me here?” Bai Xiaofei asked meekly. He seemed to have completely forgotten Xue Ying’s words, and the instant he opened his mouth, he started speaking in a crafty manner like usual. Indeed, a person’s nature was something hard to change.</p>
 <p>Lei Shan wasn’t the one to answer. Rather, it was Jing Cheng, who was standing beside the principal, who answered. He spoke with a frosty tone, a tone as cold as the temperature of an ice room. “You’re Bai Xiaofei?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, it’s me,” Bai Xiaofei answered as he met Jing Cheng’s gaze. Although he was a cautious person by nature, he was no coward. He had no fear since he had done nothing wrong!</p>
 <p>“I have a few questions for you. Answer honestly.” Jing Cheng didn’t seem surprised at Bai Xiaofei’s reaction. It was as if he had seen this coming.</p>
 <p>“Sure. But I won’t tell you anything too private.” Bai Xiaofei suddenly recalled his relationship with Hu Xian’er. If they were going to interrogate him about her, he wouldn’t tell them anything even if he had to die. As far as he was concerned, it was fine for him to know Hu Xian’er’s identity. However, if others found out about her, it would be hard for her to leave this place alive, let alone stay in Starnet Academy.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei knew that Hu Xian’er didn’t have any sinister plans for coming here. Even so, her life would still be in danger if her identity was revealed.</p>
 <p>“You have the right to not answer any question, but I hope you realize that not answering certain questions will affect our opinion of you,” Jing Cheng reminded. He then continued, “Although we don’t care about the background of our students at Starnet Academy, I really want to know one thing. Where do you come from?”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was slightly alarmed when he heard this question. He glanced over at Revelation, who was leaning against the corner of the room. Revelation was the one who had told him not to tell anyone about his origins. So should he tell? For the first time in his life, Bai Xiaofei fell into a dilemma.</p>
 <p>“There are no outsiders here. Just answer whatever they ask.” Revelation still decided to give Bai Xiaofei a hint when required.</p>
 <p>“Gorge of Heroes.” Bai Xiaofei answered without hesitation.</p>
 <p>“Do you have any proof?” Jing Cheng continued his line of questioning, wearing an extremely stern expression.</p>
 <p>“I know everything about the Gorge of Heroes, and I also know the names of all the important people there. Is this enough proof?” Bai Xiaofei answered with neither a change in his expression nor emotion. He had never been so confident before, and his answer slightly stunned Jing Cheng when Jing Cheng heard it.</p>
 <p>This was indeed the easiest way to prove Bai Xiaofei’s identity, but Jing Cheng had no way of verifying the information.</p>
 <p>“You can move on to the next question. He’s not lying,” Luo Xi remarked behind Jing Cheng, who then nodded and continued.</p>
 <p>He said, “Next question. Have you seen any strange people around who aren’t from our academy after you joined? In particular, those with mysterious whereabouts?”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei couldn’t understand Jing Cheng’s question, and in his confusion, his gaze landed on Revelation.</p>
 <p>“Does my master count? He’s the person with the most mysterious whereabouts among those I’ve met.”</p>
 <p>Revelation nearly fell on the floor when he heard this question. He coughed awkwardly before once again leaning against the wall and resuming his wallpaper act.</p>
 <p>“Nope.” Jing Cheng’s expression shifted. A slight displeasure was starting to creep onto his face.</p>
 <p>“I can’t think of anyone else, then. Everyone else I’ve met is a member of Starnet Academy.” Bai Xiaofei shrugged. Once again, Jing Cheng’s question failed to achieve anything.</p>
 <p>“One last question. As an Illusion Stream puppet master, how have you learned the ruthless melee combat technique you have been using? Who taught you?” He finally asked the main question, once again stunning Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p><em>What the hell is he trying to do?</em></p>
