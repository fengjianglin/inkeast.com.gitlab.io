 <p>Chapter 516: Be Yourself!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t know how long he was in a daze for, but by the time he returned to his senses, he had understood what Yun Jingshuang said.</p> 
 <p>When he wanted to thank Yun Jingshuang, he found that the guy had already left without him knowing. Looking at the spot where Yun Jingshuang had been sitting, there were three words written in nearly-dried tea water – Follow your heart.</p> 
 <p>“Good one, Yun Jingshuang. You’re actually a love expert now.” Bai Xiaofei smiled wryly and stood up. The haze over his heart had been cleared away and was replaced by a long-lost relaxed feeling.</p> 
 <p><em>Indeed, I was overthinking to the extent that I forgot my true heart. Let’s listen to this ‘love expert’ once!</em></p> 
 <p>Sometimes, one’s confusion could be so bad that if they weren’t courageous enough to take that one step to free themselves, they’d be completely wasted. Fortunately, Bai Xiaofei took that step!</p> 
 <p>Having decided to abolish the idea of evading the problem, Bai Xiaofei left the Blossom Pavilion. Outside, it was already dark and the moon hanging high in the sky was telling Bai Xiaofei that he had delayed for too long.</p> 
 <p>Now was the time that he seized every moment!</p> 
 <p>He still had little clues about Bai Longfei’s matter while his Illusion Demon Merchant Group was waiting to be fed, plus the grand celebration plan was around the corner while he was still unsure about his own future path…</p> 
 <p>At this juncture of important events, how could he struggle with something that shouldn’t have been a problem in the first place? He had handicapped himself. But fortunately, he could still undo it. Although he couldn’t adjust his mentality right away, he managed to regain control of himself and his general direction, which was the most difficult and valuable thing.</p> 
 <p>Returning to the Demon of Illusions with a revitalized heart, Bai Xiaofei didn’t see anyone waiting for him anxiously like he had expected. Sure enough, he was the only one who really overthought. Whether it was Hu Xian’er, Chu Liuyun, or the Leng sisters, they all regarded Bai Xiaofei being out handling his business as a normal thing.</p> 
 <p>Laughing at his own naivete, Bai Xiaofei returned to his room, where he sorted through the matters at hand before falling asleep…</p> 
 <p>“Lazy pig, get up!”</p> 
 <p>With a bang, the door was kicked open and Bai Xiaofei sprang up from his beautiful dream. Seeing a smug Leng Liuying, he gulped with difficulty.</p> 
 <p>“I… I’m up! What do you want?!”</p> 
 <p>Looking at Bai Xiaofei clutching the blanket with the expression of a damsel in distress, Leng Liuying’s eyes grew sharp and she suddenly felt playful.</p> 
 <p>“This lady wants to take advantage of you today!”</p> 
 <p>Leng Liuying then rushed to the bed and jerked on the blanket, but how could her strength be compared with Bai Xiaofei? Her surprise move didn’t succeed. However, Bai Xiaofei who was gripping it too tightly, staggered and fell from the bed towards Leng Liuying…</p> 
 <p>With a loud thud, Leng Liuying fell on the ground with Bai Xiaofei on her.</p> 
 <p>The roles were now reversed, and Bai Xiaofei who had gained the upper hand revealed an evil smile.</p> 
 <p>“Take advantage of me, is it? Since this lord is in a good mood today, I will cooperate with you!” as he said that, he pounced like a hungry wolf.</p> 
 <p>Tragic screams echoed, but no one cared since this kind of thing wasn’t uncommon in the Demon of Illusions, especially when the voice belonged to Leng Liuying…</p> 
 <p>“What’s taking Liuying so long?” Setting the last dish on the table, Leng Liushuang voiced her confusion.</p> 
 <p>“Who knows, maybe she’s entangled by that pervert. After all, this kind of thing has happened more than once before.” Leng Liuli understood her own sister and Bai Xiaofei quite well, hitting the nail on the head as usual.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Leng Liushuang instantly blushed. She had called Bai Xiaofei up several times as well, and not once was she not taken advantage of. Bai Xiaofei really just couldn’t help it when he heard her soft and fragile voice… The worst of it was one time when she almost let him reach home base. In the end, she had no choice but to become the second person after Leng Liuli to meet Bai Xiaofei’s unreasonable demands.</p> 
 <p>And the feeling was still vivid in Leng Liushuang’s memory. Not a very comfortable one…</p> 
 <p>After who knew how long, when they couldn’t wait and had already been through half of the meal, Leng Liuying and Bai Xiaofei finally appeared. Different from usual, Bai Xiaofei was the one with his head held high while Leng Liuying was the one wearing resentment on her face.</p> 
 <p>Moreover, Chu Liuyun’s sharp eyes spotted a red mark behind Leng Liuying’s collar… It seemed that the process of waking up this time had been quite intense!</p> 
 <p>“Did you bully Sister Liuying?” Hu Xian’er shot Bai Xiaofei a glare that contained a hint of bitterness after he sat down. The number of times he came to see her had obviously decreased recently …</p> 
 <p>“No, she bullied me. Ask her if you don’t believe me!” Bai Xiaofei smoothly threw the ball to Leng Liuying. Everyone’s eyes instinctively gathered on her and she instantly panicked.</p> 
 <p>“It’s… it’s the same as before! I taught him a lesson, so it took a little longer!” yelped Leng Liuying nervously as she hurriedly picked up her chopsticks. “Let’s eat! Now that the lazy pig’s finally here, let’s hurry and eat!”</p> 
 <p>Leng Liuying was about to clip some vegetables, but her chopsticks stopped in mid-air. Seeing the food on the table, she really didn’t have any appetite. Especially that milky white soup, just one look at it gave her a feeling of nausea…</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter, Liuying? Isn’t this your favorite soup? Have a taste!” Leng Liuli seemed to have guessed something. She picked up Leng Liuying’s bowl and filled it with the soup, then placed it in front of her.</p> 
 <p>“No, no, I’m a little queasy today. Big Sis, don’t you like this soup too? You have it,” Leng Liuying refused and pushed the bowl towards Leng Liuli.</p> 
 <p>“I stopped drinking this a long time ago. You take care of it.”</p> 
 <p>The soup bowl was pushed back. Swallowing several mouthfuls of saliva, Leng Liuying looked at Leng Liushuang for help.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t drink this either. If it wasn’t that you guys love it, I wouldn’t have made any…”</p> 
 <p>Leng Liushuang revealed a difficult expression, and a soup once loved by the triplets was ruthlessly forsaken… Glancing at each other, Leng Liushuang’s face instantly turned red while Leng Liuying lowered her head. <em>It’s over, everyone knows now…</em></p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Leng Liuli rolled her eyes at Bai Xiaofei. <em>Look, it’s all your fault!!!</em></p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, Bai Xiaofei was immune to this kind of eye-roll. ‘Shame’ and any related words didn’t exist in his dictionary!</p> 
 <p>“What’s the big deal? You will still drink this soup in the future anyway,” he said and raised his eyebrows with an implied meaning at the triplets…</p>
