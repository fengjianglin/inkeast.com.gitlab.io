 <p><span style>After he took Bai Xiaofei from her and raised up Bai Xiaofei’s uniform that had been dyed red with blood since a long time ago, an arc of lightning appeared on Lei Shan’s index finger before he swiped it down lightly, causing the injury to instantly heal up under the effects of the lightning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Subsequently, a golden medicinal pill appeared in Lei Shan’s hand, and Bai Xiaofei’s pale countenance swiftly turned rosy at a speed visible to the eye once he fed the medicine to Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The nearby Xue Ying and the others were dumbstruck because the perception of everyone in the outside world towards Lei Shan was the mighty and awe-inspiring Thunder Emperor, but they never imagined that he would actually be able to play the role of combat medic!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, all that’s left to do is wake him up.” As he muttered to himself, Lei Shan’s entire palm was covered in arcs of lightning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The process might be slightly intense, but I know that you won’t care about these details, stinking kid.” His voice hadn’t finished resounding out in the air when Lei Shan had already pressed his palm onto Bai Xiaofei’s chest. In the next second, Bai Xiaofei’s entire unconscious body started convulsing madly, and even though it was merely for around three seconds, everyone nearby still gulped down a mouthful of saliva from this scene.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It really is intense….</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is it!?” Bai Xiaofei who was still convulsing opened his eyes abruptly, and when he saw Lei Shan’s face from up close, his entire body trembled before he fell down onto the ground with a thump.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa, why didn’t you catch me!?” Bai Xiaofei rubbed his backside while he got up from the ground, and he’d completely forgotten that he’d just taken a circle around the gates of hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You did well.” Lei Shan revealed an amiable smile, and Lei Shan’s ability to change the topic was something he could take pride in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s the use of just talk? Why don’t you give me some actual rewards? Maybe a violetgold-grade puppet, a high level medicinal pill. Don’t worry, I’ll absolutely not say it’s too much.” Bai Xiaofei demanded an exorbitant amount as he would absolutely not let any chances of benefitting slip by.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Lei Shan wasn’t a rich man and had entirely no intention of falling into Bai Xiaofei’s trap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m just a poor old man, and I don’t have any of the things you spoke of. But, if all of you are able to obtain good results in the test for new students, then I can utilize some power I have.” Lei Shan laughed and talked his way out of it by drawing out a great pie for Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miser. But, I’ll remember these words of yours. You better not act shamelessly when the time comes, otherwise, I’ll go all around complaining about you, and I’ll absolutely allow the entirety of Starnet Academy to know of Grandpa’s ugly side!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the entire Starnet Academy, it was probably only Bai Xiaofei who dared to threaten Lei Shan….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a deal.” Lei Shan replied once more and could be considered to have settled a ‘worry’ of Bai Xiaofei’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you did very well today, and you allowed me to see a different Savage Class. I hope your display two months from now will be even better, and I really anticipate the arrival of that day!” As he turned around to look at the other, a simple sentence from Lei Shan caused everyone to become excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the affirmation of the principal!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, countless people weren’t even able to speak a single word to the principal after studying all four years in the academy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, it was also because of this excitement that none of them actually stood out and replied….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, it’s getting late and all of you should get back because you still have to take a Collective Class tomorrow. All of you have owed quite a bit of classes during this month, and if you’re unable to complete the entire curriculum, you won’t be able to participate in the final test for new students.” Lei Shan grinned before walking over to Xue Ying’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really didn’t misjudge you. Even though you’re very special, I have to admit that you’ve succeeded this time, and you’ve created a miracle.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Ying really enjoyed Lei Shan’s praise, and she revealed a rare obedient expression as she slightly lowered her head towards Lei Shan. “Everything would be empty talk without your permission, principal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey! Hey! Hey! Can both of you stop exchanging pleasantries? Grandpa has already allowed us to return, yet you’re waiting to feed us to the wolves!?” After he bid his farewells to the leader of the Demon Apes, Bai Xiaofei instantly became impatient because he just wanted to have a nice nap at this moment….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh no! Oh no! I’ve been asked to leave. Students, see you again!” Amidst roaring laughter that was accompanied by a flash of lightning, Lei Shan’s figure vanished instantaneously, and this simple ability he revealed shocked everyone present here once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you stupid!? Are you!? Do you know how difficult it is to speak to the principal!? Yet you asked him to leave!? Why don’t you f*ck off!!?” Xue Ying slapped Bai Xiaofei’s head over and over again, and her ‘furious’ appearance caused everyone in the Savage Class to cheer and laugh. On the other hand, Bai Xiaofei who was the ‘victim’ cursed out for not choosing his friends carefully before fleeing decisively….</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a silent night. After everything had ended, everyone from the Savage Class laid back down onto their long lost beds and felt as if it had been ages, and then all of them fell into a deep slumber and slept like logs….</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were too tired!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sun rose as usual on the second day, whereas, Bai Xiaofei who was used to sleeping in had actually changed this bad habit during the past month, and he’d successfully turned the tides around to become the first person to wake up in the room, allowing him to enjoy the ‘joys’ of waking the others up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Fei, you should sleep for a while longer and please don’t wake us up again….” Mo Ka walked on the path towards the class with a lingering fear in his heart, and his mind was still filled with the terrifying face Huskie had transformed into in the morning. No matter how hard he tried, he was unable to drive out that face from his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The nearby Shi Kui and Wu Chi nodded resolutely and displayed their agreement at the first possible moment because their experience was exactly similar to Mo Ka….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Based on your courage, that month in the Infinite Mountain Range was a waste.” Bai Xiaofei spoke with disdain and displayed his contempt towards them, whereas, Mo Ka and the other didn’t dare arouse the intention to resist in the slightest. It wasn’t that they didn’t dare but they knew their retaliation would only delight Bai Xiaofei, and the outcome would be horrible!</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, even though these little ones were bitter in their hearts, they couldn’t speak of it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although they weren’t very late, they’d still missed breakfast, and they noticed they were the last to arrive when they rushed over swiftly to the classroom….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your breakfast.” Bai Xiaofei had just sat down when Lin Li instantly passed over a lunch box made from love, and it caused Mo Ka and the others to drool.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t have girls, but I have three boxes of food. Do all of you want it or not?” Fang Ye who seemed like a savior appeared, and Mo Ka and the others instantly shot over gazes of absolute obedience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Ye, I knew that you’d always be our best logistics team leader!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t have the chance to say anything further because he noticed the boxes of food in his hand had already been seized away by those three hungry wolves, and the nearby Qi Wei and the other girls rocked backward and forwards with laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone stop what you’re doing and converge outside!” The four of them had just taken two mouthfuls when a familiar voice sounded out from outside the entrance, and everyone reacted at the first possible moment because this was a habit they’d developed in the past month.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re going to have a collective class this morning. Simply speaking, it’s an exchange with the other nine classes. But, this sort of exchange relies on your fists. So, do all of you understand what I mean?” Xue Ying’s voice was cold as she swept everyone with her faze, and then she saw numerous faces with sinister smiles on them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Sister Xue, how badly should we beat them?” Xing Nan rubbed his hands together as he asked with anticipation….</span></p>
