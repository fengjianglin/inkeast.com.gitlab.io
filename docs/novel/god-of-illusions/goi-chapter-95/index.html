 <p><span style>After striding into the Ethereal Pavilion, Bai Xiaofei who’d come here for the first time was stunned on the spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When looked at from the outside, the Ethereal Pavilion was just huge, but he never had he imagined that the decoration within it would be so luxurious!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everywhere that met the eye was glittering with jade and gold, and the walls and pillars had fine carvings that were obviously done by great masters at first glance. Moreover, all the counters were crafted from Goldvein Zhennan wood. Under the illumination of Origin Stone ceiling lamps at the top of the hall that had no dead angles, there wasn’t a single place in the hall that wasn’t sparkling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, it wasn’t just the building that caused one to exclaim with admiration, even the workers in the Ethereal Pavilion were dressed luxuriously. Unlike other small stores, they didn’t hire students of the academy here, and every single one of them had been trained by the Ethereal Pavilion itself, causing their dressing, movements, tone, expressions, and everything else to seem as if it was cloned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were at least a few hundred students moving about in the hall on the first floor, but it didn’t seem crowded at all, causing the vastness of the Ethereal Pavilion to be displayed vividly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, land was like gold in Starnet Academy, and even a tiny store was sufficient to cause Fang Ye’s clan, the Brightmoon Merchant Group, to exhaust a great deal of resources.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, the wealth of the Ethereal Pavilion wasn’t just talk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s really shocking right? I felt the same way when I came here for the first time as well. Sometimes, if you don’t come out to see the world, you would really not know how wonderful this world is.” Xue Ying’s voice sounded out by Bai Xiaofei’s side, and it drew back Bai Xiaofei’s wandering soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This Ethereal Pavilion belongs to the academy?” Bai Xiaofei gulped down a mouthful of saliva while his voice carried a trace of yearning. But, he could only feel yearning for now because besides feeling despair and powerless towards this, Bai Xiaofei’s current financial strength was incapable of doing anything. Even if there was a thousand more Blossom Rankings to help him bring in wealth, it would be utterly useless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The academy wishes it was theirs as well. But, the academy really doesn’t have that strength, nor does it have that much spare money to be used on this.” Xue Ying paused for a moment before she continued. “The Ethereal Pavilion has chain stores all over the north of the continent. Supposedly, the Ethereal Pavilion in Starnet Academy is considered to be on the small-scale, and in terms of the Ethereal Pavilion as a whole, what you’re seeing is only a single hair on the back of an ox.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But, this is normal. After all, standing behind the Ethereal Pavilion is the Ethereal Empire, and it’s a formidable empire that’s renowned amongst the empires on the continent for its technique in crafting puppets. If they weren’t rich, then I really don’t know who would be rich.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as she finished speaking, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but be stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew of the Ethereal Empire because he’d been taking classes on the history of the continent for almost a month after all. So no matter how slacked off during class, it wouldn’t be to the point of not knowing this empire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Infinite Mountain Range separated Starnet Continent into a northern and southern part, whereas, there was only the Violethorn Empire, Ethereal Empire, Cloudveil Empire, and Moonlight Empire amongst the kingdoms that could be called empires in the north. Moreover, each of them had their own distinguishing characteristics.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moonlight was renowned in treatment, Violethorn possessed supreme strength, Cloudveil was the richest in ores, and the Ethereal was a kingdom of puppet crafting. Basically 80% of all the outstanding Puppetsmiths in the continent were in the Ethereal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go. Stop being shocked, we still have to get all of your abilities in puppet control tested because you never know if some of you are really unable to control a second puppet.” Xue Ying interrupted Bai Xiaofei’s shock and led the group towards a corner of the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, even though it was said to be a corner, it was actually an area that was swarming with people as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher Xue Ying! You brought students to get tested as well?!” All of them had just walked over to the testing area when a pleasantly surprised voice of a man instantly sounded out, and then Bai Xiaofei and the others saw a man in glasses who had a gentle expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Tianhua, a head teacher of a new student class just like Xue Ying, and he was an Energy Stream puppet master that had been pursuing Xue Ying endlessly for an entire month.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, Xue Ying had no interest in him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, even though she had no interest in him, she still had to observe basic courtesy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good morning Teacher Huang, I’m sorry but our Big Sister Xue’s throat isn’t well lately, so it’s inconvenient for her to talk with you.” Before Xue Ying whose face was covered in refusal spoke, Bai Xiaofei took a step word and fervently stopped Huang Tianhua. Bai Xiaofei knew very clearly about what Huang Tianhua had come for, so he naturally wouldn’t allow Huang Tianhua to get close.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Bai Xiaofei’s reaction caused Xue Ying to feel extremely comfortable, and a trace of a smile appeared imperceptibly on the corners of her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaofei, I heard you caused a great commotion lately. Sure enough, heroes start from a young age. I can’t compare to you when I was your age.” As he smiled embarrassedly, Huang Tianhua who’d been stopped by Bai Xiaofei was rather polite to him, whereas, the students behind Huang Tianhua were extremely excited upon noticing Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Bai! Boss Fang!” Four new students that Bai Xiaofei didn’t know ran over instantly before greeting them excitedly. To the new students, he and Fang Ye had already become legendary existences, and it was simply like a type of honor to be able to talk with Bai Xiaofei and Fang Ye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did both of you come to choose puppets as well!? Our members are at the front, we’ll ask them to give you their spots!” The new students spoke excitedly while the nearby Huang Tianhua’s face had already turned dark.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Not only does Xue Ying disregard me, what’s the meaning of these little kid’s actions? Could it be that this kid is even more important than your head teacher? </span></i><span style>Huang Tianhua gritted his teeth and blames Bai Xiaofei for this as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no need, there’s no need. We’ll just line up slowly.” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly waved his hand. Bai Xiaofei was since this time because truthfully speaking, he’d established the New Student Mutual Aid Community at that time entirely for the sake of earning money. At the very most, it would also be for the sake of gaining popularity for himself. But, he never expected that the popularity he gathered would be a little too much….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Simply speaking, Bai Xiaofei wasn’t the slightest bit prepared to be the boss of so many people….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That won’t do! How could we make our Boss line up!?” The student in the lead spoke before immediately running over to the front with his fellow classmates and roared. “Boss Bai has come to test himself, are there any brothers in the front that will give their spot to Boss Bai!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei didn’t even have the chance to stop him before the student’s voice had spread out, and it caused everyone to instinctively turn around and look over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, there was at least a third of the people in the long line that surrounded over towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the f*ck! It’s really Boss Bai!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Fang is here as well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve finally seen them in the flesh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, give me a signature!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, please take me under your wing!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>Various sounds of excitement resounded out, causing the test area that wasn’t so quiet before to instantly become like a market.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you f*cking quiet down!!! Do you think this is your home!!?” A deep voice resounded out and instantly suppressed the voices of everyone, causing the originally clamorous test area to become perfectly silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Subsequently, a third year student that had a physique that was almost like an Earth Dire Bear walked over, and the symbol of the Gods Amongst Men on his chest displayed his identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“New student, I’ve heard about you. You’re Bai Xiaofei, right? Let me give you a piece of advice, don’t be too arrogant because those pieces of trash you encountered earlier can’t represent everyone in the higher years. Do you understand what I mean?” The senior spoke with a cold voice, and his face that carried a trace of dignity seemed to be even more awe-inspiring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, his arrival caused the hearts of everyone to tremble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>57</span><span style>th</span><span style> on the Combat Rankings, Rock Soul, Xiong Cheng!</span></p>
