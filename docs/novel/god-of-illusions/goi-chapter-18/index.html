 <p>“Alright, this is the arrangement of your dormitories. It just happens to be 12 now, so all of you have the entire afternoon and night to put all your things in order.” As she looked at the students that revealed a variety of expressions after finding out about their roommates, Xue Ying revealed a trace of complacency from controlling everything.</p>
 <p>“Go to sleep obediently after you finishing putting your things in order because if all you wander about rashly before I make all the rules here clear to all of you, you’ll have to pay the price!</p>
 <p>“There’re seniors outside the academic area that are waiting to lead the way, and if your luck is good and you encounter one that’s talkative, then perhaps you’ll be able to obtain some useless knowledge. Alright, disperse now.” As soon as she finished speaking, the group of children that had been seated for god knows how long instantly became lively, and they successively went to look for their roommates that would ‘struggle’ together with them for the next four years.</p>
 <p>“I’m your roommate from now onward. Let me introduce myself again, I’m Xu Chen, and you can call me Big Sister Chen’chen.” The tomboy styled Xu Chen leaped up to arrive before Lin Li at the first possible moment, and she stretched out her hand in a friendly manner. Besides that, the long-winded Qi Wei had similarly approached and stood behind her.</p>
 <p>“What’s… a… roommate?” Lin Li asked another question that caused everyone to be stunned for a long time, but, Bai Xiaofei had already become slightly accustomed to this because he’d encountered a person like her in the past.</p>
 <p>His Second Mother Xie in the Gorge of Heroes.</p>
 <p>In the words of his fourth father, she was slightly stupid.</p>
 <p>“A roommate is someone you’ll be together with every single today in the future, and you’ll eat and sleep together with that person.” Bai Xiaofei tried his best to make his explanation more direct but he never imagined that he would get a reply that caused everyone to be shocked.</p>
 <p>“Then…. I want to be roommates with you.” Lin Li turned around to look at Bai Xiaofei as she blinked her watery and clear eyes.</p>
 <p>“Err…. I can’t be your roommate.” Even though he really wanted to say yes, but Bai Xiaofei didn’t have this choice. Not to mention him, even Zhu Si’si and Xing Nan had to live separately.</p>
 <p>“Why…?” Lin Li’s face instantly revealed a sense of loss as she was utterly incapable of concealing the changes of her emotion.</p>
 <p>“Because the academy doesn’t allow it. I’m a male student and you’re a female student. We must live separately.” Even though he was from a gorge in the mountains, but Bai Xiaofei still knew the basics that males and females were treated differently...</p>
 <p>“But…. You’ll tell me…. Many things.” Xu Chen and Qi Wei who stood by Lin Li’s side were stunned once more when she finished speaking.</p>
 <p><i>What’s going on?!</i></p>
 <p><i>Didn’t the two of you just get to know each other?!</i></p>
 <p><i>How did he tell you many things?!</i></p>
 <p><i>He bought you over with those reminders from before? How easy are you?!</i></p>
 <p>“It’s fine. You can ask me anything you want to know, and I’ll tell you about it. Moreover, you’ll be with Bai Xiaofei all the time in the day.” Xu Chen hurriedly spoke out as she was deeply afraid Lin Li would really fall into a trap if this went on.</p>
 <p>Exactly, a trap. As far as Xu Chen was concerned, Bai Xiaofei who was of the Illusion Stream was a great trap, a heavenly trap!</p>
 <p>“Is it like that?” Lin Li seemed to have set her mind on Bai Xiaofei, so she didn’t even spare Xu Chen a glance and pursued an answer from Bai Xiaofei instead, and it seemed as if only his answer was capable of setting her mind at ease.</p>
 <p>“Yes, Xu Chen didn’t deceive you.” Bai Xiaofei suppressed the trace of dense joy in the bottom of his heart as he reassured Lin Li.</p>
 <p>“Alright then….” After Bai Xiaofei convinced Lin Li, Xu Chen took Lin Li away successfully, and during this gap, everyone else had already left completely, causing only Bai Xiaofei to remain in the entire classroom.</p>
 <p>“Three small groups, huh….” As he calmed down the great waves that had arisen at the bottom of his heart because of Lin Li, Bai Xiaofei started to consider his situation.</p>
 <p>There were a total of 10 male students, and they were divided into three dormitories. Two dormitories were occupied by three people while one was occupied by four, and the dormitory Bai Xiaofei resided in was the dormitory with four people. Moreover, the three people that were his roommates was Mo Ka’s group of three.</p>
 <p>But, the three of them utterly didn’t have any intention of waiting for him and coupled with their careful attitudes from before, Bai Xiaofei had basically already guessed their thoughts.</p>
 <p>Rejection!</p>
 <p>Simply speaking, they intended to bully a ‘weakling’ of the Illusion Stream like him.</p>
 <p>“I’ll go deal with them when I return. It’s time to go have a feast!” Bai Xiaofei struck the table as he stood up, and Huskie who lay on the table leaped into Bai Xiaofei’s embrace in the first possible moment.</p>
 <p>“Huskie, how about we bet a month’s worth of dog food? We’ll guess if that Senior Sister will be waiting outside for me?” Bai Xiaofei stroked Huskie’s head while Huskie revealed an extremely human expression of contemplation, and then he shook his head resolutely.</p>
 <p>According to Huskie’s experience, if he didn’t have a 100% certainty when betting with Bai Xiaofei, then he was just giving dog food away….</p>
 <p>“Cheh. Look at your cowardly appearance, don’t tell anyone that you’re my dog.” Huskie let out a wave of arguing barks after his head was struck heavily by Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p><i>This dog isn’t cowardly! This is wisdom!</i></p>
 <p>“Alright, alright. I know you’re the most intelligent dog, so stop barking and save your energy. Otherwise, what if we die of hunger on the way over?” Bai Xiaofei moved easily between the classrooms in the commoner’s district as he spoke. He’d already completely familiarized himself with the layout here while searching for the Savage Class.</p>
 <p>In next to no time, Bai Xiaofei arrived at the place that Xue Ying said ‘kind’ seniors would be in charge of leading them.</p>
 <p>“Junior Brother, are you heading to your dormitory. I already have enough people over here, and we’ll go over right away if you join in.” Bai Xiaofei had just made an appearance when a senior that wore the year 1 uniform approached him right away, and the small sword on his chest represented the stream he belonged to, the Sword of Assault.</p>
 <p>“Junior Brother, Junior Brother, come over here. I’m giving out the Starnet Survival Handbook!” Before Bai Xiaofei could answer, another senior had approached, and the manner he tried to pull Bai Xiaofei away in wasn’t inferior to a solicitor.</p>
 <p>“Kid, you’ve already seized quite a few people from me today. Why don’t we compete in the combat arena?” The face of the senior that came over to Bai Xiaofei first sank instantly, and the resentment he’d accumulated throughout the day had completely transformed into rage.</p>
 <p>“Of course. But, we Gods Amongst Men only accepts group battles. Brother, why don’t you bring a few more students over? Or perhaps you don’t mind going against a group of us by yourself?” The senior that was provoked didn’t have the slightest intention of being afraid, and as soon as the words Gods Amongst Men were spoken, the confidence of the senior before him weakened instantly.</p>
 <p>“Alright, remember to call more people over. I’m afraid you won’t have enough people if we fight a group battle.” The senior that arrived later was just feeling complacent when a chilly voice resounded out, and Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but be delighted in his heart when he heard this voice. <i>My lunch is assured!</i></p>
 <p>“Big Sister Lingyan!”</p>
 <p>The attitude of the senior from the Sword of Assault instantly changed when he saw Qin Lingyan walking over, and the extremely confident feeling he revealed caused him to seem as if he was a different person a second ago.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, the senior that was originally extremely confident was aggrieved to the point his face went ashen.</p>
 <p>It was basically impossible to go against Qin Lingyan amongst the year 1 students because Qin Lingyan’s popularity was obvious, and it would be a problem to even find someone within the Gods Amongst Men that was willing to lend a hand.</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Lingyan, it’s a joke, I was just joking with this brother. Everyone in the academy knows that the Sword of Assault possesses the stronger cohesive force. I still have to send the new students to their dorms, so I won’t continue being an eyesore for Big Sister Lingyan.” After he forced out a smile, the senior that arrived later casually found a way to extricate himself from the awkward situation before fleeing.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, Big Sister Lingyan!” The senior counterattacked from a hopeless situation with Qin Lingyan’s help grinned from ear to ear, and his gratitude towards Qin Lingyan was already written on his face.</p>
 <p>“There’s nothing to thank me for. I’ll send this person to the dorms, and you go do what you have to do.” After she dismissed the senior with a few simple words, Qin Lingyan turned her head to look at Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“I heard that I welcomed you in when you were passing through the entrance?!” A strand of coldness instantly crawled up Bai Xiaofei’s neck as the Qin Lingyan before his eyes were simply like a different person when compared to the female senior from before that was easy to talk to.</p>
