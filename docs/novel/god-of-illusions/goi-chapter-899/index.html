 <p>Chapter 899: Excited Brothers!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s declaration stunned Ling Fan and Ling Hai.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai, are you sure?” Out of caution, Ling Fan didn’t let his irritation show.</p> 
 <p>“Certainly. That’s why a young boy like me could become the overseer of the Imperial Guard.” Bai Xiaofei was full of confidence as he reminded the two princes that he, the overseer, was personally appointed by the Great Emperor.</p> 
 <p>Even if they didn’t have belief in him, they should in their father, who wouldn’t hand over the Imperial Guard to someone without the capability to lead it.</p> 
 <p>At this thought, the two princes fell silent for a moment.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai, what do you think of the situation in the imperial city and how will it develop in the end?”</p> 
 <p>Since Ling Fan’s earlier problem made him no longer suitable to speak, it was Ling Hai who spoke, and it was a problem that he had no clue about. The Ethereal emperor only told them to compete but did not tell them how they should do it, which put all the five princes at a loss. Fight with soldiers or hold a vote? There was no direction at all.</p> 
 <p>“The situation is completely unknown because I believe that all of you are definitely trying to scale it to your favor. As for how it will develop, I can only say,” Bai Xiaofei paused and smiled. “According to the effort you make!”</p> 
 <p>This answer put a frown on the two princes’ faces.</p> 
 <p>“How do we do it?” asked Ling Hai.</p> 
 <p>From Ling Fan’s expression, this was the question that he, too, wanted to ask as well.</p> 
 <p>“While His Majesty didn’t specify the method, you guys are free to decide on it. There are only five qualified competitors, so once you reach a consensus, wouldn’t it all work out? I believe that it’s not difficult for you five brothers to achieve this,” replied Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The eyes of the two princes lit up.</p> 
 <p>“From what you say, Brother Bai, I believe that you already have an idea!” Filled with excitement, Ling Fan could not resist speaking any longer and instantly looked embarrassed as he did. After all, he had just questioned Bai Xiaofei’s ability.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t care. What he wanted was exactly this.</p> 
 <p>“I do have a rough idea, yes. But no matter what the method is, the foremost requirement is that you five sit down together and have a good chat. As far as I know, all of you are indispensable to Ethereal.” Bai Xiaofei used this opportunity to verify what the First Prince had told him.</p> 
 <p>Judging from the reactions of Ling Fan and Ling Hai, it was true.</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother must have told you this. In fact, he said similar things that day when we were there to receive the decree. No matter what, we are brothers, and we can’t ruin the future of Ethereal just for a throne,” Ling Fan admitted with a sigh. Moreover, he also knew that his eldest brother was the most suitable candidate.</p> 
 <p>However, the allure of the title ‘Great Emperor’ was so tremendous that they could not bring themselves to give up.</p> 
 <p>“I have no problem.”</p> 
 <p>“I’m fine with it too.”</p> 
 <p>Ling Fan and Ling Hai had expressed their stand that if there was a way to satisfy everyone, they would more than wish for it.</p> 
 <p>“In that case, this has been a very pleasant conversation. I assure you that I will not be biased towards anyone, for I have no need to at all.” With a pleased smile, Bai Xiaofei raised his cup. “I hope Ethereal will last forever under the leadership of Your Highnesses.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was in a good mood, while Ling Fan and Ling Hai also got a result that they had not expected. They had come to the Imperial Guard camp with the plan to win Bai Xiaofei’s support, but they became his supporters instead.</p> 
 <p>Walking together with Ling Hai on the way out of the camp, Ling Fan couldn’t help but smile wryly.</p> 
 <p>“Fourth Brother, we are lucky there is no one like Bai Xiaofei among us brothers, or we won’t even have any need to compete at all.”</p> 
 <p>Only now did he realize that Bai Xiaofei had always had only one purpose when talking with them, and they entered his prepared trap so easily. Fortunately, the ‘trap’ meant no harm.</p> 
 <p>“I’m thinking about another thing.” Ling He was actually smiling.</p> 
 <p>“What is it?” asked Ling Fan curiously. It was rare to see Ling Hai smile.</p> 
 <p>“I’m thinking if we can keep him in Ethereal forever.” Ling Hai’s smile deepened as his answer startled Ling Fan, who then revealed a look of delight.</p> 
 <p>“Good idea! He will be a big help to Ethereal if he stays!” Ling Fan exclaimed and even started planning Bai Xiaofei’s career in Ethereal for him.</p> 
 <p>“Easier said than done, though. We don’t know enough about him – not even what he fancies – let alone keep him.” Ling Hai sighed.</p> 
 <p>However, Ling Fan only grew more excited. “<em>That</em> is easy! It’s not like our connections are there for decoration! One investigation and we will know everything about him!”</p> 
 <p>Ling Hai was struck with enlightenment. The two brothers then smiled at one another in a tacit understanding.</p> 
 <p>“How long has it been since us brothers last teamed up?” Ling Fan chuckled evilly.</p> 
 <p>“A long time. You bet I’m looking forward to it.” Ling Hai chortled.</p> 
 <p>If it weren’t that the two were wearing fine princely outfits, people would have taken them for rogues.</p> 
 <p>“Sixth Brother is best suited for this. I will go to him now. He will be even more excited than us!” Ling Fan quickly brainstormed as the sudden urge to win over Bai Xiaofei beat even his desire for the throne.</p> 
 <p>“I heard that his relationship with the Yun and Lan clan isn’t shallow. I’ll check it out. No matter what, we must retain him!” Ling Hai also found a direction.</p> 
 <p>Just like that, a ‘hunt’ for Bai Xiaofei was launched without his knowledge…</p>
