 <p>Chapter 462: The Illusion Demon Officially Kicks off; New Students are Coming!</p> 
 <p>“Not long ago, Big Brother Feng informed us that the early-stage preparations have been completed. He hopes that I will send people over quickly as he is short of manpower.” Fang Ye dropped a bomb right off the bat.</p> 
 <p>As soon as he finished, outside from Chu Qingtian and Lei Min who didn’t understand at all, the rest were pleasantly surprised. Bai Xiaofei was the calmest of them. The progress was completely within his expectations.</p> 
 <p>With the vision of Feng Wuhen and Lu Lingyun plus the start-up capital, it would be surprising if they didn’t work out something.</p> 
 <p>“The vice principal is right here. Aren’t you guys going to grasp such a good chance? Don’t forget that the future president of the business is you, not me. It is not up to me to make this decision, and if I guess correctly, Brother Feng also asked for your opinion.” Bai Xiaofei’s reaction wasn’t just fast. He had never intended to ask anything about the Illusion Demon in the first place, and this thought had not changed. He was dead set on washing his hands off it and enjoying the benefits of an investor!</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye went blank for a moment, then revealed an embarrassed expression. After all, he still hadn’t fully adapted to his identity. In his view, he was only an employee…</p> 
 <p>“Business? What do you mean?!” Chu Qingtian naturally heard the conversation. As the vice principal of finance in Starnet, he was particularly sensitive to the word ‘business.’</p> 
 <p>“Let Fang Ye tell you about this.” Bai Xiaofei promoted Fang Ye to Chu Qingtian with a smile. It would save him a lot of trouble if they communicated thoroughly.</p> 
 <p>With that, Chu Qingtian rested his eyes on Fang Ye, and Fang Ye slightly bobbed his head in response.</p> 
 <p>“Vice Principal Chu, here’s what happened…” After a brief introduction of the Illusion Demon’s motto and the difficult problems it was facing, Fang Ye composed himself. “That is basically the case, so I hope that you can do us a favor and allow us to post a mission with point rewards on the Starnet Ranking!”</p> 
 <p>Chu Qingtian fell into consideration. Meanwhile, the rest of the Savage Class were silently envying Fang Ye from the bottom of their hearts.</p> 
 <p><em>He must be the closest person to Xiaofei now.</em> Although this thought was bad, they just couldn’t control their feelings…</p> 
 <p>However, this kind of envy would not produce any negative influence. What it could bring would only be motivation for them to put in more effort. Therefore, in a sense, Fang Ye’s existence was also their driving force and goal!</p> 
 <p>“That isn’t actually hard, it’s just a trivial matter for me,” Chu Qingtian suddenly spoke after a long silence. He didn’t directly make a promise but hesitated instead.</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye quickly understood his hint.</p> 
 <p>“But it will be a godsend in our dire need. If you are willing to believe us, when the Illusion Demon develops, as my and Brother Fei’s alma mater, Starnet will definitely be the first beneficiary!” Fang Ye solemnly guaranteed and accurately guessed it. What Chu Qingtian wanted was only that promise.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, you got it. Provide me a detailed plan after this and I will arrange it as soon as possible!” Chu Qingtian immediately agreed with a merry laugh.</p> 
 <p>Although the one making the promise was Fang Ye, the real reason why Chu Qingtian was willing to do this was because he regarded Bai Xiaofei highly. Even as an idle investor, Bai Xiaofei could not really turn a blind eye to his business, and Chu Qingtian believed that Bai Xiaofei was a genius.</p> 
 <p>“There is no need, I already have the proposal you want.” A Recording Eyeball appeared in Fang Ye’s hand as he stood up. He walked to Chu Qingtian and respectfully handed it over. “Fang Ye thanks the vice principal in advance.”</p> 
 <p>Taking the Recording Eyeball, Chu Qingtian nodded with satisfaction. This was the attitude that a student should have when facing him! With this thought, Chu Qingtian subconsciously looked at Bai Xiaofei, then sighed in his heart.</p> 
 <p><em>Forget about this smelly brat…</em></p> 
 <p>Returning to his seat, Fang Ye glanced at Bai Xiaofei. After the matter with the Illusion Demon, he still had another big issue!</p> 
 <p>“Next is about the Student Community,” Fang Ye slowly spoke. Everyone once again grew high-spirited and looked at Bai Xiaofei in excitement.</p> 
 <p>They knew the situation regarding the Student Community as each of them was a member. They firmly believed that the progress would shock Bai Xiaofei!</p> 
 <p>Being stared at by a group of people, Bai Xiaofei looked at Fang Ye, somewhat uneasy.</p> 
 <p>“Made huge progress?”</p> 
 <p>“Very huge!” Fang Ye confirmed confidently and continued, “Not long after you left, the voting between the existence of the Student Union and Student Community started. Finally, we won by a landslide. Now the Popularity Ranking has been tied to us!” Growing increasingly emotional as he talked, Fang Ye was practically shouting at the end.</p> 
 <p>“That is expected. Is there anything else?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s reaction was beyond everyone’s expectations. After silently cursing, they chose to accept the reality. If this was nothing, they probably would never be able to surprise Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Because you weren’t here and the Student Community could not be without management, I pulled everyone in and selected a few from the former Student Union to form the current management,” continued Fang Ye.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei nodded his head.</p> 
 <p>“Good job, but it is easy to go wrong after adding too many people, so we must set proper rules. No matter who, those that violate the rules must be severely punished!”</p> 
 <p>In any case, Bai Xiaofei was currently one of the three bosses of the Student Community. He could not wash his hands of it completely.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I will help him with this,” declared Hu Xian’er, who had been silent until now. Everyone looked over and finally remembered that such a mighty figure was with them.</p> 
 <p>Ever since defeating Su Yu and claiming the number one spot on the Combat Ranking, Hu Xian’er had become the only person in the history of Starnet to top two lists at the same time! In the past six months, perhaps due to Bai Xiaofei’s absence, many people felt that their opportunity had come and flocked over under the pretext of challenging her.</p> 
 <p>Towards those people, Hu Xian’er showed no mercy. After beating five or six half-dead, her world was quiet again.</p> 
 <p>Those who originally planned to take this chance to create opportunities with her chose to give up. Compared to her, their lives were obviously more important.</p> 
 <p>“You must have been busy, too. Thank you.” Bai Xiaofei’s voice subconsciously softened.</p> 
 <p>People said that absence made the heart grow fonder. Bai Xiaofei now had deep feelings for this sentence. Seeing Hu Xian’er again after such a long time, he felt an irresistible impulse from the bottom of his heart. He even began to regret that the first thing he did upon his return wasn’t to look for her.</p> 
 <p>It was hard to be wild when you had such a charming beauty at home!</p> 
 <p>“Of course. If anything, I’m one of the three leaders now. I have to do something,” said Hu Xian’er with a captivating smile.</p> 
 <p>The familiar expression on her face once again ignited a fire in Bai Xiaofei’s heart. She might be the only one who could disturb his calm. Although he had never expressed it, after half a year’s separation, there was one thing he must admit.</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er held the highest position in his heart!</p> 
 <p>“Boss, shouldn’t you be ashamed now? Two of the three leaders have been busy while you have been missing for half a year during this hectic time.”</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei was inwardly emotional, a voice that made his heart tighten rang out.</p> 
 <p>Rui Mengqi…</p> 
 <p><em>Oh, Heaven! When can a kind-hearted person help me and take care of her?</em></p> 
 <p>“Ahem… Well, that… Although I was away, my heart has been with everyone!” It was hard to respond to this problem. Bai Xiaofei could only use embarrassment to prevaricate it.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, Rui Mengqi’s high threshold could not be overcome with prevarication!</p> 
 <p>“What’s the use of that? Teacher Feng said that it is better to do one thing than to say one hundred words. You've been all talk no action! If you do this again, it will affect your status!” Rui Mengqi seriously scolded.</p> 
 <p>Everyone present could see that she meant well for Bai Xiaofei, but her way of speaking really…</p> 
 <p>Rendered people speechless!</p> 
 <p>“I will change!” Biting the bullet to say three words that stunned all and sundry, Bai Xiaofei felt like there was a bone stuck in his throat.</p> 
 <p>“Mhm, now this is more like it!” Rui Mengqi seemed to be aiming exactly for this promise from him. She didn’t even notice Bai Xiaofei’s irritation and simply was proud of herself. In her opinion, she did him a great favor!</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei’s heart was dripping blood. What had he been thinking at that moment to bring this little ancestor back?!!</p> 
 <p>“There is one last thing,” declared Fang Ye after Bai Xiaofei had recovered from Rui Mengqi.</p> 
 <p>“What else?” As Bai Xiaofei viewed it, all the matters related to Fang Ye should have already been said.</p> 
 <p>“Freshmen. The freshmen are coming. Anything we should do about them?”</p> 
 <p>Upon these words, Bai Xiaofei’s eyes were wide open.</p> 
 <p><em>Freshmen?! The year is coming to an end? !’m going to be a senior?! Shit, why do I feel like I haven’t done anything?!</em></p> 
 <p>All kinds of horrors came to mind, and Bai Xiaofei suddenly realized one thing. He and Starnet were out of sync. He thought he was still a new student, but the real new students were coming.</p> 
 <p>And at this moment, a word from him would determine what the incoming freshmen would face!</p> 
 <p>“For once, the situation in Starnet is stable. As long as they don’t make trouble, let us settle down. Don’t do what you don’t want to happen to you onto others. You never know what people will do when they are pushed too hard.”</p> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei finished, the rest heaved a sigh of relief, especially Chu Qingtian. The reason why he came here was that he was afraid Bai Xiaofei would ‘bully’ the freshmen! And now, it clearly seemed he had been overly worried.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was still very friendly!</p>
