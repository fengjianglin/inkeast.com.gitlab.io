 <p>Chapter 520: Unintentionally and Intentionally…</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei swore, the current atmosphere was definitely the strangest of all the occasions that he had experienced since coming to Starnet!</p> 
 <p>Luo Han walked slowly in front, every step seemed to be hesitant, while Bai Xiaofei silently followed her with the conversation between Luo Xi and Han Xing repeatedly echoing in his head.</p> 
 <p>She was too shy to speak, while he didn’t know where to start.</p> 
 <p>Luo Han’s situation was essentially different from that of the rest. Bai Xiaofei and the other girls fell in love of their own free will, while his relationship with Luo Han was arranged by her parent, an unclear arrangement!</p> 
 <p>Moreover, Bai Xiaofei had no experience in a situation like this. However, he knew that it couldn’t go on like this. Not to mention this silence would ruffle Luo Xi, Bai Xiaofei himself couldn’t let Luo Han continue to feel so embarrassed after she set aside her pride to admit her feelings.</p> 
 <p>Whether it would work out was another story. Since the girl had taken the first step, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t keep being indifferent. It would be too much to do to a frail girl…</p> 
 <p>“Err… Luo Han…” Bai Xiaofei stopped Luo Han hesitantly despite having not come up with a proper opening.</p> 
 <p>Luo Han froze a little. With an uneasy heart, she slowly turned around and uttered a soft assent, not daring to look up at him.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t need to look to know how red Luo Han’s face was. Seeing her like this, he relaxed a lot. Between two people, there was always a dominant. Luo Han being passive meant that Bai Xiaofei had the initiative.</p> 
 <p>“Is there any place you want to go? Or do you want to check out the Vivid Wing shop like Aunt Luo said?” Bai Xiaofei finally found a topic.</p> 
 <p>Luo Han was delighted from the bottom of her heart. There was an essential difference between the same thing being said by Bai Xiaofei and Luo Xi. If Bai Xiaofei didn’t open his mouth, Luo Han wouldn’t even know what she should do next.</p> 
 <p>“I… I want to have a meal first. I haven’t eaten anything since morning…” Luo Han weakly said, and her flat belly rumbled twice in great coordination.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, then let’s head to the Hundred Flavor House! I heard they have a new cook recently!” Bai Xiaofei agreed straight away, exceptionally happy to hear that they could go eat instead of going shopping.</p> 
 <p>“No, no, no, don’t go there. The Hundred Flavor House is too expensive!”</p> 
 <p>In her panic, Luo Han finally raised her head. Bai Xiaofei really didn’t expect her to be so nervous from something like this. After a glance, Luo Han hurriedly lowered her head again, her whole face burning.</p> 
 <p>“Why? Does Aunt Luo allow you very little pocket money?” Bai Xiaofei was puzzled. How could the daughter of a vice principal find a meal at the Hundred Flavor House expensive?</p> 
 <p>“Not little, it’s enough to cover my daily expenses. Moreover, Mother doesn’t have that much money and most of it is spent on my puppets,” Luo Han explained, her voice still gentle as if in fear of scaring people.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei was slightly shocked to hear this answer. <em>Vice Principal Luo doesn’t have much money?!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei remembered very well that Di Jiang had been filthy rich then, and his son had enjoyed a luxurious life. So, how could Luo Xi have no money?</p> 
 <p>In fact, Bai Xiaofei thought too much. Di Jiang was rich because he had external income. However, the salary at Starnet wasn’t very high. Also, Luo Xi was different from Di Jiang. She didn’t have shady sources to earn from. Therefore, it was completely normal that Luo Han didn’t have much money.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei chose not to mull over this. With a confused expression, he voiced his next doubt, “Didn’t I say that Blossom Rankers can freely get anything from the Starnet stores? You’ve never used that?”</p> 
 <p>“Mother said never to take a reward that’s not deserved, casually using outsiders’ money will create a weak point later…” Luo Han said slowly, her tone weaker and weaker.</p> 
 <p>“But I’m not an outsider now! In the future, you can just report my name when you go to any store. Moreover, it’s not like you didn’t contribute. Everyone on the Blossom Ranking helps me earn so much money while you all spend only a small portion.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Luo Han froze a little. She didn’t hear the last part. After Bai Xiaofei said that he was not an outsider, her brain had already crashed…</p> 
 <p>The speaker said it unintentionally, but the listener took it intentionally!</p> 
 <p>“Mhm… I got it…” Luo Han answered in a voice as soft as a mosquito buzz, her head buried low…</p> 
 <p>The cuteness of her reaction struck Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p><em>How does someone like Aunt Luo bring up Luo Han to have this kind of character?! Maybe I can send Liuying to her for further studies…</em></p> 
 <p>Thinking this, Bai Xiaofei revealed a bitter smile. Even though he knew that this idea was impossible, he just couldn’t help but fantasize a little.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go, go wherever you want in the future. As long as it’s a place I can enter, money will not become a condition that hinders you!” Bai Xiaofei patted his chest and began to lead the way.</p> 
 <p>Luo Han was stunned before she reacted and hurriedly followed. However, her cautious small steps did not change at all, making Bai Xiaofei feel impatient. In the end, he who couldn’t wait simply pulled on her soft hand to pick up the pace.</p> 
 <p>“It’s fine to be disinterested in anything, but you must have a proper attitude for eating! This is a big deal!”</p> 
 <p>This was the first time Han Luo experienced Bai Xiaofei’s nonsense. What he didn’t know was that she took his joke to heart and remembered it deeply. Or to be exact, she would keep in mind everything he said from now on. The moment when he had grabbed her hand, she had completely fallen…</p> 
 <p>Many people often deceived children saying that kissing would get a girl pregnant. In Luo Han’s case, she felt that if she was touched by Bai Xiaofei, then he was the only one she could be with for the rest of her life!</p> 
 <p>After all, since childhood, Luo Han had never been touched by any guy around her age before. Even with elders, Lei Shan was the only man who had held her when she was a little baby.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, Bai Xiaofei had done another ‘big thing’ without knowing it. But it couldn’t be helped. He had too many girls and experiences with them, which made him feel that this kind of action was trivial…</p> 
 <p>Speeding up, the two quickly arrived at the Hundred Flavor House, the starting point of their one-day tour. From the Hundred Flavor House to the stores and then recreational areas, Bai Xiaofei took Luo Han to play all the things there were to play, also filling up half of her storage ring.</p> 
 <p>All this was something that Luo Han had never experienced before…</p>
