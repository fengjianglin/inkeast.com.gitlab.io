 <p>Chapter 817: Warehouse and Production Base!</p> 
 <p>Down on the seventh floor, Sikong Ming’s group sat in front of a barrier.</p> 
 <p>“Mister Mirror is dead,” stated Sun Shadow with a straight face, seeming to have anticipated this.</p> 
 <p>“His mission has been completed. What happens after has nothing to do with us,” Sikong Ming’s voice was nonchalant and his eyes never moved from what was in front.</p> 
 <p>Within the barrier was Zhao Ji, whose anticipation never waned as he stared fixedly at the cocoon in midair, as if he had not noticed Sikong Ming’s group at all.</p> 
 <p>“This barrier will collapse in another 30 minutes. Let’s hope no one will come down here before then,” said Bone Dragon coldly, similarly not surprised by Mister Mirror’s death.</p> 
 <p>Only what went down here was the real highlight!</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, on the fifth floor,</p> 
 <p>“Hahaha! I’m rich!!!”</p> 
 <p>An exclamation ignited the chaotic area, where many Blood Diamonds were piled up in a cave, each one of high quality. The loners and Devil Forest people crazily swept through everything they saw, unaware of the approaching danger.</p> 
 <p>“This one is mine!”</p> 
 <p>“Die!”</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>The situation escalated to violence as the number of Blood Diamonds was not enough for each to have a piece. Lives rapidly decreased, but no one noticed that every time someone fell, a thread of blood-red energy would seep through the ground down to the next floor…</p> 
 <p>“Devil Forest is taking over!”</p> 
 <p>When the main force of Devil Forest poured into the fifth floor, the several team captains immediately forgot Zhu Wuxin’s order upon the sight of the huge pile of Blood Diamonds. For them, the Blood Diamonds were not just Blood Diamonds anymore, but an opportunity for their whole mercenary group to advance even further!</p> 
 <p>“F*ck off! Devil Forest my arse! They think I’ve lived this long for nothing?! Brothers, kill them and we will be rich!”</p> 
 <p>No one knew who was the tough nut shouting that, but the already chaotic fifth floor was completely overturned. A battle between Devil Forest and the loners erupted as all sorts of colorful attacks covered the whole floor. More and more people turned into corpses, but no one was scared off. All they could see was a mountain of Blood Diamonds waving at them!</p> 
 <p>People would die for wealth, this was an eternal curse…</p> 
 <p>The fifth floor stopped many, except for some. For example, Bai Xiaofei’s elite team.</p> 
 <p>“Is there still no scent of Wu Chi?” At the gate of the sixth floor, Bai Xiaofei looked nervously at Tan Xin with a trace of regret in his heart.</p> 
 <p>“I’ve tried my best. He may be isolated by something, I can’t feel his existence at all.” Tan Xin didn’t give an absolute answer, however, she already had her own guess.</p> 
 <p>“I believe Wu Chi, he definitely won’t let you down,” Hu Xian’er gently comforted Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Besides Hu Xian’er, Yu Linfeng, Wang Hang, and Wang Chuan, Earthwalker was also present. It was him who helped Bai Xiaofei bring everyone together.</p> 
 <p>“Erm… Boss Bai, I have done everything you wanted me to do, so…” suggested Earthwalker nervously for the sake of his own safety despite knowing it was not a suitable time to cut in.</p> 
 <p>“What about it? Helping us makes you feel difficult?” Tan Xin, who failed to find something to say, immediately found an outlet. Her aggressive tone made Earthwalker curl up into a ball.</p> 
 <p>The commotion pulled Bai Xiaofei out of his state of remorse. “Forget it, let him go. He has helped a lot.” He saved the chubby man from a harsh scolding from Tan Xin.</p> 
 <p>As Hu Xian’er said, he had to have faith in Wu Chi! </p> 
 <p><em>Brat, if you dare to be so short-lived, I will never let you off!</em></p> 
 <p>“Passing this area, we’ll reach the last floor. Everything should be clear when we get there, but this layer may make you uncomfortable.” Recovering back to his former state, Bai Xiaofei’s expression resumed his previous fury.</p> 
 <p>“I have a question.” Wang Hang frowned, looking troubled as he did not know if he should ask his question.</p> 
 <p>“If it’s about the people of the All-Around Merchant Group, I have to say I didn’t expect it either. Their reaction completely went beyond my plan,” Bai Xiaofei said as he mentally sorted through the information everyone had just reported.</p> 
 <p>After the sealed spaces disappeared, they acted separately for a long time but did not run into a single person from the All-Around group at all. Even now on the sixth floor, still no one had come out to stop them.</p> 
 <p>If it wasn’t for the random pairing of the sealed spaces that forcefully pulled a portion of the All-Around people in, one would think that this place was empty. It was as if they had given up on this base, which was absolutely impossible.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei lured Devil Forest and the loners of Windlove so that they would share the pressure from the All-Around Merchant Group. Unfortunately, that arrangement had been completely ruined.</p> 
 <p>“They can’t all pile on the seventh floor, so as long as we advance, we will see them, right?” Yu Linfeng was a man of action. He swung his sword with an intense fighting spirit.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go. I believe that your fighting spirit will climb even higher after you see what’s in there.” Bai Xiaofei led the group in.</p> 
 <p>Walking next to him, Tan Xin’s expression was ugly as she recalled the scene she got from searching that man’s mind. It could only be described in three words – Hell on earth!</p> 
 <p>As the group went deeper in, Wang Hang’s doubts were answered. On the sixth floor, corpses dressed in the uniform of the All-Around Merchant Group littered the round. From their wounds, each one was obviously one-hit-killed!</p> 
 <p>Among these were the people who had arrived at Windlove with Tong Fei, also insta-killed!</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Hu Xian’er’s face paled and her heart began to drum. Ji Xian was no weakling. For someone as strong as her to be insta-killed in a head-on battle, just how powerful was the other person?!</p> 
 <p>For a moment, dead silence descended among the group.</p> 
 <p>However, it was soon broken when they saw the real sixth floor!</p> 
 <p>Agonized whines and cries for help, a suffocating stench of blood, and countless lifeless faces made up the entire sixth floor. Such was where the Blood Diamonds were produced, and the material was living people!</p> 
 <p>The victims had vicious wounds all over their bodies. Under the effect of a special liquid, their wounds could not heal at all, and sucking on the wounds were fat, blood-red worms. The worms would enter the wounds after getting full and lay eggs inside before crawling out. After a while, the host would burst, releasing a herd of new worms while crystallizing into Blood Diamonds!</p> 
 <p>All of this happened in front of the rest of the people who were still alive. In other words, the victims had to experience two things: Watching as death happened right in front of their eyes and waiting for their turn!</p> 
 <p>Among the slaves bought by the All-Around Merchant Group, there were old and young, men and women, and even pregnant women!</p> 
 <p>This was the true face of the All-Around Merchant Group!</p>
