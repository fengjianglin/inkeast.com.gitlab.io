 <p>Chapter 885: At Your Beck and Call!</p> 
 <p>A play that was within Bai Xiaofei’s expectations and outside that of the rest ended with a deafening cheer throughout the whole training field. Such an outstanding fight might not be witnessed more than a few times in a person’s lifetime.</p> 
 <p>“General Bai, how do you train? Can you tell this old man?” After being severely beaten black and blue by Bai Xiaofei, Hong Liang’s attitude took a U-turn. There were not many people who could convince him, but after today, Bai Xiaofei was added to that short list.</p> 
 <p>“Exercise your reaction speed. Your foundation is stronger than mine, General Hong. It may be that your training method is not fitting. I will discuss this with you when we have time.” Mentioning his melee skills, Bai Xiaofei recalled the painful experience in the Savage Class and also thought of Xue Ying.</p> 
 <p>Now that he thought about it, those clean and precise moves that she taught them must have been trained by Shadow Death…</p> 
 <p>“General Bai, forgive me if there has been any offense,” Feng Yin stopped Hong Liang from fawning over Bai Xiaofei further and sincerely apologized.</p> 
 <p>“General Feng, do I look like that kind of petty person? Besides, there are still many things that I need to trouble you guys in the future. You’re making me embarrassed to ask.” Bai Xiaofei laughed, breaking the serious atmosphere.</p> 
 <p>“Anything you need,” Feng Yin firmly stressed before revealing a smile.</p> 
 <p>The rest also smiled as well.</p> 
 <p>“This is not a place to talk. I’ll have people prepare it for us. How about talking over a drink?” As expected of a logistics chief, Zhao Youyu did not forget his job.</p> 
 <p>His suggestion immediately poked the satisfactory spot of everyone: No wine, no fun!</p> 
 <p>While Zhao Youyu’s people prepared a grand meal, the group made a detailed report on the situation of the Yun private army for Bai Xiaofei. At present, it had 100,000 people. Except for those who were absent for various reasons, the number of available troops was over 80,000.</p> 
 <p>Any army with nearly one-fifth of its soldiers unavailable would definitely be on the road to its end, but this was normal for private armies of big clans. In fact, one-fifth was not even a big number.</p> 
 <p>Among the 100,000, the Logistics Brigade was the smallest with 5,000 members. Shen Kuo’s Raid Brigade was the biggest with a total of 50,000, but they also had the most tasks.</p> 
 <p>Qian Ning’s Firearm Brigade was composed of 20,000 people, and they were all gun puppet masters!</p> 
 <p>Hearing this number, Bai Xiaofei smiled wryly. It was said that no country in the whole continent had successfully established an army of gun puppet masters, but in reality, they just did not exist as regular troops.</p> 
 <p>Several big empires had reached an agreement to ban pure-gun armies, but this so-called agreement was actually a restriction from the other empires against Ethereal, who would have benefited the most otherwise.</p> 
 <p>Regarding the advantage in puppets, no country could match Ethereal.</p> 
 <p>However, every rule had a way around it. Official gun armies weren’t allowed, but private ones were not restricted. Therefore, all the four great clans had established gun brigades, and the Great Emperor had expressly stipulated that they were always under the capital’s command and not entirely attributed to the corresponding private army.</p> 
 <p>Of the remaining 25,000 troops of the Yun private army, 20,000 belonged to Gan Fang’s Assassination Brigade and the remaining 5,000 were the Yun clan’s imperial troops directly under the lead of Feng Yin.</p> 
 <p>“General Bai, what do you want us to do?” Shen Kuo filled Bai Xiaofei’s cup with an ingratiating expression. Whoever could take him out to do business would be his family at the moment. The tedious barrack life had defeated him.</p> 
 <p>“Clear the new monarch’s way,” uttered Bai Xiaofei as he lifted the cup.</p> 
 <p>Everyone stared blankly. Shen Kuo, who was holding the bottle, even spilled the wine, but no one cared.</p> 
 <p>When they came to their senses, the sounds of gulping echoed one after another.</p> 
 <p>“Ge…Gen… General Bai, are… are you kidding…” The calm Yin Feng was scared to the point that he stuttered. <em>This is no laughing matter!</em></p> 
 <p>“You should be very clear if I’m kidding or not. The emperor is seriously ill but it still isn’t decided which prince will take over the throne. All the five adult princes are outstanding people. I believe that none of them is willing to be under another. As a servant of the royal family, the Yun clan can only support one prince.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s tone was calm and he had no scruples at all.</p> 
 <p>“It’s only a matter of time before we take sides, and no matter who the Yun clan chooses, we’re bound to become the enemy of the rest. If we don’t make early preparations, we will become an abandoned chess piece in this big game.”</p> 
 <p>“For the princes, aside from the expatriate armies, the four great clans are forces that they must win the favor of. Now, do you still think I’m joking?”</p> 
 <p>Finishing his speech, Bai Xiaofei put down his cup to hear the rest gulping again.</p> 
 <p>In fact, this situation could be judged by anyone with status in the capital, only that there was absolutely no one who dared to say it out loud like Bai Xiaofei!</p> 
 <p>“When?” The first to break the long silence was Feng Yin after he regained his calm, his expression solemn.</p> 
 <p>“Soon.”</p> 
 <p>“Which side do we take?”</p> 
 <p>“I haven’t decided yet, this depends on General Yun.”</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei answered the question, the atmosphere grew more and more serious.</p> 
 <p>“Youyu, recall those on leave. Yuanhang, organizing a special training schedule. Everyone needs to regain their best state the quickest possible. Old Gan, deploy all of our scouts. From now on, we need to grasp the movements of all the troops around the capital, including the private armies of the other clans. Old Hong, starting from today, our army is under martial law. No one is allowed to contact the outside. No one is allowed to approach the camp. If anyone is found to violate this, they will be dealt with according to the highest punishment!”</p> 
 <p>After a series of orders were issued, the only people left in the room were Bai Xiaofei, Shen Kuo, Qian Ning, and Feng Yin. Bai Xiaofei didn’t say a word, only quietly watching Feng Yin.</p> 
 <p>“Is there a problem with my orders?” Feng Yin looked at Bai Xiaofei and asked.</p> 
 <p>The others were puzzled. <em>Does Boss need to consult when commanding an army? Isn’t this his strong point?</em></p> 
 <p>However, that was not the case to Bai Xiaofei’s ears. Feng Yin was not asking if there was any problem with the way he led the army. He was asking if there was any problem letting the other forces know that the Yun private army had begun to make moves.</p> 
 <p>“There are people that, if you don’t force them, they won’t respond. We’re only throwing in a catalyst.” With a smile, Bai Xiaofei gave Feng Yin the answer he wanted.</p> 
 <p>It was also this answer that had Feng Yin convinced. <em>This is a man who does great things!</em></p> 
 <p>“General Bai, from now on, I, Feng Yin, am at your beck and call!”</p>
