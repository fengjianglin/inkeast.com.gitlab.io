 <p>Chapter 676: Bai-Style God Control!</p> 
 <p>“I might just believe you if you said you were trying to kill yourself,” Cang Lan cut in with an eye-roll. This had nothing to do with his impression of Bai Xiaofei, it came purely from confidence in his own technique. He firmly believed that no one in this world could practice God Control without being implanted with his puppet’s God Control silk!</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei was an exception.</p> 
 <p>He didn’t say a word. His storage ring flashed, and five white-grade puppets appeared. The next second, the five puppets floated up under the astonished eyes of Cang Lan and the triplets, before exploding into pieces with thundering sounds.</p> 
 <p>Even after the aftermath of the explosions cleared, the four gawking people still had yet to recover from their shock.</p> 
 <p><em>Am I dreaming?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Maybe that was just fireworks or an illusion?</em></p> 
 <p>Their minds were flooded with ideas as they could not believe that Bai Xiaofei was really able to learn God Control.</p> 
 <p>If he really did, just how strong was his body?! Even magical beasts couldn’t stand the domineering impact of the technique!</p> 
 <p>“Believe it now? You could see very clearly that I wasn’t using any illusions!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s voice pulled the four out of their trance. Cang Lan immediately flashed toward Bai Xiaofei and grabbed his hand.</p> 
 <p>“Hey hey hey, what are you doing, gramps?! I’m not gay, especially with someone at your age… “</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei hadn’t finished his words when a wave of Cang Lan’s hand disabled him from opening his mouth. Feeling the old man’s energy feeling out his body, he helplessly sighed in his heart.</p> 
 <p><em>Ahh, there’s nothing I can do, I can’t beat him! My poor innocence!</em></p> 
 <p>The more Bai Xiaofei studied God Control, the deeper he understood how terrifying this old man was. He then also understood why Lei Shan and Gu Xing would show apprehension when they mentioned Cang Lan. This old man certainly could hold against even Lei Shan in a fight!</p> 
 <p>Holding Bai Xiaofei’s hand, Cang Lan’s expression changed again and again. He thought that Bai Xiaofei practicing God Control would cause irreversible damage to his meridians, but his investigation told him otherwise.</p> 
 <p>Doubt finally clouded his face as Cang Lan found this fact difficult to accept. <em>Just how is this possible?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Use God Control again. My energy will not hinder you,” said Cang Lan.</p> 
 <p>The astonishment of the Leng sisters deepened at his words. They gulped hard as their hearts gradually filled with pleasant surprise. <em>If Bai Xiaofei has really learned God Control, does it mean that his problem has been solved?</em></p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei did as he was told, otherwise, he might not be able to ever speak again in his life. This would be the biggest torture for him…</p> 
 <p>Another five white puppets appeared before Bai Xiaofei. After he repeated what he had just done, the doubt on Cang Lan’s face turned into amazement.</p> 
 <p><em>How unexpected! How very unexpected! This smelly boy is irritating, but he is a genius!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had operated the technique as written on the scroll, the only difference was that the moment the energy converged into his heart, he sped up the Endless State to absorb the violent combined energy and conveniently used it for God Control. After the puppets exploded, the Endless State would automatically start and absorb the impact on the meridians.</p> 
 <p>In the whole process, Bai Xiaofei ran the Endless State twice without affecting the operation of God Control, yet was still able to solve the biggest problem with this technique.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had been unable to learn God Control because of the Endless State, but finally succeeded in learning it also because of the Endless State. This kind of reverse thinking was beyond ordinary people, and the pain of the actual process was also unimaginable to ordinary people. Therefore, Cang Lan used the word ‘genius’ on him.</p> 
 <p>What he didn’t know was that this was only a wonderfully unexpected result.</p> 
 <p>In Bai Xiaofei’s reckless repeated attempts he had almost died once. However, it was right at that time that the Endless State automatically accelerated and saved his life. The incident had also enlightened Bai Xiaofei with the idea of using the Endless State to assist God Control.</p> 
 <p>After repeated experiments, Bai Xiaofei finally succeeded!</p> 
 <p>However, there was still a gap between this success and the success in his expectations.</p> 
 <p>If the Endless State ran for too long, it would completely absorb the energy mobilized for God Control. As a result, what Bai Xiaofei had done just now was the limit. He couldn’t even control white-grade puppets to float for a long time.</p> 
 <p>However, this was enough to get Bai Xiaofei excited. Although his original purpose had not been achieved, this kind of consumable God Control added another killer card to his deck!</p> 
 <p>As Cang Lan had said before, the number of white puppets was not a problem for a Grandmaster Rank. As long as one had enough of them, it was possible to detonate several hundred in one breath. Not to mention that Bai Xiaofei’s energy was far more superior than puppet masters at the same level!</p> 
 <p>“Who would have thought that fellow Revelation actually found a good disciple, huh?” The stubborn Cang Lan refused to say a good word to Bai Xiaofei, but this was the biggest recognition from him.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you for your guidance. If you hadn’t made me go through all that training, I wouldn’t be able to master fine control over my energy.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s words came from the bottom of his heart. If he hadn’t been training to catch Snow Moles and then carefully moving around in the Crystal’s Longing forest for so long, he wouldn’t be able to do all this even if he learned God Control.</p> 
 <p>“Humph, good that you still have a conscience.” Cang Lan accepted Bai Xiaofei’s gratitude and said, “You can go to the Holy Snow Mountain by yourselves now. I’ve checked it once in the last two days and told the girls about the basic situation. It should not be a problem for you to protect yourself with your current ability.”</p> 
 <p>Cang Lan stood with his hands clasped behind his back like an otherworldly master.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, we won’t let you down,” Bai Xiaofei said, then took out an Amethyst Card with one million Amethyst Coins in it and a brocade box, respectfully presenting them to Cang Lan. “This is a small gift from me. I hope that you can accept it as my gratitude for your teaching.”</p> 
 <p>Cang Lan didn’t receive it. Bai Xiaofei smiled and put the items table nearby. Then, he took out the Downwind Boat. </p> 
 <p>After the four finished bidding goodbye to Cang Lan, they left the peach blossom forest where they had stayed for quite a long time.</p> 
 <p>“The newer generation always outdoes the former, ah!”</p> 
 <p>With a long sigh, Cang Lan looked at what Bai Xiaofei put on the stone table, and his face brightened. No amount of money would ever be enough for him!</p> 
 <p>Putting away the Amethyst Card, Cang Lan picked up the brocade box. No matter how he looked at it, it was no simpler than the Amethyst Card.</p> 
 <p>Full of expectation, he slowly opened it…</p> 
 <p>“BAI XIAOFEI!!!!”</p> 
 <p>A murderous voice echoed to the sky, and at the same time, the unique fatal smell of Stinky Grass spread…</p>
