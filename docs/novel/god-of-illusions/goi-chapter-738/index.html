 <p>Chapter 738: My Bedroom!</p> 
 <p>“If what?” Bai Xiaofei creased his brows as Bai Ye kept hesitating. <em>Is it so difficult to finish a sentence?</em></p> 
 <p>“If there is one day Lingyan doesn’t care how many girls you have, will you accept her?” Bai Ye finally squeezed out the question.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei was stunned. Then, he smiled wryly.</p> 
 <p>“There’s no such if. If she could, she would have long ago.” Bai Xiaofei rubbed his head, but before he could change the topic, Bai Ye’s stare made his hair stand up.</p> 
 <p>“I said if! You don’t have to worry about whether it’s possible! Just give me your answer!” shrieked Bai Ye as his voice suddenly went up an octave beyond what men were capable of.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t get emotional! Relax! If you shout like that again, your throat will be injured!” Bai Xiaofei gulped nervously.</p> 
 <p>Seemingly aware of his gaffe, Bai Ye calmed down before looking at Bai Xiaofei again. “Answer me!”</p> 
 <p>Looking at the extremely serious Bai Ye, Bai Xiaofei knew that he could not avoid this matter. After long consideration, he sighed.</p> 
 <p>“Why the long sigh?” Bai Ye nervously inquired.</p> 
 <p>“I sighed because there’s no way it will happen, but since you asked, senior, I will tell you that I would certainly and actively grasp that opportunity!” Bai Xiaofei firmly declared.</p> 
 <p>Bai Ye’s eyes immediately shone.</p> 
 <p>“That’s good… That’s good…” Bai Ye muttered as a smile bloomed on his face.</p> 
 <p>“Senior, what did you say?” Bai Xiaofei was stunned. Although he heard what Bai Ye had just said, he felt he might have heard it wrong.</p> 
 <p>“Nothing! Go find Lingyan! The person she wants to see most now is you!” With that, Bai Ye fled the scene.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei scratched his head in confusion before reluctantly heading to the Sword of Assault. <em>Can’t run from what you can’t avoid…</em></p> 
 <p>As a major department, the Sword of Assault had quite many students, therefore having quite many soon-to-be graduates. The graduation atmosphere could be felt from the decorations as well as couples walking in pairs everywhere.</p> 
 <p>Many considered graduation to be the season of break-ups, but most of the time it was not due to the wishes of the lovebirds, but the harsh reality that prevented them from being together forever. Instead of struggling in pain, it was better to cut all ties and get closure when they could.</p> 
 <p>Besides couples, there were senior brothers and sisters giving advice to their juniors. With the hopes of the future generations being better than the old, the passing on of knowledge and wisdom was one of the most precious treasures of Starnet Academy. Moreover, after graduating, the friends one made in their student years could be of great help in the future.</p> 
 <p>However, the bustling atmosphere could not retain Bai Xiaofei’s attention. He just wanted to see Qin Lingyan quickly and resolve the knot in his heart.</p> 
 <p>“How many times did I tell you?! You are a human, not an immortal god! Leaving no escape route for yourself before you attack?! Do you want to repeat their failures?!”</p> 
 <p>“And you! Why were you so afraid when I attacked you just now?! Was it because I’m your senior sister or because you think you are no match for me?! Let me tell you, our department is called the Sword of Assault, not the Sword of Retreat! No matter how powerful your enemy is, a battle with your enemy is until one side dies! If you don’t dare to attack, you are waiting to die! To die! Understand?!!”</p> 
 <p>Qin Lingyan’s clear voice echoed in the training field. The circle of soon-to-be fourth-year students obediently listened without even daring to breathe loudly.</p> 
 <p>“Rest for three minutes, then we’ll have another round!” Qin Lingyan waved her hands.</p> 
 <p>The group of students immediately heaved a sigh of relief.</p> 
 <p>As Qin Lingyan picked up her sword, she saw Bai Xiaofei standing beside her and she froze in place.</p> 
 <p>“Senior sister, long time no see,” Bai Xiaofei greeted with a rigid smile.</p> 
 <p>“Yeah, long time no see.” Qin Lingyan quickly returned to her senses. Her tone and attitude were completely different from her earlier teaching mode.</p> 
 <p>“Mind if I have a word?” Bai Xiaofei smiled.</p> 
 <p>Qin Lingyan also smiled. “Wait a second,” she said.</p> 
 <p>She then went to the students and said a few words to them. They immediately cheered and shot grateful eyes at Bai Xiaofei before running out of the training field.</p> 
 <p>“There is no one but us here, no need to go anywhere else.” Qin Lingyan smiled, it was so beautiful that it stunned Bai Xiaofei. Looking at his foolish face, she sourly asked, “What brings you here? What about those senior and junior sisters of yours?”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei inwardly complained. <em>What do you mean junior?! I don’t even know one junior sister!</em></p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei didn’t dare defend himself out loud. If he wanted to continue the conversation, he had to find a way to skip this topic!</p> 
 <p>“I have a lot of time with them, but you are going to graduate soon. We won’t know when is the next time we can meet,” Bai Xiaofei said as nonchalantly as he could.</p> 
 <p>Qin Lingyan smiled.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go.” She packed up her items and headed towards the training field exit.</p> 
 <p>“Where?” Bai Xiaofei followed with a puzzled face. <em>Didn’t you just say we don’t need to go anywhere else?!</em></p> 
 <p>“My bedroom. Are you interested?” Qin Lingyan tilted her head.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was dumbfounded. <em>To your bedroom?! I… f*ck!! Why?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Senior… senior sister, this… is not very good,” Bai Xiaofei stuttered as he repeatedly gulped. His trembling little body earned a disdainful glance from Qin Lingyan.</p> 
 <p>“What are you thinking? I am going back to change clothes!” She snorted and turned her head away. She had meant it in an innocent way, but Bai Xiaofei’s misunderstanding made her start to think dirty as well.</p> 
 <p>Her cheeks hot, Qin Lingyan subconsciously revealed a happy smile…</p>
