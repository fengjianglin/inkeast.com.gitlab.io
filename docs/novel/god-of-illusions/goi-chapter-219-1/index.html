 <p>The wait was a long miserable ordeal for Zhuang Ming. He was scared that Bai Xiaofei would be able to invite an expert. If that was the case, he would suffer a great loss. Unfortunately, one would always get what one feared.</p>
 <p>When the doorbell of the VIP room rang, Zhuang Ming’s heart almost stopped beating. And when he saw the newcomer, he lost all hope. The newcomer was Feng Wuhen! Although Bai Xiaofei and his classmates had no idea about Feng Wuhen’s real identity, Zhuang Ming knew. The moment he saw Feng Wuhen, he felt both hopeless and shocked. How did they know each other?</p>
 <p>“It has been a while, Deputy President Zhuang, Brother Bai.”</p>
 <p>Feng Wuhen first shook Zhuang Ming’s hand before giving Bai Xiaofei a hug. From this gesture, it was clear who Feng Wuhan was closer to. Fang Ye had also arrived with Feng Wuhen, hugging Huskie in his arms. Bai Xiaofei was not stupid enough to hope that Huskie could invite Feng Wuhen with a single letter. Thus, Fang Ye was used as the messenger.</p>
 <p>“Sorry, Brother Feng. I couldn’t leave so I had to get my brother to invite you. You won’t blame me for that, right?” Bai Xiaofei apologized with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Of course not. But I heard you had made a huge sum of money, brother. I will never let go of a chance to make some money off a tycoon,” joked Feng Wuhen with a sly smile.</p>
 <p>“Since you are here, I won’t allow you to leave empty handed. Deputy President Zhuang has many good things here. If anything catches your eyes, feel free to point it out,” said Bai Xiaofei. As for Zhuang Ming, his face turned unsightly.</p>
 <p><em>F*ck! What do you take me for?</em></p>
 <p>“I won’t be holding back, then.”</p>
 <p>The two smiled again and stopped exchanging pleasantries so they could get started with business.</p>
 <p>“We may start now. I believe Deputy President Zhuang can’t wait anymore, right?” said Feng Wuhen as he looked at the porcelain bottle on the table. This bottle had attracted his attention ever since he had entered.</p>
 <p>“If I am correct, pills requiring a bottle like this must be the Feature Locking Pill, right?” Feng Wuhen immediately revealed his insight that far surpassed others. Witnessing this, the final trace of hope vanished from Zhuang Ming’s heart.</p>
 <p><em>I’m finished! It will definitely be a great loss!</em></p>
 <p>“If I remember correctly, the last time one of these appeared was two years ago. At that time, three of them were sold. The highest price was 5 billion Amethyst Coins while the lowest price was 2.5 billion Amethyst Coins.”</p>
 <p>After Feng Wuhen spoke, Bai Xiaofei turned and looked at Zhuang Ming, “Is Brother Feng correct?”</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Zhuang Ming had to force himself to answer this question.</p>
 <p>“Things are usually overpriced in auctions. Of course, I am not going to make things difficult for you, Deputy President Zhuang. Let’s value the pills at two billion Amethyst Coins each. If you agree, I will take all seven of them,” Bai Xiaofei bargained ruthlessly, speaking like he had not heard the highest price at all. Yet Zhuang Ming had no choice but to accept it.</p>
 <p>“Fine!” Zhuang Ming endured. If he refused, it would probably be hard for them to continue this deal. With a smile, Bai Xiaofei accepted the pills and gave one to Feng Wuhen.</p>
 <p>“Brother Feng, you won’t refuse my gift, right?”</p>
 <p>Feng Wuhen hesitated, but he eventually reached out for the pill. As for the suitable bottle to store this pill, he had one in his possession.</p>
 <p>“I’ll be taking this, then. Moving on, you don’t have to be so polite with me, Brother Bai.”</p>
 <p>The two exchanged smiles before shifting their gazes at Zhuang Ming.</p>
 <p>No words were necessary. It was time to move to the next item. Zhuang Ming struggled inwardly but still took out the second item. It was a completely black and odd-looking item that was reeking with a foul stench.</p>
 <p>When they saw it, Bai Xiaofei, Hu Xian’er, and Fang Ye frowned. On the other hand, Feng Wuhen was clearly astonished.</p>
 <p>“Blood Zoysia?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, it is Blood Zoysia. Moreover, it is no less than five hundred years old.”</p>
 <p>While Zhuang Ming spoke, he handed the Blood Zoysia to Feng Wuhen. Feng Wuhen took out a unique lens which he used to study the stinky black item. After a short while, he raised his head and looked at Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“This is a Blood Zoysia. A Blood Zoysia has two usages. First, it can be used for pill refinement. Any pills that can be used for the physical flesh will only need a tiny bit of it for the effect of the pills to double or more. Additionally, it is also the main ingredient for the Rebirth Pill. So long as the flesh has yet to rot, the Rebirth Pill will be able to raise one from death.</p>
 <p>“As for the second usage, one can directly consume it. A mouthful of Blood Zoysia can extend one’s life span by at least thirty years. Moreover, it can greatly enhance the physique of the one who eats it, and if one can eat the entirety of it alone, that person will be able to reach Martial Master Rank in both defense and offense, without any training. With proper training, the effect would be even better, but it is unknown how far one can reach with it.”</p>
 <p>While Feng Wuhen narrated, he was swallowing his saliva. The Blood Zoysia was simply too rare, and even he himself had only seen it in books before.</p>
 <p>“How much is it worth?” This was the only thing Bai Xiaofei cared about.</p>
 <p>“Based on the records, the last time one appeared, it was auctioned off at 900 billion Amethyst Coins. But that was twenty years ago…”</p>
 <p>After listening to Feng Wuhen’s explanation, Bai Xiaofei heaved a long breath of relief, whereas Zhuang Ming’s face turned incredibly bitter. In his original plan, this Blood Zoysia alone would have been enough to make up for the debt they owed Bai Xiaofei. But now, that was no longer possible.</p>
 <p>“Value it at 800 billion, and I’ll accept it!”</p>
 <p>Again, Bai Xiaofei bargained ruthlessly, causing Zhuang Ming’s heart to ache greatly.</p>
 <p>“Brother Bai, that is too excessive. If we put this 500-year-old Blood Zoysia for auction—”</p>
 <p>“If you can actually find a buyer, feel free to do so. I am willing to give you one day to do so. For me, Amethyst Coins will be better than taking these items. In any case, it’s not like I need it badly. By the way, are you sure your headquarters know of the existence of this top-tier item here at your branch?”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately interrupted Zhuang Ming and gave a reply that rendered Zhuang Ming speechless. Indeed, their headquarters was unaware of the existence of this Blood Zoysia here…that was also why they had been able to keep this Blood Zoysia with them for so long. Back then, they had purchased this Blood Zoysia from a hunter who was unaware of its worth. And for their own benefits, they decided to keep it for themselves instead of handing it to the headquarters. In other words, this Blood Zoysia’s existence must be kept a secret…</p>
 <p>“Ok! 800 billion it is!” Zhuang Ming agreed. He was clenching his teeth so hard his teeth were probably going to shatter soon. If possible, he wished to slice Bai Xiaofei into pieces. But since they were currently within the Starnet Academy, he did not dare perform such an act.</p>
 <p>It would not be an exaggeration to say that Lei Shan was capable of reaching any corner of the academy at any moment he wished. Thus, one would never touch a Starnet Academy student within the academy unless one was prepared to die together with the student.</p>
 <p>Alas, Zhuang Ming did not have the courage to die with Bai Xiaofei. And now, there were 1.826 trillion Amethyst Coins left to pay Bai Xiaofei.</p>
