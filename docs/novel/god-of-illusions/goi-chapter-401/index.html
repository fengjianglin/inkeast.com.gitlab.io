 <p>Chapter 401: Third-Party, the Globe Merchant Group!</p> 
 <p>“Sometimes you need to take responsibility for your words.” Imperial Concubine Qing’s voice suddenly turned frosty, the threat it contained was obvious.</p> 
 <p>“I know exactly what I am talking about. You are at least Master Rank; I just don’t know what your ability is,” Bai Xiaofei repeated.</p> 
 <p>However, the reaction of the imperial concubine was completely different from that just now. She clapped her hands. Full of smiles, she directly turned around.</p> 
 <p>Immediately turning away, Bai Xiaofei dodged a bullet.</p> 
 <p>“Come and help me comb my hair.”</p> 
 <p>Stunned, when Bai Xiaofei looked over, he found that she was no longer in front of him. He turned around to see that Imperial Concubine Qing, wearing only a loose robe, was already seated at the dressing table. Her wet hair was quickly dried with the help of a special energy appliance.</p> 
 <p>The topic was once again interrupted like that. Bai Xiaofei reluctantly walked up behind her.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know how to comb hair,” he said as he stood behind her like a piece of wood.</p> 
 <p>“Everything has a first time. Now that I’m letting you use my hair for practice, what are you afraid of? But be gentle, I will get hurt.” Imperial Concubine Qing looked back at him, her expression exuding an unspeakable temptation.</p> 
 <p>Out of excuses to refuse this time, Bai Xiaofei silently took the comb from her hand and gently held her silky long hair.</p> 
 <p>“Tell me, what do you think of the current situation?” They finally got back to business, and it was surprisingly Imperial Concubine Qing who spoke first.</p> 
 <p>“The Bright Road Merchant House is just a pawn. Someone wants to use them to lure out the Thunderstorm Bandits, but I don’t know who. Moreover, I’m curious why the Ancient Yue royal family’s attitude is so ambiguous. Under normal circumstances, you guys can’t just sit idly, right?” Bai Xiaofei put forward his questions after summing up the event. This time, his attitude was much more relaxed. He didn’t keep probing whether Imperial Concubine Qing was a puppet master. She obviously blew up when he mentioned this.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t want to let his hard-earned communication opportunity slip away.</p> 
 <p>“You’re actually so outstanding. I really underestimated you.” There was a hint of surprise in the imperial concubine’s voice.</p> 
 <p>“Please elaborate?” Bai Xiaofei frowned a little, he could hear the implications in her words.</p> 
 <p>“You were able to find such a thin line within so much trivial information without any mistakes, shouldn’t I be surprised?”</p> 
 <p>Upon her answer, Bai Xiaofei’s eyes lit up. His guess was right! However, this was just the beginning. It was too early to be happy until he got more information out of her.</p> 
 <p>“Without mistakes or not, no one will know until the end. I won’t believe everything you say. I’m just here to know what I need to know,” Bai Xiaofei said indifferently. In the mirror, Imperial Concubine Qing smiled.</p> 
 <p>“Very wise, you really can’t believe everything I say. The most deceptive thing in the world is beauty, right? Then again, do you think I’m beautiful?” She stroked her fine clear skin and looked into Bai Xiaofei’s eyes through the mirror.</p> 
 <p>“Do you want to hear the truth or a lie?” Bai Xiaofei’s hand stopped briefly at this and he looked back at her.</p> 
 <p>“The truth, of course.”</p> 
 <p>“Beautiful. You are very much worthy of this word. You have the kind of beauty that when men see you, they can’t suppress their impulses. Time leaves no traces on your face, and only increases your charm,” Bai Xiaofei paused a little and swallowed a mouthful of saliva. “Moreover, you know men so well that you know how to fully arouse their appetite.”</p> 
 <p>Indeed…</p> 
 <p>“Haha, what a sweet mouth you have.” After hearing Bai Xiaofei’s evaluation, Imperial Concubine Qing laughed heartily.</p> 
 <p>“Not sweet, it’s just an objective evaluation.” Bai Xiaofei’s expression was serious. Indeed, it didn’t look like flattery.</p> 
 <p>“What about you? Do you have that kind of impulse that men have when you see me?” The Imperial Concubine grabbed Bai Xiaofei’s hand and pressed it on her shoulder. Through the silk, he could distinctly feel her soft skin.</p> 
 <p>“I’m a normal man, so I have impulses, but I can control them. After all, I have seen the most attractive woman in the world.” Trying to calm his restless heart, Bai Xiaofei used thoughts of Hu Xian’er to wake himself up. Unfortunately, under such conditions, all he could think of was indescribable scenes and it backfired…</p> 
 <p>“Don’t you know it’s taboo to mention a woman in front of another?” Imperial Concubine Qing’s tone was full of displeasure, but the kind that sounded like she was asking for comfort.</p> 
 <p>“You asked me, and I just answered,” Bai Xiaofei responded indifferently. He didn’t want to develop anything with the imperial concubine.</p> 
 <p>“I’m done asking. Your turn, but since you upset me, I’ll only answer three questions.” She smiled slightly.</p> 
 <p>Upon her words, Bai Xiaofei immediately wished that time could go back two minutes.</p> 
 <p><em>Why didn’t you say this earlier?! If I knew, I would have praised you to the sky!</em></p> 
 <p>Anyhow, Bai Xiaofei could only accept his fate.</p> 
 <p>“Why does the royal family ignore the Bright Road Merchant House?” This was the biggest key problem. Unless it was solved, he wouldn’t be able to connect anything.</p> 
 <p>“The Globe Merchant House. They wanted Ancient Yue to help take down the Thunderstorm Bandits. However, the Thunderstorm Bandits’ infamy is right there. Ancient Yue doesn't dare to make a move against them, so it became the current ambiguous state where it helps neither.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s eyes widened. The third party that he was looking for appeared! With this, many questions could be answered!</p> 
 <p>The Thunderstorm Bandits must have gotten the news that the Globe Merchant Group deliberately leaked and came all the way here to prey on the Bright Road Merchant House. As for what Shang Youdao swore about taking care of the aftermath very cleanly, it was just a smokescreen that the Globe Merchant Group wanted him to believe. In terms of power, the Bright Road Merchant House might not even be an ant compared to the Globe Merchant Group.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, Bai Xiaofei could be certain that the one behind the chaos at the banquet belonged to the Globe Merchant Group. One purpose was to destroy his and Shang Youdao’s plan, and the other was to warn the royal family to quickly take action.</p> 
 <p>By now, Bai Xiaofei completely strung together everything. To put it bluntly, this was a hunt by the Globe Merchant Group for the Thunderstorm Bandits!</p> 
 <p>As for the reason, it was very likely that the Thunderstorm Bandits angered the Globe Merchant Group in its previous heist. As a top organization, it was normal that the Globe Merchant Group would not endure it silently.</p> 
 <p>However, new questions also appeared.</p> 
 <p><em>Why choose the Bright Road Merchant House as the battleground? Wouldn’t it be better to resolve everything in the territory of the Globe Merchant House?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Why did the Thunderstorm Bandits still jump at this when they probably knew that this was a trap of the Globe Merchant Group? Is what the Skypatch Pill can bring to them so important?</em></p> 
 <p>Everything until now was still just the tip of the iceberg. But…</p> 
 <p><em>It keeps getting more and more interesting!</em></p>
