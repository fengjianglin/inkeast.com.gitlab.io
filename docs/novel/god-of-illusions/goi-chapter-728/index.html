 <p>Chapter 728: A Walk in the Park; Facing Leng Hen!</p> 
 <p>The distance from the Holy Snow Mountain to the capital of the Snow Kingdom wasn’t far, especially with decent transportation means. In less than an hour, Bai Xiaofei’s group arrived at the imperial city gates.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Orton and his Snow Lion Corps had only started pursuit as they had spent too much time digging themselves out of the snow. When they returned to the capital, Bai Xiaofei would have long seen Leng Hen.</p> 
 <p>“How do we get in?”</p> 
 <p>Standing at the gate of the city, Cang Lan stunned everyone with his question. Only Bai Xiaofei revealed a knowing smile.</p> 
 <p><em>The old man is still as funny as ever!</em></p> 
 <p>“Fight our way in, of course.” Bai Xiaofei’s reply was frightening.</p> 
 <p><em>Fighting our way into the capital of the Snow Kingdom? That’s…</em></p> 
 <p><em>Interesting!</em></p> 
 <p>“I’ll go first!” The resurrected zither expert stepped forward. Along the way, Bai Xiaofei had finally known his name: Wen Xiaoyao.</p> 
 <p>A soft melody sounded. It was a joy to the ears for Bai Xiaofei’s group, but not so much to the soldiers.</p> 
 <p>“Enemy… enemy attack!”</p> 
 <p>The soldiers on the wall shouted with difficulty before falling down while clutching their heads and rolled around on the floor. However, thanks to their qualities as entrance guards, they managed to pull the lever to close the gates before losing the ability to act.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, the city gates were not strong enough.</p> 
 <p>Fan Xingyu stepped forward with his hand on the handle of his sheathed sword. After a brief period of mobilizing his energy, he executed a slash so swift that the rest felt like he hadn’t done anything at all.</p> 
 <p>However, a thin mark on the thick gates proved otherwise, before it crumbled from a gentle push by Fan Xingyu. His charged attack could even split the demon king’s attack, let alone these small city gates.</p> 
 <p>Entering the city unimpeded, the group walked on the main road leading to the imperial area like they were taking a leisurely stroll in the park.</p> 
 <p>At that moment, the reinforcement soldiers arrived and shot a rain of arrows at them, but right before the arrows could hit, they were stopped dead in mid-air as if grasped by something invisible. Then, with a gentle wave of Lin Nishang’s hand, the arrows fell to the ground. Seeing this, the soldiers froze.</p> 
 <p>The next second, Tu Ying shot out before returning to the group like a flash of lightning. By the time the group walked to the soldiers, they had all collapsed.</p> 
 <p>After handling the outer area’s garrison troops, the group smoothly arrived at the entrance of the imperial ground where the royal guards quickly surrounded them. However, before the guards could say anything, Cang Lan had raised his hand. The guards found themselves unable to move no matter how hard they struggled.</p> 
 <p>Ferret then opened the Hellfire Realm and a raging flame turned the entrance gate into ashes. The members of the Hellfire Brigade contributed two shots, and the entire inner gates crumbled as well.</p> 
 <p>The group stepped over the ashes and continued forward at a constant pace with indifferent expressions. Just like that, they slowly approached the palace, where twelve Grandmaster Rank puppet masters rushed out. However, they were greeted with a sweep of Jiao He’s spear.</p> 
 <p>Within thirty exchanges, all twelve puppet masters fell.</p> 
 <p>When Jiao He returned to the group, Bai Xiaofei had fused with Blackie, right before two Exquisite Rank puppet masters appeared in their path. Before the two could attack, Bai Xiaofei had teleported behind them and imprisoned them in a black cage, then used Devouring the Heaven and Earth and drained their energy in a second.</p> 
 <p>After Bai Xiaofei devoured the demon king’s energy, ordinary Exquisite Rank puppet masters could no longer pose any threat to him!</p> 
 <p>In this way, the group cleaned all the obstacles and went straight into the main palace hall, where they saw trembling court ministers standing protectively in front of Leng Hen.</p> 
 <p>“Master Cang Lan, what do you mean by this?” Leng Hen was respectful to Cang Lan, and his question was directed at Cang Lan because the latter was the only one he knew among the other party.</p> 
 <p>“Look clearly, it’s not me who is at the front.” Cang Lan pushed Bai Xiaofei forward.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei smiled as he looked at his future father-in-law who finally placed his eyes on him, but the moment their eyes met, Bai Xiaofei didn’t have the feeling of facing one’s father-in-law at all. Similarly, Leng Hen could not believe that the young man in front of him was the Bai Xiaofei that Leng Liushuang had mentioned.</p> 
 <p>“Bai Xiaofei greets His Majesty. As the holder of Starnet Brilliances, I am afraid I cannot bow to you.” Bai Xiaofei’s reason was sufficient. The Starnet Brilliance represented the glory of Starnet Academy, the particularity of which could override the etiquettes of any country. Even if the one in front of Bai Xiaofei was the emperor of a great empire, he could also ignore him.</p> 
 <p>“If you represent Starnet, you naturally don’t have to bow.” Leng Hen’s response was outstanding. He not only used Bai Xiaofei’s reason to save face but also put a shackle on the latter. <em>Boy, if you represent Starnet Academy, you should know the consequences of making a ruckus here!</em></p> 
 <p>“Wearing the Starnet Brilliance, I certainly represent the academy, but Marshal Orton does not seem to put Starnet in his eyes.”</p> 
 <p>Regarding putting people on the sport, Bai Xiaofei was also an expert. So far, no one could beat him in this kind of game yet. At least, not this time and not Leng Hen!</p> 
 <p>“I only sent Marshal Orton to your rescue. As for whether misunderstandings have arisen between you, the explanation will have to wait until Marshal Orton returns.” Leng Hen wasn’t an emperor for nothing. In just a sentence, he put the matter on hold until Orton’s return.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei refused to wait until Orton came back because it would not be certain if he would still have the upper hand then.</p> 
 <p>“That’s not necessary. The ones standing beside me are Wine God Cang Lan and Angelic Maiden Lin Nishang. Does Your Majesty think their weight is not enough? Or do you think they would join hands with this boy to deceive you?” Bai Xiaofei kicked back the ball after adding more weight to it.</p> 
 <p>There were three known Legend Rank puppet masters on the continent, and there were few who really dared to provoke even just one, let alone two of them together. Therefore, Orton’s guts were questionably big. Even Leng Hen didn’t have that kind of guts.</p> 
 <p>“Naturally not!” Leng Hen said as he inwardly raised a flag. He looked at Bai Xiaofei observantly.</p> 
 <p><em>How is this boy so difficult?!</em></p>
