 <p>Chapter 773: Pure Interest!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s declaration caused an uproar. Discussions emerged from the audience as some even threatened to teach him a lesson.</p> 
 <p>Then, Bai Xiaofei ordered the three experts to go out and deal with them.</p> 
 <p>“Our young master said that if you want to fight, we will comply, right here, right now.” Shaman King’s voice faintly echoed.</p> 
 <p>Looking in his direction, everyone was stupefied.</p> 
 <p><em>When did these three get together?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Wait! Could the one up there be that boy who led them to walk around yesterday?!</em></p> 
 <p>As astonishment and horror replaced their anger, everyone quieted down. There were few who were willing to offend any of these three experts in Windlove, let alone all three of them together. No one would say a word as long as their brains were still working.</p> 
 <p>Between one’s face and life, most people would choose the latter. After all, losing your life meant losing everything, and there was a good chance that no one would even remember your so-called integrity!</p> 
 <p>“Ladies and gentlemen, the first warm-up ends here. Even if you missed something, please rest assured that there will be more good products to come!” Qing Han, sensing that the atmosphere was tense, immediately offered the audience a lifeline.</p> 
 <p>Then, a row of Unify Business’ staff came out to deliver delicate snacks and offer other services to the guests.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Qing Han made use of the recess time to knock on Bai Xiaofei’s door. Hearing the permission from inside, he donned a smile and opened the door. After entering the private room, he shot an inquiring glance at his little sister. Unfortunately, Qing Ya’s response was a helpless look.</p> 
 <p>She could not dig out any useful information at all!</p> 
 <p>“Young Master Bai, here are the items you won in the first stage, a total of seven pieces,” said Qing Han.</p> 
 <p>The seven staff behind him went up to Bai Xiaofei and presented him with seven trays. Besides the Elf Nectar and the gun puppet Into Oblivion, there were three violet-grade puppets and two high-grade origin devices.</p> 
 <p>“Mengqi,” Bai Xiaofei lightly called.</p> 
 <p>Rui Mengqi immediately stepped forward to put everything away. The payment had already been transferred to Qing Ya, so this was all just a formality.</p> 
 <p>“Young Master Bai, there is something I would like to discuss with you,” Qing Han bit the bullet and said after some hesitation. Inwardly, he was nervous.</p> 
 <p>Although Unify Business was powerful enough to shelter him, what he was worried about was that Bai Xiaofei would start a fight when angered. After all, none of the three Exquisite Ranks standing behind him was a simple character.</p> 
 <p>“If it is about the auction, then words are needless. As long as it is something I am interested in, I will not let go,” Bai Xiaofei directly shut Qing Han down before he could say anything.</p> 
 <p>“Young Master Bai, although you do have this ability, please consider us a little. If all the items are taken away by you, we will be troubled,” Qing Han’s tone went from consultative to pleading.</p> 
 <p>“You open an auction house as your business and you are afraid of this? Could it be that I’ve seen too little of the world?” Bai Xiaofei acted as if he had just heard the biggest joke. His strange smile put Qing Han in a hard place.</p> 
 <p>“Windlove City is not like any other. Even Unify Business has to be scrupulous here. Moreover, this is the biggest auction of the year, we can’t afford the consequences of making all of those people come all the way here for nothing.” Qing Han paused before adding, “If Young Master Bai is willing to do us this favor, Unify will prepare a big gift for you, plus a 15% credit limit and a 20% discount on all of your purchases from our business!”</p> 
 <p>Qing Han offered his greatest sincerity. Moreover, in his opinion, Bai Xiaofei’s bidding manner would help raise the price so much that they would still earn big even after giving him the discount.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, Qing Han thought too much…</p> 
 <p>“Then, it depends on whether your gift is good enough.” With a pondering smile, Bai Xiaofei leaned back on the soft sofa.</p> 
 <p>“Although Into Oblivion is good, it can’t even add icing on the cake for puppet masters who already have formed a line-up. But giving it to a puppet master-in-training, they’ll likely throw it away during their growth,” Qing Han said and took out a small wooden box. Although sealed, it couldn’t stop a strong medicinal fragrance from spreading.</p> 
 <p>This rich fragrance alone stirred the energy in Bai Xiaofei’s body! He had seen his fair share of grade seven and eight pills but none of them was able to cause such reaction, so it was easy to guess what was in the box –</p> 
 <p>A grade-nine pill!</p> 
 <p>“Making me give up on such a good puppet for a ‘perhaps’ grade-nine pill? What a joke,” Bai Xiaofei reacted with disdain before Qing Han could say anything.</p> 
 <p>“Young Master Bai, if this was any other grade-nine pill, I would not take it out, but this one will satisfy you!” Qing Han opened the box and revealed the pill to everyone.</p> 
 <p>The pill was only the size of a longan, and the surface of this lilac-colored pill was covered with fine gold threads that constituted nine vivid golden dragons!</p> 
 <p>“Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill?!!” Rui Mengqi yelled in shock before Bai Xiaofei was able to ask what it was.</p> 
 <p>When Rui Mengqi was still working in the Babel Merchant House, she had seen this pill on the rare oddity codex, where it was listed as a must-get product!</p> 
 <p>Because the only alchemist who could refine it was dead!</p> 
 <p>“Indeed it is. I don’t think I need to explain its efficacy,” said Qing Han proudly. The pill was originally the finale of today’s auction, but was not impossible to give up as long as it could stop Bai Xiaofei’s spree. After all, all of the auctioned items were only Amethyst Coins for Unify Business in the end.</p> 
 <p>“Put it down and you can leave. I’ll try not to bid unless it’s an item that I’m particularly interested in,” Bai Xiaofei indifferently dismissed Qing Han. Although Bai Xiaofei had no idea what the Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill was, he had confidence in Rui Mengqi.</p> 
 <p>As Qing Han left, Qing Ya went up to him.</p> 
 <p>“Young Master Bai, if you would like, I will give you a detailed introduction to the Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill.” Qing Ya’s keen perceptiveness noticed Bai Xiaofei’s reaction the moment the box was opened.</p> 
 <p><em>He doesn’t know anything about it at all!</em></p> 
 <p>“How do you know I don’t know about this pill?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei tilted his head at her, having no intention to hide it. She had a good eye, but he was a master in playing psychology!</p> 
 <p>“Just from experience. Forgive me if I’ve offended you, Young Master,” Qing Ya said slowly.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei suddenly felt interested in her for the first time, pure interest!</p>
