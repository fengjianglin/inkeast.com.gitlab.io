 <p>Chapter 369: Hu Xian’er’s Little Selfish Idea…</p> 
 <p>“When you’ve matured, remember to come to the Kingdom of Snow to propose. If you don’t come, the three of us may very well be miserable,” said Leng Liuli seriously after Bai Xiaofei accepted the three tokens.</p> 
 <p>This was definitely the most passive Bai Xiaofei had ever been in his life. Since entering the room, he had not taken the initiative for a second. However, he was very touched.</p> 
 <p>He knew that the three girls did it on purpose in order not to let him face the problem, while they kept all the feelings of injustice for themselves. With their status, no man who obtained their love would be able to lay hands on other women.</p> 
 <p>But in front of Bai Xiaofei, they could only surrender.</p> 
 <p>He didn’t know what Hu Xian’er said to them, but at this moment, he really didn’t know what to say except to sigh about how lucky he was.</p> 
 <p><em>I must have accumulated a lot of merit in my previous life! Yes, this must be the case!</em></p> 
 <p>“I will!” Gulping, Bai Xiaofei nodded seriously and took note of a new to-do in his heart.</p> 
 <p>“Also, you are not allowed to try any dirty ideas on us before you propose. According to the rules of the Snow Kingdom, if we lose our virginity before getting married, we will be sacrificed to the Heavens!” Leng Liuying warned as she glared at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry. <em>Do I look like such a dishonest person?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Yes, you do! Very much!</em></p> 
 <p>“If you can’t help it, you can go to Sister Liuyun and the others. They don’t have such a tradition, but it will depend on your efforts if they’ll agree. Of course, if you really, really can’t help it, we can still help. It’s simple for us to provide medicine after the meal.”</p> 
 <p>Leng Liu spoke again and even raised an eyebrow. Her playful look nearly drove Bai Xiaofei out of control…</p> 
 <p><em>Cough, cough, be serious, be serious!</em></p> 
 <p>“No need, no need…” Fighting back the urge in his heart, Bai Xiaofei hurriedly rejected her ‘kindness.’ Then, he suddenly thought of something and took out a porcelain bottle from his storage ring. “By the way, this is for you guys.”</p> 
 <p>Feature Locking Pills!</p> 
 <p>“Although it’s not as meaningful as what you gave me, this is the only decent thing I have for now.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei handed over the bottle. When the three girls saw the pills inside, their eyes lit up.</p> 
 <p>“If you give this to us, what about the rewards for the competition?”</p> 
 <p>Leng Liushuang was definitely the most caring and thoughtful one, the first thing that came to her mind was whether this would trouble him.</p> 
 <p>“You silly. Someone like him who can give away three Feature Locking Pills as rewards must have at least eight or ten in his hands. What are you worried about?”</p> 
 <p>Before he could answer, Leng Liuli knuckled Leng Liushuang’s head, while the person of interest, Bai Xiaofei, was speechless.</p> 
 <p><em>Heaven and earth can be my witness! What kind of person do you think I am?!</em></p> 
 <p>Ignoring Bai Xiaofei’s reaction, the triplets ate the pills right away.</p> 
 <p>This year they were eighteen years old and at the prime of their youth, whatever that could develop had already fully developed. Therefore, it was absolutely the most suitable time for them to use the Feature Locking Pills.</p> 
 <p>When the pills reached their stomachs, wisps of light milky light instantly enveloped them. A moment later, the light dispersed and their skin was flush with a glossy luster. Coupled with the fact that they had the best skin among all the people Bai Xiaofei had seen, the pills brought out the best in them and added a trace of ethereal temperament.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, consider that you’ve passed this trial, but remember what we told you!” Feeling the changes in herself, Leng Liuli looked satisfied.</p> 
 <p>The Feature Locking Pill definitely satisfied all women’s expectations for a gift! This was why when Bai Xiaofei took them out, the girls on the Blossom Ranking were swept off their feet.</p> 
 <p>“Then I…”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei hadn’t finished his words when the triplets flocked to him. Three sudden kisses instantly disrupted all of his thoughts. However, all three were brief, leaving Bai Xiaofei’s heart all hot and dry.</p> 
 <p>Looking at three stunning faces with different expressions, he swallowed several mouthfuls of saliva.</p> 
 <p>Twins were already a man’s dream. Now it was triplets!!!</p> 
 <p>“That’s a small reward! We want to rest, you can leave.” Leng Liuli shooed Bai Xiaofei with her hands behind her back. Bai Xiaofei could not help but be astonished by her playful, little-girl act.</p> 
 <p><em>This is the wise elder sister? Am I seeing wrong?</em></p> 
 <p>The question in his heart wasn’t answered as he was pushed out of the room by the three sisters. Just like when he first came in, Bai Xiaofei had no chance to take the initiative at all…</p> 
 <p>With a wry smile, Bai Xiaofei looked up at the sky and then gave a long sigh. <em>It seems like the days to come will be interesting!</em></p> 
 <p>Heh, it would be more than just interesting…</p> 
 <p>After Bai Xiaofei left, the triplets sat in the room, looking at each other strangely as a bizarre atmosphere brewed.</p> 
 <p>“Liushuang, you have to protect your bottom line!” Opening her mouth to speak, Leng Liuli directly pointed out the ‘weak link’ among the three.</p> 
 <p>“I’m perfectly good! It’s Liuying who whines about warming the bed every day. Now that it’s official, just be careful not to get eaten in bed!”</p> 
 <p>Leng Liushuang was very clever and only appeared gentle in certain situations. With a simple sentence, she directed the finger right at Leng Liuying.</p> 
 <p>In fact, the intelligence of the three decreased according to their order, and Leng Liuying’s acting like a bandit was actually to cover up this weakness…</p> 
 <p>“In his dreams! I’m not warming any bed!” Despite her pout, Leng Liuying couldn’t help but imagine them lying in bed as her face quickly reddened.</p> 
 <p>“Hah! What sophistry! Are you imagining yourself lying in bed?! Don’t forget that we are triplets!” Leng Liushuang again stabbed at her weak spot.</p> 
 <p>“Peh, peh, peh! Second Sister is to blame for talking nonsense. Take this!”</p> 
 <p>Shouting, the two sisters broke into a scuffle. Leng Liuli, who was secretly laughing while watching the show, was caught off guard and dragged into the fight.</p> 
 <p>Sounds of clothes being torn repeated again and again. If Bai Xiaofei hadn’t left, he would have died from having a nosebleed… This ‘little game’ among the three sisters was really a bit…</p> 
 <p>Interesting!!!</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei had just returned to his room when a familiar fragrance hit his nose. Before he could react, his coat had been taken off and a furry fox tail enveloped him.</p> 
 <p>“Well, did the negotiation go very smoothly?”</p> 
 <p>Leaning into Bai Xiaofei from behind, Hu Xian’er’s hot breath blew on his ear as she spoke, and all kinds of stimuli aroused his heart. Bai Xiaofei instantly expressed his respect.</p> 
 <p>“What did you…”</p> 
 <p>“Don’t mention them, you are mine tonight! If you don’t treat me well, I promise you won’t get a single one of them!”</p> 
 <p>The teasing with threats completely destroyed Bai Xiaofei’s defense.</p> 
 <p>“This is what you said, don’t blame me for being rough!” saying this, Bai Xiaofei mobilized the energy in his origin core.</p> 
 <p>“Ahhh! You are not allowed to use that thing!” As if recalling something, Hu Xian’er exclaimed.</p> 
 <p>“It’s too late!”</p> 
 <p>Did Hu Xian’er have selfish thoughts?</p> 
 <p>Of course she did!</p> 
 <p>However, it didn’t matter in front of Bai Xiaofei – They were two of a kind anyway.</p>
