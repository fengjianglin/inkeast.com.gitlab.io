 <p>Chapter 636: The Ceremony!</p> 
 <p>An Ming’s death seemed to accelerate the flow of time. The day after his burial was also the day that the one-month period came to an end.</p> 
 <p>Tranquil City, which had just finished a burial, started to bustle again. The death of a prince passed by just like that. Except to his mother and An Bang Ting, An Ming was no different than a normal person in the eyes of others, if he died then he died…</p> 
 <p>“Everything should be over today!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had put on formal clothes. The Leng sisters had also taken off their desert outfits and put on gorgeous dresses, looking like angels descending from the sky.</p> 
 <p>“Even if it’s not over, we can’t delay any longer. Grandpa said that he’d only stayed in the Snow Kingdom for four years, and now there’s only the month left. If we don’t get there before that, finding him would be like finding a needle in a haystack,” Leng Liuli reminded again as she had done before multiple times.</p> 
 <p>It was really hard to change Bai Xiaofei’s nosy character.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, no matter what, I won’t bother with any matters concerning this play after today,” said Bai Xiaofei with a smile. This promise relieved Leng Liuli a little.</p> 
 <p>“Master, the carriage is here,” announced a new waiter outside the door. It was not until now did the inn discover that Bai Xiaofei was more than just rich.</p> 
 <p>Outside was the most luxurious carriage in Tranquil, inferior only to the emperor’s. It was one pulled by seven Blackscale Horses!</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go before we get surrounded by onlookers.” Bai Xiaofei opened the door and walked down the stairs.</p> 
 <p>The inn was currently filled with royal guards, and all the other guests were blocked from coming out of their rooms. It was impossible for Bai Xiaofei’s so-called ‘get surrounded’ to happen.</p> 
 <p>“Greetings, Master Bai!”</p> 
 <p>The eunuch manager standing next to the carriage bowed slightly. Without giving him a glance, Bai Xiaofei’s group directly boarded the luxury carriage that could accommodate at least 20 people.</p> 
 <p>With the high-pitch shout of the eunuch manager, the guards retreated from the inn and solemnly guarded both sides of the carriage in two long lines. The carriage then moved slowly toward the square where An Bang Ting had met the city before…</p> 
 <p>Although the speed wasn’t fast, the square wasn’t far away and they arrived at the newly decorated square before long. Different from the hasty construction before, the whole square had undergone an earth-shaking change.</p> 
 <p>A tall stone platform stood in the center, on which were large and small tables where civil and military dignitaries were already seated. In the main position were An Bang Ting and the three princes who stood out from the crowd. The seats for Bai Xiaofei’s group were also there and were even higher than that of the three princes.</p> 
 <p>Under the platform was a super long royal banquet that covered the length of the whole square. All officials, businessmen, and people with some status in Tranquil City were fortunate enough to enjoy the glory that they might not be able to have all their lives – had a seat at this table.</p> 
 <p>Outside the square, spectating civilians had formed a sea of people. There were even people coming over from other cities. No one wanted to miss this grand ceremony that would determine the future of Tranquil.</p> 
 <p>“This student greets Teacher and the three ladies!” An Yue performed a big ceremonious greeting to Bai Xiaofei. It was his sincere gesture. In just one month, Bai Xiaofei had brought him great changes.</p> 
 <p>“You actually looked very spirited in formal clothes. No wonder for a prince!” Bai Xiaofei patted An Yue’s shoulder with a smile. Although he didn’t take An Yue as a disciple, he had taught An Yue as one during the past month. It was impossible for him not to feel anything.</p> 
 <p>“Nowhere as good-looking as you, Teacher.”</p> 
 <p>An Yue’s answer pleased Bai Xiaofei. It was not because he liked flattery, but that teaching An Yue what to say to which people on what kind of occasions was one of his lessons. It seemed that An Yue did a good job. At least, he was no longer that silly boy who only knew to smile foolishly a month ago.</p> 
 <p>“What I’ve taught you is not for you to use on me. I’ll be really happy to see you do well.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei went to his position and sat down. His seat was the most eye-catching because only he brought four people with him and these four people were all arranged to sit beside him.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei was not the last one to arrive this time. He chatted with the others for a long time before Zheng Gong and Zhi Daoyuan finally arrived in a dignified manner. After taking their seats, these two inadvertently glanced at Bai Xiaofei with vigilance and fear.</p> 
 <p>The letter sent by An Bang Ting to the Violethorn Empire had a reply. Liu Rushi didn’t flee to Violethorn at all, and under secret inquiry, it was learned that his life lamp at the Violetgold Merchant House had been extinguished.</p> 
 <p>Zheng Gong and Zhi Daoyuan had naturally heard about this as well. As far as they were concerned, Liu Rushi’s death definitely had something to do with Bai Xiaofei. They just couldn’t find a second person who could quietly kill a Grandmaster Rank puppet master within Tranquil City. But without conclusive evidence, no one dared to get on Bai Xiaofei’s bad side, so this could only remain speculation.</p> 
 <p>However, this did not stop them from keeping their guard up toward Bai Xiaofei…</p> 
 <p>With all the important people taking their seats one by one, An Bang Ting, the finale, also slowly boarded the tower surrounded by a group of attendants. As if to show his sincerity, he didn’t wear the dragon robe but let his attending eunuch respectfully carry it.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei didn’t see any difference whether he wore that outfit or not, because Tranquil was still under the control of An Bang Ting. It was possible that even the election of the new emperor was controlled by him.</p> 
 <p>Thinking of this, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help a wry smile. He had made so much effort to win over the royal guards only to realize that it might be unnecessary now!</p> 
 <p>After a silent greeting to Bai Xiaofei and the other two Grandmaster Ranks, An Bang Ting came to the front of the tower and faced the people below. The noisy square was instantly quiet.</p> 
 <p>“Many things have happened in the past month. This Tranquil Kingdom and its Tranquil City have been placed within a storm. Today is finally the time to end this. In a while, the three princes will publicly present what they have learned in the past month, and then, everyone here will hold the right to elect the new emperor!”</p> 
 <p>An Bang Ting paused a little. The people sitting below couldn’t help showing surprised expressions.</p> 
 <p>“Tranquil has never belonged to one person alone. This time, I hand over its future to you all. I hope each of you will seriously consider your choice and elect an emperor who can truly lead Tranquil to glory again! And I, I will pay for my mistakes as I have promised!”</p> 
 <p>At this announcement, everyone gulped. Even Bai Xiaofei frowned.</p> 
 <p><em>Will it really go as he said?</em></p>
