 <p>Chapter 780: I Dare You to Stay!</p> 
 <p>“If I tell you what you’re seeing right now is not the real me, will you still want to follow me?” Bai Xiaofei asked Qing Ya, his tone did not sound like he was joking.</p> 
 <p>“It has nothing to do with who you really are. In this city, few people are really themselves. I’m interested in you and not your identity.”</p> 
 <p>Qing Ya had already doubted that ‘Young Master Bai’ was real – his appearance in Windlove was too abrupt and there was no large clan surnamed Bai known on the continent. What finally confirmed her guess was his action of freeing Luo and Xia. At that moment, the fake identity that Bai Xiaofei had painstakingly established, collapsed!</p> 
 <p>“Alright then, sit down everyone, we are all family from now on.” With a smile, Bai Xiaofei accepted Qing Ya’s answer.</p> 
 <p>With some anxiety, Luo and Xia also sat down. Despite having expressed their stand, they were unfamiliar with Bai Xiaofei, while Bai Xiaofei could not help them adapt to their new situation immediately either. Moreover, the auction had continued to the finale of the Magical Beasts round.</p> 
 <p>Unlike the previous magical beasts that had been wheeled up on stage, the last one was packed in a transparent box made of unknown material. The box was only 60 square centimeters, filled with a floating gray fog.</p> 
 <p>“I think you already know what this one is. That’s right, this is a Ghosting. Although difficult to tame, once you succeed, the aid it provides will be extremely rewarding!” Qing Han’s voice was calm, but this calm stemmed from the confidence that the item would absolutely sell!</p> 
 <p>“What is a Ghosting?” Bai Xiaofei frowned. There were so many exotic magical beasts on the continent that it was extremely difficult to know them all.</p> 
 <p>“A parasitic magical beast without a concrete body, favored by all Assassin Stream puppet masters. However, Ghostings are born selfish. Once they sense the slightest danger, they will abandon the host or even betray the host to curry favor with the new host.” Qing Ya held no good feelings for Ghostings. They were an outstanding example of ‘a smart one submits to circumstances,’ in the most negative manner, of course.</p> 
 <p>“Is there anything that it’s scared of?” Bai Xiaofei’s lips curled up. He was tempted. Magical beasts that had moral principles were tough, while cowards like the Ghostings were easy to handle!</p> 
 <p>“Fire, lightning attacks, and mental attacks.” Qing Ya was not the chief auctioneer for nothing. Her encyclopedia-like brain contained all kinds of information on the continent.</p> 
 <p>During their conversation, the bidding price had been raised to a terrifying ten billion Amethyst Coins.</p> 
 <p>The enhancement that a Ghosting could give its master was tremendous. With good cooperation, an Assassin Stream puppet master could kill someone two ranks above them. Even for non-Assassin Stream puppet masters, a Ghosting could greatly improve their chances of survival as it could make the owner elusive!</p> 
 <p>Of course, the premise was that it did not betray the puppet master and that the puppet master had enough energy to feed it. Therefore, those who bid were puppet masters with confidence in their strength. At least, they felt that they would not be beaten by others to the point that their Ghosting would defect.</p> 
 <p>“Fifty billion.” Bai Xiaofei-style price-crushing once again began as his indifferent bidding rendered the whole auction house desperate.</p> 
 <p><em>Where the hell did this god of wealth jump out from, having so much money on him to slap people with!</em></p> 
 <p>“Fifty billion! Although this price is a bit high for a Ghosting, you all should know that this magical beast can only be encountered when the stars align!” Qing Han added oil to the fire upon seeing that the majority of the previous bidders still had not calmed down yet.</p> 
 <p>“Sixty billion!” Finally, someone stood up…</p> 
 <p>Only to get more of Bai Xiaofei’s cruel crushing bid, “Eighty billion!”</p> 
 <p>“One hundred billion!” But the fellow immediately added 20 billion!</p> 
 <p>This time, Bai Xiaofei hesitated. He could call higher, but from the beginning to the present, out of the money that Feng Wuhen sent him, nearly one-fifth had been spent. If they kept bidding like this, the price of the Ghosting would probably rise to the point that he would not have enough for the Slave auction…</p> 
 <p>“One hundred and ten billion, this is my last bid. If you go higher than this, the Ghosting is yours for the time being,” Bai Xiaofei said calmly, the threat in his words could not be more obvious.</p> 
 <p><em>Only yours for the time being!</em></p> 
 <p>“Threaten me? Brat, you’re still too green! You think you can be the boss in Windlove with those three rubbish by your side? They were infants when I made my name! One hundred and twenty billion!” The other bidder stood up and took off his cloak and hat.</p> 
 <p>The next second, the whole hall gasped.</p> 
 <p><em>Dragon King!</em></p> 
 <p>Dragon King, who was notorious all over Windlove in his early years, was rumored to have been besieged and killed by his enemies. Now it seemed that the rumor was false, but the ferocious scar on his face showed that he only narrowly escaped.</p> 
 <p>“Dragon King? I hope your Nine Dragons Technique has reached level nine, or else you will be too boring for an opponent,“ Bai Xiaofei retorted coldly after getting Dragon King’s information from Qing Ya.</p> 
 <p>Dragon King was an Exquisite Rank with nine apertures opened, a Melee Stream puppet master. His cultivation technique Nine Dragons allowed him to have no noticeable shortcomings. To win against him, the only way was to overwhelm him with power.</p> 
 <p>He had an unpredictable temper and was hunted by the Ethereal Empire after massacring a city, which resulted in him fleeing Windlove City and living in anonymity. Until now, the Ethereal Empire still offered a reward on his head.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t bother with this. As long as you dare to find me, I will let you know that you’re still too small in this world!” With a cold snort, Dragon King got up to leave the auction house. Despite his tough mouth, however, his heart was somewhat anxious.</p> 
 <p>The greatest horror was not confronting a strong enemy, but the fear of the unknown, and Dragon King knew nothing about Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Are you fleeing? Stay if you have the guts!“ Bai Xiaofei’s faint voice echoed before Dragon King could go too far.</p> 
 <p>The hall fell into silence. To stay or not to stay? If Dragon King left, his face would be lost; but if he stayed, what he would face was an extremely confident opponent!</p> 
 <p>“Brat, you are not that worthy!” With another cold snort, Dragon King returned to his seat. Reality proved that even great people had their troubles: they needed face!</p> 
 <p>Seeing Dragon King sit down, some people could not sit still…</p>
