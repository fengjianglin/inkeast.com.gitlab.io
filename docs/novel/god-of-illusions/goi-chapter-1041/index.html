 <p>Chapter 1041: Giving You A Choice!</p> 
 <p>“My lord, this can’t continue, or our people will all die!”</p> 
 <p>In the city lord’s mansion, the mighty leader of the Nine Dragons Army was sobbing. He had always regarded his soldiers as brothers, and now, his brothers were dying every minute.</p> 
 <p>“Wait a little more. And you are not the only one devastated by their deaths,” said the city lord sincerely and solemnly. </p> 
 <p>Although the Nine Dragons Army leader knew what the city lord was doing, he still could not accept it.</p> 
 <p>“If you want to test their strength, then send me! I will figure them out for you!!” he shouted in a hoarse voice, but that only earned a glare from the city lord.</p> 
 <p>“You want to disobey my orders now?! The Nine Dragons Army has existed as long as you do. Do you think you can handle several thousand heavy gun puppets?!”</p> 
 <p>The city lord knew full well what kind of enemies they were facing. Gun puppet armies had always been the wish of many nations, but because of the limited purchase that the Ethereal Empire imposed on gun puppets, no nation could officially form such an army. Even Ethereal could not as the other nations joined hands to restrain it and therefore their gun puppet forces could only exist as the major clans’ private armies.</p> 
 <p>“You’re saying we should just watch our hard-trained Nine Dragons Army get destroyed?!” Being drained of all strength and will to fight, the Nine Dragons Army leader had never looked so dispirited.</p> 
 <p>“The Nine Dragons Army was established with the purpose to help our city tide over difficult times. Now is one of those times where they can show their value. As long as they survive, the Fourth Prince will not mistreat us and we can build as many Nine Dragons Armies as we want!” said the city lord coldly, having no intention to hide his thoughts at all.</p> 
 <p>“That’s right! The Fourth Prince! We can ask him for help! You are a peak Exquisite Rank puppet master!! His Royal Highness will not sit idly by!!” The Nine Dragons Army leader’s eyes lit up with hope.</p> 
 <p>“Far water cannot put out this fire. We only have ourselves to rely on at the moment. As long as we survive this ordeal, we will have more weight in the Fourth Prince’s party!” The city lord’s lips curled up, vividly portraying the image of an ambitious ruler.</p> 
 <p>“More weight?” The army leader frowned. He really couldn’t think of what good this calamity could bring to Nine Dragons City.</p> 
 <p>“Those invaders obviously have a purpose. No matter which prince they are aiming at, if we make them submit to us, it will not only prove our strength but also make us famous. When that happens, we won’t have to nest in this desolate place so far away from the imperial city!” the city lord explained and stood up. At that moment, his body suddenly emitted a dazzling light. “Finally. So that’s what you rely on!”</p> 
 <p>Seeing that the city lord was ready to make a move, the army leader smiled brightly. “I’ll go set up an Energy Gathering Formation!”</p> 
 <p>As the army leader ran out to prepare, the city lord turned a golden light and disappeared on the spot.</p> 
 <p>“The city lord is out!” The city lord’s energy fluctuation was immediately noticed by the Illusion Sword members and gathered their attention.</p> 
 <p>They who had been on a killing spree conveniently fired their guns. Bullets shot out from all directions, but before they could hit the city lord, a blinding light enveloped him and nine humanoid puppets appeared, blocking all attacks!</p> 
 <p>They were the Nine Dragons Puppets, the famous puppet set of the Nine Dragons city lord that was made of top-class materials. Each puppet had its own unique abilities and due to the city lord’s special physique, they could even think and make their own decisions!</p> 
 <p>It was because of the city lord’s special physique that the Nine Dragons Puppets were known as puppets who had infinite proximity to humans, but with a much stronger physical body!</p> 
 <p>After the nine puppets blocked the first wave of attacks, one of them separated from the defensive circle and opened its mouth, unleashing eerily soundwaves. The Illusion Sword members who had just attacked clutched their heads and collapsed!</p> 
 <p>“While you can teleport, the distance is limited. I only have to include the vicinity in my attack range and it’s not a difficult thing for me at all,” said the city lord as his puppet increased the intensity of the sonic waves.</p> 
 <p>The affected Illusion Sword members began to bleed from their noses, their cries of agony transmitted to their comrades through the Concentric Knots.</p> 
 <p>“Into Oblivion!”</p> 
 <p>At that critical moment, a dark beam of light suddenly shot at the city lord at lightning speed!</p> 
 <p>“Insect…”</p> 
 <p>Before the city lord could finish his words, the sound puppet was hit by the black beam and evaporated into nothingness. The feedback due to its spiritual link with the city lord made him spit out a mouthful of blood.</p> 
 <p>“How… how is that possible?!” Gasping, the city lord was overtaken by disbelief. Although his sound puppet was an offensive-type, its materials were nothing that should have been destroyed in a single blow!</p> 
 <p>“Nothing is impossible, your knowledge is just limited.” Fang Ye appeared with a faint smile.</p> 
 <p>Feeling Fang Ye’s energy fluctuation, the city lord’s eyes widened.</p> 
 <p>“One-aperture Exquisite Rank?!!”</p> 
 <p>The city lord’s shock was not unwarranted. Even a four-aperture puppet master couldn’t instantly destroy his puppet after a long energy accumulation, let alone a one-aperture one.</p> 
 <p>“Who are you?!” the city lord questioned through gritted teeth, feeling apprehensive about facing Fang Ye.</p> 
 <p>Little did he know that Fang Ye could only do such an attack once. What he used just now to attack wasn’t his own strength, but borrowed from the Immovable Bracelet. This was the first time he had used the bracelet ever since getting it. If it weren’t that the Nine Dragons city lord was well-known for having a never-failing life-saving method, Fang Ye would have aimed the black beam at him.</p> 
 <p>“Acting President of the Illusion Demon Merchant Group, Fang Ye,” replied Fang Ye as he rested Into Oblivion on his shoulder.</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye’s fearless appearance made the city lord hesitate. He then came up with another idea to salvage his situation. “For a merchant group to set up such a private army, and then openly come to our Cloudveil Empire to make a fuss… You really are too conceited!!”</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, the city lord overestimated his plan.</p> 
 <p>“Our merchant group does not need your worry, City Lord. Now, I’ll give you a choice.” Fang Ye’s energy started surging. “Are you going kill yourself or wait for me to turn you into a corpse?”</p>
