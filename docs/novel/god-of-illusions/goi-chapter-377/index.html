 <p>Chapter 377: Forming Teams and Relaxed Competition!</p> 
 <p>Three days’ rest time passed in the blink of an eye. Early on the fourth day, the 300 participants began to utilize their influence to find teammates.</p> 
 <p>After obtaining consent from most of them, Bai Xiaofei recorded their process of finding teammates. This would result in a win-win situation for both sides. After the broadcast of these recordings, these girls would gain popularity while Bai Xiaofei gained Amethyst Coins…</p> 
 <p>Of course, Hu Xian’er and the others weren’t not included. They just needed to wait.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei wasn’t stupid enough to run around doing things on his own. Instead, he announced a recruitment through the Bounty Ranking with a reward generous enough to excite a good number of people.</p> 
 <p>Giving Lu Lingyun full control on this matter, Bai Xiaofei handed him the list of recruitment requirements that he spent the previous night composing. After all, Bai Xiaofei was the organizer of the competition. There would inevitably be a scandal if he openly intervened with the forming of teams.</p> 
 <p>For the next three days, everyone was busy running all over the place. It was not easy to form a perfect team, and many participants even encountered people with unreasonable demands.</p> 
 <p>The participants had their own bottom lines. Although they were in a hurry, they weren’t foolish to the point of betraying their own conscience. For them, being true to themselves was much more valuable.</p> 
 <p>As for Lu Lingyun, he had lost count of how many people he had seen in these three days. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that the generous rewards attracted many brave souls. It even attracted elites on the Combat Rankings!</p> 
 <p>Lu Lingyun’s task was to select the best among them and then combine them according to Bai Xiaofei’s requirements.</p> 
 <p>In the end, Lu Lingyun didn’t disappoint. Several impeccable teams stood in front of Bai Xiaofei on the third night. Then, they were all informed of who their partners were going to be after Bai Xiaofei’s introduction.</p> 
 <p>They were super thrilled!</p> 
 <p>To tell the truth, Bai Xiaofei regretted it a little. Who knew if these animals would take the chance to make an impression or something? They definitely had to train coordination with the girls, and this was the last thing Bai Xiaofei wanted to watch. After all, he didn’t join any party, which was exactly his original idea…</p> 
 <p>In those groups, Bai Xiaofei knew only four: Wang Hang of Lin Li’s, Chu Tianyi of Zhen Qi’s, Tai Shan of Hu Xian’er’s, and Zhao Ziyun of Qin Lingyan’s team.</p> 
 <p>The rest were all elites of their years, which Lu Lingyun guaranteed as he patted his chest. In other words, it was a sure thing that the girls would pass the second round.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, some might think, <em>Isn’t this second round a bit unfair? It’s basically determined by the strength of the teammates!</em></p> 
 <p>Indeed, with good teammates would come easy victory, but let’s not forget how these teammates were recruited. The second round tested the girls’ strength, but not necessarily their fighting capacity.</p> 
 <p>Interpersonal communication, charisma, organizational ability… All the abilities that couldn’t be seen at normal times were completely displayed in the recruiting process. The final battle was just a formality. The real competition had already started from the moment the participants started choosing their teammates!</p> 
 <p>On the fourth day, the girls drew lots to determine the opponents they would face. Luck was also a part of strength, only that this part had a small influence.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, this day was also a buffer that Bai Xiaofei gave the Babel Merchant House as they needed time to open the market.</p> 
 <p>In the evening prior to the day of the competition, the recordings of the team formations were speedily produced and broadcasted as a warm-up to hype the audience’s enthusiasm. At the same time, the sale of tickets for the live show at the academy square started.</p> 
 <p>Only Starnet could organize this scale of competition while also ensuring the safety of both sides. Therefore, in addition to watching the girls’ performance, witnessing the Divine-grade formation for themselves was the purpose of many people. After all, it was impossible to find a second one on the continent!</p> 
 <p>After the previous night’s hyping, the anticipation of both the audience and the contestants reached the peak. The next morning, a crowd of people surged into the square.</p> 
 <p>“Go! I’ll wait for your good news!”</p> 
 <p>At the entrance of the Demon of Illusions, Bai Xiaofei waved to Hu Xian’er and the others. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to watch, but that he didn’t know who he should watch.</p> 
 <p>The reason was the same as how he didn’t choose to be in anyone’s team. Whichever one he chose, he would offend the others.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I’ll be back soon, you won’t have to be alone for long!”</p> 
 <p>Leng Liuying strode up to Bai Xiaofei and gently hooked his chin, her blink making him feel dry in his throat. The instant Bai Xiaofei gulped, she ran off with a smile. The rest laughed and followed her.</p> 
 <p>Ever since that day, Bai Xiaofei had been teased increasingly boldly and excessively. In addition, Hu Xian’er often came over at night to weaken his resistance to women. Bai Xiaofei was currently passing his days accompanied by hardships!</p> 
 <p>However, there was nothing he could do. He didn’t have the courage to fire his gun yet and could at most take some advantage by touching a little…</p> 
 <p><em>Sigh, when will this kind of day end?</em> Looking at the girls walking away while talking and laughing, Bai Xiaofei let out a heartfelt sigh.</p> 
 <p>“Huskie, where do you think we should go for a walk?” With a frown, Bai Xiaofei looked at Huskie, who was wagging its tail. Blackie was never considered a target for questions since it usually ignored him.</p> 
 <p>“Woof woof!”</p> 
 <p>“Eat my butt! The restaurants are closed today. If you want to eat, I can only cook for you, but do you think I’m such a diligent person?”</p> 
 <p>Being rebutted thusly, Huskie barked full of grievances, its eyes glaring with dissatisfaction towards Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>What Bai Xiaofei didn’t know was that Huskie had written this down in its little revenge notebook. It was now someone with a backer!</p> 
 <p>Wait… no, it was now a dog with a backer!</p> 
 <p>“Oh! I know, I should go visit Grandpa Illusionary. I haven’t finished learning what he told me last time. Also, might as well challenge the ranking while I’m at it!”</p> 
 <p>Having made up his mind, Bai Xiaofei ran towards the Gods Amongst Men. The reluctant Huskie and Blackie had no say at all as he couldn’t challenge the ranking without them.</p> 
 <p>Today, all of Starnet had gone to watch the competition, so the Illusionary Sandboard was deserted for once. Old Man Illusionary seemed to miss Bai Xiaofei very much, his wrinkles spread with a big smile when he saw Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Hehe, long time no see, grandpa.” Bai Xiaofei, with a sleazy smile on his face, was completely casual with the old man.</p> 
 <p>“Has someone challenged you again today? Why are you suddenly in the mood to come to my place?” Old Man Illusionary stroked his beard with a pondering look.</p> 
 <p>“No, no, I just came to talk to you. It is rare to have a living history book, how can I not grasp the chance? Listening to your stories is much more interesting than reading those boring books.”</p> 
 <p>One old man and one young man bantered back and forth. Then, Bai Xiaofei took out the recordings of the Blossom Ranking competition and the old man watched with relish. In return, he told a lot of old stories before teaching Bai Xiaofei many things according to his wish.</p> 
 <p>At the very end of all that, Bai Xiaofei challenged the ranking.</p> 
 <p>As a result, a headache of a record was created on this day…</p>
