 <p>Chapter 693: Meeting an Acquaintance!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s cognition of ‘ice caves’ was nowhere near this level. If someone told him that the ones he had been walking through were built artificially, he would never have any doubts!</p> 
 <p>“Are these ice caves really formed naturally?” Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but ask. This crisscrossed and spacious cave was too neat to be true!</p> 
 <p>“Otherwise? Who would be so idle to come to this place just to dig these caves? Maybe it’s the magical beasts, don’t they all say where there are animals, there are holes? Maybe there are even beasts here that we have never seen before that are good at doing this.” Leng Liuying shrugged, giving a speculation good enough to answer Bai Xiaofei’s question.</p> 
 <p>“There’s something there!” A’First, who was leading the group, suddenly shouted. </p> 
 <p>Everyone looked over and saw a small white figure flashing by. If it wasn’t for their sharp eyesight, they wouldn’t even be able to catch a glimpse of it.</p> 
 <p>“After it!” Bai Xiaofei quickly decided. No matter what it was, it was better to follow it than wandering about like headless flies.</p> 
 <p>A’Fourth waved his hand. The group immediately felt their bodies lighten and their speed soared to a new level. This was A’Fourth’s puppet ability – Gravity Control!</p> 
 <p>When the ‘A’ group first preyed on Bai Xiaofei, it was not without reason that the other thieves chose to back out. Although they only had five members, the ‘A’ group was a famous bandit group in the industry. Unfortunately, they chose the wrong opponent and were captured without even being able to display a fraction of their actual skill…</p> 
 <p>The white figure was too fast for the group even with their speed greatly increased. On top of that, all the twists and turns in the ice cave gave it the advantage and the group quickly lost sight of it.</p> 
 <p>They helplessly stopped. A’First released his purple-tailed mink, but it unfortunately could not provide any help this time. Purple-tailed minks excelled at identifying terrain but not tracking targets.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t pretend you don’t know. If you refuse to work, I promise you will not get any more treats!” Bai Xiaofei said coldly just as everyone else ran out of ideas. </p> 
 <p>Huskie, who had been nesting in his arms, reluctantly poked out his head but showed no intention of leaving his warm ‘nest.’ After sniffing the air, the dog’s eyes suddenly lit up before barking twice. </p> 
 <p>Huskie was not allowed to speak when there were outsiders around, although he didn’t carry out this duty very well.</p> 
 <p>“Really?!” Bai Xiaofei exclaimed. </p> 
 <p>Everyone looked at him suspiciously. His expression was telling them that he got more than just the direction of the white figure.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter?” asked Leng Liuli.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s lips curled up, his eyes deep.</p> 
 <p>“That’s an old acquaintance of mine. I hope they haven’t forgotten me!” Bai Xiaofei acted all mysterious as he took the lead.</p> 
 <p>“What do those acquaintances of yours do? Are they blacksmiths? Why does it keep getting hotter and hotter?“ Leng Liuying resentfully said with a hint of astonishment in her voice as the temperature kept rising along the way. She wouldn’t overreact like this if this was somewhere else, but they were inside the Holy Snow Mountain. How could it be so warm with ice everywhere?</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei also frowned as he couldn’t think of a reason either. Moreover, there was also another thing that he couldn’t figure out. Clearly the temperature was so high, but why didn’t the surrounding ice melt at all?</p> 
 <p>It was so bizarre that he couldn’t wait to find out.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, I don’t know if I should say this,” A’First suddenly spoke.</p> 
 <p>“What is it?” Bai Xiaofei stopped.</p> 
 <p>He was not an autocrat and was very willing to accept opinions from others. This was the necessary quality of a lazy boss. Everyone who knew him was always ‘deeply touched’ by this quality…</p> 
 <p>“To be able to make the belly of the Holy Snow Mountain this hot, there is only one possibility that I can think of. Boss, does your acquaintance have something to do with that Emperor Rank beast?”</p> 
 <p>Everyone was struck with realization. </p> 
 <p>The excited Bai Xiaofei also calmed down. He was too caught up by the information Huskie gave him and forgot about that. He immediately considered carefully after A’First’s reminder. The situation might be a bit complicated!</p> 
 <p>“No matter what, we are already here. You guys wait here, I’ll have a look,” Bai Xiaofei decided after some thought.</p> 
 <p>The triplets didn’t say anything. They knew Bai Xiaofei, knew his character, and believed in his abilities.</p> 
 <p>“Be careful,” said Leng Liuli. </p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei responded with a smile. Taking a deep breath, he walked alone in the direction that Huskie had pointed. As he went deeper into the ice cave, the surrounding temperature kept rising at such a terrifying rate that ‘hot’ was no longer enough to describe it.</p> 
 <p>Suddenly, the jade amulet at his waist shone and sent a cold sensation to his mind.</p> 
 <p>An illusion! And a very strong one at that! Or else, the amulet that Leng Liuli had given him wouldn’t have reacted.</p> 
 <p>After realizing that something was wrong, Bai Xiaofei ate an Ice Heart Pill to be on the safe side. His mind then grew clear and he could keenly sense the existence of the illusion.</p> 
 <p>Carefully making his way forward, he soon exited the cave and was greeted with bare rock mountains. According to the others, this meant that he had arrived at the center layer of the mountain belly.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei took a deep breath as his body tensed. The faint pressure in the air was not an illusion. He was sure that A’First was right, that Emperor Rank beast was around!</p> 
 <p>Just as Bai Xiaofei was about to resume walking forward, sharp roars echoed from the cave, followed by a flurry of heavy footsteps. Moments later, a large group of blazing Flame Bulls stampeded toward him, about to turn him into meat paste.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei didn’t mean to run at all. The bulls ran right through him and then dissipated.</p> 
 <p>He was right, they were illusory.</p> 
 <p>He continued to move forward and finally saw his ‘acquaintance,’ who was glaring and baring its fangs like it was seeing a mortal enemy.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t they all say that magical beasts’ ability to remember humans is very strong? I still remember you, but you’ve already forgotten me?” Bai Xiaofei smiled. </p> 
 <p>The Blood-Eye Fox first slightly froze, then a hint of delight surfaced in its eyes. But soon, the delight became caution as it tried to look behind Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“No need, I came alone.” Bai Xiaofei still gave way so that the fox could see more clearly. At the same time, he began to feel glad that he had not brought the rest over.</p> 
 <p>After making sure there was one else, the Blood-Eye Fox obviously relaxed and looked gratefully at Bai Xiaofei. If it weren’t for him, it and its three children might be in a different state now.</p> 
 <p>“I’m a guest, aren’t I? You don’t want to invite me in?” Bai Xiaofei grinned. </p> 
 <p>However, the Blood-Eye Fox seemed hesitant.</p> 
 <p>“Snow, since it’s a friend of yours, bring them in. I believe in your judgment,” a weak voice suddenly rang out from a cave. It seemed to be female.</p> 
 <p><em>A human?! There are humans here?!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was inwardly amazed. At the same time, his interest toward the existence in the cave was piqued.</p> 
 <p>The Blood-Eye Fox didn’t care about Bai Xiaofei’s reaction. Getting permission, it slightly indicated with its head and started leading the way. Following the fox, Bai Xiaofei turned at a corner and was instantly struck dumb.</p> 
 <p>First was due to the huge cave in front of him, the second reason being the sparkling origin rocks in the cave, and third, the huge magical beast lying there!</p> 
 <p>It was a gigantic bird-type beast that Bai Xiaofei had never heard or seen before. Its golden feathers were like molten gold and a faint flame was running along its long feathered tail.</p> 
 <p>However, at the root of the wings was a ferocious wound that crossed nearly half of its body. The blood dripping from it immediately turned into golden flames upon touching the ground, which was why the temperature in the cave was so high.</p> 
 <p>“Human, it must be you that saved Snow. I thank you in her stead. You can take as many of these stones as you’d like,” the voice now echoed again. As the huge beast spoke, its eyes never left Bai Xiaofei for a second.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the Blood-Eye Fox was behind the beast, where two miniature versions of the golden bird were playing with the three fox babies, their cheerful voices in sharp contrast with their mother’s state.</p> 
 <p>“You must be using this mine to heal your wounds. Although I really like to take them all away, I can’t do this kind of thing, especially when it’s related to the life of a mother,” said Bai Xiaofei sincerely with a nonchalant smile.</p> 
 <p>Although he had never met his mother, he always thought of her as the best person in the world and this idea had never changed.</p> 
 <p>“Human, you are different from others,” the weak magical beast slowly opened its mouth a long time later. There was approval in its voice.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t praise me, I’ll let it get to my head. In fact, I am more greedy than most people, I only know to avoid ill-gotten gains.” Bai Xiaofei grinned and actually gave himself a pertinent evaluation.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the Blood-Eye Fox squeaked at the magical beast. However, the latter shook its head helplessly.</p> 
 <p>“Please don’t be in a hurry to reject my help. I believe I can help you,” said Bai Xiaofei suddenly.</p>
