 <p style="text-align: center;"><i>Book One — Rising In Starnet Academy</i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Infinite Mountain Range, as an existence that caused others to reveal terror upon mentioning its name, an ordinary person should have kept away from it. But, it wasn’t the slightest bit silent here today.</p>
 <p>In midair, a ‘birdman’ worked hard to flap his wings, yet its effect wasn’t quite obvious, and he collided right onto a towering tree….</p>
 <p>“Motherf*cker! I forgot about the landing. Fortunately, I have f*cking good luck.” As he endured the pain and crawled up from the ground, Bai Xiaofei who had an overjoyed expression written all over his face took a deep breath.</p>
 <p>“I’m finally free!!!!” As soon as he finished speaking, a tiny head that was a mix of black and white stuck out from beneath his loose clothes, and it licked Bai Xiaofei’s face crazily.</p>
 <p>“Woof! Woof! Aowu~” Shockingly, it was a juvenile husky that had come out of from Bai Xiaofei’s embrace! It seemed to have sensed its master’s excitement, and it started howling as well.</p>
 <p>“Huskie, quickly go see if there’s anything edible in the surroundings. We’ve been busy all morning, and we even forgot to have a meal.” As he rubbed Huskie’s head, Bai Xiaofei pulled out the tiny fellow and placed him on the ground, and then Huskie fully displayed the behavior of huskies when let go, he vanished within the bushes in the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>But, Bai Xiaofei seemed to not be worried in the slightest, and he calmly waited for his husky to return victoriously.</p>
 <p>“AH!!!”</p>
 <p>“F*CK! Whose dog is this!!!?”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the shocked exclaims of a man and woman sounded out from within the bushes, and subsequently, a geezer that was wearing his clothes in a rush stood up from the bushes….</p>
 <p>The frightened Huskie instantly fled into Bai Xiaofei’s embrace.</p>
 <p>Both of them stared at each other in speechless dismay. Bai Xiaofei tried hard to fake a calm expression as he stared fixedly at the geezer before him, yet a tempestuous storm was actually surging within his heart.</p>
 <p>Not to mention anything else, this fellow Huskie was one that roamed fearlessly in a place like the Gorge of Heroes that villains ran wild in, yet Huskie obediently tucked his tails between his legs before this geezer while curled up quietly in Bai Xiaofei’s embrace.</p>
 <p>“Kid, do you recognize me!?” Finally, the geezer was the first to break the silence, and he spoke with a cold voice and stiff expression as if he wanted to eat Bai Xiaofei up.</p>
 <p>“Grandpa, even though you’re filled with spirit and seem like a big boss at first glance, but I’ve just come from a remote village and really don’t know you.” After gulping down a mouthful of saliva, Bai Xiaofei who was full of smiles spoke a string of words in one go, and he instinctively praised the geezer up into the heavens.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, the geezer heaved a long sigh of relief instead when he heard this answer. <i>Since he doesn’t recognize me, then it’s easy to deal with. </i></p>
 <p>“Cough, cough, that…. Earlier, that….” His stiff expression instantly collapsed and replacing it was a trace of embarrassment, and then the geezer started to stutter.</p>
 <p>“Earlier, I saw that you were concentrated in your cultivation. Every single move you made caused the spirit energy of the heavens and the earth to surge, and it terrified the countless high level Magical Beasts in the surroundings to the point of bowing their heads in submission.” The geezer was still thinking about how to explain it when Bai Xiaofei had already given him a perfect answer, and it stupefied the geezer.</p>
 <p><i>I’ve seen many who can speak nonsense, yet I’ve never seen one that can do it while seeming justified, confident, and without blushing.</i></p>
 <p><i>What a promising young man!</i></p>
 <p>“Err…. Exactly, it’s exactly like that! But, it isn’t suitable for this cultivation technique of mine to be known by others, so….” One couldn’t say the geezer’s reaction was slow, and he went along with it.</p>
 <p>“I understand! I just had a nap here and had a sweet dream of meeting an expert!”</p>
 <p>“Right! It’s exactly like that!” He couldn’t help but clap. The old man was happy like a child, yet he quickly realized that he’d lost his composure, and he became solemn and serious once more.</p>
 <p>“Cough, cough, err…. Meeting is fate. You seem to be talented, so I’ll bestow some fortune upon you.” As he spoke, a light flashed on the old man’s hand, and a gorgeous and multicolored disk that was covered in various symbols appeared on his hand.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s expression swiftly turned grim when he saw this.</p>
 <p><i>A Violetgold Puppet!!!</i></p>
 <p>Even though one might not have had meat nor seen game running about, but one had surely heard of their existence!</p>
 <p><i>A Violetgold Puppet! That’s a treasure from the legends!</i></p>
 <p><i>Could it be that this geezer wants to silence me?!</i></p>
 <p><i>It can’t be! If he wanted to make a move, I’d have died long ago!</i></p>
 <p><i>So what’s the meaning of this?</i></p>
 <p>Instantly, countless thoughts flashed within Bai Xiaofei’s heart, yet all of them were rejected by him.</p>
 <p>“Grandpa, what’re you….” As he asked with a weak tone, Bai Xiaofei felt as if his heart had already risen to his throat, and so long as the geezer scared him a little bit more, the geezer would utterly not have to make a move and Bai Xiaofei would have suffocated himself to death.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, I’m not the type of person that attacks because of the slightest dispute. I prefer a win-win situation.” As he revealed a sly smile that really didn’t match his age, the geezer exerted strength with his wrist to lightly toss the disk into midair. After it left his hand, the disk grew in midair and became a huge disk that was at least five meters in diameter in the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>“This puppet of mine is called the Heavenly Secret Disk, and it’s capable of obtaining clear knowledge of the secrets of the heavens and predicting everything in the world. Normally, I wouldn’t display my skill, yet you seem congenial to me, so I’ve decided to make a prediction for you!” Complacency was written all over the geezer’s face as he spoke, and his head was partially raised as if he was waiting for Bai Xiaofei’s praise.</p>
 <p>But, he was disappointed this time.</p>
 <p><i>F*ck, he intends to pay me hush money!</i></p>
 <p><i>But, isn’t this hush money too unreliable? What’s the f*cking point of making a prediction for me? Give me something practical!</i></p>
 <p>Even though he was cursing the geezer for being a cheapskate in his heart, he had no choice but to put on a flattering smile. What else could he do since his life was in the geezer’s hands?</p>
 <p>“Err…. Grandpa, I don’t believe in this so there’s no need to make a prediction for me. I….”</p>
 <p>“What do you mean!? Do you know how many people line up and wait for me to activate the Heavenly Secret Disk a single time!? What’s the meaning of that unwilling expression of yours!?” As he repeated the same words, the geezer seemed as if he’d been struck at a sore spot, and he instantly withdrew his complacent expression while his eyes seemed to be on the verge of catching fire.</p>
 <p>“I’m going to predict your fortune today if you believe it or not!” The stubborn geezer spoke as seven rays of lights of seven different colors shot into the Heavenly Secret Disk, and the disk that originally stayed motionless started to revolve swiftly.</p>
 <p>A short moment later, the disk stopped moving, whereas, the geezer stared at the disk for a long time while his expression slowly changed from fury to surprise before finally transforming into utter shock.</p>
 <p>After stopping for a while, another seven rays of light shot into the disk….</p>
 <p>Next, he looked at it for a long time after it stopped before another seven rays shot out….</p>
 <p>After repeating this for an entire seven times, the geezer was exhausted to the point of spitting out a mouthful of blood, and it shocked Bai Xiaofei to the point of directly jumping up from the ground.</p>
 <p><i>F*ck, I knew it was unreliable! Look, you exhausted yourself to such an extent. No wonder Master Yi in the gorge is so ugly, he was probably exhausted like this!</i></p>
 <p>While he thought like this, what he said was an entirely different thing. “Grandpa, are you alright, why don’t we just forget it? I know you’re doing it for my own good, and I appreciate your good intentions….”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei hadn’t finished speaking when the geezer that still had fresh blood hanging from the corners of his mouth leaped up with a thump before grabbing Bai Xiaofei’s hands.</p>
 <p>“You still don’t have a master, right?!!!” The sudden reaction of the geezer startled Bai Xiaofei, and he practically reflexively replied.</p>
 <p>“I have quite a few mothers and fathers, but I really don’t have a master….” As soon as Bai Xiaofei finished speaking, delight and pleasant surprise was instantly written all over the geezer’s face, and it caused Bai Xiaofei to feel a wave of aversion.</p>
 <p><i>F*ck, and you said you can obtain clear knowledge of the secrets of the heavens yet you have to ask me about this little bit of crap. Even Master Yi can divine that….</i><i></i></p>
 <p><i></i></p>
 <p>“Kneel!” After he withdrew his hands, the geezer stood directly before Bai Xiaofei and spoke a word that caused him to be dazed for a long time.</p>
 <p>“What? You don’t want to take me as your master? This is a chance that others can’t obtain even if they fight to the death!” The geezer spoke sternly, causing Bai Xiaofei to be stunned before putting on a smile.</p>
 <p>“Grandpa, you’ve misunderstood. It isn’t that I don’t want to, but I don’t deserve to take an existence at your level as my master. I’m just scum that can’t even control a puppet.” As he waved his hand helplessly, Bai Xiaofei spoke truthfully according to facts, but to a certain extent, this was an excuse as well.</p>
 <p>Just think about it, if a geezer that was having a romp in Infinite Mountain Range in broad daylight and even spat blood from a single divination wanted to be your master, would you do it!?</p>
 <p>In any case, Bai Xiaofei wouldn’t!</p>
 <p>“How could that be possible!? Isn’t that dog your puppet!?” The geezer had an expression that said ‘don’t try to trick me’, and his tone was filled with anger.</p>
 <p>“If you don’t believe me, then look! The energy in my entire body has been sealed, and I haven’t utilized it for a very long time.” As he stretched out his right hand with extreme confidence, for the first time in his life, Bai Xiaofei felt that being unable to control a puppet was a good thing!</p>
 <p>The geezer skeptically stretched out his hand towards Bai Xiaofei’s wrist, and after a short moment, pleasant surprise was written all over the geezer’s face.</p>
 <p>“HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!”</p>
 <p>“The heavens favor me! The heavens favor me!!!!”</p>
 <p>Wild laughter reverberated in Infinite Mountain Range and accompanying the rise of the geezer’s wild laughter was goosebumps all over Bai Xiaofei’s body.</p>
 <p><i>I’m finished, I’m doomed now!</i></p>
 <p><i>This geezer is insane….</i></p>
