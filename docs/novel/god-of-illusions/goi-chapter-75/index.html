<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>Since Zhu Si’si made a move, rattling sounds had never ceased to resound out within the entire training field, and there was someone flying up into the sky and dropping down to the ground practically every single second. When both of them stopped, there wasn’t a single person capable of standing up from the other class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Especially that ‘brother’ that had received close attention from Xu Chen. At this moment, his entire head had already swelled up like the head of a pig, so not to mention his mother, even he himself would be absolutely incapable of recognizing himself before a mirror!</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the entire process, besides the members of the Savage Class constantly pointing and crying out loudly, the others were utterly silent as they watched this entire battle that didn’t conform to logic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Teacher Feng was no exception!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was able to accomplish this as well, but that was established under the precondition that he possessed a strength at the Grandmaster Rank, and if he went back to the time he was at the Proficient Rank….</span></p>
 <p><span style>He ought to be one of those people that lay on the ground!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xu Chen, both of you have gone too far. I only asked both of you to go forward not annihilate their entire class. How are they going to survive in the academy in the future? Even I feel embarrassed about speaking of it!” Xu Chen and Zhu Si’si had just returned when Bai Xiaofei’s ‘educating’ voice sounded out, and his voice was extremely loud as if he was deeply afraid others wouldn’t be able to hear it clearly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Exactly. Those two people from before could still be carried back, but now that their entire class has been beaten down, who’ll go carry them?!” Xing Nan had been tainted by Bai Xiaofei to the point his skill at adding fuel to the fire had attained the acme of perfection, but he’d forgotten his current situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Numerous icy cold gazes stared at him to the point he trembled instinctively, and he instantly withdrew everything else he was about to say.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I got carried away. Getting beaten this time can’t be avoided….</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As he thought like this, Xing Nan had already started searching for someone that could provide him with protection, but he gave up decisively after taking a look around.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was easy to find someone in the Savage Class that would beat someone when they were down, yet someone who would offer timely assistance didn’t exist at all!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher Feng, shouldn’t we continue our class?” After he finished saying what he should, Bai Xiaofei called out lightly to Teacher Feng and pulled his wandering thoughts back into his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah….? Oh….! Right! Right! Let’s continue! Let’s continue!” Teacher Feng had practically repeated his state from before, and he felt his face was almost cooked from the heat.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fortunately, I’m only taking a single Collective Class….</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As he consoled himself silently in his heart, Teacher Feng gulped down a mouthful of saliva and looked once more towards the Savage Class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Teacher Feng had completely forgotten all he knew about the Savage Class, and he only yearned that Bai Xiaofei and the others could give him an even greater pleasant surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Bai Xiaofei smiled at him instead. “Our class won’t be sending out anyone else. The remaining opportunities are theirs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as he finished speaking, the members of the other classes heaved a sigh of relief for no reason or rhyme, whereas, a trace of a sense of loss appeared on Teacher Feng’s face but he still looked towards the other classes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the remaining time in the morning, there was really not a single person from the Savage Class that stood out, and the remaining classes weren’t stupid enough to look for trouble with the Savage Class again because, in their eyes, the Savage Class had transformed from a ‘ripe persimmon’ into an iron plank!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they were rid of the unexpected Savage Class, the remaining battles were fairly ‘intense’. At the very least, Teacher Feng had taken a fancy to a few people and recorded their names.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, when compared with the three people from the Savage Class that had put on a display, they were still greatly lacking….</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bell that marked the end of class resounded out, and Teacher Feng took a very long breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright students, the Collective Class this morning ends here. I was very surprised by yours displays today, and I hope that I’ll be able to see all of you in the various streams of the academy two months from now.” As he spoke, he couldn’t help but glance at the Savage Class. Unfortunately, he didn’t see the anticipation he expected but the composed grins of Bai Xiaofei and the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei really didn’t care too much about the so-called ‘quota’ of the Collective Classes because his target was the competition between classes!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone bowed with extreme respect to Teacher Feng and send him off with their gazes, and then when everyone was just about to leave, an unexpected event occurred!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fellow Students, aren’t all of you going to stay behind and have a brief exchange?” Bai Xiaofei’s voice that wasn’t loud nor soft resounded out. Besides Lin Li, all the remaining 14 members of the Savage Class charged out to block the various directions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Over 10 people blocking over 100 people, it simply sounded laughable, but the Savage Class had done just that!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fellow Student, what’s the meaning of this?” The Class Monitor of one of the classes turned around with a gloomy expression, but deep fear had arisen within his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t for them having sufficient numbers, he would probably not even have the courage to speak to Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s nothing. I’ve already told you, it’s only a brief exchange.” Bai Xiaofei shrugged and revealed an expression that seemed as if it was a trivial matter, and it brought the atmosphere in the entire area to a strange point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speak frankly if you have something to say, and let us through if you don’t. Could it be that you want to challenge all nine of our classes with just your class alone?” A Class Monitor that had a comparatively robust figure spoke, and he made his stand clear at the first possible moment and pulled together the remaining nine classes with a single sentence. Moreover, the facts were indeed like this, and the remaining Class Monitors had instantly displayed their agreement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If we’re unable to come to an agreement, then I don’t mind testing to exactly what extent our class has arrived at now. But, I presume all of you surely don’t want such a thing to occur.” Bai Xiaofei’s expression didn’t change in the slightest, and the so-called ‘collective’ before him didn’t cause him to feel the slightest fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a time, everyone went silent because they were able to discern from Bai Xiaofei’s expression that he wasn’t joking, so Bai Xiaofei would absolutely make a move at the first possible moment if one of them spoke now!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We weren’t present in the past month, so everyone might not understand us well. But, fortunately, we still have two months of time. So, I hope that everyone can have more ‘exchanges’ with us for the remaining two months of time.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei added emphases to the word ‘exchange’, and then he revealed a sly smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How do you intend to carry out these exchanges?” Someone asked and just happened to create a platform for Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s very simple, I hope that the Class Monitor of every single one of your classes can come over and tell me about the situation of your classes during lunch every day, and you can mention anything that you need help with. Of course, I hope that all of you will be present at the first possible moment when I need help.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as he finished speaking, everyone went into an uproar!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei’s intentions couldn’t be any more obvious, and he wanted to be the boss of these 10 classes!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stinking kid, don’t go too….” Retaliation arose at practically the first possible moment. Unfortunately, he wasn’t able to retaliate much….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Li who erupted swiftly didn’t give him the slightest time to react, and she charged over directly to grab the neck of that person before raising him up with a single hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The expression of the person who was raised up grew unsightlier by the moment, and his legs that floated in midair shook about with all his strength, yet his strength was growing weaker and weaker.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Toss him away. Don’t dirty your hand.” Bai Xiaofei’s light voice resounded out before Lin Li swung the person in her hand with force, and she swung him out far away. After that, she walked back to Bai Xiaofei’s side in a few steps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once again, Bai Xiaofei swept everyone with his gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, not a single person dared to stand out and say a single word!</span></p>
