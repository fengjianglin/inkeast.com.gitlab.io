 <p>Chapter 634: A Prince? Kill Him All the Same!</p> 
 <p>“Sister, nothing’s gonna happen to them, right?” Leng Liushuang at the inn was unable to stay still. Bai Xiaofei had told them that it would be handled quickly, but there hadn’t been any news from him even after such a long time.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, those black-clad men aren’t very strong. How can he not deal with them?” Even though she was comforting Leng Liushuang, Leng Liuli wasn’t faring any better. Her eyes kept glancing out the window.</p> 
 <p>“What’s with you two?! If he can’t even handle this, how can he pass our pop’s test? Who kept saying that we should have confidence in him before? Now you both can’t trust him when he needs this confidence?” the youngest Leng Liuying righteously scolded her sisters. This time, they had no words to refute.</p> 
 <p>“So you’re not worried?” The two actually calmed down thanks to Leng Liuying, but after that, they had the urge to tease her.</p> 
 <p>Women. Have some free time on their hands and they’d come up with evil ideas…</p> 
 <p>“Tch! Why would I worry about him?! I can’t wait for him to just drop dead and then no one will bully me!” Leng Liuying snorted and hurriedly turned away for fear that the other two would see the embarrassment on her face. Yet, she didn’t know how adorable she looked.</p> 
 <p>Teasing laughter resounded behind. In the end, Leng Liuying couldn’t bear it anymore and plunged into bed.</p> 
 <p>“I’m sleeping! You two enjoy waiting!”</p> 
 <p>Just like that, the three waited for a long time until there was finally some movement outside. When A’Tao ran back with hurried steps and opened the door, he was surprised.</p> 
 <p>“You really didn’t sleep?!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the ‘sleeping’ Leng Liuying instantly sprang up from bed, and then the triplets flocked over to the boy.</p> 
 <p>“You’re alone?! Where’s your master?!” Leng Liuying grabbed Tao’s shoulders and shook him. If it weren’t for his physical quality, his soul might have been shaken out of his body…</p> 
 <p>“Master said that you guys must be waiting for us, so he sent me back to let you know that we’re fine. You guys can stop waiting and go to bed. Everything is fine over there. He is just waiting to trawl the net.”</p> 
 <p>In order to ‘protect himself,’ A’Tao quickly relayed Bai Xiaofei’s words.</p> 
 <p>Exhaling a long sigh of relief, Leng Liuying let go of him and turned to her two sisters with a look of disapproval.</p> 
 <p>“See, I told you, that fellow will be fine. Let’s go to bed!” Not giving them a chance to ridicule her, Leng Liuying then fell back on the bed. This time, she really fell asleep…</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei also welcomed his guests as he was teasing his cat and dog in the stone room, a guest who was completely in the dark about the situation.</p> 
 <p>After Liu Rushi had expressed his desire for the triplets, An Ming had immediately arranged for him to meet A’Da. In a good mood, Liu Rushi promised him a piece of the pie. Of course, the main reason was to drag An Ming into being his accomplice.</p> 
 <p>Along the way, all An Ming could think about was the way Liu Rushi described the Leng sisters. Having been beaten so badly during the day, he didn’t have a chance to see their appearances. Therefore, his anticipation was no lower than Liu Rushi when he thought he’d gotten his goods.</p> 
 <p>“Teacher, your student has come…” An Ming joyously walked into the stone room, but before he could finish speaking, he froze on the spot. The next second, cold sweat soaked his back.</p> 
 <p>“Bai… Bai…”</p> 
 <p>“I know you are very surprised, but there’s no need to say it, Your Royal Highness the First Prince,” Bai Xiaofei stressed each word as he put down his teacup.</p> 
 <p>Blackie on his shoulder shot An Ming a glare with her pitch-dark eyes, while Huskie never even got distracted from enjoying his Crystal’s Longing treats.</p> 
 <p>On ruining the atmosphere, Huskie was definitely an expert…</p> 
 <p>“What… what do you want?!” An Ming trembled uncontrollably as his voice choked.</p> 
 <p>“What do I want?” Bai Xiaofei asked with great humor. “That should be my question. You and your master sent people to my place to kidnap people in the middle of the night. Now I am here to seek justice, but you ask me what I want?”</p> 
 <p>An Ming was horrified. He had been holding on to a faint trace of hope, but now it seemed that Bai Xiaofei already knew everything.</p> 
 <p>“I have no idea what you’re talking about! I came here because that man said my master summoned me. Although you are strong, you can’t slander people. Don’t forget that you are in Tranquil!” </p> 
 <p>An Ming wasn’t stupid. Since Bai Xiaofei had evidence of his direct participation, he made it like it really had nothing to do with him. Moreover, upon mentioning Tranquil, An Ming’s confidence leaped. He felt that Bai Xiaofei would have some scruples about this.</p> 
 <p>However, he thought too much.</p> 
 <p>Once his bottom line was violated, Bai Xiaofei would not have any qualms! What’s more, it wasn’t like he didn’t have a retreat route…</p> 
 <p>“Your master’s body isn’t cold yet. Do you want me to bring him for confirmation?” Bai Xiaofei slowly walked toward An Ming.</p> 
 <p>“You… you can’t kill me! I’m going to be the next emperor, I’ll give you whatever you want then!” An Ming completely panicked and blurted without thinking.</p> 
 <p>“If these are your last words, then you can rest in peace!” With this, Bai Xiaofei’s palm slapped down on An Ming’s head. In less than a second, An Ming fell.</p> 
 <p>After killing An Ming, Bai Xiaofei walked slowly toward A’Da.</p> 
 <p>“You said you wouldn’t kill me…” A’Da gulped. His big palms were completely clammy with sweat. He had seen Bai Xiaofei act more than once. If Bai Xiaofei wanted to kill him, he wouldn’t be able to put up any resistance.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I still remember. But like just now, clean up the body.”</p> 
 <p>With a smile, Bai Xiaofei walked toward the tunnel. Huskie hurriedly chewed the rest of the Crystal’s Longings before catching up.</p> 
 <p>After confirming that Bai Xiaofei did leave, A’Da collapsed to the ground and looked at An Ming who was lying nearby.</p> 
 <p>“The body just now had nothing to search for, but this one is mine! Thanks for the fleeing fee, Prince!” A’Da smiled wide as he crawled toward An Ming and searched his body.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, hiding in the dark tunnel, Bai Xiaofei watched as it happened, a sneer creeping over his mouth.</p>
