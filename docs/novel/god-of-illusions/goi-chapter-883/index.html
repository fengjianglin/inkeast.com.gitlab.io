 <p>Chapter 883: General Feng, Please!</p> 
 <p>After saying goodbye to Yun Lan, Bai Xiaofei left the Yun residence with a revised plan. Having accepted the army token, he was curious about the Yun clan’s private army.</p> 
 <p>The Yun private army, as its name implied, was an army that only obeyed the orders of the Yun clan’s head. In the Ethereal Empire, this kind of army was allowed to exist as a reward from the Great Emperor for the heroes of the nation.</p> 
 <p>All the four great clans had their own private army, and the strongest one was the Yun, but outside of Yun Lan, no one knew exactly how strong it was. Therefore, Bai Xiaofei could not wait to find out for himself.</p> 
 <p>“Speak, what are you going to do? Why do I feel that you have no specific direction at all? Aren’t you in a hurry?” Tan Xin couldn’t help but ask upon seeing how carefree Bai Xiaofei looked. Curiosity was always the most torturous!</p> 
 <p>“I am in a hurry, but there are things you can’t rush. What can you do when your enemy doesn’t rear its head? Moreover, if our preparation is insufficient, there are bound to be mistakes later,” said Bai Xiaofei nonchalantly while returning Tan Xin’s question unanswered.</p> 
 <p>“Fine, but don’t tell me you came to the Yun house for the so-called preparation.” Tan Xin stared at him with a cute pout.</p> 
 <p>“Well… That’s hard to say!” Bai Xiaofei chortled and walked faster. He felt that Tan Xin might explode if he said anything else.</p> 
 <p>Before long, the duo arrived at the Yun army compound outside the imperial city. Although the Emperor allowed the existence of private armies, they were normally forbidden from entering the capital.</p> 
 <p>“Who goes there?! This is the Yun clan’s private army, do not approach!”</p> 
 <p>Before they could even see what the gatekeepers looked like, they heard a booming voice. At the same time, Bai Xiaofei felt at least ten threatening energy fluctuations locked on him as did Tan Xin.</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t even notice the sentry. Now that’s formidable!” Bai Xiaofei exclaimed and his eyes glowed.</p> 
 <p><em>There must be a lot to learn here!</em></p> 
 <p>“Brother, I’m one of yours, don’t attack!” Bai Xiaofei took out Yun Lan’s token and raised it high.</p> 
 <p>After half a second of shock, a group of people rushed over and collectively knelt in front of Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Greetings, General. May we know your name?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei could see discipline deeply ingrained in these soldiers. Accepting the token and not the person was undeniably important to an army, because the person could be fake, but tokens would never be! All army tokens of high rank were made with unique materials and techniques. Among the known forces on the continent, none was known to have the ability to copy such tokens. Even Bai Xiaofei’s Virtual Reality could not do that.</p> 
 <p>“Bai Xiaofei.” Showing the token, Bai Xiaofei smiled. The last time he had been called ‘General,’ it was in the Illusionary Sandboard several years ago…</p> 
 <p>Thinking of this, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but recall the thrill of strategizing and commanding. It had to be the coolest thing for a man to do, especially when one had an outstanding army!</p> 
 <p>“Raid Brigade Chief Shen Kuo greets General Bai. Is there a mission for us?” Shen Kuo briefly introduced himself and asked with full of expectation.</p> 
 <p>An elite army was afraid of not wars, but not having battles to fight. In recent years, let alone the Yun private army, even Ethereal had no wars at all, so the group of people in front of Bai Xiaofei had been unable to stand it. Because of the same reason, there had been constant fights among the four great clans’ private troops. No one could do anything about this as they all knew the soldiers needed to vent.</p> 
 <p>Seeing the Raid Brigade Chief’s reaction, Bai Xiaofei instantly understood why Yun Lan was so generous. He wanted him to find something for the clan army to do!</p> 
 <p><em>No wonder he gave me such a big gift as soon as we met. The older the ginger the spicier indeed!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei smiled wryly, a little caught off guard by the fact that he had been schemed against by others. However, this kind of scheming… he didn’t mind a few more!</p> 
 <p>“Do you guys want something to do?” Bai Xiaofei revealed an evil smile.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Shen Kuo was stunned. Then, he quickly exchanged glances with his companions before turning back to Bai Xiaofei in excitement. “We will all listen to your orders, General Bai!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei’s smile deepened.</p> 
 <p>“Then let’s take a look at your army first.” He eagerly walked straight towards the camp, full of expectations for what it would bring. After following Shen Kuo to the general’s tent, he sat down and issued his first order, “Gather all the people in charge, I have questions to ask them.”</p> 
 <p>An excited Shen Kuo immediately carried it out. Before long, a group of excited people ran into the room, but after seeing Bai Xiaofei’s appearance, some of their expressions immediately changed.</p> 
 <p>It could not be helped, he was too young.</p> 
 <p>Their reaction was within Bai Xiaofei’s expectations. Shen Kuo was the ‘more brawn than brain’ type, so he did not have any objections. However, an army could not be composed entirely of such people and some people naturally would have differing opinions.</p> 
 <p>The first thing Bai Xiaofei needed to do was eliminate such opinions.</p> 
 <p>“Shen Kuo, introduce them to me.”</p> 
 <p>Shen Kuo instantly stepped out. He currently had nothing on his mind but Bai Xiaofei’s question earlier: ‘Do you guys want something to do?’</p> 
 <p>Of course he did, to the point that it was driving him crazy!</p> 
 <p>“This is General Feng. Before you arrived, General Feng was our leader. These two are General Chu and General Hong, responsible for management and punishment respectively.”</p> 
 <p>“This is Chief Qian of the Firearm Brigade, Chief Gan of the Assassination Brigade, and Chief Zhao of the Logistics Brigade.”</p> 
 <p>Shen Kuo quickly finished his introduction, and the aforementioned three generals as well as Chief Zhao in charge of logistics were the four who revealed doubts about Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Very nice to meet you, General Feng. I’m Bai Xiaofei, just graduated from Starnet.” Walking to General Feng, Bai Xiaofei briefly introduced himself.</p> 
 <p>As the distance between them was too close, General Feng could feel Bai Xiaofei’s breath.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, the rest held their breath. No matter how they looked at this, Bai Xiaofei was obviously looking to cause chaos!</p> 
 <p>However, Feng Yin was not a general for nothing. Although inwardly very uncomfortable, his response was fairly proper. He took a step back and saluted, “This subordinate greets General Bai.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately straightened up with a renewed impression of this person. It was common for superiors to act domineering in front of their subordinates, but not every subordinate could suppress themselves from losing their composure, especially when Bai Xiaofei did not look like a reliable superior at all.</p> 
 <p>“General Feng is too polite. Compared with you, I’m only a junior, so you don’t need to salute me in the future.” With a one-eighty change in attitude, Bai Xiaofei helped Feng Yin up and looked at the others. “You guys too, big brothers. If you don’t mind, you can call me Lil’ Brother Bai.”</p> 
 <p>Everyone was stunned and at a loss for words.</p> 
 <p>“Well, they all say no fight no friends. How about we have a little spar?” Bai Xiaofei continued.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, everyone’s eyes lit up. <em>Spar? Awesome! You suggested it, little brother. Don’t blame us if you cry later!</em></p> 
 <p>Although they didn’t voice what they thought, the expression on their faces said it all.</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t think you’d be belligerent as well, little brother! Since you brought it up, you can pick an opponent. Any one of us will do, even Old Zhao is no problem!” Hong Liang, as his name implied<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>, had quite a loud voice.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei almost couldn’t hold back his laugh. “ About that… brother… In fact, you can all come together,” he said the most aggressive words with a seemingly simple and honest smile in the most cowardly tone.</p> 
 <p>“You!” Chu Yuanhang nearly exploded. However, Feng Yin stopped him.</p> 
 <p>“Let me. If necessary, they will join.” Feng Yin looked at Bai Xiaofei with a serious expression. He could see that Bai Xiaofei was not putting on a front.</p> 
 <p>“The training field?” Bai Xiaofei asked.</p> 
 <p>With that, the group went to the training field. Because the days were too boring, sparring had become the favorite activity of the soldiers, thus the place was quite packed.</p> 
 <p>However, seeing so many bosses arriving together, the soldiers retreated to the periphery as they watched Feng Yin enter the ring.</p> 
 <p>“Damn! Boss is fighting!”</p> 
 <p>“Which idiot dares to be his opponent?!”</p> 
 <p>“Did someone come to provoke our boss again?”</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>The sound of discussions filled the area as the onlookers looked back and forth among the superior group. In their view, only these superiors were worth making Feng Yin act.</p> 
 <p>However, it turned out to be a young man in his early twenties who entered the ring, someone who they had all thought to be a noble young master who was only here to watch the fun!</p> 
 <p>“General Feng, please!”</p>
