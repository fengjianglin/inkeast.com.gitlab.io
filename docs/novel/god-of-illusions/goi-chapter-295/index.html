 <p>Chapter 295: Blood Demon!</p> 
 <p>After Wu Chi came out, Feng Wuhen didn’t resolve the doubts in Bai Xiaofei's heart and only let out a long sigh instead.</p> 
 <p>“Go to the lounge. You guys may want to think it over.”</p> 
 <p>After giving a small hint, Feng Wuhen led them out. Meanwhile, Wei Feng said something to the receptionist before she immediately left in a hurry.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Fei, what’s going on?” A confused Wu Chi grew nervous as he kept feeling that something bad was about to happen.</p> 
 <p>“I don't know, but the worst thing is only you being unable to be an Energy Stream puppet master, so there's nothing to worry about. You’re so normal that you can’t be any more normal. Don't worry, we can make up for it at the puppet level!”</p> 
 <p>After receiving Bai Xiaofei's reassurance, Wu Chi's drumming heart quickly relaxed.</p> 
 <p><em>Hell yeah, what's there to worry about? It’s already better than being a lifetime martial artist!</em></p> 
 <p>As a puppet master transformed from a martial artist, Wu Chi was quite relaxed at this problem and had no burden at choosing puppets like other people. No matter what, anything was still stronger than martial artists!</p> 
 <p>With this enlightenment, Wu Chi and Bai Xiaofei followed Feng Wuhen to the lounge. After sitting down, the four men looked at each other in silence for more than ten seconds.</p> 
 <p>“Are we just going to sit here like this? Are Wu Chi's test results too rubbish?” Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help it and broke the deadlock of silence.</p> 
 <p>“No, it’s actually the opposite. His test result is perfect. A light spot stopped, which means the puppet represented by that light spot is a perfect match for him!”</p> 
 <p>Upon Feng Wuhen’s answer, Wu Chi and Bai Xiaofei immediately revealed pleasant surprise.</p> 
 <p><em>There’s hope to be an Energy Stream puppet master!</em></p> 
 <p>“Then, what was your reaction just now?” Bai Xiaofei asked, earning a sigh from Feng Wuhen.</p> 
 <p>“You don't want his life to be in danger, right?” Feng Wuhen replied with a question.</p> 
 <p>This time, the pleasant surprise on Bai Xiaofei's face was instantly replaced by horror. Next to him, Wu Chi didn’t look much better.</p> 
 <p>“What do you mean?!” exclaimed Bai Xiaofei, his posture practically saying ‘I demand an explanation.’</p> 
 <p>“It’s a good thing to be selected by a puppet, but the problem lies in the puppet that selected Wu Chi. It’s not a normal puppet, it has a problem…” said Feng Wuhen slowly.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei and Wu Chi were puzzled.</p> 
 <p><em>What problem can puppets have?</em></p> 
 <p>“Let me. I don’t think you can explain it in an objective manner,” Wei Feng suddenly interrupted Feng Wuhen from continuing. “First of all, I would like to talk about the test results. Besides the puppet that selected him, he has a good affinity for fire and earth energy. If the scale is ten, then his affinity of these two can be graded eight and six respectively. Meanwhile, the affinity with the puppet that actively chose him is definitely over ten, but this puppet is a little special. It is an incomplete puppet that can’t be upgraded but can evolve.”</p> 
 <p>Wei Feng was indeed objective with his explanation as his insipid tone was without any emotion. Since he wasn’t acquainted with Wu Chi, he had no psychological burden.</p> 
 <p>“As for its peculiarity, I’ll have to start from its birth history.”</p> 
 <p>After a short pause, Wei Feng entered his story-teller mode.</p> 
 <p>“All puppetsmiths have a common goal – forging a violetgold puppet and then be apotheosized as godly for it. To them, this is the highest honor, just like how everyone in Starnet strives for the Starnet Brilliance. However, the difficulty of forging a violetgold puppet is, in many aspects, much more difficult than getting a Starnet Brilliance. In addition to having a perfect technique, the puppetsmith also needs the right materials and the right method to match those materials. If anything in the refining process goes wrong, it is an instant failure. Moreover, the amount of resources consumed in this process is terrifying, that’s why violetgold puppets are so rare.”</p> 
 <p>After a long speech of background, Wei Feng suddenly paused and his eyes grew serious.</p> 
 <p>“The puppetsmith who forged Blood Demon is one of those who failed.”</p> 
 <p><em>Blood Demon!</em></p> 
 <p>Finally hearing the puppet's name, Wu Chi’s heart leaped in excitement for an unknown reason.</p> 
 <p>“However, Blood Demon is not a complete failure, so Karthus, the one who forged him, became the first person most likely to become a godly puppetsmith! In his original plan, Blood Demon was supposed to be one puppet, but he failed in the final stage – integration, and the puppet was divided into seven gold puppets with the same strength. He then tried to reintegrate them, but it was useless.”</p> 
 <p>Listening to Wei Feng's story, Bai Xiaofei and Wu Chi could imagine a puppetsmith staring blankly at his puppets. That feeling must have been very uncomfortable…</p> 
 <p>“However, after a series of tests, Karthus concluded that his seven Blood Demons could level up into a violetgold puppet. Of course, no one believed him at the beginning. Everyone thought that he made it up to protect his reputation, up until his conclusion was confirmed after the owners of two Blood Demons tried the method he said. While the Blood Demons can’t be upgraded normally like other puppets, Karthus’ method allows them to, in a way that every promotion can bring qualitative change. Once they have evolved a certain number of times, they may even become peak-grade violetgold. After this news spread, the rest of the Blood Demons immediately became the rage at the market. Countless tried to get their hands on them, but very few got the approval of the Blood Demons. Twenty years have passed since they were forged and only six Blood Demons have chosen their owners.”</p> 
 <p>Wei Feng stopped, his eyes rested on Wu Chi.</p> 
 <p>“So, it is the seventh Blood Demon who has just chosen me?” Wu Chi wasn’t foolish beyond cure yet. He quickly understood.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, that's right. You must be quite formidable, since the Blood Demons’ requirement for choosing owners is more than just harsh. However, being chosen isn’t necessarily a good thing.”</p> 
 <p>At the sudden turn of the conversation, Wei Feng once again put their hearts in anxiety.</p> 
 <p>“Blood Demons are good at everything and their power is just perverse, but the problem lies in Karthus’ upgrading method – by devouring each other. The Blood Demons can no longer be fused according to normal puppetsmiths’ forging methods, but after being nourished by puppet masters, special changes will occur that cause the Blood Demon to be active. After their masters die, the puppets in this active state will become a nutrient that allows the other Blood Demons to evolve. Therefore, the way for the Blood Demons to rank up is to kill the other six owners and take their Blood Demons to strengthen your own.”</p> 
 <p>As soon as the explanation finished, Bai Xiaofei and Wu Chi were struck dumb. They really didn't expect something like this…</p> 
 <p>At the same time, they also understood why Feng Wuhen had been so hesitant.</p>
