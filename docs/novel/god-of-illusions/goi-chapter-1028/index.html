 <p>Chapter 1028: Tan Xin</p> 
 <p>“He’s back!”</p> 
 <p>On the fortress wall, Tan Xin, who had been staring blankly in the direction of the Sacks, suddenly stood up in joy and took out her Windsurfing Ship. She boarded it and set the speed to maximum, and the ship shot out with a loud shrill sound.</p> 
 <p>In the distance, Bai Xiaofei was happily flying when the ship entered his perception range.</p> 
 <p>“The heck… Why do I have a bad feeling…?” He gulped and nervously stopped.</p> 
 <p>Before long, the huge ship stopped right in front of him. However, the strange air that this familiar big guy emitted only made Bai Xiaofei more nervous! </p> 
 <p>“BAI XIAOFEI!!!”</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin’s voice full of murderous intent, suddenly echoed. Before Bai Xiaofei could react, her fist had connected with his skull…</p> 
 <p>“Damn you for leaving me behind! Damn you for taking so long to come back! Damn you for leaving without a word! Damn you…”</p> 
 <p>Pouncing on Bai Xiaofei and knocking him to the ground, Tan Xin punched his chest as her harsh tone gradually became sobs.</p> 
 <p>“I’m back, aren’t I? Did my little girl miss me that much?” Bai Xiaofei grabbed her hand with a chortle, his words immediately put a stop to her tantrum.</p> 
 <p>“You… called me… what…?”</p> 
 <p>“Little dwarf, you’re at least a few hundred years old. Is pretending to be a little girl so fun?” a discordant voice interrupted the two.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei knew that it was bad. He hurriedly twisted his head to shoot the Demonic God of Pain a glare.</p> 
 <p>“Why are you glaring at me? Isn’t that what you told me? Can’t tell the truth when you see the person now?” asked the Demonic God of Pain ‘innocently.’</p> 
 <p>At that instant, Bai Xiaofei felt a surging murderous intent.</p> 
 <p>“BAI! XIAO! FEI!”</p> 
 <p>In this world, there was nothing a good beating couldn’t solve. Even if there was, then just beat harder…</p> 
 <p>“Let me introduce this friend of mine. You can call him Moshen<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>.” With a black and blue face, Bai Xiaofei introduced the Demonic God of Pain to Tan Xin.</p> 
 <p>As for Tan Xin, the Demonic God of Pain naturally knew who she was already.</p> 
 <p>“I’m sorry, I was only joking, I hope you will forgive me, little sister. If you want someone to blame, blame this smelly boy. He made me run after him all the way and refused to take me flying with him. I just wanted to find someone who could help me vent my anger.” The Demonic God of Pain chuckled with a sleazy expression very similar to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“It’s all right, I understand. He really needed a good lesson,” said Tan Xin coldly, having no intention to side with Bai Xiaofei at all.</p> 
 <p>“Can we change the subject? I’ve got my lesson, we can let it slide now.” Bai Xiaofei couldn’t bear to listen anymore, or else, he knew he’d be beaten harder.</p> 
 <p>“Has the matter with the Sacks been handled?” Tan Xin decided to spare him, but only after shooting him a profound look.</p> 
 <p>“You bet. That little Saintess is still keeping our Little Brother Bai in her heart even now,” said the Demonic God of Pain before Bai Xiaofei could reply, and obviously he only chose to tell the worst part of it.</p> 
 <p>From the Sacks to the border of Moonlight, he literally ran all the way. This was actually one of the reasons why Bai Xiaofei had asked him if he was sure that he wouldn’t regret it, because the human puppet could not fly!</p> 
 <p>“Oh? It seems that our General Bai’s charm has not diminished one bit, huh? If it weren’t for my earnest persuasion, the Moonlight emperor might still be waiting for his return here at the border.” Tan Xin viciously glared at Bai Xiaofei like a cat owner looking at her troublesome male cat.</p> 
 <p>“Ahem! With your ship’s speed, we should be able to reach the capital soon. Let’s leave Moonlight after I handle the leftover matters there. I don’t really comfortable here. Alright, I won’t entertain you two, I’m exhausted after flying for so long, I’m going to have a rest,” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly excused himself for fear of his life.</p> 
 <p>…… </p> 
 <p>“Demonic God, right?”</p> 
 <p>“A Survivor, aren’t you?”</p> 
 <p>After Bai Xiaofei left, Tan Xin activated a sound insulation barrier. She and the Demonic God of Pain then looked at each other and blurted out questions that made the atmosphere become quite strange.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know what your purpose is, but if you dare to hurt him, I will give you a very ugly death even if I have to risk my life!” Tan Xin seriously warned.</p> 
 <p>The Demonic God of Pain smiled wryly. “Oh? As if you don’t have ulterior motives. From what I know, it’s not so simple for you Survivors to integrate into a new world. Judging from your appearance, you still haven’t finished the last step. Don’t you want me to help you?”</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry about my business. Since you know that I am a Survivor, you should know what I’m capable of. I heard about the Battle between Demons and Gods, and I know those people in the Virtual World will be more than happy to beat you to ashes. At worst, I can just sacrifice myself to bridge the gap and lead them here!” Tan Xin stared intently at the Demonic God of Pain, her voice resolute.</p> 
 <p>“Little girl, you worry too much. He knows who I am.” Upon hearing the two words ‘Virtual World,’ the Demonic God of Pain’s expression became ugly, but he understood his present situation very well.</p> 
 <p>The current him couldn’t even handle Starnet Continent, let alone the Virtual World…</p> 
 <p>“I don’t trust old monsters like you. Remember, I’ll keep an eye on you!” Tan Xin coldly snorted, then removed the barrier and left.</p> 
 <p>Watching as she left, the Demonic God of Pain laughed.</p> 
 <p>“The smelly boy is quite a character to make this type of person fall head over heels for him. Looks like staying with him will turn out to be quite an interesting choice,” he said and slowly closed his eyes…</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei was staring blankly at the Dragon Saliva Fruit in his hand.</p> 
 <p>“Little fellow, why do I have a feeling that you will dupe me again?”</p>
