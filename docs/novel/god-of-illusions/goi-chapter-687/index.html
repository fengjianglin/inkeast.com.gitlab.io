 <p>Chapter 687: Tactical Retreat…</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei joyously snapped off all the spikes from the monsters. Once again, his moderate storage ring was filled.</p> 
 <p><em>It seems I should get a new one. This is not the first time that I’ve been limited by my storage space.</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei thought as he touched the ring Revelation had given him. He would keep this one if he could, but he didn’t want to wear a bunch of rings like a crude moneybag, so he would prefer changing a new one unless he found another way.</p> 
 <p>“Do we keep going further in?” asked Leng Liuying eagerly after they finished cleaning the battlefield. She was currently filled with the desire to explore the Holy Snow Mountain.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei poured cold water over them to the surprise of the three sisters.</p> 
 <p>“No, we should go back,” he said.</p> 
 <p>The triplets stared in disbelief. <em>Did that really just come out of Bai Xiaofei’s mouth?</em></p> 
 <p>Blinking her eyes, Leng Liuying touched Bai Xiaofei’s forehead, and then touched her own.</p> 
 <p>“No fever, so what was that nonsense about? We spent so much time getting here and even went through a battle. Now that we are just a little away from the peak, you want to go back?” For once, Leng Liuying used sense in her speech and earned the approval of her two sisters.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, her opponent was Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“It’s not nonsense. My original plan was just to have a look. I did intend to go in deeper, but you can all see that there’s already something capable of threatening our safety just at the edge. No one knows what else we will come across if we go deeper. On the whole, our preparation is lacking.”</p> 
 <p>His explanation made the triplets quiet down as they could not refute. Although they were able to dominate the spike monster, they didn’t let the victory get to their head and therefore they could understand his thoughts.</p> 
 <p>“But we’ve come so far…” Leng Liuying’s stubborn eyes were full of unwillingness as she looked at the mountain peak in the distance.</p> 
 <p>“Temporary departure is for a better next entry. Don’t worry, the next time we return, we will not retreat even if you want to, and that day will come soon.” Bai Xiaofei gently patted her shoulder with a smile.</p> 
 <p>“Humph, you little chicken!” Leng Liuying rolled her eyes.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei thus gained a new nickname. Leaving him behind caught between laughter and tears, Leng Liuying turned around and headed back toward the direction they had come from.</p> 
 <p>Having confirmed that they needed to leave, the group sped up and soon disappeared into the valley. Not long after they had left, a ‘messy’ team carefully approached the area where their battle had just taken place.</p> 
 <p>‘Messy’ was the way they dressed. At first glance, this group of people looked like they were forced together as all kinds of costumes from all over the world could be seen. Looking carefully, however, one would find that this was a top-class team!</p> 
 <p>If nothing else, they breathed basically at the same frequency. Over two dozen people and there wasn’t even a sound as they approached the valley.</p> 
 <p>“Captain, those monsters were all handled.”</p> 
 <p>As the group waited nervously, the scout ran back with a report that spread shock among them.</p> 
 <p><em>Handled?! By whom?! I’ve never heard about a formidable expert choosing this route!</em></p> 
 <p>This made them nervous. There were many roads to their final destination and no one wanted to cross a tough opponent before reaching the final stage as it did no good for either side.</p> 
 <p>Soon, the group arrived at the battlefield. The dozens of ‘bald’ monster corpses were almost covered by snow, which also erased all traces of fighting.</p> 
 <p>This was fortunate for the newly arrived group. Otherwise, if they were to find clues hinting that this group of monsters had been ‘killing each other,’ they might lose the courage to move on.</p> 
 <p>“There’s no obvious trauma, but their internal organs are damaged evenly. It seems that the killer is a very special puppet master.” The leader came to this conjecture with an ugly face. To be able to kill all of these difficult monsters by themselves, the person ahead of them would definitely be a huge obstacle that was at least an Exquisite Rank expert!</p> 
 <p>Reality proved that sometimes seemingly logical inferences might not be correct…</p> 
 <p>For example, this poor leader.</p> 
 <p>“Everyone scatter. We’ll continue to act as guildless adventurers and keep a low profile. Do not make unnecessary trouble! Before we find out who this expert is, the goal is to keep yourselves safe!“</p> 
 <p>After a series of commands, the two dozen people quickly dispersed before heading towards the depths of the snowy mountain…</p> 
 <p>While this group of people was worrying about an imaginary opponent, Bai Xiaofei’s group had already crossed the valley area and returned to the temporary town outside. Fortunately, they did not run into Bryne and avoided a lot of trouble.</p> 
 <p>Returning to the inn, the triplets once again holed up, determined not to step out of the door. Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei used this rare rest time in the trading area. Although there was no special situation this time, the seeds he had planted the last time could be harvested today.</p> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei shouted he wanted to buy white puppets, a myriad of people rushed over and surrounded him. They had been waiting for him for too long! Refusing no one, his temporary storage bracelet borrowed from Leng Liuli was almost filled up.</p> 
 <p>Looking at the mountain of white puppets inside, he sighed in relief. <em>This should be enough for a while.</em></p> 
 <p>Suddenly, Bai Xiaofei looked troubled. In fact, even if more people came wanting to sell, he couldn’t afford it. Just now, he had given out his last Amethyst Coin…</p> 
 <p>That’s right, he had spent every last penny.</p> 
 <p>Over 10 million Amethyst Coins was his entire pocket money. Originally, he had felt that he’d never be able to spend 10 million, so when Feng Wuhen suggested giving him more, he refused.</p> 
 <p>Now it seemed that he had thought too little. After ‘gifting’ Cang Lan and buying the formation base, he had fallen directly from rich to broke due to having no clear idea of money…</p> 
 <p>However, there was one thing that Bai Xiaofei had to consider, something that never even crossed his mind before this ––</p> 
 <p>The accommodation fees…</p>
