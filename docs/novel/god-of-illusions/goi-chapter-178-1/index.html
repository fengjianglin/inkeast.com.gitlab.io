 <p>“What happened after that one day?” Xue Ying asked when she saw Bai Xiaofei stop. For some reason, she was very interested in his story.</p>
 <p>“Until one day, a seriously injured mysterious person brought a baby there. But due to his serious injuries, the mysterious person departed this world soon after. Therefore, the baby became a problem for the people there to deal with.</p>
 <p>“How should they deal with the baby? They got into an intense argument. Some suggested eating the baby, and some commented that a deep-fried baby would taste better. In any case, all sorts of crazy ideas were suggested. However, they all neglected one thing.”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, a blissful smile appeared on Bai Xiaofei’s face. Xue Ying was infected by his emotion, and she lightly smiled, her mood improving considerably.</p>
 <p>“What did they neglect?” Xue Ying was completely engrossed in the story. She started yearning to know what happened next.</p>
 <p>“They neglected the fact that the appearance of this baby had breathed more life into the atmosphere. Ultimately, the baby was lucky enough to not end up as their dinner. Instead, everyone grew attached to the baby.</p>
 <p>“And when a person found a sense of attachment, purpose would reappear in that person’s life. As time passed, the baby grew. The people there were no longer suicidal as well. Do you think it’s even possible for a baby to bring about such a huge change?”</p>
 <p>The sudden question caught Xue Ying off guard. However, she soon smiled. “As per your own words, nothing is impossible in this world as long as one believes one can do it. I am willing to believe everything you say.”</p>
 <p>Her simple reply sent Bai Xiaofei into a short daze. Of course, he still had to continue his story.</p>
 <p>“Time passed, and the baby was now a child. He discovered how special that place was, and in his own way, he started trying to bring more life to it. Gradually, the people there got a brand new life with their past their sole weakness. The kid was therefore transformed into the best listener for them to talk about their pasts, a vessel in which they stored their weaknesses.</p>
 <p>“And ultimately, when the kid grew old enough, he decided to leave, carrying all their weaknesses with him. He wanted to give them a new reason to leave that place, even though he didn’t know what the future would have in hold for him once he left.”</p>
 <p>At this point, Xue Ying already knew who was the main character of the story. Nevertheless, she still listened on faithfully.</p>
 <p>“So what is this kid thinking about now?” She whispered expectantly.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei spoke while gazing straight at Xue Ying. “He still remembers his mission, yet he is starting to lose his sense of direction. He never expected that this world would also give him his own weakness. Because of this weakness, he has no choice but to first put his mission to the side.”</p>
 <p>Xue Ying pinched Bai Xiaofei’s face and said with a smile, “He is a very outstanding person. I believe a day will come when this kid is no longer lost. Am I right?”</p>
 <p>To her surprise, she couldn’t pull her hand back, as Bai Xiaofei had held onto her hand. After a slight struggle and having failed to pull back her hand, she stopped and gazed at Bai Xiaofei in silence.</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Xue, may I ask you a question?”</p>
 <p>In this situation, she had no way of saying no.</p>
 <p>“If a day comes when both of us have to stand at opposing sides, what will you do?”</p>
 <p>The moment she heard this, her face froze. Then, they each sank into long thought.</p>
 <p>Eventually, Xue Ying broke the silence and, with an incomparably solemn expression, declared, “No matter what, as long as I am around, I will not allow any harm to come to you. Even if you want to harm me, I won’t resist. This is what I owe you.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei remained silent. He was unaware of what he should say.</p>
 <p>“Can I also ask you a question?” Once again, Xue Ying broke the silence, her solemn expression replaced by a smile.</p>
 <p>“Yes. Ask anything you want.” Bai Xiaofei calmly agreed, still holding Xue Ying’s hand.</p>
 <p>“I hope the kid in your story can have a happy ending. Can you make that happen?” Xue Ying stared straight into Bai Xiaofei’s eyes, unwilling to miss any change in his expression.</p>
 <p>“I will do my best. After all, I hate sad endings.” Bai Xiaofei grinned and let go of Xue Ying’s hand. He then raised his head and continued gazing at the night sky. “The moon is so round tonight,” Bai Xiaofei said before inhaling deeply, sounding less tense than before.</p>
 <p>“I almost didn’t notice. This is a rare chance. Shouldn’t we make use of it properly?” Xue Ying said with a sly smile on her face. Bai Xiaofei couldn’t understand what she was trying to say.</p>
 <p>“What do you—”</p>
 <p>His words were cut off by Xue Ying’s actions. She held onto his right hand and gently wrapped it around her waist. Then, she leaned against his chest. “Hug me tightly and don’t say anything. I only want to gaze at the moon.”</p>
 <p>After realizing what was happening, Bai Xiaofei fell into a slight stun then tightened his arm around her as he was told.</p>
 <p><em>This moon is really quite beautiful…</em></p>
 <p>Before he knew it, he fell asleep. When he woke up, he found that he was covered by a fur overcoat and lying on the ground. Xue Ying, who had woken up earlier, was sitting beside him and silently gazing at him.</p>
 <p>“How long have you been awake?” Bai Xiaofei sat up and started checking his clothing as if he was a little girl who had been molested. To his disappointment, his clothing was still in an orderly manner.</p>
 <p>“Look at how you are behaving. As if I would take advantage of you. I am still a virgin flower. How can I let you take advantage of me? I have been awake for a while, but I was scared that you would be laughed at if the public saw you. That’s why I have been staying here waiting for you to wake up.”</p>
 <p>As she spoke, she waved her right hand. “I set up a formation earlier. So long as I remain within the formation, we won’t be seen. Otherwise, how will I be brave enough to sleep here with you? No…I mean sit here with you.”</p>
 <p>Xue Ying corrected herself with a slight blush on her face the moment she realized her wrong choice of word.</p>
 <p>“I knew it. Big Sister Xue, who would be on guard even when going out on a stroll, would never become so brave.” After understanding what was going on, Bai Xiaofei heaved a sigh of relief. He stretched slightly and stood up. “Let’s go. Breakfast is on me to celebrate me waking up early. I’ll have you know that it is very rare for me to wake up this early.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei rubbed his belly as he made his generous offer. Generosity was a trait rarely seen in him.</p>
 <p>“Hey!”</p>
 <p>He had just turned around when Xue Ying suddenly shouted at him. She grudgingly stared at him and asked, “Do you still remember what you said last night?”</p>
 <p>“Don’t you worry. How can I forget what Boss Xue Ying told me?” Bai Xiaofei grinned and continued walking. Behind him, Xue Ying smiled as well. Then, she stepped forward into her usual position and hugged Bai Xiaofei’s arm.</p>
 <p>“As usual, I am not your teacher.”</p>
 <p>“And I’m not your student.”</p>
