 <p>Chapter 671: It’s Time!</p> 
 <p>Hearing the roar of Cang Lan from a distance, Bai Xiaofei hurriedly poured energy into the boat to make it go as fast as he could. He feared that if he got caught, he might not be able to return to the peach blossom forest for a good while.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei’s worry was unnecessary. Although Cang Lan’s Light Chaser was a rare commodity known for its speed, he couldn’t use it until the taste of Devil Pepper was eliminated, and by that time, Bai Xiaofei was already standing in front of the Leng sisters.</p> 
 <p>“My beautiful ladies! Have you missed me?” Bai Xiaofei grinned with wide-open arms, only to welcome a flying kick from Leng Liuying.</p> 
 <p>“You think too much. We’d be happier if you just drop dead outside,” she snorted and dusted her hands. The other two laughed unkindly at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Keep doing this to me, and you will lose me,” said Bai Xiaofei with a very serious expression as he crawled up from the ground.</p> 
 <p>Leng Liuying rolled her eyes. “Cut your crap. Going missing for a month, what have you been doing?”</p> 
 <p>Despite her harsh words, Leng Liuying’s concern for Bai Xiaofei was absolutely no less than that of her two sisters. Her way of expressing it was just a bit special.</p> 
 <p>“A lot, in fact. But the three of you had to stay in this small forest. Are you sure that your training can keep up?” Recalling his hardships, Bai Xiaofei looked at the triplets in doubt.</p> 
 <p>Originally, he was a little worried that the three of them wouldn’t be able to pull through such demanding training, but now it seemed that his worry was completely unnecessary. These three people had clearly passed their days much more pleasantly!</p> 
 <p>“We should be the ones asking you this.” Leng Liuying snorted in contempt. Then, twenty inkstone beads floated up slowly around her. During the whole process, not a single one made a sound!</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Bai Xiaofei was stupefied.</p> 
 <p>“How is that? I’m formidable, aren’t I?” asked Leng Liuying smugly, mistaking his stupor for surprise.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei <em>was</em> surprised, but not about what she thought.</p> 
 <p>“What is this…?”</p> 
 <p>His question stunned the triplets because they could see that he was not faking it.</p> 
 <p>“You didn’t practice this?”</p> 
 <p>“You didn’t catch Snow Moles?”</p> 
 <p>The four asked almost at the same time, and their questions stunned each other.</p> 
 <p>Then, they exchanged their own training experiences and finally, Bai Xiaofei got so angry that his whole body trembled violently, while the triplets burst out laughing like crazy.</p> 
 <p>They had thought the other would have it a little easier or harder, but the difference was actually so big. Although all roads led to the same goal, these roads were truly two extremes!</p> 
 <p>“Smelly brat! Die!!!”</p> 
 <p>Before Bai Xiaofei could complain about his rough fate, Cang Lan’s murderous voice echoed in the sky. The next second, the old man had descended and at the same time, a powerful force pressed down on Bai Xiaofei, fixing him on the spot.</p> 
 <p>“I have a way to get rid of the Devil Pepper taste on the rest of the crystals!” shouted Bai Xiaofei quick-wittedly when Cang Lan’s palm was about to land on his head. With that, he successfully saved his own life.</p> 
 <p>Begging for mercy might not be useful on Cang Lan, but food could definitely be exchanged for a chance, especially when it was about Crystal’s Longings that he was obsessed with.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the triplets were puzzled. Bai Xiaofei hadn’t told them that he had been stealing Crystal’s Longings for half a month, so they found their verbal exchange very confusing.</p> 
 <p>“Brat, you know what will happen if you lie to me!” Cang Lan’s gnashed his teeth, his face a vicious expression.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s tact was nothing to joke about. He smiled so much that his face was all wrinkled.</p> 
 <p>“How would I dare to?!” He motioned to the triplets. “With them here, how dare I trick you?!”</p> 
 <p>Despite his humble words, the implication was otherwise. <em>It’s up to you, old man. Your three precious granddaughters are here. If they know that you have been stealing Crystal’s Longings, I’ll see how you’ll save that face of yours!</em></p> 
 <p>Upon Bai Xiaofei’s ‘reminder,’ Cang Lan immediately hesitated and quickly put away his vicious expression. At the same time, regret arose from the bottom of his heart. He should have known that the brat would grasp this weak point and use it as leverage against him. He shouldn’t have been so greedy!</p> 
 <p>However, Cang Lan didn’t show his thoughts on his face. He squeezed out a smile with difficulty.</p> 
 <p>“Of course. After all, you still have God Control to learn.” Cang Lan looked at Bai Xiaofei with a sharp glint at odds with his smile.</p> 
 <p><em>Brat, I can forget about this, but if you want to learn my God Control, be smart and let this rot in your stomach!</em></p> 
 <p>“Of course, that’s the most important thing. I don’t want to come all the way here for nothing,” Bai Xiaofei understood the implication and quickly agreed.</p> 
 <p>Just like that, a pleasant consensus was reached while the two locked eyes. However, it was only temporary.</p> 
 <p>Cang Lan was thinking about how to get back at Bai Xiaofei for the Devil Pepper later, while Bai Xiaofei was thinking about the Snow Mole grudge. The minds of one young and one old man were completely in sync…</p> 
 <p>“Hey, what are you two talking about?!” shouted Leng Liuying with her hands on her hips, her pouting lips and wrinkled brows vividly expressing her dissatisfaction.</p> 
 <p>The other two weren’t as emotional, but there were doubts in their eyes.</p> 
 <p>“Nothing. He means he is going to teach us to God Control,” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly glossed it over with big news.</p> 
 <p>“Really?!”</p> 
 <p>The eyes of the triplets lit up in excitement. Such three pairs of twinkling stars shot at Cang Lan at the same time, seizing his heart.</p> 
 <p>If someone could resist such an ‘attack’ from the three girls, then he was definitely not a man. Although Cang Lan had been single for hundreds of years, he was still a normal old man…</p> 
 <p>“The smelly boy is right,” a helpless Cang Lan confirmed as he quickly shot a glare at Bai Xiaofei, but was ignored. He went on to say, “Although it hasn’t been long, you have indeed reached the bare minimum to cultivate God Control. We can officially start.”</p> 
 <p>Cang Lan then took two steps back. When he shook his right hand gently, all the bandages wrapping it scattered, revealing the purple-gold arm that shocked everyone every time it made an appearance – God Control!</p>
