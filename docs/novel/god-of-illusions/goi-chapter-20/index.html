 <p>Bai Ye swore that this was absolutely the first time he’d seen someone that dared bully Qin Lingyan like this. Not to mention anything else, it was the first time he’d seen such an expression on Qin Lingyan’s face!</p>
 <p>The table before them was already covered in almost two layers of plates of various sizes, and the waiters were still bringing over dishes continuously.</p>
 <p>“Are you sure you’re able to eat it?” Qin Lingyan had already gnashed her teeth to the point they emitted cracking sounds because after this table of food was eaten, she would basically be unable to eat properly for an entire month.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, Senior Sister. I will surely not waste anything, otherwise, I’ll pay for the food!” Bai Xiaofei rubbed his hands together before pulling up his sleeves yet the nearby Huskie suddenly barked when he was just about to start eating.</p>
 <p>“No, do you think I’m an idiot? I’ve allowed you to eat freely, so how can I compete with you?” Bai Xiaofei rolled his eyes fiercely at Huskie before officially entering the battle.</p>
 <p>After that, Bai Ye and Qin Lingyan witnessed what a whirlwind that swept everything away was!</p>
 <p>One plate, two plates, three plates….</p>
 <p>No matter what was contained within the plates, Bai Xiaofei casually pulled it over before sweeping through it, and the most terrifying thing of it all was that under this sort of speed, Bai Xiaofei was actually still able to give a suitable evaluation after finishing every single dish!</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, an ‘empty space’ had already been cleared out before Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei wasn’t the most ruthless because the most ruthless was Huskie who Qin Lingyan thought was just an accessory. If she was given a chance to do it all over again, then she would surely not think that Huskie was only a dog.</p>
 <p><i>It isn’t a f*cking dog!</i></p>
 <p><i>It’s obviously an elephant alright!!!</i></p>
 <p>Huskie who didn’t seem very big was like a bottomless abyss, and he ate more than two times faster than Bai Xiaofei!</p>
 <p>Moreover, based on his excited appearance, he seemed to have just entered into the zone….</p>
 <p>“Eh, why aren’t the two of you eating?” As he patted his belly and burped, Bai Xiaofei whose mouth was shining with oil had finally recalled that there were still another two people at this table.</p>
 <p>“Oh, oh, I’m sorry. I unintentionally finished everything.” Bai Xiaofei slapped himself on the head and revealed an embarrassed smile as he looked at the empty plates that covered the entire table.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Bai Ye had already been completely dumbstruck, and Qin Lingyan who ought to be furious didn’t even know what sort of expression she should use to face everything before her eyes.</p>
 <p>But, both of them had a common thought — <i>They’ve finally finished eating!</i></p>
 <p>Unfortunately, this thought didn’t represent reality….</p>
 <p>“It’s fine, it’s fine. This is only the first table full of food, and there’re still more to come, so both of you won’t stay hungry.” As soon as these words were spoken, Qin Lingyan and Bai Ye both revealed terrified expressions at the same time.</p>
 <p>“There’re more?!!!” Qin Lingyan and Bai Ye both exclaimed at the same time, and disbelief was already insufficient to describe the expressions on their faces at this moment.</p>
 <p>“Right. I asked for four rounds of the same dishes from before. We can just order more if it isn’t enough.” Bai Xiaofei spoke in an extremely carefree manner, yet Qin Lingyan and Bai Ye were both horrified when they heard it.</p>
 <p>Moreover, Bai Ye finally understood why Bai Xiaofei asked that in the beginning. <i>Four rounds of the same dishes, Qin Lingyan might really have insufficient money….</i></p>
 <p>“Bai Xiaofei!!!”</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Qin Lingyan struck the table to the point it trembled, and she stood up directly.</p>
 <p>But, before Qin Lingyan could fly off the handle, Bai Xiaofei had already seized the opportunity to speak a step before her.</p>
 <p>“Senior Sister, don’t worry. Just speak frankly if you don’t have enough money, and I’ll cancel the next few rounds. I’m an extremely considerate person and won’t make it difficult for you, Senior Sister.” Just like this, Qin Lingyan’s words were forcefully pressed back in, and Bai Ye who sat by Bai Xiaofei’s side was already feeling worried for Bai Xiaofei’s future.</p>
 <p><i>This enmity can be said to have been sowed today, and there seems to already be no need to imagine the miserable consequences of a new student sowing enmity with a popular Senior Sister like Qin Lingyan.</i></p>
 <p><i>But, is this what he meant when he said being despicable until the end? This is….</i></p>
 <p><i>Really f*cking despicable!!!</i></p>
 <p>As he thought like this, Bai Ye played his role of a full time spectator with extreme seriousness.</p>
 <p>“Waiter! Give me another two rounds of the same dishes!!!” Qin Lingyan’s voice was loud to the point she had completely lost her usual image, and she seemed to have already entered entirely into a fight with Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“Today, you’ll either die from being too full, or you’ll make me poor! Otherwise, don’t hope of walking out of the 100 Flavor House’s door!” Qin Lingyan glared fiercely at Bai Xiaofei, and she utterly didn’t conceal her innermost thoughts and spoke them out.</p>
 <p>“Senior Sister, why torture yourself by doing this?” Bai Xiaofei frowned slightly, and a trace of difficulty seemed to have appeared on Bai Xiaofei’s face.</p>
 <p>“There nothing torturous about this. Just eat your food!” Qin Lingyan sat down once more and had finally found a trace of the feeling of victory. But, unfortunately, this sort of feeling didn’t last for long.</p>
 <p>“Waiter, add on another two more rounds.” Qin Lingyan had just sat down when Bai Xiaofei spoke a sentence that caused her to feel she’d made the wrong decision.</p>
 <p>“Huskie, didn’t you want to compete with me earlier and see who can eat more?” As he spoke, a unique fluctuation gushed out from within Bai Xiaofei’s body.</p>
 <p>When Huskie who was resting between battles heard this, he hurriedly shook his head like a rattle-drum, and his whining seemed to be repeating the words Bai Xiaofei had said to him earlier.</p>
 <p><i>Wouldn’t I be giving away my dog food if I compete with you when you’re in your current state!?</i></p>
 <p>It was precisely within these few breaths of time that Huskie was whining wildly that Bai Xiaofei’s stomach that had bulged up from eating actually shrunk down at a speed visible to the eye and replacing this was Bai Xiaofei seemed more and more spirited.</p>
 <p>When he was with Old Man Revelations earlier, Bai Xiaofei had actually not told Old Man Revelations everything about himself.</p>
 <p>His inability to control his Origin Energy was true, but Bai Xiaofei had never stopped utilizing puppets, whereas, this special ability to utilize puppets while lacking Origin Energy came from his Fourth Father!</p>
 <p>The Heaven Devouring Dog, Tu Bujin!</p>
 <p>There were probably very few people that knew the nickname Heaven Devouring Dog on the continent, but the secret technique of the Heaven Devouring Dog had always been passed down on the continent in the form of a legend.</p>
 <p>The technique, World Devourer, was capable of storing energy within the body through ceaseless eating. This energy could be used to replace daily consumption of food, or it could be used as a replacement for Origin Energy. But, its effects were just slightly inferior.</p>
 <p>It was precisely by relying on this secret technique that Tu Bujin had created the record of being pursued for three months without sleep nor rest yet ceaselessly counter killing his pursuers.</p>
 <p>Now, Bai Xiaofei had utilized it here….</p>
 <p>Time slowly flowed by bit by bit. This was the first and the last time that Qin Lingyan felt that watching another eat was actually so tormenting.</p>
 <p>At the instant Bai Xiaofei stopped completely, Qin Lingyan had a feeling of escape that didn’t suit the current situation, and it wasn’t just her, even Bai Ye broke out in cold sweat for Qin Lingyan.</p>
 <p>“Senior Sister, let’s stop here today. I can’t make you stay behind and sell your body, right?” This time, Qin Lingyan disregarded Bai Xiaofei’s words.</p>
 <p>She believed that so long as she retorted, then Bai Xiaofei would surely order another two more rounds, and she would be unable to pay for those two more rounds no matter what….</p>
 <p>After he wiped his mouth, Bai Xiaofei who’d eaten to his satisfaction snapped his fingers at Huskie.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go, Huskie!” As she looked at the figures of this dog and man leaving, Qin Lingyan suddenly recalled the words Bai Xiaofei had said earlier.</p>
 <p><i>I’ll eat until it hurts and make you remember me….</i></p>
