 <p>Chapter 998: Born a Fickle, Die a Fickle!</p> 
 <p>“I thought you were going to be kept overnight by that pervy emperor!” Tan Xin jumped on Bai Xiaofei the moment he opened the door to his room.</p> 
 <p>“I know I’m handsome and all, but that’s no reason to call her pervy…” Bai Xiaofei said, partly awkward, partly proud.</p> 
 <p>Unexpectedly, his remark stunned Tan Xin for a good while.</p> 
 <p>“Am I dreaming?!” She teleported in front of him and started staring. Before Bai Xiaofei could respond, she suddenly pinched his waist.</p> 
 <p>“Ahhhhh!” Bai Xiaofei screamed.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin gulped. “Since it hurts, it’s not a dream. What did that perv do to you? How did you… how did you become normal?!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei understood why she was surprised.</p> 
 <p>“She gave me a hearty lesson and enlightened me… Wait! Can’t you stop calling her that? At least she was generous enough to agree to all of our demands,” Bai Xiaofei said with a scowl.</p> 
 <p>“Humph! You didn’t notice the way she looked at you! Like she couldn’t wait to eat you right then and there!” yelled Tan Xin with hostility. If this wasn’t Moonlight’s territory, she would never have let Bai Xiaofei go with Ye Qingcheng.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, alright. Go back and rest. We still have work to do later,” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly changed the topic.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin immediately revealed a look of being wronged. “I waited for so long and you’re just telling me to go back…” Her head low, her index fingers touching each other, and her pitiful voice coupled with her petite appearance made Bai Xiaofei feel like he was the most heinous villain in the world.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, then don’t go. Let me tell you a sto…”</p> 
 <p>“Yay!” Tan Xin cried out excitedly before Bai Xiaofei could finish his words. She then drilled into his blanket at lightning speed and poked her head out shyly. “You said it, so I can only obey our general’s order. Please be gentle with me, this is my first time…”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei gawked in shock. Gulping with difficulty, he knew he had been tricked… <em>You’re the perv here, alright?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Fine, if you don’t get out of there, I’ll sleep outside!”</p> 
 <p><em>I can’t provoke you, but I can hide!</em></p> 
 <p>“I warn you, if you dare to run, I’ll tear up my clothes and run out crying, shouting that General Bai bullied a little girl!” Tan Xin’s voice coldly rang out just as Bai Xiaofei turned around to leave.</p> 
 <p><em>What the heck?!! This girl evolved again?!</em></p> 
 <p>“You should learn to be more reserved!” Bai Xiaofei righteously advised.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin coldly snorted. “If I act reserved with you, I’ll have to wait until my next life to get official. You have three seconds to get back here!”</p> 
 <p>She obviously planned to act out her words for real. Before Bai Xiaofei could react, the countdown had already started.</p> 
 <p>“Three!”</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei showed no sign of turning around, so Tan Xin decided to take it upon herself to make it happen. Her creation ability was launched, and a suction force pulled him to the bed. She then wrapped her limbs around him like an octopus.</p> 
 <p>And then… nothing.</p> 
 <p>After hugging Bai Xiaofei, Tan Xin had no idea what to do next, and so the two were in a deadlock for half a day.</p> 
 <p>“How about… we do this all night? Let’s put it on hold until I’m ready…” Tan Xin finally broke the silence, her voice as soft as a mosquito buzz.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was relieved. “That’s fine by me. After all, you are the boss.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Tan Xin also relaxed. After all, it was already not easy for her to achieve this level. She had been even more nervous than Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>After the tension eased, Tan Xin curled up into a ball in Bai Xiaofei’s arms and demanded, “Hold me!”</p> 
 <p>With a wry smile, Bai Xiaofei obediently did as told. Before long, the two tired people entered their dreams one after another, marking the end of the eventful day.</p> 
 <p>This night had opened a new door for Tan Xin. Whenever she thought back about this experience, she would feel grateful to Ye Qingcheng for giving her the courage to speed up the process…</p> 
 <p>In the days after, Ye Qingcheng repeatedly summoned Bai Xiaofei before successively issuing several orders, after which the whole Moonlight border started carrying out.</p> 
 <p>On the sixth day after Bai Xiaofei’s group arrived in Divine Light, Ye Qingcheng received a report from Crimson Moon Fortress about what had happened at Savage Wolf Ridge. It was also on this day that Bai Xiaofei and the group of 600-odd men welcomed what they had been expecting – their due justice!</p> 
 <p>As the facts were announced to the public by Ye Qingcheng, the men were thrust into the spotlight. Over a dozen thousand holding off 300,000 troops and successfully killing nearly 200,000 of them had become the hottest story at the border.</p> 
 <p>After the story garnered enough publicity and momentum, Ye Qingcheng announced their rewards: making their deed known to the whole empire, building a monument, bestowing titles, and giving them an exclusive name – the Fickle Army!</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingcheng shouldered the pressure from the whole empire and ‘stubbornly’ met all the demands that Bai Xiaofei had made. Because of this move, the name Fickle Bai became the center of the empire’s talk.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei couldn’t care less about what was happening outside. At present, only the 600-odd brothers standing in front of him mattered!</p> 
 <p>“Can you guys hold back a little? At this rate, I think you’d grow wings and fly up from being too happy.” Bai Xiaofei was in a good mood at the sight of the men smiling from ear to ear. However, business still needed discussing.</p> 
 <p>“Zip your mouths, Boss wants to speak!” shouted Zhuang Shuo.</p> 
 <p>As a result, the picture of the men all trying to suppress their smiles made Xiaofei shake his head with a sigh.</p> 
 <p>“I have fulfilled my promise to you, and I believe that no one will look down on you now. However, the border war has not ended. Now you have two choices ahead of you. First, go back and enjoy prosperity for the rest of your life. I will not laugh at you, because you definitely deserve it. Second, stay and keep risking your life. I don’t know if you will be able to get more rewards out of this, but it’s likely that you will die. Now, make your choice.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei finished and turned his back to them. In fact, he truly wanted them all to choose the first option, but…</p> 
 <p>“Brothers, tell Boss who we are!” yelled Zhuang Shuo.</p> 
 <p>The next second, the group answered collectively,</p> 
 <p>“We are the Fickle Army! Born a Fickle, die a Fickle!”</p> 
 <p>His nose tingling, Bai Xiaofei looked up as his eyes grew hot. <em>Oh, these fools!</em></p>
