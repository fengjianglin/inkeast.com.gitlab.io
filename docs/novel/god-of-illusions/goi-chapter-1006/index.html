 <p>Chapter 1006: Hitching a Ride!</p> 
 <p>“They’re coming!”</p> 
 <p>The Fickle Army who had been lying in wait for an entire day finally ushered in the light of hope when they were just about to leave. Bai Xiaofei watched intently in that direction, and pleasant surprise lit up his face.</p> 
 <p><em>Now that’s a huge gift package!</em></p> 
 <p>It was a group of at least 5,000 Sacks soldiers escorting a bulky motorcade, with the number of coachmen alone amounting to 3,000. From the depth of the wheel marks, the things in the carriages were quite heavy.</p> 
 <p>In a place and a time like this, what such a motorcade carried was an obvious answer: Food!</p> 
 <p>“Inform everyone, do not attack for real. Just hold them off for a while, then pretend to be defeated and retreat!” Bai Xiaofei made a quick plan before the motorcade entered their ambush range.</p> 
 <p>Nothing was more suitable as a stepping stone than this food escort motorcade being delivered right to their doorstep.</p> 
 <p>As the motorcade slowly approached, a command from Bai Xiaofei marked the beginning of an excellent performance.</p> 
 <p>All the non-fatal traps were activated, which didn’t even tickle the Sacks, but the emergence of the enemy soldiers caught them completely off guard. After all, who could have thought that they would be ambushed right on their own turf?</p> 
 <p>Therefore, despite the Fickle Army holding back, the first wave of attacks still took down several hundred people.</p> 
 <p>“Raise the barricades and shoot arrows to interfere with their flow! Expose our numbers to attract them into attacking back!” Bai Xiaofei issued a series of orders, and the Fickle Army immediately acted on them.</p> 
 <p>After another two hundred people fell, the Sacks motorcade finally returned to their senses. From the density of arrows, they judged that the other party didn’t have many people.</p> 
 <p>“It’s impossible that a big army can sneak into this place, so it must be some small force from the vicinity! Don’t panic, fight back!” shouted the leader of the motorcade.</p> 
 <p>The Sacks soldiers immediately observed the situation and came to the same conclusion. One by one, they stormed toward the direction of the ambush.</p> 
 <p>“Prepare to retreat, but don’t move too fast, let them see clearly how many people we have. Kite them for a while!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s order was quickly passed down, and the Fickle Army immediately changed directions. Before long, the Sacks soldiers quickly approached while shouting slogans, only to be welcomed by the traps and more arrows.</p> 
 <p>However, this didn’t discourage the Sacks soldiers. On the contrary, they were thrilled to see that the other party only had a hundred people! <em>This is not an ambush, this is a damned provocation!</em></p> 
 <p>The crazed Sacks soldiers immediately charged fearlessly, but their responses were still the same traps and the unhurried counterattacks of the Fickle Army. Since a part of the traps were made by Tan Xin, so the kill zone took nearly a thousand lives before letting the Sacks soldiers pass.</p> 
 <p>However, what came next was a crueler scene – the Fickle Army ran extremely fast!!!</p> 
 <p>Compared with the fighting and traps just now, the Fickle Army, when fleeing wholeheartedly, was like having wings on their legs. After giving chase for less than one kilometer, all the Sacks could see was a row of blurry figures!</p> 
 <p>It couldn’t be helped. After all, running was the first lesson of the Fickle Army…</p> 
 <p>Being dragged around for several hours, the furious motorcade began to count casualties and clean up the battlefield.</p> 
 <p>And then, they became even more furious.</p> 
 <p>The opponent who only had more than a hundred people had been able to take down more than a thousand of their soldiers. Many carriages were also damaged, and the most disgusting thing was that the road was destroyed…</p> 
 <p>Helpless, the leader had to order a break on the spot while their laborers fixed the road.</p> 
 <p>“It’s impossible to arrive at the fortress tonight. Tell everyone to be on their guard. If those guys dare to come back again, we must kill them!” In the makeshift camp, the leader was shaking with anger at the mention of the enemy.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei’s group, who hadn’t run far at all, had set up barbecue sets and started cooking.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, we clearly could wipe them out. Why did we suddenly stop?” Zhuang Shuo asked curiously as he chomped on his meat.</p> 
 <p>“Our ultimate goal is to enter the fortress. My original plan was to stop some people and interrogate the reason why they are entering the fortress, and then we can disguise as them, but I realized this method is not reliable. If the gate guards are just a little smart, we will be at great risk. However, if we don’t have to face the guards directly, it will be much simpler, and that food motorcade meets the requirement,” Bai Xiaofei chortled evilly.</p> 
 <p>“We’re going to blend in?” said Zhuang Shuo after thinking for a moment.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei, Tan Xin, and Ye Qingtong were dumbstruck. They swallowed a mouthful of saliva and looked at Zhuang Shuo in astonishment.</p> 
 <p>“Ehhh… Boss, even if… I got it wrong, you don’t have to look at me like that.” Zhuang Shuo panicked under their stares.</p> 
 <p>“No, no, no, you’re right. We’re just surprised that you actually started thinking!” Bai Xiaofei said, and the other two nodded in agreement.</p> 
 <p>Zhuang Shuo gawked at them and almost couldn’t hold back his tears. <em>So it turns out that you’ve always seen me as an idiot!</em></p> 
 <p>“Alright, I won’t tease you. You’re right, we’re going to blend in. That’s why we have to hold them off. As long as they stay on the road for the night, that will be our chance,” Bai Xiaofei said and took a bite of his lamb leg. “Get some sleep after you finish eating. We will get up in the middle of the night.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the soldiers who had to concentrate all day immediately fell down on their backs. The word sleep was what they wanted to hear most at the moment.</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>Unlike the fast asleep Fickle Army, the Sacks motorcade had to arrange for patrols during their night stay. At first, the patrol took their work very seriously, but because nothing happened at all, the sleepiness gradually caught up with them after midnight and those in the later shifts began to doze off.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei, who didn’t sleep at all to monitor the entire area, naturally saw this.</p> 
 <p>“Well, is everything I asked of you ready?” he asked upon hearing footsteps behind him.</p> 
 <p>“Are your ears dog’s ears? You can tell it’s me from just my footsteps?” Tan Xin complained as she stood next to him and looked in the direction of the Sacks motorcade.</p> 
 <p>“Your weight is too easy to distinguish.” Bai Xiaofei chuckled as he received the package Tan Xin handed over. Fiddling with it, he complained, “That’s it? You weren’t lazy, were you?”</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin snorted. “Don’t worry, this can put down a group of elephants. It took me a long time to make, and according to your request, the effect only lasts thirty minutes.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei nodded with satisfaction.</p> 
 <p>“Wake everyone up and get ready,” he said and crushed the little package between his fingers. Plumes of smoke then followed the breeze and drifted towards the motorcade.</p> 
 <p>The tired Sacks soldiers didn’t notice the smoke at all. One by one, they fell and then a steady stream of snores rang out. What Bai Xiaofei asked Tan Xin to make was indeed sleep smoke…</p> 
 <p>After waking up, the Fickle soldiers excitedly reported to Bai Xiaofei. Under his command, they snuck toward the enemy party using the cover of the night.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei put all the food into his storage ring, making room for the Fickle soldiers. In less than five minutes, more than a hundred people successfully hid themselves in the last dozen wheat carts.</p> 
 <p>“Brother! Wake up! “</p> 
 <p>Before long, the next patrol shift came along and shook their friends awake.</p> 
 <p>“Who is it?!”</p> 
 <p>The patrol, who had been sleeping next to the carts, sprang up with their weapons. Upon seeing that it was their own people, they heaved a sigh of relief.</p> 
 <p>“Look at you. If we were really Moonlight people, your heads would have been removed long ago. Go back to rest. It’s our turn.” The captain of the next shift teased his old friend, and the latter smiled sheepishly.</p> 
 <p>“My brothers are just too tired. I’ll buy you a drink sometime, just don’t report us, old chap.”</p> 
 <p>The two captains laughed and the shift change was completed.</p> 
 <p>Everything went smoothly, and the Fickle soldiers hiding among the food relaxed. Next, they only needed to wait!</p> 
 <p>The next morning when the sky was bright, the commander of the motorcade checked the situation, and after confirming that everything was normal, he ordered the motorcade to resume on the road to Colorful Star Fortress.</p> 
 <p>The laborers had worked hard for a night and were able to repair the road just in time. Coupled with the fact that there was no ambush afterward made the commander relieved. Although he wasn’t able to vent his anger from yesterday, his mission would be perfectly completed as long as the food arrived safely.</p> 
 <p>After half a day, the motorcade finally arrived at its destination. Without any surprise, they were stopped at the gate to be checked without any exception.</p> 
 <p>However, since the commander was known, the inspection was only a routine check of several carts at the front before they were let past.</p> 
 <p>As the motorcade entered the fortress, the soldiers escorting it also withdrew, leaving only a logistics officer in charge of receiving the food to lead it to the granary.</p> 
 <p>In a cart, Bai Xiaofei carefully listened carefully to the surrounding sounds, and when they arrived near the granary, he moved.</p> 
 <p>A fine needle accurately stabbed the horse’s butt, and the poor creature instantly went crazy. As it collided with everything around, the commotion became a signal for the carts behind. The Fickle soldiers hiding in them did the same thing and turned the motorcade into a total mess!</p> 
 <p>In the face of the rampaging horses, the coachmen used every trick they knew to calm the horses down. However, after they succeeded, the wheat was already all over the ground.</p> 
 <p>What no one noticed was that in the chaos, a group of people had quietly snuck out…</p>
