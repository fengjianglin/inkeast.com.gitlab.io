 <p>Chapter 594: Parting</p> 
 <p>Driven by Lei Shan, the effect of the whole conference far exceeded Bai Xiaofei’s imagination. He only aimed to start rebuilding confidence in everyone, but Lei Shan completely united Starnet into an unbreakable bond!</p> 
 <p>After the awards, Lei Shan announced the remaining two matters, namely the graduation and the establishment of a new training course. Although preparations for their implementation had been made, the announcement still caused an uproar among the students. However, Lei Shan didn’t give them time to be shocked because what they now lacked the most was time!</p> 
 <p>The awards conference was on the first day, so the latest that the graduates had to leave would be early the next day as that same afternoon was when the training course would be formally established. The current state of Starnet was intense, they simply had no time to rest.</p> 
 <p>This departure would be most hurtful to Bai Xiaofei until now. Some close to him would be leaving his side for a long time…</p> 
 <p>Chu Liuyun did not leave Bai Xiaofei’s room that night. They lay in bed embracing each other, recounting what had happened between them, from meeting to getting to know each other, then to becoming an item. Their talk started from laughter and ended with tears, from full of energy to falling asleep…</p> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei woke up, Chu Liuyun brought him breakfast for the last time. Under her gaze, he finished the porridge bowl spoon by spoon until there wasn’t a grain left.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go, they are all waiting.” Reaching out her hand towards Bai Xiaofei, Chu Liuyun wore the same smile as when they first met. Entranced, Bai Xiaofei felt that he had returned to the day when he had first set foot into the Demon of Illusions.</p> 
 <p>“Mhm…” Gently, he took her hand. The soft touch sent an electric current through his fingertips.</p> 
 <p>Pulling Bai Xiaofei along, Chu Liuyun skipped like a little girl along the way and reminisced about the scenery around with him. The place where Yun Sheng had been teased, the place where Leng Liushuang had been stung by bees, the place where she had peeked at Bai Xiaofei…</p> 
 <p>She easily recalled every bit of memory perfectly that was stored in her head as they walked all the way to the entrance of the academy. At that time, the area was already full of people.</p> 
 <p>The large send-off team formed by Hu Xian’er and Savage Class members was standing opposite the departees.</p> 
 <p>Yun Jingshuang graduated, and Han Qianye dropped out early for him. Yun Sheng also decided to leave with Yun Jingshuang after careful consideration. He knew what Yun Jingshuang was going to do upon returning home, and he wanted to share the responsibility with his brother.</p> 
 <p>Sima Ye and Su Yu, Bai Xiaofei’s two former rivals, were also amongst the team of waiting departees. By now, they were able to face Bai Xiaofei. The fall of the Student Union was a fair loss in skills. From the perspective of personalities, they considered Bai Xiaofei a great person to be friends with.</p> 
 <p>“After I leave, no one can compete with you on the Command Ranking, but I hope you won’t stop training and brushing up on yourself.” Sima Ye’s farewell was quite distinctive, but it was a little odd…</p> 
 <p>“Compete with me? Forget it. You leaving is just one less person that’d find me to be bullied,” said Bai Xiaofei arrogantly.</p> 
 <p>The people around were instantly nervous as the atmosphere felt like it was going to erupt. But as they were gulping, the two main characters suddenly burst out laughing at the same time.</p> 
 <p>“One day!”</p> 
 <p>“We’ll meet again on the battlefield!”</p> 
 <p>“A gentleman’s words!”</p> 
 <p>“Can’t be taken back!”</p> 
 <p>Their hands clasped together, the two men made a vow. When Sima Ye turned around to leave, everyone could clearly see the slight smile at the corner of his mouth.</p> 
 <p>“I’m not as stupid as Sima Ye. I don’t want to fight you again in my life. If you two really fight, though, remember to call me. I’ll help you handle that guy!” Su Yu came forward. He was no longer the cold and aloof man in the past but had become an approachable big brother.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had made him realize his own shortcomings, and the celebration activity sanded away his edges. The honor of a Starnet Brilliance was the fruit of his experiences. Su Yu had gone through a complete change!</p> 
 <p>“I’ll remember this. If you ever go back on your word, I will talk bad about you everywhere!” Bai Xiaofei ‘solemnly threatened’ and earned a round of laughter from all around.</p> 
 <p>“Then I’d better just take it back now.”</p> 
 <p>“Hey, don’t! It’s too late!” Bai Xiaofei grinned and gave him a bear hug. “Senior Brother, take care. I believe that you will make the Starnet name resound wherever you are!”</p> 
 <p>This was from the bottom of his heart. The Grandmaster Rank was already among the most advanced of puppet masters on the continent. With Su Yu’s talent on top of that, it was only a matter of time before he became an elite leader.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll take your word for it. I’m also looking forward to the day when you graduate!”</p> 
 <p>After bidding farewell to Su Yu, the remaining were all Bai Xiaofei’s close friends.</p> 
 <p>“I really don’t know what to say to you as a goodbye.” His emotions choked him as he looked deeply at Yun Jingshuang. His relationship with this only senior brother who had ever made him feel ‘butterflies’ couldn’t be any closer, so close that nothing needed to be said.</p> 
 <p>“Then, don’t say anything. I believe that distance won’t change anything. When we meet again, words will naturally come.” Yun Jingshuang’s face coupled with his charming voice was truly too much. Bai Xiaofei, an absolute straight man, felt like he was being bent.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it! Hurry on your way, I don’t want to see you again!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei hurriedly shook his head to shake out that image that kept whispering sweet nothings in his head, then turned to Han Qianye and Yun Sheng. “Be careful after you return. You are not dealing with just one or two people. Big Brother Yun may not be able to consider every little thing, you guys do your best to assist him.”</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, we know our brothers better than you, most of them are useless skin bags. Handling them is not a problem.” Yun Sheng waved his hand before chasing after Yun Jingshuang. The moment he turned around, his eyes reddened.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Yun Jingshuang up ahead was already in tears…</p> 
 <p>After seeing everyone off, Bai Xiaofei looked at Chu Liuyun, who had been standing behind him all the time. On her face was a familiar smile.</p> 
 <p>“You’re not going to repeat what you nagged about all night last night, are you?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei hadn’t even opened his mouth when Chu Liuyun already blocked his mouth. Helpless, he smiled gently and stroked her cheek.</p> 
 <p>“Alright then I won’t say anything, but you mustn’t forget a word I said!” Bai Xiaofei said with incomparable seriousness.</p> 
 <p>Chu Liuyun pulled his hand and pressed it on her chest, her smile deepening.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, it’s all in here. I won’t forget a word! Alright, I’m going!”</p> 
 <p>Throwing that last simple sentence, Chu Liuyun mounted the Blackscale Horse held by Mo Ka and galloped away into a black spot in a blink.</p> 
 <p>Looking at her disappearing into the horizon, Mo Ka slowly gathered around Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother Fei, I thought you’d cry…”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t reply. He even revealed a slight smile.</p> 
 <p>Cry?</p> 
 <p>All the tears seemed to have already dried last night…</p>
