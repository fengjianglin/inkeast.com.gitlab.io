 <p>Chapter 1035: Assemble!</p> 
 <p>“The lockdown is now underway,” Moshen bitterly reported to Bai Xiaofei after a day of supervising the puppet masters. He had thought he would have the opportunity to eat one or two, but those puppet masters had been surprisingly honest.</p> 
 <p>“Before the ten days are up, we cannot let any news get out. It’s not the time yet,” said Bai Xiaofei</p> 
 <p>Moshen shot him a curious look. “How do you cultivate your brain? I wouldn’t be surprised if you are some hundred-year-old monster.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei inhaled deeply. “Because there is a group of old scoundrels who can’t take care of children who taught me these things every day. If there is a chance, you will meet them.” He was full of gratitude when mentioning his parent group. Without them, there would not be the Bai Xiaofei today.</p> 
 <p>“Not interested. Anyway, are you going to just wait here?” Ever since having gotten his new body, Moshen had become much more talkative. It was not so much of curiosity and more like he was learning from Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“The most important thing now is to find Senior Sister Qianye, so for now, we can start preparing the publicity of Yi Shuang City, and spread the news as soon as my people from Illusion Demon arrive.”</p> 
 <p>Despite his fury toward Cloudveil, Bai Xiaofei maintained a clear head, which put Nie Qing’s anxious heart at ease. She had only decided to follow him for fear that he would be impulsive.</p> 
 <p>“What is this Illusion Demon you keep mentioning? Is it very strong? You are going to fight against an entire empire this time. No matter how strong you are, that’s just an impossible feat alone,” Moshen voiced the biggest problem at the moment, which had been the most discussed topic among the puppet masters in the city.</p> 
 <p>Everyone was wondering what Bai Xiaofei would do next to expand his force.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know exactly how strong my Illusion Demon is now, but I believe it’s not half bad.” At the mention of his merchant group, Bai Xiaofei was a little ashamed. He only provided an idea and money, then left it all to everyone, so he didn’t know how much it had developed. “However, I don’t intend to rely entirely on Illusion Demon. No matter how much force I can mobilize, it’s only an outsider to Cloudveil. In the end, I have to rely on this empire’s own power, and build an army of justice!”</p> 
 <p>For the first time, Bai Xiaofei revealed his big picture to everyone. They all thought that he had been acting out of an impulse, only he knew that he had never been so serious – because only success was allowed this time!</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>Six days passed under Bai Xiaofei’s intensive preparations, during which Yi Shuang City had become livelier day by day.</p> 
 <p>Large flying commercial ships arrived one after another, each with a ‘Fei’ flag on them!</p> 
 <p>Seeing these commercial ships, the puppet masters in Yi Shuang City completely dropped any wrong ideas. They knew they couldn’t afford to betray those who could mobilize this kind of power.</p> 
 <p>“Xiaofei, we won’t say anything unnecessary. What you are looking at is all of our Illusion Demon’s assets. I dare not say we can beat Cloudveil, but if they want to touch us, this is enough to make them reconsider their decision.”</p> 
 <p>Once again standing in front of Bai Xiaofei, Feng Wuhen and Lu Lingyun had become much more experienced. Seeing them made Bai Xiaofei feel like this was a family reunion.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Feng, Brother Lu, please receive my most sincere gratitude!”</p> 
 <p>In front of a room full of people, Bai Xiaofei bowed deeply to the two men with gratitude and guilt. At the same time, he was also telling everyone that their positions in his heart and Illusion Demon could not be shaken!</p> 
 <p>“Hahaha! Old Lu, I won! What did I say? This brat would definitely do this! That wine is mine!” Feng Wuhen burst out laughing in joy, while Lu Lingyun looked as if he had just eaten a fly.</p> 
 <p>“You brat, leaving all the work to us for several years, and now you made me lose my bet as soon as we meet!” Lu Lingyun gritted his teeth.</p> 
 <p>The two’s attitude was clear – they accepted Bai Xiaofei’s gratitude.</p> 
 <p>They knew that Bai Xiaofei would be bothered by guilt if they didn’t. Moreover, only through this would Bai Xiaofei be able to show his identity to the people in the Illusion Demon management who he had never met.</p> 
 <p>“Then you two have to be prepared. I may have to leave the work to you indefinitely.” Bai Xiaofei laughed. He had expected a get-together with his friends, but he hadn’t thought it would be so soon.</p> 
 <p>Everyone had changed. They had all matured!</p> 
 <p>In the room were almost all of the people that he had pulled into Illusion Demon – </p> 
 <p>Savage Class’s Fang Ye, Wang Hang, Xu Chen, Wu Chi, Zhu Nuo, Qi Wei, Ming One, Ming Two, and Chen Hui. Except for Shi Kui and Mo Ka who had gone to chase their dreams, and Duan Yiyi who had returned to her hometown, and Lin Li who had gone back to the Love Burying Mountain, the rest were present.</p> 
 <p>There was Chu Tianyi who Bai Xiaofei had once beaten up and the ‘A’ group who he had met in the Holy Snow Mountain. There was also the husband and wife pair, Xia and Luo, his apprentice Wang Chuan, and the Shaman King trio who he had brought back from the Windless Zone.</p> 
 <p>There were also many Starnet high-flyers that Bai Xiaofei had ‘tricked’ into joining him when he had still been president of the Student Community.</p> 
 <p>Without knowing, Bai Xiaofei had gathered a group of reliable people whose lives had all been changed by him!</p> 
 <p>In addition to all the people of Illusion Demon, in the room was Fang Lei’s group who had returned from their tasks. Upon seeing so many people who emitted strong energy fluctuations, they all had a new understanding of Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>For a long time, Bai Xiaofei had always given them the impression that he was a lone wolf, but as it turned out, he was a wolf king with a powerful wolf pack!</p> 
 <p>The merchant ships parked outside were not empty, they were full of people as well!</p> 
 <p>They had no idea that this was only a part of the force that Bai Xiaofei could mobilize as many weren’t convenient to be summoned this time. And in Bai Xiaofei’s view, these people were already enough, and had even exceeded his expectations!</p> 
 <p>“Since everyone is here, let’s have a simple introduction!” Bai Xiaofei said.</p> 
 <p>Everyone was waiting for these words.</p>
