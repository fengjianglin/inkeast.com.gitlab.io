 <p><span style>After this meal, half of the Starnet Stones Bai Xiaofei had plundered in these past two days had instantly vanished, and if it wasn’t for Mo Ka and the others having reaped large gains yesterday, Bai Xiaofei might have had to stay back in the 100 Flavor House to wash the dishes….</span></p>
 <p><span style>After everyone ate and drank their fill, they returned to the classroom. All along the way, the sounds of discussions had never ceased, and there was only one center of discussion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What to do about the battle!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, what caused Bai Xiaofei to be extremely moved was that even though they were going against seniors, not a single person from the 16 members of the class backed out, and all 16 of them fighting together had already become a common view!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, all of you sit down. Class is about to start.” Xue Ying was rather gratified by the reactions of everyone, and what was difficult to come by was that Xue Ying’s expression had truly eased up slightly before class started.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone instantly settled down as they looked silently at Xue Ying who was about to speak. As far as they were concerned, the outcome of this battle was mainly dependent on three people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first was Bai Xiaofei himself. Not only because he was the cause of the matter but even more because of his endless tricks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The second was Lin Li, a genius of the Energy Stream that was at the Master Rank! If Bai Xiaofei played the role of intelligence, then Lin Li played the role of force. Not to mention new students, even second year seniors might not be a match for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The last was Xue Ying! A single month! If it was before, then perhaps they would be unable to do anything within this month of time. But, everyone firmly believed a single thing, and it was that with Xue Ying present, a tremendous change might occur within them in this month of time!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, this was exactly what Xue Ying wanted to speak of right now!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know what sort of people that Qin Lingyan can find to take the other four places. But, if we think of the worst possible situation, then the person’s strength would at most be at the Grandmaster Rank just like me.” Everyone couldn’t help but gasp when they heard Xue Ying.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Grandmaster Rank! If it’s really a senior at the Grandmaster Rank, then would we have any chance of winning?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“But, all of you don’t have to worry. According to my knowledge, there’s absolutely less than five people in the entire academy that have broken through to the 3</span><span style>rd</span><span style> stage of the Master Rank. Moreover, all of them are existences that like to keep to themselves. No matter how formidable Qin Lingyan is, she’s only a first year student, and the possibility of her knowing them isn’t great.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Coupled with the fact that if this was considered from the angle of an ordinary person, five people at the 1</span><span style>st</span><span style> to 3</span><span style>rd</span><span style> stage of the Master Rank would already be sufficient to deal with all of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Master Rank was the divide between low level puppet masters and high level puppet masters, and only by striding into this rank would one be truly considered to have opened the entrance to the world of puppet masters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was from the Master Rank that puppet masters of the same rank were divided into stages, whereas, the Master Rank was divided into three stages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first stage was internal sight and being able to view the flow of Origin Energy within the body was the standard for advancing into the Master Rank. Bai Xiaofei has already taken this step, and he only lacked the accumulation of Origin Energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The second stage was Origin Energy control. On the foundation of being capable of internal sight, someone at the 2</span><span style>nd</span><span style> stage of the Master Rank was capable of casually controlling the speed the Origin Energy within his body flowed, thereby controlling the strength of his attacks, so the puppet master didn’t have to rely on his cultivation technique to automatically move his Origin Energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The third stage was Absolute Control. On the foundation of being able to control the Origin Energy, the puppet master would be able to control his Origin Energy a step further. Moreover, the puppet master would be able to discharge Origin Energy through the seven Origin Energy Convergence Points in the body. After a puppet master attained this stage, the utilization of Origin Energy had truly become varied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to what Xue Ying said, people at these three stages would be the main constitution of the enemies that they would face a month from now!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it’s enemies at the Master Rank, all of you still have the chance to fight!” At the same time that she spoke, and air of arrogance and confidence appeared on Xue Ying’s face, causing even the members of the class to become excited along with her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fighting Master Rank experts as new students!</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could they not be excited by this?! But, they were bewildered after their excitement because they knew their ability clearly. </span><i><span style>So exactly what does she want to do that gave her such confidence?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>For a time, the gazes of everyone stared fixedly at Xue Ying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Originally, the plan for your training was spread out. But, now it would seem like I can only compress it. I know that it’ll be extremely hard, but this is the only way out for all of you!” As soon as she finished speaking, everyone was stunned on their seats.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Compress the training plan? Could it be that the training plan from before hadn’t been compressed?!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It can be even harder?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, most people felt regret, but they’d already jumped in the hole, and it was impossible for them to jump out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Sister Xue, what should we do?” Fang Ye asked with a light voice, and he just happened to hit the bomb that Xue Ying had prepared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I would look for you even if you didn’t ask me.” As a faint smile that contained deep meaning appeared on her face, Xue Ying rubbed her hands together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How much is your allowance every month?” Everyone revealed astounded expressions as soon as she finished speaking, and Fang Ye was even dumbstruck for a long time before he caught his breath. Within his preparations, there weren’t any preparations to deal with such a direct question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“10,000 Amethyst Coins.” Fang Ye slowly spat out a few words, and besides Wang Heng, everyone else gasped along with these words.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sure enough, the life of the rich isn’t something the poor can imagine….</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you ask for more?” Xue Ying’s subsequent question almost caused everyone in the class to fall to the ground. </span><i><span style>Oh my god, what does she want to do? Smash Qin Lingyan and the others to death with money?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>But, Fang Ye was rather serious. As far as he was concerned, he was only a Ranged Stream puppet master at the Apprentice Rank, and he was really not of much use. However, he wouldn’t act perfunctorily when dealing with money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have savings of 500,000 Amethyst Coins. If I tell my father that I have to pay fees, then he ought to be able to give me a little bit more. But, he told me before I came here that he wants to see my progress before he would.” Fang Ye had already started thinking about how to trick his father but he never imagined that Xue Ying was even more direct.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just tell him you want to bribe me and get as much as you can. I guarantee that you’ll at least be at the peak of the Mastery Rank after this month of time!” Everyone was astonished as soon as these words were spoken, and even Fang Ye was almost unable to recover from his shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Err, I’ll try my best….” Fang Ye was shocked by Xue Ying to the point he was slightly flurried, and he muttered out a few words. But, Xue Ying’s promise of allowing him to attain the peak of the Mastery Rank within a month had deeply attracted him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t becoming strong exactly one of the reasons he’d come here for!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai Xiaofei, how many Starnet Stones are left from those that you plundered? They’re confiscated right now!” After she dealt with Fang Ye, Xue Ying turned to look at Bai Xiaofei. But, unlike the pleasant expression she had when dealing with Fang Ye, Xue Ying used an ordering tone when dealing with Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to being deterred by Xue Ying’s might, Bai Xiaofei handed over his jade token extremely unwillingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All three of you as well!” Mo Ka and the others who originally thought they’d escaped calamity revealed bitter expressions in unison, and then they handed over their jade tokens like Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I knew earlier, I wouldn’t have gone to the 100 Flavor House to eat, it’s only a little over 1,000 stones.” Xue Ying let out a long sigh as a trace of a sense of loss appeared on her face, whereas, the members of the class that heard what she said were stunned in unison.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A little over 1,000 Starnet Stones?!!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>For a time, everyone moved their gazes onto Bai Xiaofei’s group of four, and their gazes seemed to be asking ‘What have the four of you done during these past few days?!’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It still isn’t enough. Looks like I can only think of something else.” Their previous surprise hadn’t passed when Xue Ying’s words pulled back the attention of everyone.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It still isn’t enough?!!!</span></i></p>
