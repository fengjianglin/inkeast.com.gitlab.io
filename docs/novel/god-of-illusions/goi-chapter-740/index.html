 <p>Chapter 740: Promise!</p> 
 <p>Escaping the girl’s dormitory like there was a ghost chasing them, both Qin Lingyan and Bai Xiaofei heaved a long sigh of relief.</p> 
 <p>However, the same action resulted in completely different reactions. Bai Xiaofei found Qin Lingyan’s hectic manner quite appealing while Qin Lingyan frowned at his.</p> 
 <p>“You’re so scared of being seen with me?!” Her face was dark as she said this.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was stupefied. <em>Who am I? Where am I?!</em></p> 
 <p>“I’m scared that it will affect you. There are already a bunch of rumors about me, one more wouldn’t hurt me.” Despite his shock, Bai Xiaofei’s reply was more than just quick.</p> 
 <p>He was also gambling. He bet that Qin Lingyan had become accustomed to the fact that there were many girls around him.</p> 
 <p>“So you still know what you are!” Qin Lingyan snorted.</p> 
 <p>However, the topic safely passed. Bai Xiaofei somehow won the gamble! Seeing her walk away, he wisely caught up. Following her lead, the two left the academy.</p> 
 <p>Ever since the Ling Tianxia incident, the Infinite Mountain Range had quieted down. For both Starnet students and outsiders, it was currently near impossible to come across a decent magical beast there.</p> 
 <p>To put it simply, the magical beasts had been beaten scared. A furious Thunder Emperor was still fresh in their memory!</p> 
 <p>“Remember this place?” Qin Lingyan suddenly stopped and turned to look at Bai Xiaofei with a smile. Having left Starnet, she also selectively forgot those people who made her afraid to approach him.</p> 
 <p>At least, at this moment, Bai Xiaofei only belonged to her…</p> 
 <p>“Of course, Senior Sister, you almost gave me a beating here…” As memories surged from the depths of his mind, Bai Xiaofei felt warm in his heart.</p> 
 <p>Back then, he had used Qin Lingyan’s name to cause trouble everywhere, resulting in the Savage Class and Qin Lingyan’s helpers battling at this place. After that, there was little contact between them unless there was serious business that required it. However, it was also on that day that the name Bai Xiaofei was completely engraved into her mind.</p> 
 <p>“Can you not call me ‘senior sister’? Did you forget what you promised me?” said Qin Lingyan with an upset expression that made Bai Xiaofei’s heart ache.</p> 
 <p><em>To have affinity but no fate, ah…</em></p> 
 <p>“Lingyan…” Bai Xiaofei slowly uttered. </p> 
 <p>The next second, Qin Lingyan plunged into his arms and tears uncontrollably streamed down her face.</p> 
 <p>“Why?! I was the first person to know you! How could they all get ahead of me?! Is it because I wasn’t being obvious enough?!”</p> 
 <p>As her pent-up emotions flooded out, Bai Xiaofei felt like a boat in the stormy waves it created. His normally quick wits couldn’t keep up, and the only thing he could think of was to hold her and gently pat her back.</p> 
 <p>Sometimes, silence was the best answer. After all, he did not have an answer…</p> 
 <p>Say he was too young and wild back then? But even if he could start all over again, would the result be different? Bai Xiaofei did not dare guarantee that he would not love those he now loved, and neither could Qin Lingyan be certain.</p> 
 <p>After a while, Qin Lingyan, perhaps tired from crying for so long, finally calmed down. The two had sat down, but she was still leaning on his chest.</p> 
 <p>It had gotten dark, but fortunately, it was a beautiful night.</p> 
 <p>“Will you remain in Starnet next year?” Qin Lingyan jumped to a new topic, a topic concerning their future. Having lost the first time, she wanted to fight for the next chance!</p> 
 <p>“What about you? If you had the option to stay in Starnet this year, would you choose it?” Bai Xiaofei replied with the same question. Although he didn’t answer her directly, his meaning was clear.</p> 
 <p>Qin Lingyan asked when Bai Xiaofei could go find her, and he asked if she could stay…</p> 
 <p>“Remember Ancient Yue? In fact, I could have chosen to stay, but after that event, I lost that choice.” Qin Lingyan’s voice sank as if she was recalling something sad.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was struck with realization. Back in Ancient Yue when he had been so seriously injured that his life was in danger, Qin Lingyan had gone to Violethorn in order to find a way to save him, but when she returned, he had been saved by Nie Qing.</p> 
 <p>Although he didn’t know what had happened in Violethorn, Bai Ye had implied that she must have paid a high price. Now it seemed that the price was her freedom…</p> 
 <p>“I will go to Violethorn!” declared Bai Xiaofei as his eyes grew firm.</p> 
 <p>Qin Lingyan raised her head and looked at him to see he was gazing intently at her. She felt warm in her heart. If he had chosen to apologize, her palm would have swung at his face…</p> 
 <p>“I will wait for you! Moreover, I promise that I will be ready to accept everything at that time!” Qin Lingyan said resolutely. She had come to accept her fate and accepted everything about him. She just needed a little more time.</p> 
 <p>“This is for you.” Bai Xiaofei suddenly remembered something and a Fei token appeared in his palm.</p> 
 <p>“What is this?” A confused Qin Lingyan took the token and felt the energy fluctuations within it.</p> 
 <p>“I’ve established a merchant group. Although Illusion Demon is still in its infancy, I believe that one day it will be known throughout the continent. This token is a representative of identity. Hold it, and you are among the top-ranked personnel of Illusion Demon.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei laughed shyly. Although it sounded far-fetched, Qin Lingyan was very willing to believe it!</p> 
 <p>“Good, I await such a day. But before that, if your small merchant group needs any help, you can always send your people to me. I still have a certain influence in Violethorn.” Qin Lingyan covered her lips and snickered. Her gaze on him was never this soft.</p> 
 <p>Looking at Qin Lingyan in his arms, Bai Xiaofei instinctively swallowed.</p> 
 <p>Under the moonlight, their faces slowly approached until their lips met…</p>
