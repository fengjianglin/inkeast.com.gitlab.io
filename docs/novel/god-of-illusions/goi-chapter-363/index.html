 <p>Chapter 363: Domineering Hu Xian’er!</p> 
 <p>After leaving the Gods Amongst Men, Bai Xiaofei advanced straight to the headquarters of the Student Union, a large piece of fengshui treasure land in the Sword of Assault.</p> 
 <p>In the academy, departments would think of many methods to increase their popularity. Just like the Illusionary Sandboard of the Gods Amongst Men, the Student Union was also a great place to garner popularity.</p> 
 <p>Only just that the situation in the Student Union was currently a bit precarious.</p> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei and Hu Xian’er just stepped into the entrance of the Sword of Assault, Luo Tong, who was hurriedly returning from his trip to find Sima Ye, passed them with a tense expression. As he was passing them, he suddenly came to a screeching halt. Looking back at Bai Xiaofei, the tension on his face instantly turned into horror.</p> 
 <p>“Bai Xiaofei?!”</p> 
 <p>The last person Luo Tong wanted to see now was definitely Bai Xiaofei! Just now, he also watched the match between Bai Xiaofei and Sima Ye. Although he only saw half of it, it did not stop him from gaining a new understanding of Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Sima Ye’s defeat was definitely a terrible shock for the Student Union. Moreover, Sima Ye had even told him something he would never dare to believe even in his death – Sima Ye wanted to quit the Student Union, and the cause of it was Bai Xiaofei!</p> 
 <p>What they didn’t expect was that before they challenged Bai Xiaofei, he had already made his way here! Their worry had come over to find them in the end!</p> 
 <p>“Good day, Senior, I wonder if you know where Senior Su Yu is right now? I’m looking for him for something,” asked Bai Xiaofei with words that once again shook Luo Tong.</p> 
 <p><em>What does he want with Big Brother Yu?! Did he come to cause trouble?!</em></p> 
 <p>“What are you going to do?!” Luo Tong was on full alert. If Bai Xiaofei said anything shocking at that point, he would definitely attack without hesitation!</p> 
 <p>“I told Senior Su Yu that I would see him again. Today I happen to be free, so I came. Senior, do you know Senior Su Yu?” Bai Xiaofei’s tone was so friendly that Luo Tong narrowly escaped disaster. If he really made a move against Bai Xiaofei, he would be lying on the ground. Hu Xian’er hadn’t followed Bai Xiaofei here to let him be a pushover.</p> 
 <p>However, after hearing what Bai Xiaofei said, Luo Tong was still inwardly irritated.</p> 
 <p><em>Your mother! You don’t know me, a grand vice president of the Student Union? What have you been doing in Starnet?!</em></p> 
 <p>Fortunately, Luo Tong didn’t voice his thoughts, or else he might just get an answer that would trigger him.</p> 
 <p>His meaningless position of vice president was something Bai Xiaofei never took seriously. Not to mention him, he hadn’t even known who Sima Ye was before the guy sought him out. To Bai Xiaofei, they were all insignificant people.</p> 
 <p>“You have an appointment with Big Brother Yu? Why didn’t I hear him mention anything?” Luo Tong asked suspiciously, and Bai Xiaofei smiled in response.</p> 
 <p>“It was verbal, not formal. It’s just a casual meeting. Maybe he has forgotten it, but I’m sure he’s very interested in meeting me.”</p> 
 <p>Staring at Bai Xiaofei for half a day, at last, Luo Tong accepted Bai Xiaofei’s explanation.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go. I’ll take you there, but I advise you not to mess with him. He is in a bad mood now.”</p> 
 <p>Luo Tong kindly reminded him, but Bai Xiaofei didn’t respond to this. He estimated that the guy’s mood was not just bad, but on the verge of exploding.</p> 
 <p>Following Luo Tong, Bai Xiaofei and Hu Xian’er soon arrived at the office of the Student Union. Here, Su Yu and another vice president were anxiously waiting for Luo Tong’s report. When there was a knock on the door, their eyes instantly lit up.</p> 
 <p>“Come in,” Su Yu slowly said after fixing his expression.</p> 
 <p>The moment the door opened, they were delighted upon seeing Luo Tong at first, but when they saw that it was not Sima Ye but Bai Xiaofei who came in behind him, Su Yu’s face sank instantly.</p> 
 <p>“Why is it you?!”</p> 
 <p>Su Yu’s shocked tone startled Luo Tong.</p> 
 <p><em>Didn’t he say they had an appointment? What does this mean?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Shit, you tricked me, you brat!</em></p> 
 <p>Luo Tong furiously looked back at Bai Xiaofei, but the latter ignored him.</p> 
 <p>“Why can’t it be me? Senior, have you forgotten what I said before?” His face full of smiles, Bai Xiaofei didn’t treat himself like an outsider at all. He pulled over a sofa chair and sat down. “Heh, this place is awesome. I’ll decorate the office of the New Student Mutual Aid Community like this in the future.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei swayed on the sofa as what he said instantly put colors on Su Yu’s expression.</p> 
 <p>“If you’re here to look for trouble, you’ve really come to the wrong place. I have the right to attack in this place!” Su Yu’s tone was threatening and his expression icy. At the same time, the pressure of a Grandmaster Rank instantly engulfed Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, Bai Xiaofei wasn’t alone. This time, behind him, stood Hu Xian’er!</p> 
 <p>She stepped forward right away and a far stronger pressure than Su Yu’s spread, replacing his suppression. Apart from Su Yu, the other two instantly found it hard to breathe.</p> 
 <p><em>The peak of the Grandmaster Rank!!! How is this possible?! How can a freshman have the strength of a Grandmaster?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Did they come here to…</em></p> 
 <p>“Senior, I heard that if you want to climb the Combat Ranking, you have to challenge the person who holds the rank you want, right? And the people on the Combat Ranking can’t refuse such challenges?”</p> 
 <p>Su Yu hadn’t finished the guess in his heart when Bai Xiaofei confirmed it.</p> 
 <p>That was right, he was here to challenge Su Yu! Of course, the one fighting would be Hu Xian’er…</p> 
 <p>“With just you?” Spitting out three words through gritted teeth, Su Yu’s eyes were full of contempt. Master Rank was nowhere near enough to whet his appetite!</p> 
 <p>“Are you blind?” This time, it wasn’t Bai Xiaofei who replied, but Hu Xian’er, who was still suppressing Su Yu. Her words were faint yet domineering, “It’s me who is challenging you. Accept. Our time is too precious, we’re not going to waste it on you!”</p> 
 <p>After the first sentence finished, Su Yu’s anger had not subsided when the next part struck like a hammer.</p> 
 <p><em>Four years! I, Su Yu, have been in Starnet for four years!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Who dares to talk to me like that!?!?!</em></p> 
 <p>Forcing down the anger burning in his heart, Su Yu looked at Hu Xian’er with raging eyes. However, he didn’t dare to attack.</p> 
 <p>If two Grandmaster Rank puppet masters started a fight in here, the office was as good as ruined. Moreover, if he acted out of anger just from this and the news got out after being ‘processed’ by Bai Xiaofei, it would definitely deal a blow to his image.</p> 
 <p>When people stood in a certain position, there were many things to consider. Sometimes this was a good thing, but sometimes it put limits on them. Just like Su Yu now, even if he gritted his teeth so hard that they broke, his only choice would be to swallow them!</p>
