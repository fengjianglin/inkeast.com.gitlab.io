 <p>Chapter 814: Common Goal!</p> 
 <p>“He should be dead this time!“</p> 
 <p>In a sealed space on the fifth floor, a member of Tong Fei’s party was cursing angrily. In front of him was Wang Chuan, firmly nailed to the ground by nine needles nearly one meter long, each needle piercing through a fatal point!</p> 
 <p>In the past ten minutes, Wang Chuan had ‘died’ ten times, but every time his abnormal self-healing ability made him stand up again and in turn made his opponent, Xiu Lang, begin to doubt reality.</p> 
 <p>Among the top-class fighters of the All-Around Merchant Group, Xiu Lang was the strongest in one-on-one fights, and the nine needles were the weapons that let him dominate the All-Around Merchant Group – a peak-grade Gold puppet, Life Eraser!</p> 
 <p>“Master is still waiting for me, how can I die here? Trash, take a good look at my puppet!” Wang Chuan pulled his body little by little out of the needles. As his blood flowed down along the needles, the visual impact painted his every word extremely gloomy.</p> 
 <p>What could be more terrifying than watching a man whose whole body had been fatally pierced standing up in front of you? At that moment, Xiu Lang’s mentality collapsed!</p> 
 <p>“Kill, Dark Descent!” After Wang Chuan completely extracted himself from the needles, his injury recovered at a speed visible to the naked eye. At the same time, his body glowed indicating a puppet being activated, and a strange fluctuation spread.</p> 
 <p>“How… how is this possible?!” Gawking as his opponent turned into a demon with a pair of meaty wings and two blood-red horns, Xiu Lang was in disbelief.</p> 
 <p><em>A Dark Descent King?! How can this creature become a Transformation Stream puppet?! Don’t they all self-detonate at near death?!</em></p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, no one would provide Xiu Lang an explanation. With a slight flap of Wang Chuang’s wings, he instantly appeared right before Xiu Lang.</p> 
 <p>However, Xiu Lang was not to be underestimated. With just a thought, the nine needles instantly appeared in front of him. Three of them shot at Wang Chuan and the rest formed a barrier.</p> 
 <p>“Die!!!” Ignoring the needles shooting at him, Wang Chuan slapped the needle barrier away and kept going as energy surged in his palm, letting him shatter the opponent’s energy armor and smash his head to bits.</p> 
 <p>Even until his death, Xiu Lang had no idea what happened. Only two would know, one was Wang Chuan himself, and the other was Bai Xiaofei who trained him.</p> 
 <p>Wang Chuan’s Immortal Physique made him the best choice for Devouring the Heaven and Earth. Although it was different from Bai Xiaofei’s condition, the Immortal Physique could help Wang Chuan completely support the Endless State, and the Endless State even further improved his recovery ability.</p> 
 <p>Wang Chuan’s puppet was bought by Bai Xiaofei during his rare free time. No one knew how Bai Xiaofei was able to find a Dark Descent King or what method he had used to make it into a Transformation Stream magical beast soul. However, one thing could not be more obvious, Wang Chuan had become a genuine ‘monster’ in strength!</p> 
 <p>“Master, please wait, Wang Chuan is coming!” Like Hu Xian’er, Wang Chuan couldn’t come up with another method. He just wanted to find Bai Xiaofei immediately…</p> 
 <p>“I said, get out of my way!”</p> 
 <p>In another sealed space, Tan Xin was like a completely different person. Her originally harmless-looking face was filled with murderous intent as she tore her opponent, a team captain of Devil Forest, into pieces!</p> 
 <p>And it was the thirty-ninth person to die in such a fashion in her hands!</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin, in other words, had been insta-killing her opponents non-stop! She killed everyone she saw in order to find Bai Xiaofei as soon as possible!</p> 
 <p>Acting the same as Tan Xin were Wang Hang and Yu Linfeng.</p> 
 <p>As the commander of the Windlove Army, there was no exaggeration at all about Yu Linfeng’s nine-aperture Exquisite Rank. The reason why his existence had been kept low-profile was because he was scared of Tan Xin! In front of her, he did not even dare to be too active…</p> 
 <p>After all, if it weren’t for the fact that Tan Xin had lacked people at her disposal, Yu Linfeng might have lost his life the day he first met her.</p> 
 <p>Lastly was Wang Hang, who achieved the record of one-hit kills with his ghostly movement. Previously, he was already an outstanding Assassin Stream puppet master, not to mention now that he had gained the help of the Ghosting. Although they were still getting familiar with each other, their cooperation had become more and more efficient…</p> 
 <p>“Finished.”</p> 
 <p>In the sealed space containing Hu Xian’er and Ji Xian, Ji Xian had collapsed to the ground, his body shredded and his vitality slowly flowing away.</p> 
 <p>However, Hu Xian’er was not much better off forcibly using Divine Beast Transformation. Although she managed to stop right before her body collapsed, it had still caused a great burden on her. It was absolutely impossible to regain the ability to fight in a short time.</p> 
 <p>“I… will be… waiting… for… you lot… below…” Ji Xian struggled to squeeze out his last words with a sneer. Unfortunately, Hu Xian’er did not notice at all…</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Fang Ye’s group on the surface had arrived at their predetermined position. With the obvious marks left by Sikong Ming’s group, it was not difficult to find the place.</p> 
 <p>When they got there, they collectively froze.</p> 
 <p>Indeed, the people who were keeping guard there belonged to Shadow Death, just like Bai Xiaofei had predicted. However, from the number, it was as if they had sent out their entire force! Circles upon circles of assassins tightly surrounded Mister Mirror, and there was even a magic formation at the center!</p> 
 <p>The moment Fang Ye’s group was noticed, the assassins immediately turned around with a feverish murderous look in their eyes!</p> 
 <p>“It’s gonna be a tough battle. Get ready!” Fang Ye said and reached out his hand. The inheritance gun puppet Into Oblivion appeared. “Go as quickly as possible!”</p> 
 <p>Upon Fang Ye’s command, the quiet Lin Li charged out. She, who Bai Xiaofei refused to bring underground with him, had accumulated a great deal of irritation and was on the verge of exploding. Now that she saw the members of Shadow Death, it detonated!</p> 
 <p>Lin Li’s Divine Phoenix Feather Dress glittered beautifully as she entered the crowd of assassins. The terrifying elemental fluctuation she emitted turned her into the focus of the area, a deadly one!</p> 
 <p>While Lin Li attracted the first wave of aggro, the rest quickly joined the battlefield. Unlike Lin Li’s display of individual power, they skillfully cooperated.</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t think you really came! Then I won’t be polite!” Mister Mirror looked at the newcomers with a faint smile. The next second, the scope of his sealed spaces suddenly expanded!</p>
