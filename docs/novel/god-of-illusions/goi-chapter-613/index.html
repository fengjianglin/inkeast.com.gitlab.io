 <p>Chapter 613: A’Tao!</p> 
 <p>The banquet ended with some happy and some sad. An Bang Ting offered to let Bai Xiaofei stay in the palace, but he refused using the reason that he wasn’t used to living in such a place with a weird atmosphere. It sounded far-fetched, but An Bang Ting could only comply.</p> 
 <p>However, even Bai Xiaofei himself didn’t know exactly why he didn’t want to live in the palace. He just had a feeling that he should stay outside.</p> 
 <p>Per Leng Liuli’s proposal, Bai Xiaofei asked An Bang Ting for a pot of his treasured Zen Wine before leaving.</p> 
 <p>After all, Cang Lan’s title was Wine God. Good wine was a must to qualify for any communication with him. According to Leng Liuli, one of his favorite things to do was tasting different specialties, and the Zen Wine was a big specialty of Tranquil.</p> 
 <p>“Is there something on your mind?” Leng Liuli softly asked Bai Xiaofei after they exited the banquet hall. Leng Liushuang and Leng Liuying were also concerned. They didn’t do anything at the party and simply let Bai Xiaofei handle it all.</p> 
 <p>Obviously, he had been thinking about something.</p> 
 <p>“Nothing, actually. It just feels a bit strange. Although his reason seems sufficient, I always have this feeling that An Bang Ting is deliberately making a big fuss out of this small problem.” Bai Xiaofei frowned and sighed softly, then said with a wry smile, “Maybe I’m worrying too much. After the incident with Ling Tianxia, I may be a little too sensitive.”</p> 
 <p>“As you’ve said, it’ll all work out in the end. Even if there is a problem, it’ll be fine as long as we are careful. No one here can detain us.” Leng Liuli held Bai Xiaofei’s hand, her eyes gentle.</p> 
 <p>“Liuli is right. No matter what, you still have us,” spoke Leng Liushuang meekly. Bai Xiaofei felt as if his whole body was melting.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t want to sleep by myself tonight, can you guys…”</p> 
 <p>“In your dreams!”</p> 
 <p>Before Bai Xiaofei could finish his words, Leng Liuying pounced and flicked his forehead, then pulled Leng Liuli and Leng Liushuang away from him.</p> 
 <p>“We can’t pamper this perv, or he’ll push his luck!” Taking off her veil to pull a silly face at Bai Xiaofei, Leng Liuying then took her two sisters and ran out.</p> 
 <p>Thinking to himself that he shouldn’t have brought Leng Liuying on this trip, Bai Xiaofei hurriedly tried to catch up. Although the triplets were already Master Rank, they were still on someone else’s turf after all. Bai Xiaofei was still a little worried.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t hit!”</p> 
 <p>“We know our wrongs! We will never come again!”</p> 
 <p>“You scum, I’ll risk my life with you!”</p> 
 <p>“Let my daughter go, or I won’t go back even if I die!”</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>Chasing after the triplets, Bai Xiaofei hadn’t even seen them when a ruckus of whining and swearing already reached his ears. He looked over in that direction to see a group of royal guards beating dozens of commoners at the city entrance.</p> 
 <p>Several men had fallen in a pool of blood, but the royal guards still showed no intention of stopping at all. The triplets looked at Bai Xiaofei, their eyes full of pity as they couldn’t bear to see this.</p> 
 <p>In fact, even if it weren’t for the triplets, Bai Xiaofei wouldn’t stand and watch either. Meddling in others’ business was a hobby of his!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei abruptly charged forth and arrived behind two guards. Grabbing one with each hand, he flung them out. Then, like a rampaging wolf in a flock of sheep, each punch knocked out a guard. In less than a dozen breaths, the royal guards became rolling worms on the ground.</p> 
 <p>“You… who are you?! How dare you attack the Royal Guards in the Imperial City!!” shouted a man who looked to be a small captain in a trembling voice as he covered his smashed nose. The title ‘royal guard’ had become his last spiritual support.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, it was worthless to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“If you don’t want to die, scram very far from me. And you’re welcome to find me if you want to change jobs, but remember to bring more people next time!” Bai Xiaofei said coldly while taking a step towards the small captain.</p> 
 <p>Scared witless, the small captain stumbled back. The rest of the royal guards also quickly crawled back inside.</p> 
 <p>After driving away the guards, Bai Xiaofei looked at the terrified commoners with mixed feelings. In the face of absolute power, how powerless these people were…</p> 
 <p>“It’s okay, everyone get up.” Gritting his teeth, Bai Xiaofei tried to suppress his anger and stretched out his hand to help the nearest little boy.</p> 
 <p>The Leng sisters also ran over and supported the wounded. They fed those whose injuries were serious with vitality-type pills.</p> 
 <p>The group of commoners looked at each other, then suddenly knelt down to Bai Xiaofei and the triplets under the lead of a person.</p> 
 <p>“Masters! Please help us!” Cries of requests ensued and filled Bai Xiaofei’s ears.</p> 
 <p>“If you want me to help you, then stand up!” he coldly roared after failing to get them up several times.</p> 
 <p>And it worked. In the blink of an eye, this group of battered people was on their feet. Everyone’s face was full of grief, only the eyes of the little boy near Bai Xiaofei were sparkling with a different light.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei squatted down, placed his hands on the little boy’s shoulders, and asked softly, “What’s your name?”</p> 
 <p>“A’Tao.” The little boy’s voice was firm, not sobby like others.</p> 
 <p>“Can you tell me why they hit you?” Bai Xiaofei’s voice mellowed even more. His interest in this strong little boy was piqued.</p> 
 <p>“Because we want to see the emperor. They won’t let us, so they beat us.” The little boy’s answer was very simple and clear. Before Bai Xiaofei could ask further, he beat him to it. “Master, can you teach me how to fight?” The little boy stared fixedly at Bai Xiaofei with a ruthlessness that a child of his age shouldn’t possess.</p> 
 <p>“You want to learn how to fight?” Bai Xiaofei was dubious.</p> 
 <p>“Yes. Only when I am strong enough can I defeat those scum and save my sister!” the little boy spoke seriously. His little fists clenched tightly.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, I will teach you. Are you willing to revere me as your teacher?” Bai Xiaofei casually dropped a bomb.</p> 
 <p>Behind him, the triplets gawked. <em>What the hell is he doing?!</em></p>
