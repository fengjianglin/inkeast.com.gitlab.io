 <p>Chapter 891: Devious Emperor; Candidates!</p> 
 <p>“Senior, I understand how you are feeling right now, but it is not the time for sorrow. I need information from you.” Bai Xiaofei solemnly interrupted Lan He’s melancholy. “What does the emperor think about the next in line for the throne?”</p> 
 <p>Lan He had expected this question. He shook his head with a wry smile.</p> 
 <p>“He… oh… He is still crazy as always!” Lan He exclaimed before continuing to explain, “He has no intention to appoint one. He said, and I quote, ‘Leaders born under stability will have no ability to lead.’ Therefore, he wants to let his sons fight among themselves and whoever wins, inherits the throne.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei stared blankly. <em>What did I just hear?! Now that’s a talent of an emperor!!</em></p> 
 <p>Even when nearing their death, any other emperor would still be worried left and right that their son would rob their throne, and this one actually publicly announced that he wanted his sons to fight for it.</p> 
 <p><em>Does he find his royal life too boring or what?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Aren’t you surprised? I had the same reaction as you when I first heard it as well. However, if you think about it carefully, he is in fact right to do so,” said Lan He.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei looked slightly puzzled.</p> 
 <p>“At present, there are five princes whose overall conditions are qualified to become the next emperor. The oldest is 57 and the youngest is 27. Although the rest are old enough, either their experience or talent is lacking. While the emperor is seriously ill, his mind is clear. Knowing that it is inevitable, he’d rather the princes strive openly instead of fighting each other in the dark with underhanded means, thus avoiding certain… regrettable outcomes,” Lan He explained.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was enlightened. Indeed, it was hard for one to control their ambition in the face of such a cake as big as Ethereal. Moreover, there was no shortage of emperors being overthrown after being crowned.</p> 
 <p>Thinking about it, the current Ethereal emperor had played a beautiful move! Moreover, Bai Xiaofei was certain that he had already had everything properly arranged.</p> 
 <p>“What exactly did he say?” Bai Xiaofei gulped as he gazed at Lan He with the attitude of consultation. Compared with these prodigies, he was still too young.</p> 
 <p>“He will issue his final decree and let the five princes compete openly without underhanded moves; this will be a competition of connections and influence. At the same time, he will make them swear that no matter who becomes the winner, they can’t kill the other brothers,” Lan He recounted.</p> 
 <p>With that, Bai Xiaofei was in awe. No wonder Ethereal had become one of the several major empires.</p> 
 <p>“Who are the five?” he asked.</p> 
 <p>Lan He took a deep breath before starting.</p> 
 <p>“57-year-old First Prince Ling Yue, peak grade Exquisite Rank puppet master. He became famous for pacifying rebels. His wife is the youngest daughter of the Imperial Preceptor<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>. I don’t think I need to explain this title to you. Regarding wide connections, no one can compare to the First prince.”</p> 
 <p>“52-year-old Third Prince Ling Fan, one-aperture Exquisite Rank puppet master. At the age of 23, he led a negotiating team to Violethorn to discuss border issues and returned victorious. His wife is the older sister of the current garrison commander.”</p> 
 <p>“47-year old Fourth Prince Ling Hai, peak grade Grandmaster Rank puppet master. When the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain once grew restless, he, at the age of 30, entered it alone and used his kindness and prestige to sign a contract with them that continues to this day, fortifying the foundation of Ethereal. His wife is the younger sister of the Hai clan head.”</p> 
 <p>“35-year-old Sixth Prince Ling Zong, peak grade Grandmaster Rank puppet master. Five years ago, when the Ethereal Merchant Group encountered unprecedented obstacles and nearly collapsed from both internal and external troubles, Ling Zong volunteered to take over the organization. First, he rearranged the internal hierarchy of the business and then hit the road for a year to settle the external problems. When he was done, the Ethereal Merchant Group became unshakable. He has been in charge of the business since then and is currently still unmarried.”</p> 
 <p>“27-year-old Eighth Prince Ling Ming, peak grade Grandmaster Rank puppet master. Three years ago, when the Moonlight Empire asked for help, he led an army and defeated the Northern barbarians before asking for Ye Youran’s hand in marriage, who was at that time Moonlight’s Grand General, thus breaking the tradition of Moonlight’s people never marrying outside.”</p> 
 <p>Finishing his speech, Lan He took a long, deep breath. Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei was dumbfounded… by the fact that so many major events had happened in Ethereal. Before today, he had always thought that Ethereal was all smooth-sailing.</p> 
 <p>Reflecting on it, he realized how ridiculous this idea was. It would be a joke if such a grand empire had been nothing but peaceful. No growth to power was ever simple, and Ethereal could not be an exception!</p> 
 <p>“Then, the one that the Yun and Lan clan support is…?” Bai Xiaofei voiced a very important question as the answer would determine his next course of action.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, a problem popped up. Who of those five would seek cooperation with Shadow Death and use such inhuman means as the human puppets? Bai Xiaofei had no clue at all.</p> 
 <p>“We don’t have a clear direction yet, because the emperor specifically instructed me to keep the Lan and Yun clans neutral and inviting for all the princes. This will not only give us opportunities but also give the princes opportunities. Having the help of two major clans will be precious to any of them,” explained Lan He indifferently.</p> 
 <p>The relationship between him and the emperor was quite clear from these words. Such a reminder from an emperor was equivalent to leaking exam questions…</p> 
 <p>“Who are you more optimistic about?” Bai Xiaofei changed his phrasing to ask the same question.</p> 
 <p>“Who do you think?” Lan He laughed bitterly.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was stunned. He did not expect this attitude from the old man.</p> 
 <p>“I have no problem with leading troops to battle, but this kind of imperial fight? You can say that I don’t have a single aperture for it. As far as I can see, those five people are evenly matched. It’s impossible to tell who has more chances,” Lan He lamented.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei smiled wryly because he was in the same boat. <em>It is indeed!</em></p> 
 <p>“That’s fine, there is no hurry. I think it won’t be long before they come to our door.” He set aside the matter temporarily, and at the same time, he was ready to meet the five princes.</p> 
 <p><em>What kind of surprises would they bring</em>, he wondered… </p>
