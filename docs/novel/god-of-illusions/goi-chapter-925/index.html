 <p>Chapter 925: Final War! (1)</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go, it’s time to go back!” said Bai Xiaofei as he grasped Tan Xin’s hand. The next second, his energy surged and the two disappeared.</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>“Congratulations to Master Pinocchio for opening his furnace. I declare that the performance is officially over!” declared Ling Yue.</p> 
 <p>The whole area instantly burst with a tsunami of cheers. All eyes fell upon the furnace in front of Pinocchio.</p> 
 <p>In the past several days, the other four godsmiths had opened their furnaces one after another, and every time there would be a dazzling violet-gold light, fully demonstrating the abilities of the godsmiths. Therefore, Pinocchio, as the First Godsmith, attracted much attention. Many speculated that he could forge a puppet beyond the violetgold grade!</p> 
 <p>To the crowd’s shock, the stove emitted a deep black light!</p> 
 <p><em>Could that really be blackgold?!!</em></p> 
 <p>Everyone held their breath at that moment, staring at the furnace for fear of missing any details.</p> 
 <p>However, there was a group whose reactions were completely different. Unlike others, the Ethereal soldiers showed not expectation, but readiness to welcome enemies!</p> 
 <p>“I admit that you are very smart, but you really shouldn’t have given us this half a month!” ‘Pinocchio’ burst into laughter. In the blink of an eye, his short body began to change rapidly and transformed into a pale and thin man.</p> 
 <p>At that moment, the eerie black light on the furnace also revealed its true face – the teleportation gate in the form of black fog that had appeared at the tragic auction!</p> 
 <p>Countless human puppets poured out from the black fog and immediately attacked the people around, with the four godsmiths being their prioritized target!</p> 
 <p>However, their appearance was not outside of certain people’s expectations. The four great clan’s private armies were the first to respond. They got into formation, then each army shot out a brilliant light that enveloped the godsmiths protectively while the outstanding younger generation like Yun Tianhe took on the task of guarding by their sides.</p> 
 <p>The garrison started to evacuate the envoys, and the Imperial Guard, as well as the princes’ private armies, cooperated to handle the human puppets. Everything was executed so smoothly that it seemed as if it had been frequently rehearsed.</p> 
 <p>The human puppets were suppressed on the spot!</p> 
 <p>“You really underestimated Shadow Death!!” The thin man laughed hysterically as he flew into the air. At that moment, the Holy Puppetsmith Mountain suddenly became restless.</p> 
 <p>“Heavenly Nonaburn!!!” roared the thin man.</p> 
 <p>The temperature of the whole area began to soar to a terrifying degree. Everyone felt like they were melting from the heat.</p> 
 <p>“Tch tch, turns out that someone can really control this formation. Fortunately, you were not underestimated at all,” a calm voice rang out just as everyone thought their lives were finished, along with which a dazzling figure floated down from the air.</p> 
 <p>Right this instant, Tan Xin also appeared at the scene and waved her hands. A faint purple light shone at the feet of the people who weren’t fighting.</p> 
 <p>Ling Yue was no stranger to the light because it was his teleportation skill! However, even he couldn’t teleport this many people scattered over such a large area so accurately!</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin did it, and from her expression, she found it no trouble at all!</p> 
 <p>Moments later, after the non-combatants were teleported out of the mountain, Bai Xiaofei lifted his suppression of the surrounding temperature.</p> 
 <p>“Everyone, do your best to resist the temperature for ten seconds!” his voice resounded in the air as he shot towards the thin man.</p> 
 <p>“You are still too naive!” The thin man coldly snorted. A figure suddenly appeared next to him as a dark space imprisoned Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The same ability that had sealed off Bai Xiaofei at the auction, Cage! It had been specially researched and created to deal with Bai Xiaofei. However…</p> 
 <p>“How can this…” Looking down at the claws pierced through his chest, the thin man was full of disbelief.</p> 
 <p>“Oh, I said it more than really needed. It didn’t take ten seconds. I didn’t expect that you have only one such person who can restrain me.” Bai Xiaofei smiled deviously and launched Devouring the Heaven and Earth.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t look down on me! Formation, merge!!” shouted the thin man. Then, a stream of energy flowed from the Heavenly Nonaburn Formation into his body.</p> 
 <p>Realizing that the situation was not good, Bai Xiaofei quickly retreated. The next second, from the thin man a terrifying explosion enveloped everything in a radius of 10 meters with a blinding light that stung everyone’s eyes.</p> 
 <p>From the light, a figure bathed in flames suddenly rushed straight at Bai Xiaofei and slapped him flying!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei hurriedly steadied himself in the air and launched his Invincibility barrier. The next moment, the figure rushed at him again, but the attack was blocked by the barrier.</p> 
 <p>The figure was forcefully stopped. It was the thin man who should have died.</p> 
 <p>“Tsk, this kind of feeling, too powerful! I’m too powerful!!” With another bout of hysterical laughter, the thin man savored the feeling of power filling every corner of his body.</p> 
 <p>Formation Merge: merge a formation with one’s body for a period to strengthen it. The effect depended on the rank of the formation. And the Heavenly Nonaburn Formation of the Holy Puppetsmith Mountain was definitely a peak-grade formation on the continent!</p> 
 <p>However, because the formation had merged into the thin man’s body, its high-temperature threat had also disappeared.</p> 
 <p>“I’m very curious. I have the ability to ignore the designated target’s puppets and just now, you obviously didn’t use any illusions. How did my seal not work?” The skinny man wondered. If it weren’t for this ability, he wouldn’t have been able to replace the previous task leader.</p> 
 <p>“Very simple, that fake body wasn’t made by me.” Bai Xiaofei’s lips curled up into a crazed smile.</p> 
 <p>Wise people rarely went crazy. Ever since coming out of the Heavenly Nonaburn Formation previously, Bai Xiaofei had never had a hearty fight, but this time, perhaps he could!</p> 
 <p>“So it was that little girl. But you are also very good, even counting in the possibility that I can see through your ability,” the thin man commented as energy started to gather in his body again.</p> 
 <p>It was war!</p>
