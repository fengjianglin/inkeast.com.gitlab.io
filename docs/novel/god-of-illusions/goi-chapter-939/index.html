 <p>Chapter 939: Vision!</p> 
 <p>As the first group of contestants to complete the mission, Bai Xiaofei’s group of five startled the presiding officer. She never thought that Bai Xiaofei was really able to do what he had said with four deadweights, not to mention at such a fast speed.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei’s teammates had come to regard him as a big boss, believing firmly that they could make it through the first round.</p> 
 <p>With one hundred people assembled, the remaining thousands returned with regret, and the masters of those who passed began to gloat. </p> 
 <p>At that time, what everyone was looking forward to was the assessment criteria of the second test.</p> 
 <p>“Congratulations to you all for passing the first test. This shows that your physical strength isn’t bad at all. Now, for the second test, your vision!” the presiding officer got down to business with just a few words. Then, she clapped her hands, and ten women dressed exactly the same and wearing the same masks came out. “The ten people in front of you look identical, but in fact, three of them are men.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s eyes widened in shock. He thought that Moonlight was perverse enough already, but this took it to another level! He could not tell who the men were at all!</p> 
 <p>“During the next 30 minutes, they will walk back and forth among you all. During this time, you cannot have physical contact with them and cannot communicate with them. The only thing you are allowed to do is observe! When the time is up, you can submit your answers at any time, but each person can only submit once, and the first thirty with the right answer will pass this test. The test starts… now!”</p> 
 <p>The host talked at her own pace, not giving a care whether the contestant kept up with her or not. At her signal, the ten people started moving around.</p> 
 <p>Caught off guard, the contestants panicked.</p> 
 <p>“Brother, how do we find them?” Bai Xiaofei’s teammates gathered around him, also having no clue at all.</p> 
 <p>“We wait. Can’t hurry this one,” replied Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The group then waited. The wait lasted thirty minutes.</p> 
 <p>“Time’s up!” shouted the presiding officer, at which the ten people stopped at once.</p> 
 <p>Then, everyone submitted their answers, except for Bai Xiaofei’s group.</p> 
 <p>“What do you five mean by this? Are you forfeiting?” asked the presiding officer coldly. She had been observing everyone during the test, and Bai Xiaofei’s group, who were the quickest to pass the first test, naturally received more attention. However, she was a little disappointed. While everyone else tried to discern which were men, Bai Xiaofei’s four teammates were just looking flustered.</p> 
 <p>“Of course not. Good food doesn’t fear coming late, right?” Bai Xiaofei smiled. “The answers of us five are unified, and since we’re the only ones left, can I answer for them as well?”</p> 
 <p>The presiding officer nodded with a cold smile. “Well then, let me hear your answer.”</p> 
 <p>Obviously, even Bai Xiaofei couldn’t make her see him in a different light.</p> 
 <p>“Our answer is these three.” Bai Xiaofei pointed out three people.</p> 
 <p>His selection drew a round of laughter from the crowd of contestants.</p> 
 <p>“You are blind! These three people are the most standard! They are nothing like men!”</p> 
 <p>The laughter echoed, making Bai Xiaofei’s four teammates weak in their hearts.</p> 
 <p>However, unlike them, the presiding officer was stunned for a good while before she asked, “And why is that?”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the laughter came to an abrupt end as horror replaced the contestants’ expressions.</p> 
 <p>“It’s very simple; they are too much like women.” With a smile, Bai Xiaofei began explaining, “Knowing their status, the three men definitely had to be extra careful to make themselves look like women for fear that they would affect the competition. And since they were chosen for this test, they should have been subjected to rigorous assessment and training, so that they absolutely look like women from all aspects. Therefore, their performances are impeccable. However, it’s exactly their caution that betrayed them.”</p> 
 <p>The whole square was quiet as everyone listened to Bai Xiaofei with rapt attention.</p> 
 <p>“Meanwhile, as real women, the seven masters will certainly not care as every move they make is natural. However, walking around for 30 minutes will affect their composure somewhat, which would not occur in the men’s performances. So, I came to the conclusion that these three people, who performed so perfectly, are men!”</p> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei finished, all eyes fell upon the presiding officer, wanting to know if his answer was right!</p> 
 <p>“Who is your master?” asked the officer after a long silence.</p> 
 <p>“Me!” a proud voice rang out. Tan Xin squeezed through the crowd, drawing eyes of envy from all around. She demanded impatiently, “Quickly reveal the answer. I’m still waiting to see if the third test can trouble my Lil’ Bai!”</p> 
 <p>The presiding officer nodded. “Congratulations to you five. You are the only ones whose answers are correct. I hereby announce that you have passed the second test.”</p> 
 <p>The crowd was then dead silent. Those who had just laughed at Bai Xiaofei didn’t dare to make a sound.</p> 
 <p>“You five go and take a break. We must choose another twenty-five people, or else we will not be able to start the third test. The second test now begins again.” The officer sighed, feeling humiliated by the fact that the whole Indigo City failed to gather thirty contestants for the third test of the first round. <em>Are Moonlight men really incompetent to this extent?!</em></p> 
 <p>“You don’t have to show that kind of expression. It’s Moonlight’s fault that Moonlight’s men have become what they are now. And if you go on like this, Moonlight’s men will eventually and completely turn into waste.” Bai Xiaofei did not leave. He stood quietly and looked at the presiding officer while speaking words that shocked the whole square.</p> 
 <p><em>Did this guy’s brain go wrong somewhere?! Why is he seeking death?!</em></p>
