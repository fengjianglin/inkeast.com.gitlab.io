 <p>Chapter 869: Wrong Judgment!</p> 
 <p>“Can’t this place work?” Looking at the liquid fire element below his feet, Bai Xiaofei chickened out.</p> 
 <p>“Only the very limit of this place can refine your body. Only when you bear the ultimate fire will your body reach perfection. Moreover, this kind of physical refinement can only be used once, so you only have this one chance,” explained Golden Feather matter-of-factly.</p> 
 <p>Anyone would die at the core of a Fire Separation Formation, but for the sacred phoenix, taking a walk around here was not different from taking a bath.</p> 
 <p>“Alright!” Feeling Golden Feather’s confidence, Bai Xiaofei delayed no further and swam deeper in.</p> 
 <p>That’s right, he swam!</p> 
 <p>Any energy released from the body would be assimilated by the rich elements of fire in this place. Therefore, Bai Xiaofei could not use any ability and only had his body to rely on!</p> 
 <p>“Strange…” Golden Feather suddenly said.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter?” What Bai Xiaofei feared most was this kind of reaction from her. If she was wrong now, he was definitely the first one to turn into nothingness.</p> 
 <p>“The increase in the temperature according to distance is a bit too fast. Theoretically, a Fire Separation Formation should not be this strong…”</p> 
 <p>As Golden Feather pondered, Bai Xiaofei suddenly felt as if he had hit something. Golden Feather focused to see what it was…</p> 
 <p>“Go back!!!” she shouted.</p> 
 <p>Despite her quick reaction, it was too late. The thing that Bai Xiaofei hit suddenly expanded and a suction pulled him in. He instantly felt the pain of his skin being rapidly melted away, followed by his muscles, then bones…</p> 
 <p>His storage ring was the first to be destroyed, spilling the contents all around.</p> 
 <p>“Use Spiritualization!” Golden Feather hurriedly reminded.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately did as told. As the skill activated, Golden Feather fused with him. The rate of his body being melted instantly slowed down but did not stop, and his invincible self-healing ability could not keep up, making him suffer indescribable pain along with the liquefaction.</p> 
 <p>While it was not enough to kill Bai Xiaofei, his eyeballs had been destroyed and he could no longer see anything.</p> 
 <p>“Pull the fire elements around to you and circulate them in your body according to the method I gave you. This is the only way you can survive!” From confidence to panic, Golden Feather had begun to regret not reacting more quickly.</p> 
 <p>The formation enveloping the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain was not a Fire Separation Formation, but one that gave off a very similar vibe – the Heavenly Nonaburn Formation, which could melt even Golden Feather herself!</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, this formation was not manipulated, otherwise, Bai Xiaofei would have no chance to live.</p> 
 <p>There was no time to tell Bai Xiaofei about these things at the moment. All she could do was guide him to survival.</p> 
 <p>“You brat!! How the hell did you get into this thing?! I don’t care if you seek death, but don’t drag me down with you!!!” The Demonic God of Pain roared within Bai Xiaofei’s consciousness. Like Golden Feather, he was also panicking as Bai Xiaofei’s life was linked to his. He growled, “You can’t hold on with the ability of the big bird alone, use my energy and add it to the circulation that bird told you about. Use the fire element you just refined as a temporary barrier!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had no other choice but to follow. He circulated his energy according to the two’s instructions, starting the most thrilling and risky self-rescue ever!</p> 
 <p>Unlike in the past, he only had himself to rely on this time. Even the Thunder Emperor could not get into this place.</p> 
 <p>The Endless State frantically adsorbed all the energy around, including the large number of spilled origin and Starnet Stones from his storage ring that was being melted by the temperature. Even Nightcharm turned into a stream of purple liquid and was absorbed into his body, as well as the grievances from the Falling Flower Formation…</p> 
 <p>Everything that could provide energy flocked to Bai Xiaofei after being purified by the dense fire elements around. Even the deadly toxicity of Nightcharm did not escape this fate.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, Bai Xiaofei drove the mixed energy in the body according to the routes instructed. The demonic energy that once gave Bai Xiaofei a headache had now become the last lifeline for him.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, Bai Xiaofei’s body was being gradually rebuilt. The speed of reconstruction barely kept up with the speed of collapse, but fortunately, the reconstructed parts had developed resistance to the fire elements!</p> 
 <p>From bones to muscles, to fascias to skin, Bai Xiaofei did not know how long the process took. He felt like at least a century had passed.</p> 
 <p>By this point, his pain tolerance’s highest limit was once again renewed…</p> 
 <p>Gradually, with the completion of his body reconstruction, Bai Xiaofei broke away from the boundless pain. The fire elements that he pulled into him formed a huge cocoon and enveloped him. Escaping the crisis of death, he relaxed a little and fainted…</p> 
 <p>After a who-knew-how-long sleep, Bai Xiaofei opened his eyes, only to be greeted by complete darkness.</p> 
 <p>“I’m finished, I’m blind…” This was his first reaction.</p> 
 <p>The Demonic God of Pain’s impatient voice immediately rang out in his mind, “Did your brain get burned? Try releasing your origin energy.”</p> 
 <p>Stunned, Bai Xiaofei immediately did so. The next second, the fiery-red cocoon shattered into pieces, revealing his surroundings.</p> 
 <p>“Oh heaven, hell, god, demon, buddha!!” He gulped in horror.</p> 
 <p>“Congratulations, you have made a fortune. Everything here is a treasure,” said the Demonic God of Pain.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei still did not recover from his trance as he gawked foolishly.</p> 
 <p>The Demonic God of Fiend couldn’t help but despise him again with a snort, “Tch, country bumpkin.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei still did not react.</p> 
 <p><em>This place… is so freaking beautiful!!!</em></p>
