 <p>Chapter 525: Honest Ling Tianxia!</p> 
 <p>This was not the first time that Bai Xiaofei came to Lei Shan’s office. He was as familiar with the place as his own backyard. But this time, he came with a tensed heart. It was no exaggeration to say that Ling Tianxia was a person who could influence the whole continent, and Bai Xiaofei was going to confront such a person face to face.</p> 
 <p>And it was likely to be an unfriendly confrontation!</p> 
 <p>Stopping at the door to Lei Shan’s office, Chu Qingtian raised his hand, about to knock, but suddenly stopped and turned to Bai Xiaofei with a strange expression.</p> 
 <p>“Are you ready?” Chu Qingtian gently asked. Bai Xiaofei inhaled a deep breath.</p> 
 <p>“It’s nothing, I’m ready!”</p> 
 <p>Getting an affirmative answer, Chu Qingtian smiled.</p> 
 <p>“I hope you can still have this expression when you come out!” Chu Qingtian then knocked on the door. “Principal, I’ve brought Bai Xiaofei.”</p> 
 <p>They quickly got a response from Lei Shan. Chu Qingtian pushed open the door and motioned Bai Xiaofei to go in. His mission had been completed at this point.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei walked into the room slowly with slightly heavy steps. There were only two people in the big office. One was Lei Shan who was sitting on the sofa, facing Bai Xiaofei. The other person sat across Lei Shan so Bai Xiaofei couldn’t see his face, but the hill-size of his figure stunned him.</p> 
 <p><em>Damn, he’s so fat?!!</em></p> 
 <p>Mhm, fat was the precise description. Ling Tianxia’s body was similar to that of a top sumo wrestler, filling the sofa that could fit four people…</p> 
 <p>This was way beyond Bai Xiaofei’s expectations of Ling Tianxia. He had imagined that the boss of the Globe Merchant Group would be a smart and competent person and look outstanding at first glance, but this…</p> 
 <p>This was just the complete opposite!</p> 
 <p>“Smelly brat, you’re finally here. Come and meet your senior Ling. Haven’t you always wanted to ask him for advice on business? This is a rare opportunity!” Lei Shan pulled Bai Xiaofei back from his stupor.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, Ling turned around to look at Bai Xiaofei, and the guy’s cheeks that were as big as washbasins made him dizzy.</p> 
 <p><em>This face… is truly unique!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had always thought that his Fourth Father’s ferocious face could be considered ugly, but now it seemed that his Fourth Father’s face was actually kind of handsome in comparison! How should he describe it… To put it simply, Ling Tianxia’s facial features almost looked like they were forcefully stitched together, it just didn’t look like a human face at all.</p> 
 <p>However, shocked as he was, Bai Xiaofei quickly gathered his wits while digesting what Lei Shan had just said. He had never mentioned anything about asking for business advice with Lei Shan, so the old man’s purpose was obvious.</p> 
 <p>He had called Bai Xiaofei over to give him a chance to check Ling Tianxia in person. The reason was obvious, Lei Shan had certainly carefully considered the information provided by Bai Xiaofei. However, Ling Tianxia was still Lei Shan’s disciple and the old man couldn’t bring himself to interrogate him face to face, so Bai Xiaofei became his best choice.</p> 
 <p>And Lei Shan’s implication was also obvious: ‘I am telling you to test him in the way of asking for advice. You brat are not allowed to go overboard, or else even I won’t be able to handle it!’</p> 
 <p>To sum it up, Lei Shan couldn’t directly question Ling Tianxia not only because the guy was his favorite disciple but also because of his identity. Setting aside their teacher-student relationship, even though Ling Tianxia’s current status might not be able to be equal with that of Lei Shan, it was no exaggeration to say he could still influence Lei Shan’s actions to an extent.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, what Bai Xiaofei would have to go through would be much more difficult than he had imagined.</p> 
 <p>“Principal, thank you for your consideration. This little one Bai Xiaofei greets President Ling.” Bai Xiaofei first paid respects to Lei Shan, then politely greeted Ling Tianxia.</p> 
 <p>“Heheh, no need to be so polite, just come and have a seat.” Ling Tianxia chuckled and his voice that was like a heavy drum echoed. Bai Xiaofei felt like he was standing in front of a giant clock and was being shaken by its alarm…</p> 
 <p>Setting aside his excessively loud voice, however, judging from his tone alone, one really couldn’t imagine that Ling Tianxia was the president of the Globe Merchant Group – he sounded too simple and honest! They said there was no business that didn’t deceive and all businessmen were evil. Ling Tianxia’s honest vibe simply posed to be an opposite extreme of this unchanging truth.</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei sat on the third sofa, the atmosphere between the three people relaxed.</p> 
 <p>“You must have been scared by my appearance. How embarrassing. I’ve been like this for decades since childhood. I thought I’d look better when I grew up, but who knew that I only got fatter and uglier?” Ling Tianxia joked. His voice was still ever resounding and his tone still simple and honest.</p> 
 <p>“Well, I was a little scared at first, yes.” Bai Xiaofei donned a fearful expression before his words took a turn. “But looks are not everything. There is no lack of beautiful but useless things in the world, while you are the one and only president of the Globe Merchant Group!”</p> 
 <p>These words came from the bottom of his heart. Not considering other aspects, Ling Tianxia was no doubt the definition of success.</p> 
 <p>“Haha! You are straightforward, Little Brother! I’ve heard too many flattery and lies, but this is the first time I’ve met someone as direct as you! Now, that’s what I like!” Ling Tianxia was so excited that his already shocking voice climbed to a new height, stunning Bai Xiaofei and making him dizzy.</p> 
 <p>“Tianxia, he is only Master Rank, mind your voice!” Lei Shan sent some origin energy to Bai Xiaofei and the sliver of lightning energy stimulated his nerves, pulling him back from his daze.</p> 
 <p>Gradually recovering, Bai Xiaofei gulped with difficulty and there was an instinctive fear in his eyes when he looked at Ling Tianxia.</p> 
 <p><em>What kind of ability is this?! Does this mean if he wants to kill me, he only needs to shout twice and I’ll be done for?!</em></p> 
 <p>“I’m so sorry, Little Brother, I forget to control myself when I get excited. Are you all right?” Ling Tianxia tried to tone down his voice, and on his face appeared an expression that no one could tell if it was apologetic or not…</p> 
 <p>It was just impossible. It was too hard to tell the expressions from such a face!</p> 
 <p>“Nothing… It’s nothing…” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly waved his arms while inching away. This was instinctive avoidance, although it was pointless…</p> 
 <p>“This is Tianxia’s innate special physique. Even without puppets, he can use his voice as a means of attack even without puppets. At present, this special physique has only appeared on him alone and it is still uncontrollable, but it’s not as strong before,” Lei Shan explained with a hint of helplessness.</p> 
 <p>“Teacher is right! I call this physique the Dragon Croon Physique. Overbearing, don’t you think?” bragged Ling Tianxia with a proud expression.</p> 
 <p><em>Erm… I can’t understand this kind of pride…</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but think.</p> 
 <p><em>How did this kind of person who wears his heart on his sleeve become the president of the Globe Merchant Group?! Or is this just acting?! But it all seems too genuine!</em></p> 
 <p>For the first time in his life, Bai Xiaofei felt conflicted by his judgment of a person!</p>
