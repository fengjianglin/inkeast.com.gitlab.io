 <p><span style>“The Floating Blade!” Bai Xiaofei didn’t hesitate in the slightest because he’d decided as soon as he’d finished listening to Feng Wuhen’s introduction. Not to mention anything else, Bai Xiaofei had already thought of how to utilize this thing during the New Student Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was absolutely a great strategical weapon!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After hesitating for a long time, Mo Ka chose to believe in Bai Xiaofei in the end. Even though Bai Xiaofei usually liked to trick others, Bai Xiaofei had never been careless before important matters, and Mo Ka had this confidence towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Mo Ka withdrew himself from the selection, the three young women before Shi Kui raised the red cloth on their trays to reveal three extremely overbearing puppets that emanated a silver metallic sheen that caused it to seem as if it was of very high quality. They were respectively a helmed, a body armor, and gauntlets that completely covered the hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All the second puppets of a Puppetsmith are related to strength. The only difference is the location of the puppet, and this depends on your own preference. All these three puppets carry the effect of strength and defensive improvements.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Violet-grade puppets only possess two effects that are so simple?” Before Shi Kui could make any comment, as his roommate and sword brother, Mo Ka wouldn’t accept this because he felt such an effect was something fit for a blue-grade puppet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Feng Wuhen seemed to have been prepared against Mo Ka’s reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young student, don’t compare the ‘improvement’ I spoke of with the effects of those low grade puppets. The main material of these three puppets is rare heavy silver from deep within the ocean. Even if no Origin Energy is poured within them, their defense strength is comparable with an ordinary yellow-grade puppet. Moreover, heavy silver from deep within the ocean carried an extremely good conductivity and amplification of Origin Energy. So, these three things can bring forth the effects I spoke of to the limit.” Feng Wuhen paused for a moment. “Have you heard of the saying, all is crushed before absolute strength?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As someone part of the audience, Shi Kui gulped down a mouthful of saliva before walking directly towards the gauntlets that flickered with silver radiance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll take this one!” Shi Kui gave the final word, and since he’d already made a choice, there was nothing for the others to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Subsequently, the last three young women revealed the items on their trays. Surprisingly, they were three fist sized shuttle shaped crystals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once again, Bai Xiaofei was stunned. He didn’t recognize these things, but he could be sure that these things were absolutely not puppets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Puppet Cores. After an animate or inanimate puppet is destroyed, it will leave behind a core that contains records of all information related to it. This sort of core usually possesses three types of uses. The first is to be refined into a one time use tool, and it’s capable of discharging the original ability of the puppet once.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The second is to allow animate puppets to evolve. Animate puppets are able to increase the speed of their growth by eating it, and to a certain extent, it will provide some benefits to the puppet master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The final type is to become the second core of another inanimate puppet. Moreover, it will perfectly transfer its ability over to the other inanimate puppet. The method of utilizing it is very simple, just place it close to your existing puppet after you’ve established a contract with it.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhu Nuo withdrew herself when Feng Wuhen spoke up to here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She chose to possess a second puppet and not this sort of improvement on a single puppet. The person that wanted a puppet core was Duan Yi’yi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What abilities do these three cores carry?” After another month had passed, Duan Yi’yi’s habit of becoming shy for no reason had almost been completely rectified, and it wasn’t a problem for her to communicate normally with another now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This first carries the ability Rousing. It’s capable of eliminating stun type controlling effects within its area of effect. At the same time, it can strengthen one’s resistance towards illusions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The second carries the ability Frenzy. Three targets can be designated to enter a frenzied state at the same time. Under this state, Origin Energy circulates at a 30% increased speed, movement speed is increased by 30%, and the target will be able to disregard ordinary controlling effects. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“The third carried the ability Flicker. It allows you to teleport within a certain area. But, it needs to be recharged with Origin Energy every single time before utilization, and it takes five seconds to recharge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, Duan Yi’yi would have to experience a difficult choice because it was truly too difficult to choose between Frenzy and Flicker if she had to choose one from the three. To a Support Stream puppet master, abilities to protect their lives were very important, but what she needed the most right now was a team buff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, Duan Yi’yi could control three puppets now!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I choose frenzy and flicker.” Feng Wuhen was first stunned before revealing a smile when Duan Yi’yi spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations, congratulations! I never expected the you’d be able to control a third puppet so quickly.” His flattery caused Duan Yi’yi’s beautiful face to flush, and then she put away the puppet cores before slowly walking back to where she stood before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The first batch has come to an end, next will be the second batch.” Feng Wuhen who was already able to see commission entering into his pocket was in an excellent mood, and his efficiently increased greatly as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eight young women withdrew themselves before six more replaced them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We only found a single puppet related to a Frostooth Tiger because such specific puppets have always been scarce.” Feng Wuhen’s face carried a slightly apologetic expression as he opened up the red cloth on the tray held by the first young woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An ice blue colored dagger that was the size of an infant’s arm lay on the tray.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Frostooth Tiger’s Bite was refined from two sharp teeth of a Frostooth Tiger. Its effect is ice element strengthening and disregarding fire attribute defensive shields.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no choice this time, but Qi Wei was still very excited. Just as Feng Wuhen had said, if he didn’t get this from their headquarters, it was very likely that Qi Wei would be unable to find a suitable second puppet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The next three are for this student from the Onslaught Stream, and I feel these three puppets are much more suitable for you.” As he spoke, Feng Wuhen revealed three puppets that were fiery red in color.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blaze Armor, it’s capable of improving the destructive force of the fire attribute, and it weakens ice attribute attacks by 50%. Moreover, it carries an ability called Blaze Shield that creates a fire attribute shield upon activation. The shield can burn nearby enemies and be detonated at any moment, causing a fire attribute area affect blast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gauntlets, the Firegod’s Grasp. After it comes into contact with an enemy, it can send fire attribute energy into the enemy’s body to disrupt the opponent’s Origin Energy’s circulation, causing the person’s Origin Energy to fall into a paralyzed state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Accessory, Divine Flame Blessing. 80% of flame attribute damage is negated upon equipping it, and it’s capable of absorbing fire attribute attacks before converting it into Origin Energy that is returned to the user.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he finished introducing the puppets, Xu Chen hesitated for half a second before choosing the Blaze Armor and Firegod’s Grasp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since she was from the Onslaught Stream, she intended to be on the assault until the end!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for defense, she could just leave it to her teammates! It wasn’t in the scope of her consideration at all!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Finally, its these two brothers. Because both of you requested puppets with the main objective of increasing the grade of your existing puppets, I chose high energy cores for you. As for the effects of these cores, it’s only mediocre.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The contents of the last two trays was revealed, and two exactly similar cores lay there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These two cores carry the ability to attract. They are capable of changing the direction of a ranged attack to a certain extent and force it to strike towards the user. But, I don’t know what ability it will possess once both of your puppet’s combine.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the charms of Combination Puppets was its uncertainty, and every single improvement to the puppet was a gamble to the puppet master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, this was never a losing gamble, and up until this date, there hadn’t been news of any combination that was inferior to the original ability.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ming One and Ming Two received the cores with excitement. This was already rather difficult to come by for them because if they didn’t encounter Bai Xiaofei, then their blue-grade puppets would at most be able to be improved to the yellow-grade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, with these two cores, it was very likely for their puppets to directly advance to the peak of the yellow-grade!</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, along with the two brothers becoming fully satisfied and content, the selection of the second batch of puppets had come to an end!</span></p>
