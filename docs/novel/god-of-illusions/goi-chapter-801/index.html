 <p>Chapter 801: Unexpected Guest!</p> 
 <p>Leaving the slave market with the goatee man’s promise, Bai Xiaofei came up with a series of sinister plans.</p> 
 <p>“You’ve been smiling evilly all the way. What did you get?” In the end, Hu Xian’er couldn’t help her curiosity.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei chuckled mysteriously. “Remember I said we were gonna muddy the water? Don’t you have any thoughts after hearing that goatee guy say we had to wait six days?” After giving Hu Xian’er a hint, he quietly looked at her.</p> 
 <p>After a long silence, Hu Xian’er finally revealed a look of realization.</p> 
 <p>“Are you going to drag both the Devil Forest and Windlove City in?” Hu Xian’er was Hu Xian’er after all. She soon understood Bai Xiaofei’s idea, just not in detail.</p> 
 <p>“They are only part of it. The key lies in the timing.” Bai Xiaofei kept Hu Xian’er in suspense again.</p> 
 <p>This brought a frown to her face. Guessing his thoughts was probably the hardest thing in the world.</p> 
 <p>“Just plan away. Everyone will wait for you,” Hu Xian’er expressed her support without asking further. A calm Bai Xiaofei was the best version of him, and he could not go wrong in this state!</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I’ll give you guys a big show!”</p> 
 <p>The two chatted along the way back to the inn, which had become the group’s temporary base. Upon seeing them return, a crowd immediately came up.</p> 
 <p>“How about it?” Chen Hui could not wait. Her face was full of expectation.</p> 
 <p>“Inform Fang Ye to come back and not worry about it. His target won’t come back in at least several days. As for Lin Li’s group, they’ll continue to investigate, but tell them not to be hasty.” Bai Xiaofei did not explain, but directly gave out orders.</p> 
 <p>Chen Hui immediately went out, while the rest continued to be curious babies.</p> 
 <p>“We’ll talk when everyone’s here.” Blocking all incoming questions with a wave of his hand, Bai Xiaofei dived into his room.</p> 
 <p>Inside, Rui Mengqi and Gu Lingyue were busy preparing the room so that Bai Xiaofei could rest at any time.</p> 
 <p>“Err… Just leave this stuff to me. You guys…”</p> 
 <p>“That won’t do! We’ve agreed to leave these things to me!” Rui Mengqi turned around with a glare.</p> 
 <p>“And me! I’m your slave. How can I let these little things occupy your time?” Adding to the headache called Rui Mengqi was Gu Lingyue…</p> 
 <p>“Alright, alright, I’m scared of you two now! But I have something to do, you guys can leave. And by the way, call Wang Chuan over.” For his own ‘safety,’ Bai Xiaofei gave them a good reason to leave.</p> 
 <p>The two girls glared at each other, sparks flying from the fire in their eyes.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Bai Xiaofei wisely chose to turn a blind eye, but his heart drummed like crazy. If he let these two do as they wished, his future would definitely be too ‘thrilling’!</p> 
 <p>After the two girls left, Bai Xiaofei heaved a sigh of relief, but before his breathing could become even, Wang Chuan rushed into the room. Bai Xiaofei’s words were like edicts to the boy and must be executed immediately!</p> 
 <p>“Master!” Wang Chuan excitedly shouted and almost jumped on Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t, don’t get excited, keep your distance!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was overwhelmed by the boy’s enthusiasm. This guy never took a bath before he accepted him as his disciple, and although Bai Xiaofei ordered him to clean himself for a day, some smells could not be removed in just a while.</p> 
 <p>“Oh, this disciple understands.” Wang Chuan immediately retreated to a corner, looking like he had suffered a huge injustice.</p> 
 <p>“Erm… you don’t have to retreat that far. How can I talk to you when you are so far away?” Bai Xiaofei smiled bitterly and was at a loss for words. The mentality of Wang Chuan was at best seven years old…</p> 
 <p>“Good, Master!” Wang Chuan laughed foolishly and stood opposite Bai Xiaofei. After cleaning up, he looked totally different from before.</p> 
 <p>“I have checked and found that you’re qualified to become a puppet master. Combined with your physical characteristics, I suggest you choose the Transformation Stream. As for your puppet, I’ve already asked someone to help you choose. What you need now is the basic cultivation for puppet masters, which Sister Qi Wei will teach you later. Now, I’ll teach you a secret art that’s very suitable for you!”</p> 
 <p>Wang Chuan’s big eyes widened. In his view, what Bai Xiaofei would give him was the best. Driven by this kind of psychology, Wang Chuan memorized every word Bai Xiaofei said…</p> 
 <p>Wang Chuan remained in Bai Xiaofei’s room for more than three hours. When they came out, Fang Ye’s team had returned. Not only them, even Lin Li and Wang Hang, who had vanished for a while now, had come back with their teams.</p> 
 <p>Being surrounded by them, Bai Xiaofei was filled with pleasant surprise.</p> 
 <p>Windlove City itself was an indispensable part of his plan. Since Wang Hang had returned, it meant there was no problem on his side!</p> 
 <p>“Have it all figured out?” Bai Xiaofei got straight to business without a caring word. Since Wang Hang was standing in front of him intact, it was unnecessary.</p> 
 <p>“The city lord agreed to meet. And I don’t know why their party was extremely friendly despite the chaos we have caused in the city lord’s mansion. It’s as if we have done nothing at all.” Wang Hang’s face was full of incomprehension and he felt like he had been punching cotton. According to the plan, there should have been a tough battle.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei pondered for a moment and decided to postpone all his questions temporarily. “No matter what doubts you have, they’ll all be resolved as long as we meet them. What’s the time of the meeting?”</p> 
 <p>“Tonight…” Wang Hang uttered.</p> 
 <p><em>Seems like the fellow is actually impatient after all that beating!</em> Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help a pained smile. “Shall we go to them or…?”</p> 
 <p>“They said they would come in person and bring an acquaintance…”</p> 
 <p>Wang Hang’s reply stupefied everyone.</p> 
 <p><em>An acquaintance?! Since when does Xiaofei have an acquaintance in Windlove?</em></p> 
 <p>“You know someone in Windlove City?” Hu Xian’er voiced everyone’s doubt.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei stared blankly, but then he widened his eyes. <em>Talking about an acquaintance, it can only be him!! No wonder! No wonder!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei burst out laughing as the mystery he had been wondering about was solved by more than half.</p> 
 <p>“You don’t know this person, but he did us a big favor.” Keeping everyone in suspense, Bai Xiaofei was full of expectations for the Windlove city lord.</p> 
 <p><em>There will be a long talk tonight!</em></p>
