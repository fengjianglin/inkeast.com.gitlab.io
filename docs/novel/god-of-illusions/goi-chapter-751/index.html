 <p>Chapter 751: A Chain of Schemes! (1)</p> 
 <p>“Brother, I heard that my people have been detained?”</p> 
 <p>Coming alone to the garrison post of the mayor’s building, Bai Xiaofei, still in the appearance of Liu Heng, approached the gatekeepers with a big smile.</p> 
 <p>The guards were startled. After all, Liu Heng was a puppet master. Instinctive fear made it hard for normal people not to panic upon being addressed by a puppet master.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, the squad guarding the city gate did bring back a few people recently. We’ve received an order from above to take anyone who comes for them there. Come with me.”</p> 
 <p>Despite their apprehension, the guards still appeared composed. After all, they were still a part of the official army of a city.</p> 
 <p>Following the guards, Bai Xiaofei passed a series of depressing-looking structures before finally arriving at a place that looked slightly more magnificent. If it weren’t for the occasional tragic screams coming from inside, it might have been more welcoming…</p> 
 <p>“Master, someone has come to bail out those people!”</p> 
 <p>It seemed that this was not the first time something like this had occurred. Upon being called, someone immediately went out to greet them, and the person happened to be a familiar face – Qin San, who previously suffered a loss from Huskie at the city gate.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei knew him, but the guy didn’t know Liu Heng and therefore took him for a stranger, a fat sheep to be slaughtered!</p> 
 <p>“Bailing out your people?” asked Qin San coldly. He was still dejected about losing his money pouch. What was inside was more than his monthly salary!</p> 
 <p>“No, no, you may have misunderstood me, official. I did come for those people, but not to bail them out,” replied Bai Xiaofei as he took out a pouch.</p> 
 <p>Qin San’s eyes lit up at how heavy the pouch appeared, and without surprise, Bai Xiaofei stuffed it into his hands.</p> 
 <p>“This is a greeting gift. I wonder if you can find us a private place to talk?” Bai Xiaofei asked.</p> 
 <p>Qin San took a glance inside the pouch. The gold coins inside made his eyelids twitch.</p> 
 <p>“Come with me.” Stowing the pouch, Qin San’s attitude took a U-turn. He led Bai Xiaofei to a slightly decent room and carefully shut the door.</p> 
 <p><em>Can’t let others see this moneybag!</em></p> 
 <p>“Alright, what do you want to do with those people?” Qin San was smart. He understood what Bai Xiaofei meant with only a hint as he had encountered his fair share of ‘taking people’s money to eliminate their problems.’</p> 
 <p>“I want them to disappear from this world in a reasonable way, without leaving any trace!” Bai Xiaofei took out an Amethyst Card.</p> 
 <p>Seeing the card, Qin San was stupefied. The lowest-ranked Amethyst Card still needed to have 10 thousand gold coins inside, which was enough to pay for Qin San to guard the gate for his entire life!</p> 
 <p>“After the job is done, this card is yours. What you are going to do with this money later will be none of my business, and I don’t want anyone else to know about this. Do you understand what I mean?” Bai Xiaofei fully released his energy pressure. After some time, he had completely fortified the first realm of the Grandmaster Rank, origin energy solidifying.</p> 
 <p>Seeing the energy armor materializing on Bai Xiaofei’s body, Qin San gulped. He was not a puppet master, but he had knowledge on the subject. A Grandmaster Rank master puppet master was beyond what Starflame City could handle!</p> 
 <p>“Master, please rest assured! I will disappear from this city immediately after I finish the job!” A frightened Qin San was shaking like a leaf. Let alone being paid, even if Bai Xiaofei demanded money from him now, he would not refuse. Nothing was more important than his life!</p> 
 <p>“No need to be so serious. I’m very easygoing.” With a smile, Bai Xiaofei said something that Qin San didn’t dare to believe even if he was killed.</p> 
 <p><em>Easygoing? Having your own people murdered is easygoing?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Well, that’s all I have to say. Remember, you already handled them before I arrived. As for the Amethyst Card, I will send someone to deliver it to you after you leave.”</p> 
 <p>With that, Bai Xiaofei put away the card and left. When Qin San finally returned to his senses, there was no longer any sign of him.</p> 
 <p>Leaving the mayor’s building, Bai Xiaofei hurriedly ran all the way back to the inn. Seeing him return alone, Old Song’s expression sank.</p> 
 <p>“Where are they?!” asked Old Song anxiously.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei revealed an ugly expression. “They had a conflict with the mayor’s people and were executed before I arrived…”</p> 
 <p>Old Song’s blood ran cold upon the news. “How can it be?! I told them to keep a low profile! Why would they do that?!”</p> 
 <p>Old Song wanted to rush to the mayor’s building and demand an explanation but was stopped by Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Are you crazy?! Did you forget why we’re here?!” shouted Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Old Song fell silent. The tremendous pressure from their organization was an unusually useful threat.</p> 
 <p>“What about that guy Bai Sicheng? Do we still cooperate with him or not?” Old Song turned to the most important problem. In fact, he didn’t care that much about whether the investigators were dead or alive. He only cared about his money!</p> 
 <p>“I think we should leave it to the higher-ups to decide!” Bai Xiaofei slowly said after some thought.</p> 
 <p>Old Song was struck. <em>That’s right!</em></p> 
 <p>If there was no problem with Bai Sicheng, they would get the money after introducing him to their superiors and then could escape the organization. Even if Bai Sicheng was found to be problematic later, the higher-ups would have to handle the mess. At that time, they would have already run too far to be found.</p> 
 <p>The organization was terrifying, but only when one was in it!</p> 
 <p>“Great! We’ll do as you said! I’ll contact the above, but Old Liu, you have to make sure that no one else knows about this. Our lives are really on the line now!” Old Song gulped, but his expression grew fanatic. “However, as long as we seal this deal, we won’t have to run around all day like this for the rest of their lives!”</p> 
 <p>His shoulders tightly gripped by Old Song, Bai Xiaofei fell into a long silence.</p> 
 <p>“Alright. I just hope that there’s nothing wrong with that guy!” In the end, he sighed.</p> 
 <p>His response filled Old Song with delight. The latter laughed joyously before running back to his room, unaware of the sneer on Bai Xiaofei’s lips after he left.</p> 
 <p>Hook, line, and sinker!</p> 
 <p><em>But the play has just begun. Old Song, oh, Old Song, hope you can make it through the next act!</em></p>
