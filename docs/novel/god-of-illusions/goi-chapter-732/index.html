 <p>Chapter 732: Enough…</p> 
 <p>“What did I tell you?! Keep an eye on your enemy’s movements in battle. What were you just looking at?! Waiting to die?!”</p> 
 <p>Within the Fist of the Beast’s duel ring, a group of new students lay flat on the ground. In the center was Qi Wei clad in her battle outfit as she scolded them, her imposing aura totally different from that of the girl who liked to gossip before.</p> 
 <p>“No, senior sister, you are just too fast…” complained a freshman from the bottom of his heart, but what he got in return was Qi Wei’s icy glare.</p> 
 <p><em>He is so done!</em> The onlookers gulped. Every time her special ‘tigress’ glare appeared, blood would spill!</p> 
 <p>In just over a year, Qi Wei had become a celebrity of the Fist of the Beast. Having graduated from the first training course with flying colors and being the holder of a Starnet Brilliance laid a good foundation for her. However, having to teach new students added more and more fuel to her fiery temper. Gradually, ‘Tigress’ became her exclusive title.</p> 
 <p>“You think your enemies will let you off because you’re slower than them?!” Qi Wei’s tone was ice-cold as she slowly approached the junior who had just complained, cold air spreading from her.</p> 
 <p>The next second, Qi Wei’s body flashed and her raised foot was about to land on the junior. At that moment, a hand suddenly appeared and stopped her by her ankle while another supported the trembling junior up.</p> 
 <p>“Long time no see. I see our chatterbox has changed a lot.”</p> 
 <p>Qi Wei was about to attack and teach the person who stopped her a lesson, but when she looked up, she was instantly struck dumb.</p> 
 <p>“Class Monitor!!!” she shrieked as she pounced at Bai Xiaofei and gave him a big hug in front of all and sundry.</p> 
 <p><em>What the hell?! Now this is serious!! Senior Grim Reaper is being cuckolded!!!</em></p> 
 <p>This was the thought of every junior present, and ‘Senior Grim Reaper’ was none other than Wang Hang, who had never dared to confess to Qi Wei and only taken the last step during Bai Xiaofei’s absence. Currently, not only had they made their relationship clear, but they had also taken a crucial step that surpassed even Mo Ka and Zhu Nuo.</p> 
 <p>Poor Mo Ka was still only at the ‘holding hands’ stage…</p> 
 <p>“Cough, cough… Pay attention to distance, or Wang Hang will kill me,” Bai Xiaofei softly reminded.</p> 
 <p>The excited Qi Wei turned red in the face and immediately let go.</p> 
 <p>“When did you come back? What took you so long? What have you been doing? Do you know that everyone is looking for you like crazy?” Like a machine gun, Qi Wei fired off a series of questions in one breath.</p> 
 <p>“Err… About that, let’s talk after everyone gathers?” Bai Xiaofei scratched his head in embarrassment as he didn’t know what to say.</p> 
 <p>He didn’t even need to use his brains to know that the others would be similarly curious like Qi Wei. If he had to tell everyone one by one about his trip, he wouldn’t have time to do anything else in the next two months.</p> 
 <p>“Yeah, you’re right. I was too anxious.” Qi Wei laughed, but the excitement and delight on her face didn’t wane at all. Then, she suddenly revealed a strange smile. “By the way, you’re here to find Sister Xian’er, aren’t you?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei panicked.</p> 
 <p>“Erm… Is something wrong with Xian’er?” An uneasy Bai Xiaofei gulped. Half a year had changed Qi Wei this much, then the others…</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was scared to think about how Hu Xian’er had changed.</p> 
 <p>“How do I put it…” Biting her finger in thought for half a day, Qi Wei finally shook her head with a helpless smile. “I don’t know how to describe it.”</p> 
 <p>Then, her smile suddenly grew so eerie that the flustered Bai Xiaofei lost all courage to see Hu Xian’er.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll put it another way.” Bai Xiaofei looked intently at Qi Wei with a desperate desire to survive. “Do you think I’ll be able to live?”</p> 
 <p>Although it sounded a bit exaggerated, it was definitely not too much from Bai Xiaofei’s point of view. No news for half a year was really seeking death!</p> 
 <p>“Hard to say. You don’t know how formidable Big Sis Xian’er is now!” This was Qi Wei’s answer after half a day, an answer too vague to speculate anything from. There were many kinds of ‘formidable,’ and the degree of them remained to be considered.</p> 
 <p>“Why? Her strength has improved again?” asked Bai Xiaofei in delight. Hu Xian’er was already Grandmaster Rank when he had left. Did she breakthrough to the Exquisite Rank in just half a year?!</p> 
 <p>“Her strength has improved a lot, but definitely not as much as you think. She is formidable in another aspect.” Under Bai Xiaofei’s guidance, Qi Wei slowly figured out the right direction to communicate. Unfortunately, she came to an abrupt halt at this point and refused to elaborate. “You need to feel it yourself. Hearing it from me is definitely not as real as seeing it in person!”</p> 
 <p>Qi Wei then ran away as her voice echoed.</p> 
 <p>“I’m going to tell the others of your return. Big Sis Xian’er is at the training ground, you can see her when you go there!”</p> 
 <p>With that, an excited Qi Wei disappeared from sight, leaving Bai Xiaofei at the center of attention of the freshmen who had never seen him before. They all stared at him like an animal in the zoo.</p> 
 <p><em>Who is this senior? How can he make Tigress Qi Wei so excited?!</em></p> 
 <p>In front of the astonished juniors, Bai Xiaofei fixed his expression before looking at them.</p> 
 <p>“Ahem… Well, class dismissed. I don’t think your senior sister will come back.”</p> 
 <p>Leaving these words, Bai Xiaofei hurriedly ran towards the training ground that Qi Wei had said. The freshmen’s stares gave him a feeling that he would be dissected for study if he stayed any longer.</p> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei arrived at his destination, at least 800 people were surrounding the training grounds of the Fist of the Beast. He went to a corner and looked at the center of the training ground below giving a lecture.</p> 
 <p>One look and his eyes blurred…</p> 
 <p>Standing in the middle of the training ground was none other than the person who he had been missing dearly, Hu Xian’er.</p> 
 <p>He thought that he would be excited beyond measure when he saw her, but only now did he know he was wrong. He was very calm. The moment he laid eyes on her, he already felt it was enough…</p>
