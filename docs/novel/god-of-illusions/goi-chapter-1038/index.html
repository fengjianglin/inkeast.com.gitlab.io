 <p>Chapter 1038: Illusion Sword Emerges!</p> 
 <p>“Squads 1 and 3, deploy!”</p> 
 <p>In the sky, the First Team of Illusion Sword was fast approaching Golden Light City when their captain issued an order. Two hundred people immediately halted, effectively separating from the team as the rest continued forward. Lights flashed, and identical gun puppets appeared in the hands.</p> 
 <p>These were also custom-made: the violet-grade heavy gun puppet, Skyripper!</p> 
 <p>The two hundred people were divided into two squads, each aiming at two stone statues standing at the entrance of Golden Light City.</p> 
 <p>After a short energy-accumulation period, two hundred rays of light converged into two terrifyingly thick beams. The beams triggered the city’s defensive formation and shattered it the next second with a thunderous explosion.</p> 
 <p>The moment that happened, the remaining four hundred members, who had arrived at the city, rushed right in!</p> 
 <p>“Although it’s only a mid-grade formation, it’s still impressive that they could find the core so quickly and calculate the intensity needed to destroy it. You really taught them well,” Bai Xiaofei praised as he watched everything through the screens.</p> 
 <p>“I had no other choice, these children are always too hungry to learn. In the past two years, they have slept less than six hours a day on average. They don’t know how to spend their time outside of studying.” A proud Fang Ye was smiling ear to ear.</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei continued to watch with great interest, the First Team started the first performance of Illusion Sword!</p> 
 <p>“Squads 2 and 4, claim the high ground!” ordered the captain.</p> 
 <p>The two hundred members of Squad 2 and 4 stopped attacking and spread out to find high spots.</p> 
 <p>“Enemy attack!!!”</p> 
 <p>Only then did the garrison of Golden Light finally respond and start attacking the Illusion Sword members. However, the latter showed no intention to slow down despite being attacked. As this caught the garrison soldiers off guard, energy bullets out of nowhere blew them to pieces.</p> 
 <p>In the distance, Squads 1 and 3 put away their Skyrippers.</p> 
 <p>Then, with Squads 2 and 4 occupying the high ground, the first task of Squads 1 and 3 was completed. They rode their Flying Excaliburs right into Golden Light City and attacked the scattered garrison in addition to stopping the enemy soldiers that were trying to reach Squads 2 and 4.</p> 
 <p>On the high platforms, Squads 2 and 4 began to cover for Squads 1 and 3. Every time a beam of light shot out, an enemy lost their life.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Squads 5 and 6, who had flown straight to the city lord’s mansion, arrived above the target safely as all flying puppet masters had been shot down by Squads 2 and 4.</p> 
 <p>“Squad 5!” shouted the captain of Squad 5 upon sighting the city lord’s personal guard team. Hearing this, the 150 members of Squad 5 plunged down into the enemy team!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei widened his eyes in shock. “Close combat?”</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye smiled. “Don’t worry, they cherish their lives more than anything.”</p> 
 <p>What happened right after made Bai Xiaofei understand Fang Ye’s confidence.</p> 
 <p>Upon landing, the Squad 5 members summoned their third puppets – a set of two snake-like chains!</p> 
 <p>“Starcloud Double Chains, a mid-range puppet. The star chain has a restraint ability and the cloud chain can break through defenses. Although not as aggressive as Skyripper, their flexibility and attack frequency are unmatched and very suitable for breaking formations,” Fang Ye explained.</p> 
 <p>By the time Fang Ye finished speaking, the city lord’s personal guards’ defensive formation had been destroyed by Squad 5’s flying chains while Squads 2 and 4 covered their backs.</p> 
 <p>“Arrogant bastards, f*cking die!!”</p> 
 <p>With a sudden furious roar, the whole city lord’s mansion was blown up. From the rubble, the city lord of Golden Light, clad in golden armor, glared at the 50 members of Squad 6 surrounding him.</p> 
 <p>Even though it looked like Squad 6 was at a disadvantage, the rest showed no intention to go to their aid, everyone focusing on their own missions. However, it was also for this reason that all of the soldiers in Golden Light City were held back from helping their city lord.</p> 
 <p>He was completely isolated!</p> 
 <p>“An Exquisite Rank puppet master. What are they going to do about the rank oppression now…?” Bai Xiaofei watched with great interest.</p> 
 <p>“Only two-aperture. There’s nothing he can do. 30 seconds at most.” Fang Ye laughed with contempt at the city lord. Rank-oppression training was a daily routine for Illusion Sword.</p> 
 <p>“Of course I’m not worried. I’m just curious about what other strange items you’ve equipped them with,” quipped Bai Xiaofei. “Compared to lone puppet masters, this kind of city lord always has a natural disadvantage: their ability has long been known by the outside world. Without the element of surprise, they are already on the losing side.” As a famous person himself, Bai Xiaofei had a deep experience of this.</p> 
 <p>During the talk, Bai Xiaofei had seen what he wanted to see. As a Melee Stream puppet master, the city lord ‘intimately’ experienced what it was like to be led around by the nose.</p> 
 <p>The fourth puppet of the Illusion Sword members was Radiant Shield, a trigger-type puppet. When the owner was attacked for the first time, it would be activated and repel all living things around.</p> 
 <p>Their fifth puppet was Concentric Knot. Within a certain range, puppet masters holding Concentric Knots of the same set could transfer energy to each other as well as teleport.</p> 
 <p>These two defensive puppets, coupled with the Flying Excalibur that was big enough to be a shield allowed Squad 6 to perfectly fend off the city lord, who was helpless despite being much stronger.</p> 
 <p>“Exquisite Rank? Nothing special. If that’s all you have, you can die now,” taunted the captain of Squad 6.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the furious city lord erupted. His body suddenly emitted a dazzling light.</p> 
 <p>“YOU ALL HAVE TO DIE!”</p> 
 <p>In that instant, the Squad 6 members moved in unison. They all disappeared on the spot, and reappeared almost right after.</p> 
 <p>Looking at the city lord, his eruption had been forced to stop mid-way as all the vital parts on his body had been ridden with sword cuts. Without even a chance to leave any final words, he collapsed.</p> 
 <p>That was the sixth puppet of Illusion Sword, Terror. It was an offensive assassin-type puppet with a shield-breaking effect that could attack the opponent at lightning speed. After each use, it needed three hours to recharge.</p> 
 <p>“Thirty-one seconds.” Bai Xiaofei looked at Fang Ye and burst out laughing, but the approval was clear.</p> 
 <p>Illusion Sword, the sword of Illusion Demon. It was worthy of its name!</p>
