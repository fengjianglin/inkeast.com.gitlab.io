 <p>Chapter 712: Seeing the Demon King at Last!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei dashed straight at Jie. His golden flame erupted and enveloped his whole body.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Jie looked troubled. If he was not injured, he had absolute confidence in fighting Bai Xiaofei, but his current state didn’t allow him to muster any strength at all.</p> 
 <p>However, he was not at a dead end. Although he wasn’t Bai Xiaofei’s opponent, the others weren’t the case, and Jie knew who he cared about the most!</p> 
 <p>Jie turned into black energy and flew toward the Leng triplets, shuttling through all the puppet masters and resurrected people on the way. No one could stop him who was desperate to survive.</p> 
 <p>“I knew you would do that.” Bai Xiaofei’s lips curled up. In a flash, he appeared in Jie’s path, and his burning golden flame made contact with the black energy mass.</p> 
 <p>A tragic scream echoed as Jie was forced back into his solid form. He hurriedly retreated, but Bai Xiaofei didn’t intend to let him go. He quickly pursued and constantly inflicted wounds on Jie’s body with his two flame-wrapped hands. Jie’s energy fluctuation rapidly weakened.</p> 
 <p>“F*ck off!” Jie roared. His remaining energy erupted and extinguished the flames with its corrosive property.</p> 
 <p>In order not to be tainted, Bai Xiaofei had to temporarily retreat. After the aftermath of the eruption cleared, Jie’s body became translucent and the dark energy disappeared.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll remember this. Sooner or later, I’ll pay it all back!” Jie left a malicious threat as his almost transparent body kept fading. Thick gray smoke poured out and quickly drifted in all directions.</p> 
 <p>“Soul Solution Great Art! He wants to escape! Attack with energy!!!” Yue Xiaofei shouted.</p> 
 <p>Everyone hurriedly did as he said. The scattered gray smoke became the target of all and the battlefield was once again chaotic.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t join them. He had the heart but not the energy. While he had been attacking very fiercely just now, he was actually not familiar with the golden flame ability yet and had to spend more energy to make up for the lack of proficiency. As a result, he was depleted.</p> 
 <p>While Bai Xiaofei hurriedly recharged with Starnet Stones, the gray smoke had been destroyed by nearly 80% while some managed to escape. As the last wisp of Jie’s soul energy was extinguished by Fan Xingyu’s sword aura, everyone stopped.</p> 
 <p>During his brief appearance, Jie managed to intimidate the majority of the group. If it weren’t for the fact that Bai Xiaofei just so happened to have the skill to injure Jie, the result would have been different. Moreover, Jie was obviously not the demon king, meaning the enemy they would face next would only be more difficult.</p> 
 <p>In other words, they didn’t know how many more people would die, and no one could guarantee that they wouldn’t be the next one to fall.</p> 
 <p>Many hesitated as the idea to back out began to sprout. Right at that moment, Bai Xiaofei opened his eyes and said, “Let’s go.”</p> 
 <p>Seeing that he had recovered, Leng Liuli brought his group of close acquaintances to him with a smile.</p> 
 <p>“I hope you won’t tell us to stay here or anything like that. If we stay, the others won’t follow you. However, we don’t want you to worry about our safety and get distracted from the battle. Even if we can’t help you, we don’t want to hold you back,” Leng Liuli stopped Bai Xiaofei before he could say anything. “If you really miss an opportunity because of us, believe that we will personally end our lives!”</p> 
 <p>She gazed at him with determination. Behind her, Leng Liushuang and Leng Liuying shared the same expression. They were not joking.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, I’ll remember what you said, but you have to hold this!” Bai Xiaofei agreed and handed a Starnet Brilliance to Leng Liuli. His expression said that he wouldn’t let her refuse.</p> 
 <p>With a smile, Leng Liuli received it.</p> 
 <p>“You can do it!” She nodded strongly at him.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go!” Bai Xiaofei had never been more determined as he walked at the forefront of the team for the first time, followed by the Leng sisters and the first group of people that he had saved.</p> 
 <p>With them taking the lead, many of those who were hesitating decided to follow. A fearful pack of sheep could never fight against hungry wolves, and sometimes, what they only lacked was a good leader!</p> 
 <p>As they pushed forward again, no one on the road ahead could stop Bai Xiaofei’s group. They killed their way to the very center. It was also at that moment that they saw the formidable demon king in Yue Xiaofei’s story.</p> 
 <p>The demon king was grasping a weak-looking, trembling Jie, whose gray soul energy was flowing into his body through his right arm. Poor Jie thought he would be safe after returning to his lord’s side, but he who had been unable to stop the enemy only had one last value – to provide the demon king with the power to break free!</p> 
 <p>“So you have arrived.” After absorbing all of Jie’s energy, the fettered demon king turned around and faced Bai Xiaofei’s group.</p> 
 <p>At that moment, everyone truly felt what real might was!</p> 
 <p>They clearly didn’t feel any energy fluctuations from the demon king, but a simple look made them feel like they were being crushed by a mountain. Even Bai Xiaofei was no exception. Standing at the front, he actually felt at least twice as much pressure!</p> 
 <p>However, he smiled faintly.</p> 
 <p>“I bet you can’t get out of those chains yet.”</p> 
 <p>With one sentence, Bai Xiaofei pulled everyone back from their fear. Only then did they notice that black wisps of energy from the battlefield were still fusing into the demon king’s body. This was their opportunity!</p> 
 <p>All eyes shone as rising hope instantly replaced fear.</p> 
 <p>“Attack!” Bai Xiaofei commanded.</p> 
 <p>There was no delay. All kinds of attacks shot out as everyone used their most powerful abilities. In this battle, one side must die!</p>
