 <p>Bai Xiaofei was slightly stunned when he saw the solemn look in Revelation’s eyes. He had not heard of Dark Death, but he could see from Revelation’s eyes that this term represented something important.</p>
 <p>“Dark Death is the most mysterious organization on the continent and is also the biggest tumor plaguing it.” Revelation slowly explained, a trace of anger creeping onto his face. The more he talked, the more agitated he became. “They operate in an extremely secretive manner, and may be hidden anywhere around us. Even a neighbor who has been living next door for many years may be one of them. The moment their services are required, these hidden members will transform into wolves, killing all they need to kill.</p>
 <p>“Over the years, any appearance of Dark Death has been followed by bloodshed. Each time they appear, people with considerable status die. Many people want to eliminate them, but nobody can. The melee combat technique you had demonstrated, the clean killing method, is a combat technique commonly used by the Dark Death members.”</p>
 <p>Revelation stopped his explanation and fixed his gaze on Bai Xiaofei. As of this moment, Bai Xiaofei’s mind went completely blank.</p>
 <p>After regaining it, he gulped and asked while staring blankly at Revelation, “Master, not even your Heavenly Secret Disk can locate them?”</p>
 <p>It had been a while since he had first met Revelation. Through hearsay, he had gained an understanding of how powerful Revelation’s fortune telling ability was and now knew more about him.</p>
 <p>“Nope. I tried many times, and every time I tried seeing anything related to the Dark Death, an incorporeal power would cut me off. A huge amount of origin energy is required to fight that power. With my strength, I can’t break through it.”</p>
 <p>An intense self-blame was present in Revelation’s voice. It was as if he had recalled something painful.</p>
 <p>“Master, can you wait?” Looking at the pain Revelation was in, Bai Xiaofei made a sudden request, stunning Revelation.</p>
 <p>“Wait? What am I waiting for?” Revelation raised his head and looked at Bai Xiaofei with doubt in his eyes.</p>
 <p>“I promise you that one day, I will find out everything about the Dark Death. Whatever they had done to you in the past, I will use my identity as your disciple and avenge you.”</p>
 <p>For some reason, Bai Xiaofei had suddenly grown emotional, and he had made a vow that shocked even himself. On the other hand, after hearing his completely unreliable words, Revelation sank into a long silence.</p>
 <p>“I have already waited for more than a century. Another century of waiting is nothing,” Revelation said with a laugh. He then picked up the cup of wine in front of him and downed it. “I had never noticed in the past that the wine of the Thousand Aroma Restaurant is actually this fine!”</p>
 <p>Revelation was now intoxicated, not from the wine, but from his emotions. Over the years, this was the most pleasant drink he had had. This was also the only time Bai Xiaofei had ever become drunk since entering Starnet Academy. While they were drinking, Rui Mengqi arrived with some medicine. When she discovered Bai Xiaofei was fine, she placed down the medicine then silently left the room.</p>
 <p>As of this moment, this room belonged to the master and disciple pair alone. By the time they staggered out of the restaurant, the sky was already dark. Revelation was as graceful as ever, and stepping onto his golden arrow, he flew away.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He was supposed to stay until Bai Xiaofei’s New Student Tournament was over. Unfortunately, he had suddenly received a message from the Revelation Pavilion that forced him to leave at an earlier date. Naturally, he did not forget to make Bai Xiaofei promise that he would be the New Student Tournament’s champion before leaving.</p>
 <p>Of course, Bai Xiaofei was definitely planning to become the champion. After all, several billion Amethyst Coins were on the line here. How could he allow that much money escape him?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After Revelation left, Bai Xiaofei did not return to room 807. Rather, he sat down in a corner of the public square and blankly stared at the night sky, sinking into deep thought. Both Huskie and Blackie were not around. It was unknown where they had gone to have fun. Having a master like Bai Xiaofei was definitely a stroke of good luck on their part. Very few animate puppets were granted as much freedom as Bai Xiaofei had granted them.</p>
 <p>“Are you homesick again?”</p>
 <p>Just when Bai Xiaofei felt like he could no longer hold in his emotions, Xue Ying’s familiar voice sounded behind him. Although he was drunk, he could still hear a trace of remorse in Xue Ying’s voice.</p>
 <p>“Would you believe me if I say I was missing you?” Now that he was drunk, Bai Xiaofei was much more courageous than before. He spoke so calmly that it was as if this was a completely normal conversation. The nervousness he would normally have whenever he flirted was nowhere to be seen.</p>
 <p>“I will believe anything you say,” Xue Ying said, slowly sitting down beside Bai Xiaofei. “Do you know that because of you, I also now have the habit of staring at the starry sky? I wonder if this is a healthy habit to have.”</p>
 <p>She spoke with a slight smile on her face. Under the moonlight she had an air of cold indifference about her, yet at the same time, this cold indifference had some sort of charm to it.</p>
 <p>“There are things we won’t know if they’re good or bad, like my departure from my home. Even now I am not sure if it was a good decision.” As he spoke with her, Bai Xiaofei’s intoxication started fading, and melancholy replaced it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“If it isn’t for the fact that you’re my student, I will never believe you’re only 16 years old. Every time I’m beside you, I have an inconceivable feeling that you seem to be the older one instead,” Xue Ying said after turning her head to gaze at Bai Xiaofei. This was the first time she had ever told him her inner thoughts like this.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei smiled bitterly and spoke in a self-mocking tone. “That’s probably because there were a lot of people with troubled minds back home. They had nobody to talk to, and as the only kid there, I became the only person they could talk to about their troubles. Slowly but surely, I came to know many things I shouldn’t have known.”</p>
 <p>There was a reason for Bai Xiaofei’s capability to perfectly juggle so many roles. A person who was innately a genius at controlling their own emotions did not exist. Such a person would only come into existence after experiencing many things themself.</p>
 <p>“Do you have anything troubling your mind at this moment? May I be your listener?” Xue Ying offered; then, she gulped and blushed. Nevertheless, she still resolutely gazed at Bai Xiaofei, waiting for him to turn his head and look at her.</p>
 <p>“Are you sure you want to be my listener?” Bai Xiaofei could clearly see Xue Ying’s expression. Instead of voicing his troubles, he had asked a seemingly pointless question.</p>
 <p>Xue Ying paused slightly before speaking, a trace of stubbornness creeping into her eyes. “I have never been a listener before, but I have a feeling I will be a good one.”</p>
 <p>“Let me first tell you a story.” Bai Xiaofei smiled and started speaking, unaware of the purple flash created by the jade bracelet Xue Ying was wearing on her right arm. “Once upon a time, there existed a place that was cut off from the rest of the world. The people there had been abandoned by the entire world. No people or place was willing to accept them. Therefore, this place that was cut off from the rest of the world – a place one could only enter and not leave – became their home. Even though their bodies had found a place to settle down, their minds could not find peace.</p>
 <p>“At this place that nobody could find, they lived on without any hope or goal. Some of them decided to kill themselves, while some continued to mindlessly live on because of the slight trace of attachment they still had towards this world.</p>
 <p>“One day, everything changed.”</p>
