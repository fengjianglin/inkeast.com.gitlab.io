 <p>“Master, there’s a situation at Illusion Demon!” Fang Ye rushed into Bai Xiaofei’s room, interrupting his conversation with Tong Fei. Fang Ye immediately apologized, “Sorry, Boss Tong, I didn’t know you were here.”</p> 
 <p>With that, he acted like he wanted to retreat.</p> 
 <p>“It’s nothing, we are just chatting. I’ll leave it to you two, it’s not good if I delay you from handling serious affairs.” Tong Fei tactfully kept Fang Ye and got up to leave. Although he wanted to know what they wanted to talk about, he did not have a reason to listen to others’ business secrets.</p> 
 <p>After Tong Fei left, Fang Ye took out a ball and activated it. An energy barrier covered Bai Xiaofei’s room. As they had to keep up their act to perfection, this kind of device that didn’t require origin energy to use had become a necessity for the group.</p> 
 <p>“How is it?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei knew full well that Fang Ye didn’t come to discuss Illusion Demon. Moreover, Fang Ye must have known that Tong Fei was in the room. He only used that excuse to make Tong Fei leave of his own will.</p> 
 <p>“That guy Heartless has been keeping a close eye on us, I think Tong Fei has been testing you as well. Moreover, Chen Hui found that ever since we arrived here, Heartless’s energy fluctuation has not stopped,” reported Fang Ye solemnly. Although their disguises had been very successful, no secret could be kept forever. There was no guarantee that Heartless would not find something if he kept a close watch on them.</p> 
 <p>“Then, give him a climax act to perfect the show and completely cut off their doubts.” Bai Xiaofei curled his lips.</p> 
 <p><em>What kind of play can we pull in this sh*tty place?!</em> Fang Ye was bewildered. However, his blank look immediately turned into disbelief as he suddenly realized something.</p> 
 <p>“You mean there is something wrong about those two rest stop guys!?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei nodded in approval. “Not bad, your brain is getting faster.” He grinned.</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye was embarrassed. <em>So I’ve always been a slowpoke in your impression, huh…</em></p> 
 <p>“What’s wrong about them and how can we use them?” Fang Ye could only guess the two rest stop men because they were the only variables in this place, but he could not guess what those variables were up to.</p> 
 <p>“I sent Blackie to check this station. The food stored here is only enough for those two. In other words, they have no intention of sharing it at all. No matter how deserted this place is, there will never be only two guards at a station. At the very least, there must be some kind of registration, but after we came here, they never mentioned anything like that. I thought that they forgot, but turns out it’s not the case. You can go to the kitchen and see what they are doing,” Bai Xiaofei explained. His eyes flashed with a sly glint.</p> 
 <p>“They are sharpening their knives?” Fang Ye was not stupid enough to really go to the kitchen and verify. He could guess from Bai Xiaofei’s information.</p> 
 <p>“Yeah. We are already being regarded as fat meat delivered to their mouths.” Saying the most horrifying words in the most nonchalant tone, Bai Xiaofei did not take the two rest stop men seriously at all. He even felt glad. If it weren’t for those two, he couldn’t have found a way to get Tong Fei’s complete trust.</p> 
 <p>“Then we…?” Fang Ye asked, still having no idea what Bai Xiaofei wanted to do.</p> 
 <p>“We wait. Tell everyone to prepare anti-toxins. We won’t move unless we have to!” said Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye was stunned. After thinking for a moment, his eyes lit up with thrill. “We’re borrowing their hand to kill that guy?”</p> 
 <p>“Heartless is Tong Fei’s right-hand man. As long as we get rid of him, Tong Fei can no longer find out anything. Don’t forget, he is not a puppet master.” Bai Xiaofei sneered. He was ready to help the two men in the rest stop.</p> 
 <p>“I’m going to inform everyone to prepare. But how can you guarantee that they will start from Heartless?” Fang Ye voiced his last concern.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei summoned Blackie. “No matter who they plan to start with, they will still be going for Heartless!”</p> 
 <p>Getting Bai Xiaofei’s reassurance, Fang Ye withdrew from the room feeling completely relieved.</p> 
 <p>Tong Fei did not seek Bai Xiaofei again, while Heartless was pulled into a drinking contest by Wang Hang and the guys.</p> 
 <p>At dinner, the fat and thin duo only took out some small dishes to fool them, and they were made unusually unpalatable. Fortunately, Chen Hui prepared a lot of food in his storage ring, sparing Duan Yiyi from a ‘Second Young Miss-style rage of fury’ act.</p> 
 <p>Night fell slowly. After having to spend days in the wild, everyone cherished this chance to sleep in bed very much, even though they had something to do that night…</p> 
 <p>As everyone’s breathing started to become regular, the fat and thin duo quietly got out of bed.</p> 
 <p>“Which one first?” whispered the thin man whose face was full of pockmarks.</p> 
 <p>“Handle those guards first. The rest are trash without them.” The fat man’s eyes rolled around craftily. He who was a little more professional was the decision-maker of the duo.</p> 
 <p>What the two did not notice was that when they felt their way towards Wang Hang’s room, the scenery around them distorted imperceptibly.</p> 
 <p>Getting to the door, the thin man inserted a small bamboo tube into one of the cracks on the plank walls. A wisp of smoke then slowly drifted into the room.</p> 
 <p>It was an old-fashioned method, but the smoke was not simple. It was a famous sedating gas from the southern border.</p> 
 <p>“That’s enough! One more blow and we’ll run out!” The fat man ruthlessly slapped the thin one before covering his nose and mouth with a cloth strip soaked with the antidote. Then, he knocked on the door. “Honored guests?”</p> 
 <p>After making sure there was no response, the two barged in with machetes in their hands.</p> 
 <p>Without any surprise, under the guidance of Bai Xiaofei, the room they invaded belonged to Heartless! Rushing to the bed, the fat man chopped down!</p> 
 <p>To his shock, however, when his machete was about to fall on Heartless’s neck, a pale-blue light suddenly rose from his body and sent it flying. The next second, the light shrank back into his body and cool energy flowed into his mind.</p> 
 <p>Watching this scene through Blackie’s eyes, Bai Xiaofei was surprised.</p> 
 <p><em>Trigger-type puppet! That’s rare stuff!</em></p>
