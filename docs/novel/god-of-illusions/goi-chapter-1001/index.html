 <p>Chapter 1001: Bet?</p> 
 <p>Half a month flew by as the men learned under the ‘intimate’ guidance of Bai Xiaofei. No, wait… It flew by for Bai Xiaofei, but for Zhuang Shuo’s group, every second felt like an eternity. Their boss showed them what hell and a devil looked like. Therefore, after the special training officially ended, the 600-odd men celebrated for a whole night!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was probably the only person in the whole Moonlight Empire who dared to ‘torture’ six hundred people with status. And, unlike his men, he did not get a celebration banquet, but a summons from Qingcheng.</p> 
 <p>As soon as Bai Xiaofei entered Ye Qingcheng’s room, she pointed to a thick stack of court reports with a look of ‘I just want to die.’</p> 
 <p>“Look at this. If you didn’t return, I would have to have these delivered to you.”</p> 
 <p>Laughing awkwardly, Bai Xiaofei walked to the stack of scrolls and opened several of them, clicking his tongue as he read.</p> 
 <p>“Unbelievable, so many people have been paying attention to us when we were at such a remote place. Looks like we’re getting famous,” he commented with pride in his voice, successfully making Ye Qingcheng angry.</p> 
 <p>“You’re still laughing?! If I hadn’t been shouldering all the pressure, over a dozen generals would have gone to find you for disappearing with the best military resources for half a month! Do you know how many people want to take this opportunity to trample you into the mud?!” Ye Qingcheng said icily.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately donned an ingratiating smile. “Aren’t I back now? Just leave the rest to me.” He patted his chest and hurriedly changed the subject, “What’s the situation now? Has there been any reaction from the Sacks?”</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei became serious, Ye Qingcheng’s anger also calmed down.</p> 
 <p>“So far, they have done nothing except for a small-scale test, so the progress on our side has been quite smooth. At present, there are only six routes connecting the Sacks to us, the rest have been sealed off. All troops from the fortresses at the rear have been mobilized to expand control over all areas in the direction of the enemy,” she informed him in detail.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei nodded. It was obvious from her arrangements that she understood his advice quite deeply.</p> 
 <p>“If I’m not wrong, you’ve encountered some obstacles,” he suddenly said.</p> 
 <p>Then, he saw Ye Qingcheng freeze with a troubled expression, which made him laugh.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, after the Sacks discovered our actions, they quickly responded. Along the only way we will have to go through, they built several temporary bases. Although we haven’t made contact with them yet, we can’t avoid them forever.” Ye Qingcheng rubbed her temples as she mentioned the matter that had been bothering her the past several days. Compared to this, the denunciation from the generals toward Bai Xiaofei could only be regarded as a trifle.</p> 
 <p>“Right! Those who want to seek me for trouble are all at Divine Light right now, aren’t they?”</p> 
 <p>Just when Ye Qingcheng thought that Bai Xiaofei would help her think of a solution, he returned to the previous topic. It was so sudden that she was stunned for a while.</p> 
 <p>“What do you mean?” She stared at him with a frown.</p> 
 <p>“Isn’t it obvious? At present, only these two things are troubling you, so why not handle them together?” Bai Xiaofei looked at Ye Qingcheng with pity in his eyes.</p> 
 <p>The look made Ye Qingcheng want to bite Bai Xiaofei to death, but she had no excuse. Who else could she blame for not thinking of this?</p> 
 <p><em>But you could just have said it directly!</em></p> 
 <p>“Half a month no see and your audacity took a whole leap. You’ve recovered well from your mental trauma, huh?” Not knowing how else she could get even, she brought up an old matter. <em>Don’t forget that I guided you out of it! You better watch your attitude!</em></p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, she didn’t know much about Bai Xiaofei, who was notorious for burning bridges…</p> 
 <p>“When was that? How can an optimistic person like me suffer from mental trauma? I’m afraid you’re mistaken. As for what you said about ‘audacity,’ it’s confidence, alright? It’s audacity when talking nonsense without knowledge, while having confidence is when one has real talent and knowledge!” Bai Xiaofei said with a straight face.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Ye Qingcheng’s expression sank. “Fine, then let’s see where your confidence comes from. I’ll give you a week. If you can’t solve both of these problems in a week, I will ‘unman’ you!” Her lips curled up into a dark sneer, clearly already considering who to find to operate on Bai Xiaofei’s ‘little man.’</p> 
 <p>“One week is enough, just wait for my good news,” declared Bai Xiaofei as he walked to her table.</p> 
 <p>As the distance between them decreased, Ye Qingcheng instinctively widened her eyes and gulped.</p> 
 <p>“What… what are you doing?!” she questioned.</p> 
 <p>With a wide smile, Bai Xiaofei grabbed the bowl of fruits on the table and put it into his storage ring.</p> 
 <p>“It’s a waste to leave these Crystal’s Longings uneaten. Since I’ve always done a great job at sharing Your Majesty’s worries, of course I also have to solve this problem for you. No need to thank me, I’ll be seeing myself out now!”</p> 
 <p>With that, he speedily fled from the room.</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingcheng stared at the empty table in shock. Then, a dragon roar echoed from the main keep.</p> 
 <p>“FICKLE BAI!! JUST YOU WAIT!!!”</p> 
 <p>The reason why the Crystal’s Longings had been sitting on her table was because she couldn’t bear to eat them!</p> 
 <p>Running all the way back to his base camp and seeing Zhuang Shuo’s group, Bai Xiaofei was once again the demonic instructor.</p> 
 <p>“You didn’t slack off while I was away, did you?” he lightly asked.</p> 
 <p>Zhuang Shuo instantly sprang up, cold sweat seeping out from his forehead.</p> 
 <p>“Report… reporting… to Boss, we… we…”</p> 
 <p>“Are you stupid? This is resting time. Isn’t resting time for slacking off?” Tan Xin jumped out and knuckled Zhuang Shuo on the head.</p> 
 <p>Zhuang Shuo actually giggled in delight and relief. “Ah! Yes! We are resting! Boss, we are having a rest!”</p> 
 <p>Seeing him like this, Bai Xiaofei reluctantly shook his head. <em>Half a month still wasn’t enough to help this group of fools improve their thinking ability. Not only so, but they also seem to have become even more foolish!</em></p> 
 <p>“How come you returned so soon? That fox didn’t keep you for a long, enlightening talk this time?” Tan Xin circled around Bai Xiaofei, her eyes piercing.</p> 
 <p>“If you let those people outside hear this, we will struggle to leave Moonlight alive,” Bai Xiaofei retorted.</p> 
 <p>However, Tan Xin didn’t care. “Ask yourself first, can you accept it if I die here?” she said. And upon seeing that her question rendered him speechless, she revealed a proud smile before getting to the main topic. “Spill it, what’s the trouble this time?”</p> 
 <p>Zhuang Shuo pricked up his ears. Every member of the Fickle Bai Army was longing for the battlefield now. At the very least, they would not let their two weeks’ training go to waste!</p> 
 <p>“Can’t be called trouble. At best, it’s…”</p> 
 <p>“Fickle Bai!”</p> 
 <p>A loud voice interrupted Bai Xiaofei. He looked over and saw three armor-clad generals followed by a large number of soldiers angrily striding toward him.</p> 
 <p><em>So quick?</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was inwardly surprised because he had just got back!</p> 
 <p>“Generals, what can I do for you?” Bai Xiaofei looked composed, but next to him, Zhuang Shuo and Tan Xin were visibly alarmed.</p> 
 <p>“You should know what we’re here for. In order not to affect the morale of the army, you’d better take your people out of here. We’ve arranged a place for you by the fortress, and that’s where you should go,” said a general, her meaning was obvious –</p> 
 <p><em>You people have done nothing but eat, so make room for those who actually work and get out of here!</em></p> 
 <p>“Then you should also know why Her Majesty summoned you all here. Want us to go? Fine. But you have to prove that there are others who are more qualified to enjoy this treatment than us.” Bai Xiaofei smiled faintly.</p> 
 <p>The three generals snorted almost in unison.</p> 
 <p>“It’s up to you to decide when, where, how many people, and the content of the competition. If we can’t beat you, our troops will dissolve on the spot!”</p> 
 <p>The speaking general was aggressive, but she couldn’t be blamed. After all, in the eyes of most people here, men were still the representation of cannon fodder. While the record of the battle at Savage Wolf Ridge had been verified, many still refused to acknowledge it as the achievement of Bai Xiaofei’s group.</p> 
 <p>“We’re all people of Moonlight, there’s no need for infighting. So…” Bai Xiaofei said.</p> 
 <p>The contempt on the faces of the generals deepened. <em>Chickening out already?!</em></p> 
 <p>“The Sacks’ temporary fortresses have been a hindrance to our plan. In seven days, whoever takes down more of them will be the winner. If we win, I don’t need you to disband, but you have to declare something out loud in front of everyone –”</p> 
 <p>Pausing briefly, Bai Xiaofei’s expression grew cold.</p> 
 <p>“The Fickle Army is the best!”</p>
