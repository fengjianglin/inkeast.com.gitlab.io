 <p>Chapter 894: Imperial Guard Overseer!</p> 
 <p>“Smelly boy, good job!”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Bai Xiaofei walked out of the imperial study, Lan He excitedly came up to him. There were few people who could make the Ethereal emperor fancy them so.</p> 
 <p>“Gramps, spare me your sarcasm. I have something to do. The emperor asked you if you have had enough eavesdropping and if you have, go in for a drink with him,” Bai Xiaofei teased.</p> 
 <p>Lan He coughed in embarrassment and hurriedly changed the subject, “Go and do your stuff then. I’m gonna catch up with my old friend. Just a little piece of advice, the Imperial Guard is very special!”</p> 
 <p>With that, Lan He fled into the study and saved himself from Bai Xiaofei’s ridicule.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei pondered. <em>What does he mean by special?</em></p> 
 <p>In the imperial study,</p> 
 <p>As soon as Lan He sat down, the emperor laughed. “You recommend a good person for the job. I think I can rest easy now.”</p> 
 <p>“I told you long ago, you just didn’t believe my judgment. We’ve known each other for so many years, when have you ever seen me miss?” Lan He smugly said.</p> 
 <p>“Oh, you’ve never missed?” the emperor asked.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t mention that thing to me, or I’m not drinking with you,” said Lan He coldly with a serious face.</p> 
 <p>However, the emperor wasn’t fazed. “Are you sure? This friend of yours doesn’t have many days left.” The emperor used his ‘advantage’ to provoke Lan He. During this period, he knew he could be completely unbridled with his friend.</p> 
 <p>And it worked quite well. Lan He’s temper immediately dissipated.</p> 
 <p>“However, I know you see it too. There are some differences in appearance, but their personalities are too similar. Moreover, I heard that Qiushuang is very concerned about this child,” the emperor picked another fatal matter to bring up.</p> 
 <p>To his surprise, Lan He did not react intensely.</p> 
 <p>“Even so, many years have passed. He is already dead and Tianhe has grown up. Many things have become bygones, why would I spend so long bothering myself over something so trivial, right? I’m old now, I just want to quietly watch them live their lives,” said Lan He open-mindedly with a hint of helplessness.</p> 
 <p>“You are right, we are all old. It’s now the world of young people,” the emperor agreed with a smile.</p> 
 <p>Thus, the two old men no longer bothered with Bai Xiaofei’s identity…</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei was heading to his new destination: the Imperial Guard camp, which was right inside the palace grounds!</p> 
 <p>This was one of the reasons why the Ethereal steel guard was so famous – the Ethereal emperor’s trust in them!</p> 
 <p>At the end of their conversation, the Ethereal emperor had given Bai Xiaofei an additional new identity: Imperial Guard Overseer. To put it simply, he now had the right to mobilize this army, second to only the emperor!</p> 
 <p>High-spirited was no longer enough to describe Bai Xiaofei. He was on cloud nine!</p> 
 <p>However, what greeted him at the entrance of the Imperial Guard camp were two daggers pressed at his throat and his heart respectively, without him noticing anything at all. At the same time, two figures appeared on his left and right side.</p> 
 <p>“Didn’t anyone tell you this is a forbidden area?” coldly said the guard who held the dagger at Bai Xiaofei’s throat. However, he learned the next moment how fatal talking nonsense could be.</p> 
 <p>The temperature quickly rose before Bai Xiaofei turned into a burst of fire, forcing the two guards to retreat. Before they could steady themselves, two long fire blades were pointed at their foreheads.</p> 
 <p>“Didn’t anyone tell you to measure your strength before you start a fight?” Bai Xiaofei returned coldly while taking out the token and the letter of appointment given to him by the emperor. “Although you aren’t very polite, it doesn’t matter. From today on, I will train you well. No matter how mighty you think you are before, remember that you are a part of Ethereal and not privileged troops!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei finally understood what Lan He meant by ‘special.’ The fact these guards only answered to the Ethereal emperor had made them forget their place.</p> 
 <p>Moreover, he could now imagine how hateful this group of people would be. <em>Ah, it seems I have taken more trouble upon myself!</em></p> 
 <p>With that thought, Bai Xiaofei dragged the two guards up, his face ruthless.</p> 
 <p>“You can’t hear? Or do you want to continue ‘dueling’ with me? Let me tell you in advance, I know no such thing as ‘restraint’ during a fight!”</p> 
 <p>His vicious tone made the two guards tremble. Recalling the terrifying energy that had just erupted from him, they chickened out. This was not a character that they could handle!</p> 
 <p>“Master, we know our wrongs! However, this needs to go through our leader first.” The two clever guards immediately kicked the ball to their superior.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei could tell from their tone that their so-called leader was a tricky one.</p> 
 <p>“Then take me to him. If I can’t see him today, you lot don’t need to rest either,” Bai Xiaofei commanded with a murderous look.</p> 
 <p>The two guards trembled again. <em>This is a cruel one!</em></p> 
 <p>Out of fear, the two guards took Bai Xiaofei into the camp, becoming the focus of attention along the way. During this, Bai Xiaofei also noticed the two men making secret signals, but he pretended that he hadn’t seen anything.</p> 
 <p>Before long, the three arrived at the leader’s room. Although it looked very low-key, after the door opened and Bai Xiaofei entered, he froze.</p> 
 <p><em>Damnit, this one is a local tyrant!</em></p> 
 <p>The resplendent room was in stark contrast to the simplicity of the emperor’s study. The decoration in this room alone gave Bai Xiaofei a ‘very good’ impression of this leader.</p> 
 <p>“Master, as you can see, our leader is absent.” The two guards looked quite pitiful.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s reaction surprised them. He ordered, “Inform everyone to gather, I will do a roll call. I have already spoken to His Majesty and he has passed down a decree that in the next two weeks, the Imperial Guard isn’t responsible for guarding the palace, so don’t give me any excuses!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the two guards exchanged glances, not knowing what to do.</p> 
 <p>“Get a move on or die, you choose!”</p>
