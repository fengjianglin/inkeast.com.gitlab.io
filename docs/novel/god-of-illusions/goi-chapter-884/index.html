 <p>Chapter 884: General Bai!</p> 
 <p>The spectators were stunned to see Bai Xiaofei give up the first move, but Feng Yin was not one bit careless. He didn’t sense any nervousness from Bai Xiaofei at all and did not think he was pretending to be calm.</p> 
 <p>As Feng Yin’s origin energy surged, a huge chain knife appeared in his hand. At the same time, a domineering full armor set appeared, turning him into a tank.</p> 
 <p>Heavy, this was the first thing that Bai Xiaofei thought of after seeing his outfit. However, that idea was quickly proved to be wrong.</p> 
 <p>The armor morphed and two huge boosters appeared at Feng Yin’s back and spewed flames. The only thing Bai Xiaofei saw was a blurry figure before he was hit with the pain of being rammed flying.</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei flew backward, Feng Yin threw out the chain knife. The barb on the blade hooked Bai Xiaofei while a small booster appeared at the tip of the knife and fired, jerking the knife back toward Feng Yin. Using that momentum, Feng Yin rammed him into the ground.</p> 
 <p>Exclamations and praises for Feng Yin’s sharp combo attack rang out around the field, but Feng Yin himself was frowning.</p> 
 <p><em>It can’t be this simple!</em></p> 
 <p>Staring intently at Bai Xiaofei on the ground, Feng Yin was highly strung…</p> 
 <p>Which was exactly what Bai Xiaofei wanted.</p> 
 <p>“Demonic fire of resentment!”</p> 
 <p>No one knew how Bai Xiaofei appeared behind Feng Yin, not only uninjured but also able to freeze Feng Yin and then press a long saber against his neck.</p> 
 <p>“Omnidirectional outbreak!”</p> 
 <p>However, the frozen Feng Yin still retained his ability to act. He fired the two huge boosters to parry the demonic fire of resentment. Therefore, what was frozen was only part of his origin energy.</p> 
 <p>The violent explosion kicked up a skyful of dust, under the cover of which Feng Yin quickly broke away from Bai Xiaofei with a fanatical expression.</p> 
 <p>“Mimicry and Virtual Reality, huh? I actually get to see the strongest combination of the Illusion Stream while I’m still alive. Moreover, you were able to use Virtual Reality so quietly and seamlessly that it deceived my eyes.” Feng Yin was not a general for nothing. After only one round, he had already figured out Bai Xiaofei’s ability.</p> 
 <p>“General Feng guessed correctly. However…” Bai Xiaofei smiled, his body suddenly fading. “What just attacked you is not my real body!”</p> 
 <p>The last sentence rang out from behind Feng Yin. At the same time, Bai Xiaofei chopped his hand at Feng Yin’s neck. The wind accompanying it alone made Feng Yin feel a terrifying threat. Without any hesitation, he fired the boosters and dodged while tossing out his chain knife at Bai Xiaofei behind.</p> 
 <p>The moment when the knife connected, Bai Xiaofei’s body turned into a stone statue.</p> 
 <p>With Mind Sunder joining his puppet team, Virtual Reality had become much more flexible. Combining Huskie’s ability to leave marks, Bai Xiaofei could even attack with his fake bodies like just now. Meanwhile, Blackie’s ability to reign over a wide terrain coupled with Mind Sunder’s ability to change elemental memory could make even hard stone as soft as a human body.</p> 
 <p>The three puppets allowed Bai Xiaofei to walk a completely new path in the Illusion Stream, a path that could allow him to toy with anyone at will!</p> 
 <p>“Boss, let me help you!!” Seeing Feng Yin being bullied, Chu Yuanhang was unable to stand still. He summoned his puppet and jumped into the fight.</p> 
 <p>The first one to join was him not because he was stronger than the remaining, but because his ability could restrain the Illusion Stream to a certain extent. His core puppet was called Primitive Field. Within a certain range around him, any element would be returned to its original state and could not be used or changed. In short, he could create a field where puppet skills were useless!</p> 
 <p>Feng Yin did not refuse Chu Yuanhang as he had a clear judgment of himself. If he continued to be worn down by Bai Xiaofei like this, he would lose. His puppet was extremely strong, but at the same time, so was its consumption. Prolonged battles were not his forte.</p> 
 <p>As soon as Chu Yuanhang joined the field, Blackie gave feedback to Bai Xiaofei about the limited areas in her environment. With a sigh, Bai Xiaofei, who hadn’t moved at all since the beginning of the duel, descended from mid-air.</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t expect any of you guys to have this kind of ability,” he commented.</p> 
 <p>Seeing the real Bai Xiaofei landing, Feng Yin’s face sank. The fact that he had been trading blows with only illusions for so long and was nearly handled…</p> 
 <p>“Your illusion ability is really strong, but without it, you will have nothing!” Chu Yuanhang stared at Bai Xiaofei. Although he had limited Bai Xiaofei’s ability, he could not relax at all.</p> 
 <p>“Then, come give it a try!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei chortled and his purple wings on his back glowed. As they flapped, he shot at Chu Yuanhang like a bullet.</p> 
 <p>In fact, Bai Xiaofei had wanted to teleport, but he had found out that he couldn’t use any abilities when he activated his puppets. Still, his speed alone was already terrifying.</p> 
 <p>Chu Yuanhang, however, smiled.</p> 
 <p>“You are still too young!”</p> 
 <p>When Chu Yuanhang’s voice dropped, Bai Xiaofei, who had entered his field, suddenly slowed!</p> 
 <p>Chu Yuanhang’s field not only silenced skills but also exercised a control effect upon the enemy. He had started following Feng Yin when the latter was still a small captain and they had always been promoted together. Over the years, he had been Feng Yin’s shadow, and in order to be the best shadow possible, he even chose puppets that could support Feng Yin!</p> 
 <p>After Bai Xiaofei’s speed was forcibly slowed, Feng Yin tossed out his knife to hook Bai Xiaofei and shot at him with a puppet attack.</p> 
 <p>“Fix!” Feng Yin shouted.</p> 
 <p>Chu Yuanhang’s field could freely open or close. Years of cooperation allowed him and Feng Yin to reach the degree where their minds connected. Once Feng Yin started using his skills, the original field was absolutely closed!</p> 
 <p>Just when everyone thought that there was absolutely no way for Bai Xiaofei to resist, a shocking scene happened. He parried the attack with one hand and grasped the knife in the other! Everyone thought he was fixed in place, but in fact, he had deliberately stayed motionless and then stopped Feng Yin’s puppet skill with raw strength alone! </p> 
 <p><em>Is he still human?! Moreover, he can keep up with General Feng Yin’s speed? How is he a puppet master of the Illusion Stream?!</em></p> 
 <p>Everyone was shocked silly, while it was only the beginning for Bai Xiaofei. He slammed Feng Yin with a shoulder throw, and before Feng Yin could recover, he grabbed him and swung him at Chu Yuanhang. With a heavy sound, Chu Yuanhang flew backward with Feng Yin. At the same time, Bai Xiaofei rushed at the two.</p> 
 <p>At that moment, two roars resounded as Hong Liang and Shen Kuo dashed over.</p> 
 <p>Shen Kuo was an Onslaught Stream Grandmaster Rank puppet master, and Hong Liang was a Grandmaster Rank martial artist who could be compared to an Exquisite rank puppet master! In order to suppress Bai Xiaofei’s strong melee ability, both of them joined the fray. Shen Kuo caught Feng Yin and Chu Yuanhang while Hong Liang dashed toward Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>A martial artist’s attack could be summed up in three points: Strength, speed, and skill.</p> 
 <p>Hong Liang felt that he had reached the peak of those three points. At least, he never thought that one day, he would be suppressed by an Illusion Stream puppet master on all three points!</p> 
 <p>This was no longer called a fight, but being beaten unilaterally!</p> 
 <p>However, Hong Liang was indeed the strongest melee fighter among his group. At least, he was able to stall Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>It didn’t take long for Shen Kuo to join the beating, but because of Chu Yuanhang’s field, all he could do was share the number of punches taken.</p> 
 <p>“Let us join in too!”</p> 
 <p>Seeing as their comrades were about to lose, Qian Ning, Gan Fang, and Zhao Youyu jumped in, making what Bai Xiaofei had said at the beginning a reality.</p> 
 <p>The group didn’t even realize this reality. They only had one thing on their mind – beat Bai Xiaofei!</p> 
 <p>The three new joiners were all Ranged Stream puppet masters. Bai Xiaofei immediately felt uncomfortable when they attacked. His puppets could not be used while theirs could fire at will as Chu Yuanhang, the key figure, was well protected by Feng Yin.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei was only a little uncomfortable, which had Feng Yin’s group floored.</p> 
 <p><em>He… Is he really human?!</em></p> 
 <p>Elemental attacks had no effect on Bai Xiaofei, while gun attacks became physical attacks after he absorbed all the energy in them, causing only insignificant injuries.</p> 
 <p>Not only that, they found another problem: Bai Xiaofei’s physical strength!</p> 
 <p>Any puppet master would have been exhausted and beaten down after being surrounded by so many puppet masters, but Bai Xiaofei’s pace was not even messed up!</p> 
 <p>Gradually, when Feng Yin’s group started to pant, the soldiers watching the fight were all dumbstruck as Bai Xiaofei looked like he was still at his peak state.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s count this as a tie.” Bai Xiaofei suddenly stopped and looked at Feng Yin with a smile. “I know that you all definitely still have cards in reserve. As far as a friendly duel is concerned, this is enough, right?”</p> 
 <p>Feng Yin’s group immediately followed this ‘ladder’ to step down.</p> 
 <p>“General Bai is right, let’s call it a draw,” Feng Yin concluded the fight and once again addressed Bai Xiaofei as General Bai.</p> 
 <p>The first time was courtesy, but this time, it was sincere recognition!</p>
