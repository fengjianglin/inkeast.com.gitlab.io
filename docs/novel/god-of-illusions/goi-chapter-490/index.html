 <p>Chapter 490: 1 vs 16!</p> 
 <p>The pain and danger that he imagined didn’t come. As Bai Xiaofei slowly fuelled Endless State, his body had a positive response, the kind of feeling that it had been looking forward to this day for a long time!</p> 
 <p>The first that responded was Lunisolar Brilliance that had been quiet ever since ranking up. The activation of Endless State was like a spark. Bai Xiaofei didn’t need to do anything and the technique had already started to activate.</p> 
 <p>And that was just the beginning. After Lunisolar Brilliance was his origin core.</p> 
 <p>This scared Bai Xiaofei, but fortunately, the pink energy that always made an appearance at the wrong time was very obedient this time.</p> 
 <p>For a long time after most of the energy of the Nirvana Pearl had been absorbed by the origin core, Bai Xiaofei had never found a way to effectively mobilize this energy and had been passively waiting for treatment, the effect of which wasn’t good. But now it was different. Under the stimulation of Endless State, his origin core released that energy!</p> 
 <p>With the joint activation of Lunisolar Brilliance and the origin core, he not only lost nothing because of Endless State but even pried out an incomparably powerful energy. That energy strengthened his body little by little with the help of Endless State!</p> 
 <p>His physical body that had reached the power of a Martial Master finally took the next step and began to march towards the Grand Martial Master Rank, and that was only the tip of the iceberg!</p> 
 <p>With Endless State fully activated, Bai Xiaofei discovered another change that made him almost jump in joy.</p> 
 <p>According to Gu Xing, Endless State would constantly absorb external energy, but the energy couldn’t be stored and could only be used directly or to strengthen the body. However, Bai Xiaofei’s origin core could take in this energy. In other words, he could store it!</p> 
 <p>To sum it up, the activation of Endless State also activated a complete circulatory system in Bai Xiaofei’s body. This system constantly built up his origin energy and body, and at present, there were no side effects at all!</p> 
 <p>As delightful as a flower blossom, Bai Xiaofei slowly opened his eyes and was struck dumb.</p> 
 <p><em>What the?! Why are there so many people?!</em></p> 
 <p>Looking around, the originally empty training field was currently filled with people. Everyone was staring at Bai Xiaofei with hungry eyes…</p> 
 <p>“He finally woke up!”</p> 
 <p>“The duel can start, right?!”</p> 
 <p>“You guys have no reason to stop us now!”</p> 
 <p>“……”</p> 
 <p>With the opening of Bai Xiaofei’s eyes, the crowd broke into a commotion. In fact, if it wasn’t for Hu Xian’er and Chu Liuyun, he would have already been woken up long ago.</p> 
 <p>“Sorry to have kept you waiting, everyone. Those who have passed the first two conditions can step up.”</p> 
 <p>Once Bai Xiaofei opened his mouth, the crowd quieted down. Then, one after another, confident-looking students stepped out. After counting, there were a total of 16…</p> 
 <p>After they made simple introductions, Bai Xiaofei basically understood the goals of these people.</p> 
 <p>Four were after Hu Xian’er, three were after Chu Liuyun, six were after the Leng triplets, two were after Lin Li, and one was after Luo Han.</p> 
 <p>Aside from Qin Lingyan, who nobody dared to chase after, and Xue Ying, who nobody was shameless enough to, the others were all targeted. Bai Xiaofei had to admire these guys’ financial resources. All of the girls were high on the rankings. Whether it was the first requirement of Starnet Stones or the second requirement of Blossom Tickets, it was a huge expense.</p> 
 <p>But now, Bai Xiaofei was going to reap the harvest!</p> 
 <p><em>No matter how much money you spent, I’ll stop you all here today!</em></p> 
 <p>Of the 16 people, none was a Grandmaster, but none were below the second grade of the Master Rank. The weakest one was already a second-year senior.</p> 
 <p>The students in the same year as Bai Xiaofei didn’t dare to stand up at all. The pressure of facing him was too heavy. However, this didn’t affect their fancy for watching a show! Everyone was looking forward to watching the seeming underdog Bai Xiaofei dominate all. 1 versus 16, just thinking about it alone made them feverish!</p> 
 <p>“Guys, we can start when you’re ready.” Looking at the group of people surrounding him in the center, Bai Xiaofei not only had no regrets but was even a little excited.</p> 
 <p><em>This is exactly what I want! Absolute combat power!</em></p> 
 <p>As long as he won this game, he would no longer have to helplessly watch a battle in a daze like in Ancient Yue!</p> 
 <p>“Then pardon my offense!” a senior of the Sword of Assault who was armed to the teeth announced in a low voice. The next second, he rushed straight to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Rushing at the same time as him were three puppet masters of the Melee Stream!</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei also moved. A pair of purple wings unfolded at his back, Bai Xiaofei instantly appeared behind a senior of the Ranged Stream and his clenched right fist punched at the latter’s nape.</p> 
 <p>However, this senior was nothing to look down at. He launched his puppet and an illusion replaced him. Bai Xiaofei’s fist went through the illusion.</p> 
 <p>Then, a bombardment from several people landed at the spot where Bai Xiaofei appeared. However, he only dodged the physical ones and simply allowed the energy ones to fall on himself!</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, everyone watching was shocked.</p> 
 <p><em>He wants to die?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Not avoiding a group of attacks?!</em></p> 
 <p>But they knew they got it wrong right in the next second. It wasn’t that Bai Xiaofei was stupid, but that there was no need to hide. When all the energy attacks fell on him, they didn’t even cause a spark before they were absorbed by the passive ability of Endless State!</p> 
 <p>As the attacks turned into a surge of energy that poured into his body, Bai Xiaofei raised his right fist at a Melee Stream senior that was coming at him again. The energy that was just absorbed was converted into origin energy and gushed out!</p> 
 <p>This kind of pure force attack was something all puppet masters who had reached the Master Rank were capable of, but very few would actually use it. It was a waste of energy compared to using puppet skills.</p> 
 <p>However, wasteful did not mean weak!</p> 
 <p>The approaching senior didn’t expect that Bai Xiaofei would use such a move. He hurriedly put up a defensive barrier but still failed to change the result of being sent flying by the punch.</p> 
 <p>After blowing away the senior, Bai Xiaofei continued to pursue and bolted towards him in mid-air!</p> 
 <p>“Aid him!” Another person rushed up, and a ray of light connected him to the flying senior. In the next three seconds, both of them would be immune to all attacks.</p> 
 <p>It was a brilliant cooperation move to play, especially when they didn’t know each other. Unfortunately, he made a mistake.</p> 
 <p>Originally Bai Xiaofei was indeed set on taking down the first senior right away. However, he had the ability to change his momentum at any time. Teleportation was once again used, and Bai Xiaofei appeared behind the Ranged Stream senior who had escaped earlier. This time, he wouldn’t be able to escape!</p> 
 <p>The higher the rank of a puppet, the shorter the cooldown of its abilities. Bai Xiaofei took advantage of the Purple Luan’s rank to dominate his opponents.</p> 
 <p><em>Bam!</em> The targeted senior was sent flying. Even though Bai Xiaofei didn’t use his full force, the attack hit a vital and rendered the senior unconscious.</p> 
 <p>The first KO!</p>
