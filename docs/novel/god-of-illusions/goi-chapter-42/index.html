 <p>Grrr~</p>
 <p>Amidst the long wait, Bai Xiaofei’s stomach had already started reminding him to replenish its energy, but Xue Ying who seemed to be extremely excited had utterly no intention of letting him leave.</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Xue, the Principal might not be coming, right? Why don’t we go have something to eat first? It’s my treat!” Bai Xiaofei patted his chest and showed rare generosity. After all, he’d just gotten a windfall earlier….</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, Xue Ying had entirely no intention of appreciating this kindness.</p>
 <p>“If the Principal isn’t coming, then Little Li’Li and Xu Chen have to return right? Wait obediently. I’ll skin you alive if you make another noise!” Xue Ying turned around and glared fiercely at Bai Xiaofei before looking once more at the path that led to the classroom, and the anticipation on her face was at least three levels higher when compared to the time she was waiting for the students yesterday.</p>
 <p>“Old Hag! Once I’m f*cking capable of defeating you, I’ll absolutely not pull out your skin but only pull off your clothes!” Bai Xiaofei muttered in a tiny voice before falling weakly onto the chair that had been brought out earlier, and he rubbed his stomach without end.</p>
 <p>Every time this occurred, Bai Xiaofei would regret believing the words of his Fourth Father. The World Devourer technique did indeed possess numerous benefits, but it caused Bai Xiaofei to get hungry much more easily than a normal person, and it felt extremely terrible once he became hungry….</p>
 <p>Luckily, the heavens weren’t blind, and there was activity on the path towards the classroom right when Bai Xiaofei felt he was on the verge of going mad with hunger.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei directly bounced off the chair while carrying curiosity in his heart.</p>
 <p>He looked towards the distance and saw an old man that looked no different to a next door old man carrying a grin on his face while walking towards the classroom. Following close behind him were Lin Li and Xu Chen who were extremely ill at ease, and when he looked further behind the two of them, he saw an outrageous fat bald man. Merely a single glance caused Bai Xiaofei to not just feel his hunger subside, he even had the impulse to vomit.</p>
 <p>“The person in the front is the Principal, Lei Shan, and he’s at the peak of the Legend Rank. He obtained the name Thunder Emperor while roaming the continent in his youth. Presently, he’s basically in a state of retirement, and no one has seen him fight in at least 20 years.” Xue Ying who stood by Bai Xiaofei’s side introduced in a low voice, and Xue Ying’s face was filled with detest when she saw the fatty.</p>
 <p>“That fatty is the chairman of the new students in the academy, Fei Guangshi, a fat pervert. When I was a candidate to become a teacher, this fellow actually wanted me to come to see him at night, and that’s why I directly made the report about you to the Principal. I never imagined that he has actually come along.” When she spoke of Fei Guangshi, the disdain in Xue Ying’s voice showed on her face as well, and her tone sounded as if she wished for nothing more than to cripple him.</p>
 <p>“Fei Guangshi? Does he have a son?” Bai Xiaofei thought of Fei Gou at the first possible moment, and he instinctively related the two of them. Coupled with their body sizes being similar….</p>
 <p>“Who knows. How could I have the mood to find out about him when I don’t even have enough time to avoid him?”</p>
 <p>The two of them hadn’t spoken much when Lei Shan’s group had already approached the classroom, and Xue Ying hurriedly brought Bai Xiaofei along to greet them.</p>
 <p>“Hello, Grandpa Lei.”</p>
 <p>“Hello, Principal.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei and Xue Ying spoke at practically the exact same moment. But, Bai Xiaofei had played a little trick that caused even Xue Ying to be stunned as she never imagined that Bai Xiaofei would actually be shameless to such an extent when striking up relationships….</p>
 <p>But, she had no choice but to admire him because Lei Shan seemed to fairly enjoy being called ‘Grandpa Lei’, and the smile on his face grew slightly deeper.</p>
 <p>“Little Fellow, you aren’t bad. You’re extremely spirited and have my style from all those years ago.”</p>
 <p>As soon as Lei Shan spoke, everyone thought in their hearts in unison. <i>Are they hitting off right from the beginning?</i></p>
 <p>“Exactly, exactly. I noticed once Principal said this that Young Brother Bai is really a great talent.” Fei Guangshi that followed at the back was extremely afraid of being unable to put in a word, and he forcefully gave out a wave of flattery that allowed even Bai Xiaofei to benefit.</p>
 <p>“How can I compare with you, Grandpa Lei? I just rely on unorthodox methods yet I heard Grandpa Lei was the real thing all those years ago.” Bai Xiaofei had never been convinced of anyone’s superiority when it came to flattery.</p>
 <p>“That was the past, the past. Now I’m old and useless, and I’m only able to retire and dawdle through my days in this valley. I’m not young, full of energy, and possessing ample opportunities like all of you.” Lei Shan roared with laughter and Bai Xiaofei’s disposition seemed to conform to his own.</p>
 <p>“Principal, let’s go in and speak. There’ll be more and more people here soon, and it won’t be convenient to speak.” These words of Xue Ying’s were purely for the sake of making an excuse to drag the Principal into the classroom because besides snakes, insects, rats, and ants, there was basically no living thing that would come over to a desolate place like the Savage Class….</p>
 <p>“Alright, then let’s go in.” Lei Shan’s voice was clear and powerful, and it was utterly impossible to discern that he was an old man over the age of 100.</p>
 <p>Xue Ying instantly led the way, and she lightly knocked Bai Xiaofei while passing him before pointing unnoticeably at the wooden door of the class that had just been kicked into pieces by Bai Xiaofei….</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei revealed a smile of understanding, and he indicated with his gaze that Xue Ying didn’t have to worry.</p>
 <p>“This door is….” When he saw the wooden door on the ground that had already transformed into shattered bits, Lei Shan had already asked the question before Bai Xiaofei and Xue Ying could even mention it themselves.</p>
 <p>“It hasn’t been repaired for many years, so the wind blew it apart. But, we’ve already reported it to Chairman Fei, and he has already agreed to repair it for us. Chairman Fei even fervently agreed to help repair our entire classroom as well, and he said that it couldn’t be inferior to the other classrooms of the enrolled students.” Bai Xiaofei spoke as if it was true, whereas, Fei Guangshi who was at the back was stunned from hearing this.</p>
 <p>“Right, Chairman Fei?” Along with Bai Xiaofei asking Fei Guangshi, even Lei Shan’s gaze had descended on Fei Guangshi as well.</p>
 <p>“AH! Right! It was already slightly late when they came to see me today, so the people to repair it will arrive tomorrow.” Fei Guangshi’s reaction was extremely swift, and he directly accepted this vast project.</p>
 <p>“Mmm, no matter who the academy causes hardships for, it shouldn’t be the students because the students are the foundation of our academy. Guangshi, you’ve done well this time.” Lei Shan nodded as he spoke, and a trace of satisfaction was present in his smile.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Fei Guangshi revealed an overjoyed expression as if he’d obtained a precious treasure, and even the gaze he shot at Bai Xiaofei had become gentle.</p>
 <p>“It’s something I ought to do, and I’ve been doing it all according to your intentions, Principal.” Flattery is king, this had already become a true saying for Fei Guangshi, and all his flattery had been going around Lei Shan since the beginning until now.</p>
 <p>However, Lei Shan seemed to not like him very much, and he grunted lightly before paying no further attention to Fei Guangshi.</p>
 <p>“I won’t beat around the bush. I came here this time because I wanted to see your puppet.” After entering the classroom and sitting down, Lei Shan stared directly at Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>So long as one wasn’t an idiot, one would know who amongst the people in the classroom was the Mimicry Stream puppet master that Lin Li and Xu Chen spoke of.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei took a very deep breath as a slight smile that was difficult to perceive appeared on his face, and then he summoned Huskie over.</p>
 <p>“Grandpa Lei, Chairman Fei, then I’ll display my little ability.” As soon as he finished speaking, Huskie’s body started to transform along with the Origin Energy that flowed into him, and a trace of pleasant surprise appeared on Lei Shan’s face at the instant the transformation was complete, whereas, there was a trace of stupefaction on Fei Guangshi’s face instead.</p>
 <p>Because Huskie had transformed precisely into the appearance of Fei Gou!</p>
