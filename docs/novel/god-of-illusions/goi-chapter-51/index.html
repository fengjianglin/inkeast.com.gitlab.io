 <p><span style>As she brought along the group who hadn’t recovered from their shock, Xue Ying arrived once more at the square that overwhelmed everyone with grief to the point they hardly wished to live.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, unlike before, not only did no one complain this time, all of them faintly carried a trace of anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“During the next one month of time, the first thing all of you must do is improve your physical strength. Females will be trained as males, and males will be trained as animals. If someone can’t endure it, then you can put forward your withdrawal, and I’ll absolutely not look down upon all of you.” Xue Ying was exceptionally serious as she spoke these words, but not a single person amongst the 16 of them answered her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since no one is withdrawing, then we can begin.” Xue Ying took a deep a deep breath, and the devil headteacher Xue Ying officially came online!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Within a single hour, all of you must run two rounds, and not a single person is allowed to fall behind! Time starts now!” As soon as Xue Ying finished speaking, everyone who originally thought they’d made sufficient preparations still felt feelings of resistance that came from the bottom of their hearts, but this type of feeling was quickly digested by them.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s only two rounds, and it’s much better than yesterday!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As they consoled themselves like this, the 16 of them stepped on a long journey once again!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their legs that were already sore to the point of being unable to move measured the length of the square step by step, but not a single person wailed like before, and all of them gritted their teeth as they persisted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because this time, they had a target!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The time of a single hour was nothing but a short moment to most people, but to the members of the Savage Class, this one hour of time was simply torturous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When everyone passed the end while drenched with sweat, an unprecedented feeling of happiness gushed into their hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Things like limits have always existed. But, its existence isn’t for the sake of being an obstruction to your improvement, and it serves as a point of improvement for all of you. Breakthrough a limit and you’ll be slightly stronger.” Xue Ying’s emotionless voice resounded out as she faced everyone that was gasping for breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rest for five minutes before running another round! Finish it within 40 minutes!” Everything she said in the beginning was only foreshadowing, and these words were the most important. Moreover, it was precisely these words that allowed many of them to understand how precious a medicine that could cure regret was….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to the hour from before, these five minutes simply flew by, and Mo Ka even felt that he hadn’t caught his breath, yet had no choice but to set out once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wu Chi, Shi Kui, Xu Chen, we four will run at the back. Xing Nan, Si’si, Wang Heng, Qi Wei, the four of you run at the front. The remaining people run at the center, and no one fall behind!” Before they started to run, Bai Xiaofei distributed everyone’s positions according to their physical strength, and running that looked to be simple was already like a battle and caused them to have no choice but to be serious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone moved according to Bai Xiaofei’s arrangements at the first possible moment, and a group that formed a four by four arrangement started their journey to conquer the square once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every single time someone was unable to hold on, the four people that ran behind them would push them until they caught up to the group once more, and when they ran until they were almost at the end, Bai Xiaofei’s group of four were already pushing two people each.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, no matter what, in the end, they’d passed through the end as a group before the time was up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, their physical strength had really been exhausted completely, and not a single person amongst them wasn’t like a worn-out blower that huffed and puffed heavily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rest for five minutes, and then we’ll go to the next place.” Xue Ying seemed as if she hadn’t noticed the state everyone was in, and her icy cold voice didn’t have the slightest bit of pity in it. It seemed as if she was an entirely different person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once again, five minutes passed in the blink of an eye, and the group didn’t have the strength to think as they followed behind Xue Ying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, luckily, Xue Ying didn’t bring them to a place that could be used for training this time, and she’d brought them to the medicinal district where the Furnace of Agarwood was located. This was also the one and only place of business that wasn’t within the academy’s shopping district. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, we’re here to buy medicine.” Xue Ying took out a jade token as she spoke, and the Starnet Stones she’d plundered from Bai Xiaofei’s group of four had become the main funds to buy things this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Subsequently, Xue Ying spoke the name of a string of medicinal materials, and the amount that followed every single medicinal material was terrifying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei and the others gulped down their saliva as they heard this, whereas, the boss of the medicine store was more energetic as time went by.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Xue Ying led their group out of the medicine store, half of the reserves of the entire medicine store had basically been emptied out, whereas, Xue Ying had even placed an order for another batch of the same medicine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, in exchange, the amount of Starnet Stones within the jade token had already changed into zero….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“From today onward, all of you aren’t allowed to utilize spatial type tools, but you can utilize puppets.” Right when Bai Xiaofei and Fang Ye intended to place the medicinal materials that formed a small mountain into their Spatial Rings, Xue Ring poured down a bucket of cold water onto them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re relying on our hands….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To move so many things?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ming One and Ming Two activated their synchronized mode, and they displayed joint surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can carry it on your head as well. In any case, so long as it’s a part of your body, you can use it, and you have the freedom to do so.” As soon as she finished speaking, Xue Ying looked silently at everyone that was bewildered and at a loss, and this continued until Wu Chi stood forward and started to place things one by one on his own body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luckily, the boss of the medicine store had given them sufficient rope, so besides holding it in their hands, they could carry a lot on their backs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, with Wu Chi taking the lead, everyone else walked forward one by one and following the idea of males carrying more and females carrying less, the small mountain was quickly shared up completely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go, the next stop is the shopping district!” Under Xue Ying’s orders, the 16 of them that were returning ‘full of supplies’ followed closely behind her. At the same time, as they thought about the distance between the Furnace of Agarwood and the shopping district, all of them couldn’t help but feel utterly dispirited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another journey through the square began!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now, if anyone asked the group from the Savage Class about the place they hated the most in their entire lifetimes, then the square in Starnet Academy would absolutely be blurted out at the first possible moment!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they arrived at the shopping district, the group that had just almost caught their breath were almost exhausted to death once more because things like medicinal materials were really heavy, and its weight wasn’t questionable in the slightest….</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, luckily, the things Xue Ying bought here wasn’t much, and after they took a round through a few shops, Xue Ying had quickly completed her purchase plan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, perhaps it was because the 16 of them were really unable to carry anything more, Xue Ying directly put away all the things she bought into her own Spatial Ring this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, everyone couldn’t wrap their heads around why Xue Ying wanted to buy so many tents and water barrels….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you wait here for me first, I’ll be back very soon.” Xue Ying gave the group a rare period of rest before vanishing within their fields of vision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Class Monitor, how do you think Big Sister Xue will train us next?” They seemed to have finally become familiar with each other because another female student besides Lin Li that initiated a conversation with Bai Xiaofei had appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person that spoke was precisely Qi Wei that never stopped talking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m don’t dare to tell you because I’m afraid all of you will be afraid once I do.” Bai Xiaofei had a bitter expression, and even he carried an expression of being unwilling to believe it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean?” The more Bai Xiaofei didn’t dare speak of it, the more interested she was. This was a common characteristic of all men and women at this age, whereas, Qi Wei was a top figure amongst them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell me, is there any place within our academy where a tent is needed?”</span></p>
