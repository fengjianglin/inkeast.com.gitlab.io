 <p>As he experienced the feeling of soaring in the sky once more, Bai Xiaofei was sent to the outer area of the Infinite Mountain Range by Old Man Revelations.</p>
 <p>During this time, Bai Xiaofei had completely adapted himself to the changes in his body under the geezer’s guidance.</p>
 <p>Firstly, Bai Xiaofei was already capable of utilizing Origin Energy like an ordinary person, and the volume of Origin Energy within his body had completely attained the peak level of a Proficient Rank puppet master!</p>
 <p>Moreover, this was merely the outcome from utilizing the Origin Energy emitted from within his Origin Core, and if he utilized his entire strength to mobilize the Origin Energy within his Origin Core, then Bai Xiaofei’s strength could even compare to a Grandmaster Rank puppet master!</p>
 <p>Presently, the puppet masters on the continent were divided into nine ranks, the Apprentice Rank, the Mastery Rank, the Proficient Rank, the Master Rank, the Grandmaster Rank, the Exquisite Rank, the Legend Rank, the Timeless Rank, and the Eternal Rank that only exists in theory.</p>
 <p>So, Bai Xiaofei could be said to have ascended the heavens with a single step.</p>
 <p>But, unfortunately, utilizing the Origin Energy within his Origin Core had been explicitly forbade by the geezer.</p>
 <p>Because Bao Xiaofei had carelessly mixed the pink colored energy into his Origin Core, thus so long as he utilized the Origin Energy within his Origin Core to an excessive level, then the aphrodisiac effect of the pink colored energy would be activated….</p>
 <p>Moreover, this was also something that the geezer envied extremely as it was equivalent to carrying a storehouse of ‘medicine’ wherever he went!</p>
 <p>Just think about it, when you want to do that thing, all you had to do was casually utilize your Origin Energy and then you’ll instantly….</p>
 <p>Cough… cough… that’s gone a bit indecent….</p>
 <p>All in all, Bao Xiaofei was an explosive barrel of medicine that could ‘explode’ at the slightest carelessness, and he was the type that would hurt both himself and others!</p>
 <p>Besides his Origin Energy, the geezer had given Bai Xiaofei a comprehensive explanation of the Lunisolar Brilliance technique, and it was an explanation that caused Bai Xiaofei to wish for nothing more than to return what he’d obtained.</p>
 <p>The Lunisolar Brilliance was an advancing cultivation technique, and in theory, the Lunisolar Brilliance was absolutely capable of being a top divine-grade technique.</p>
 <p>But, under the circumstances that it hadn’t been advanced, this cultivation was at the lowest origin-grade, whereas, the method to advance it was to use women as cultivation vessels….</p>
 <p>Moreover, the women must be virgins to be effective, and their strengths couldn’t be too weak!</p>
 <p>The explanation Old Man Revelations gave for this was that every man on Starnet Continent had a few wives, so it wasn’t a problem, and according to his divination, Bai Xiaofei’s luck with women was very good.</p>
 <p>Of course, Bai Xiaofei didn’t believe the geezer’s so-called divination….</p>
 <p>Moreover, after the cultivation technique advanced, besides the increase in speed of recovery and condensing of Origin Energy, every single advancement allowed Bai Xiaofei to control an extra puppet!</p>
 <p>This was considerably terrifying.</p>
 <p>After all, besides a special case like Bai Xiaofei, ordinary people had to do two things if they wanted to control even more puppets, solidify their spirits and split the concentration of their hearts!</p>
 <p>The firmness of the spirit decided how many puppets one could be connected to at the same time, whereas, the flexibility of the heart decided how many puppets one could control at the same time!</p>
 <p>Moreover, the solidifying of the spirit and the splitting of the concentration of the heart just happened to be the most difficult amongst the six abilities important to a puppet master, essence, energy, body, spirit, heart, and Origin Energy! Numerous people were unable to go further and enter the ranks of high ranked puppet masters because of these two things.</p>
 <p>But, to the current Bai Xiaofei, these thresholds were utterly nonexistent, and he only needed enough women!</p>
 <p>Of course, the precondition was that there were women who satisfied these requirements and were willing to give themselves to him, and if Bai Xiaofei wasn’t worried about conflict between his women….</p>
 <p>But, Bai Xiaofei felt relieved with a quick thought because even if he was unable to advance the cultivation technique, he was already extremely satisfied with being able to possess his current ability. After all, he wasn’t even able to utilize Origin Energy before this.</p>
 <p><i>A man can’t be too greedy. </i>Bai Xiaofei held such a mentality and felt that his encounter with Old Man Revelations this time could still be considered to be a good thing….</p>
 <p>“Alright, take this. Continue walking forward and you’ll see a school called Starnet. That place will accept you, but you have to pass a test.” As he spoke, Old Man Revelations passed an invitation letter that was almost the same as the one he gave the Magical Beast young woman earlier, but it was made of extremely ordinary paper.</p>
 <p>“Master, didn’t you say that you’re one of the three great Legends and possess a deep relationship with Starnet Academy? Why does this invitation letter of yours so low level?” Bai Xiaofei frowned and had an expression of dislike as he received the invitation letter from the geezer.</p>
 <p>“Err….” After thinking for a long time, Revelations was unable to think of a suitable explanation as he couldn’t say that he’d taken out the wrong one earlier and given the high level invitation letter to another, right?</p>
 <p>“What the f*ck do you know? The entrance invitation of Starnet Academy is in great demand, and it's not bad that you’re even able to obtain one. What’s with all the nonsense, go the f*ck on!” After he kicked Bai Xiaofei on the butt, the geezer leaped up onto his golden arrow.</p>
 <p>“Master has brought you here, and whether you can achieve anything is up to you!” His voice hadn’t finished resounding out in the air when the geezer had already become a black dot in the horizon, and he left readily and without the slightest thought of cherishing this ‘one and only disciple’ of his….</p>
 <p>“F*ck! That old fellow has finally left!” Bai Xiaofei heaved a long sigh of relief as if a heavy weight had been lifted off his shoulder, and it wasn’t just him, even Huskie who leaped out had recovered his vigor.</p>
 <p>“Huskie, do you think that old fellow went looking for a lover of his?” As he revealed a sly grin, Bao Xiaofei patted Huskie that was at least two sizes larger, and the latter matched him extremely and barked twice.</p>
 <p>“You haven’t grown for over 10 years yet you’ve grown so much in just this first day we came out here. Looks like coming out was really the right decision!” After he found another satisfying reason for his act of running away, Bai Xiaofei started walking towards the direction that geezer pointed out to him.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go. We’ll go experience this Starnet Academy!”</p>
 <p>The ‘brilliant’ history of Starnet Academy begins now….</p>
 <p>“Over here, over here. All those that have the ordinary entrance invitation line up here. Those with high level and top level entrance invitations enter through the passageway on the right.” At the high and grand entrance to Starnet Academy was a line at the side which one couldn’t see the end of, whereas, on the other side was a passageway where a few people directly walked in occasionally.</p>
 <p>But, no matter which side it was, the common characteristic they shared was that they were both exceedingly quiet, and there wasn’t a single person that dared act rashly here.</p>
 <p>“Sorry, fellow student, this invitation of yours requires you to line up on the left.” Bai Xiaofei and Huskie were stopped outside the entrance by the person that was on duty there, and Bai Xiaofei’s face was covered in refusal to comply.</p>
 <p>“How could that be possible?! This was given to me by Old Man Revelations! Do you know Old Man Revelations? He’s one of the three Legends that remain! How could the thing he gave me be low leveled!?” Bai Xiaofei spoke as he squeezed forward yet no matter how hard he tried, he was unable to break through the final line of defense in the end.</p>
 <p>“Sorry, fellow student, numerous people over there have said that they were recommended over by various great figures, and even if what you’re saying is true, we have no way to prove it. So, we only recognize the invitation letters, and yours is a low level invitation that requires you to participate in the entrance tests. You must register yourself over there.”</p>
 <p>While Bai Xiaofei was in a stalemate with this person, a student that had the word ‘Starnet’ embroidered on the chest area of his clothes walked over.</p>
 <p>The group of people that were on duty before the entrance withdrew towards both sides respectfully. “Senior.”</p>
 <p>When he saw this, Bai Xiaofei became slightly quieter as well, because no matter how he looked at this student, this student didn’t seem like someone that was easy to deal with.</p>
 <p>“Nevermind, nevermind. Since all you little lackeys can’t make a decision, I’ll just take the test. In any case, it doesn’t make a f*cking difference to me.” Bai Xiaofei walked awkwardly towards the end of the line as he spoke, whereas, Huskie turned around to fiercely bark at this group of people before hurrying off to follow up to Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the Fox Clan young woman walked over slowly with the golden invitation letter in hand, and her ‘injuries’ from yesterday seemed to have already recovered completely.</p>
 <p>The young woman’s body obviously shuddered when she saw Bai Xiaofei grinning at her, but it was only for an instant, whereas, Bai Xiaofei who didn’t know the situation had utterly not thought too much about this before running to the back of the line in the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>A wisp of an indescribable feeling flashed past the young woman’s eyes when she saw this, and then she turned around to walk through the entrance of Starnet Academy….</p>
