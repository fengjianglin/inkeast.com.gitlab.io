 <p>Chapter 878: Leave It To Me!</p> 
 <p>The sudden appearance of Princess Ling Ge surprised everyone and threw Yun Tianhe into despair. He really didn’t think that she would come…</p> 
 <p>“My good brother, I didn’t know you had such a romantic debt.” Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but rejoice in Yun Tianhe’s pain. In the past, it had always been him in this kind of situation and therefore he could not understand the feeling of the onlookers, but now he did.</p> 
 <p>The feeling of watching someone else’s show was… refreshing!</p> 
 <p>“Xiaofei! You have an idea, don’t you?!” Yun Tianhe’s attention immediately shifted to Bai Xiaofei. Instead of getting angry, he took him as his last lifeline.</p> 
 <p>“Yes. However, if I help you, you’ll have to listen to me in the matter of your marriage, but you can rest assured that I will help you win the beauty,” Bai Xiaofei slowly said, seeming to have been waiting for this.</p> 
 <p>“As long as you can help me with this, I will listen to you!” Yun Tianhe had no other choice as billions of Amethyst Coins was something he could not afford at the moment. Once Mu Yun missed this chance, she wouldn’t be able to leave the Moon Beck Pavilion in the most decorated way.</p> 
 <p>It was not simply a kind of honor. The identity of Moon Beck’s top card was a symbol of status in Ethereal, a way to make up for the gap between Mu Yun and Yun Tianhe!</p> 
 <p>This identity gap was the main reason why Lan Qiushuang objected to their marriage, so this was the opportunity that Yun Tianhe had been waiting for.</p> 
 <p>“I have a question. You don’t only accept Amethyst Coins, do you?” Bai Xiaofei raised his hand and shouted at the host below.</p> 
 <p>“Of course, as long as it has a value, we will convert it to the corresponding price,” replied the host.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was relieved as it would be tricky otherwise. He turned to Huskie, who was lying and gnawing at a bone, and said, “Take out any one item that I’ve put in your place.”</p> 
 <p>Huskie instantly held out a paw. “Storage fee!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei nearly fainted on the spot. <em>When did this dog become a fox?!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Very good! You are formidable! Just you wait!!” So angry that his mouth kept twitching, Bai Xiaofei took out an Amethyst Card. “It’s yours. Use it to buy whatever you want!”</p> 
 <p>Accepting the card, Huskie then disappeared on the spot and reappeared from the puppet space moments later with a strand of crystal grass in his mouth. The moment the grass emerged, the temperature of the private room began to rise.</p> 
 <p>“See how much you can exchange for this,” Bai Xiaofei raised his voice to say while launching Blackie’s ability to deliver the grass directly before the host.</p> 
 <p>Startled, the host subconsciously stretched out his hand.</p> 
 <p>“I advise you not to touch it, or your hand may be ruined,” Bai Xiaofei’s voice rang out again.</p> 
 <p>Regaining his wits, the host immediately withdrew his hand. Very quickly, the grass was carefully taken off stage by their staff.</p> 
 <p>Before long, the host ran back excitedly and announced, “150,000-year-old Molten Grass, three billion Amethyst Coins!”</p> 
 <p>The whole hall immediately raised a ruckus and all kinds of dissatisfied voices resounded, but the host ignored them.</p> 
 <p>“Anyone still would like to support your favorite performer? If not, tonight’s top card will be decided now!”</p> 
 <p>Under the host’s urging, Princess Ling Ge could not remain calm. She was about to raise her sign when…</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness, this humble one is Bai Xiaofei. I ask you to go easy as Mu Yun is the one I want to take away and this has nothing to do with brother Tianhe. Please rest assured,” Bai Xiaofei said.</p> 
 <p>Ling Ge hesitated. She didn’t get the needed consent to come here this time. The money in her hand was not entirely hers to spend either. Spending any more meant she would be in trouble.</p> 
 <p>“Can I believe you?” Ling Ge asked.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei laughed and said calmly, “Please rest assured that I will give you a satisfactory answer, otherwise, you can take my life at any time.”</p> 
 <p>Ling Ge quieted down. With that, Mu Yun became the top card of the night, making Yun Tianhe excited beyond words.</p> 
 <p>“Lil’ Bro! I owe you a big one! When I get married, you must be my best man!”</p> 
 <p>As Yun Tianhe pictured his happy life, Bai Xiaofei poured cold water on him, “Brother, you haven’t forgotten what you just promised me, right?” Then, he put down his teacup, ignoring the shocked Yun Tianhe as he went up to Mu Yun, who seemed to still have her rationality. “Sister-in-law, if you can, please invite me tonight. I will help redeem you.”</p> 
 <p>“I’ll act according to your arrangements.” Bowing slightly to Bai Xiaofei, Mu Yun once again demonstrated her intellect.</p> 
 <p>After Mu Yun left to deliver her winning speech, Yun Tianhe could not sit still.</p> 
 <p>“Lil’ Bro, what are you going to do? Didn’t you say you’d help me?” As his long-cherished plan seemed ruined, Yun Tianhe was unable to calm down. The most idiotic time for a man was when he wanted to start a family, especially with the woman he loved.</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother, don’t you believe me?” Bai Xiaofei asked back.</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe froze. How dare he not? It wasn’t like he had any other choice!</p> 
 <p>“But, what should I do? I only like Mu Yun. I just regard Ling Ge as my sister. I can’t allow myself to hurt anyone.” Yun Tianhe dejectedly sat down. At the moment, one could not see the usual famous gentlemanly image in him at all.</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother, sometimes you just have no choice, but what you can do is to compromise. You are the hope of the Yun clan and the Lan clan. There are things you must shoulder,” Bai Xiaofei said with a hint of helplessness in his voice.</p> 
 <p>People envied those who were born with a golden spoon in their mouth, but no one knew that those people sometimes had to suffer much more than ordinary people. No matter what they did, they had to worry left and right…</p> 
 <p>“Leave it to me, I will give you a satisfactory ending.”</p>
