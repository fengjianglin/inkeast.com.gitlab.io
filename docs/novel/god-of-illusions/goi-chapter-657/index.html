 <p>Chapter 657: Falling Flower Formation!</p> 
 <p>“You can read it?!” Bai Xiaofei exclaimed as he quickly walked to Huskie, his mouth wide in surprise enough to fit a fist. He remembered back in the Gorge of Heroes whenever Second Mother taught him to read, Huskie had always escaped quite quickly. Bai Xiaofei was inseparable from Huskie for so many years, how could he not know something Huskie knew?</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know why, but I just can understand…”</p> 
 <p>Huskie was also full of doubts as even he himself found this hard to believe.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it. What does this book say?!” Bai Xiaofei didn’t have the heart to think so much at the moment. He just wanted to know if the book’s contents could get him out of that place.</p> 
 <p>“Do you really want to know?” Huskie looked up at Bai Xiaofei with a question that struck him dumb.</p> 
 <p><em>Why? What’s in there that you can’t just tell me?</em></p> 
 <p>“Nonsense! This is possibly the clue to us getting out of this hellhole. Of course I want to know!”</p> 
 <p>“Then take two steps back and you’re not allowed to beat me after I read it.” Huskie coughed with a solemn gaze.</p> 
 <p>While having no idea what Huskie was up to, Bai Xiaofei had no choice to do as he was told. After all, Huskie was the boss for now.</p> 
 <p>“Future-comer, as you read these words, I should have been dead for a long time, but since you have sincerely kowtowed to me, I will reluctantly accept you as my disciple.”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Huskie’s finished reading the first sentence, Bai Xiaofei knew why he had to take two steps back. If it weren’t for this distance, a slap would definitely have landed on Huskie’s head.</p> 
 <p><em>Damn this lil’ sh*t, taking advantage of me!</em></p> 
 <p>Although Bai Xiaofei knew the message was left by the skeleton, he couldn’t adjust his mentality as Huskie was the one who was saying it. However, no one knew his puppet better than he did. If he used violence now, Huskie would definitely quit on the spot.</p> 
 <p>Crushing down the impulse to beat the dog up, he bit the bullet and continued listening.</p> 
 <p>“My identity is very special, therefore preventing me from disclosing certain matters, but you only need to know that your master is a very powerful person.”</p> 
 <p>As Huskie went on, Bai Xiaofei was so angry that his whole body started shaking trying to suppress the anger. <em>I swear, if this book doesn’t tell me how to get out of here, I will grind this pile of bones into powder!</em></p> 
 <p>Poor ‘master,’ already in danger of being ground by his precious apprentice without knowing it.</p> 
 <p>“I’m sure you currently really want to leave this place. Don’t worry, I will realize your wish.” Huskie flipped to the next page. Bai Xiaofei’s heart pounded at this information.</p> 
 <p>“I will tell you this later. As for now, what do you think is the first thing you should do as my only apprentice?”</p> 
 <p>Still not getting down to business. However, Bai Xiaofei already had a certain understanding of his second master – he was absolutely a bastard!</p> 
 <p>“After leaving this place, you must avenge me! If it wasn’t for him, how could I end up in this situation, being trapped to death in this bird’s nest?!”</p> 
 <p>Huskie read out this impassioned remark in the calmest tone, which sounded really bizarre in Bai Xiaofei’s ears.</p> 
 <p>“Sorry, I got too emotional, but it can’t be helped when you’re old. Let us get to the main business now.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei pictured an old man who was mediating his emotions. At the same time, he was deeply excited.</p> 
 <p><em>Main business! Should be the way out of here!</em></p> 
 <p>“The man you need to kill is called Wu Shaokun, a rank-eight Spirit Stream expert, but now he may have advanced beyond. However, since you were able to pass through the Falling Flower Formation, you’ve proved your potential to defeat him. After all, he couldn’t make his way through this formation to kill me.”</p> 
 <p><em>Ugh, so your main business is to avenge you…</em></p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, something else also confused Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p><em>What the hell is rank-eight? Which age uses that system for strength? Puppet masters once used it in history?</em></p> 
 <p>All sorts of doubts got Bai Xiaofei curious enough to temporarily forget about his current problem. His eyes drifted to the skull again.</p> 
 <p><em>It seems that this ‘master’ of mine is not only strong, but also mysterious!</em></p> 
 <p>“You may not meet this Wu Shaokun soon, but you must remember this name. I believe that there definitely comes a day you will cross paths with him. Such is fate, just like you got here!”</p> 
 <p>“Remember, no matter what he tells you, do not believe him. He is an out-and-out petty villain, calling me this and that outside, but doing the most abominable things in secret. Just fight him as soon as you see him!”</p> 
 <p>The trivial complaining made quite a long passage. Just when Bai Xiaofei was losing his patience, Huskie turned to another page.</p> 
 <p>“Next, let me tell you about this Falling Flower Formation.”</p> 
 <p>Finally, it had reached the real main business, as Bai Xiaofei strained his ears.</p> 
 <p>“The Falling Flower Formation is not my creation, but something I exchanged for with my long-saved fortune. The name is beautiful, don’t you think? In fact, it is not what it seems. ‘Falling Flower’ has nothing to do with the peach blossoms you see, but indicates the fall of heroes!”</p> 
 <p>“Unfortunately, before I could witness its might, I had to use it to protect myself. In the end, I could only pass it on to a fated one knowing I was going to die. Ridiculous, how ridiculous!”</p> 
 <p>There was a trace of loneliness between the lines. Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help feeling a little sympathy for the master who he never got to meet.</p> 
 <p>Betrayed by his good brother, trapped in a place where even his enormous power couldn’t be of any use. Bai Xiaofei had just experienced this feeling himself, and it was unforgettable!</p> 
 <p>“While you aren’t able to learn my other abilities, this formation should be good enough. I hope it will shine in your hands!”</p> 
 <p>The master’s last words came to an abrupt end here. Huskie finally began reading the part Bai Xiaofei was longing for, the essence of the Falling Flower Formation!</p> 
 <p>Listening to Huskie’s dictation, Bai Xiaofei’s eyes gradually brightened…</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>“I can’t keep waiting anymore! Don’t stop me, I must go in!”</p> 
 <p>Outside the peach blossom forest, Leng Liuying was on the verge of exploding with the veil of night completely falling.</p> 
 <p>“You’re being willful!” Cang Lan shouted.</p> 
 <p>Leng Liuying was immediately pressed down to the ground by an invisible force. In front of Cang Lan, she had no way to cause a scene at all.</p> 
 <p>“Grandpa!!! You know how long it has been!!! If he can’t come out alive, I will not live either!!”</p> 
 <p>Leng Liuying yelled hysterically as tears streamed down her face. Leng Liushuang and Leng Liuli also stood up. Although they weren’t acting as fiercely, their firm eyes had already said everything…</p>
