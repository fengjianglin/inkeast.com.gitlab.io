 <p>Chapter 771: Watch How I Buy Everything!</p> 
 <p>With his three new recruits, Bai Xiaofei’s footprints covered nearly the entire Windlove City. As a result, more than half of the residents now knew of a young man who appeared out of nowhere and took in three famous experts under him.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei instantly became the hot topic of the city, consequently gathering many eyes onto him.</p> 
 <p>After achieving his goal, Bai Xiaofei contentedly found an inn to settle in. Despite having only four people, he booked the entire inn, and all the staff became his temporary servants. Some of those who were previously staying at the inn wanted to reason with him, but they all ran off after seeing the three experts. After all, when reasoning equaled seeking death, no one would be so stupid to try.</p> 
 <p>“Go to bed early. I’ll take you to see the world tomorrow,” declared Bai Xiaofei to the three experts before returning to his room with Rui Mengqi.</p> 
 <p>Yes, they stayed in the same room. Otherwise, Bai Xiaofei’s image as a corrupt young master would be ruined. What kind of corrupt master didn’t like beauties?</p> 
 <p>However, the fact that Bai Xiaofei didn’t dare to touch Rui Mengqi didn’t stop her from having strange thoughts…</p> 
 <p>“Erm… You sleep in the bed. I’ll keep watch.”</p> 
 <p>As soon as the door was closed, the arrogant young master Bai vanished immediately and was replaced by the pitiful little classmate Bai.</p> 
 <p>“Are you afraid that Xian’er and the others will know?” unknown where it went wrong in her thoughts, Rui Mengqi suddenly asked.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was dumbstruck, but he quickly reacted.</p> 
 <p>“Why would I be? My freedom is not restricted. You think too much, I just have some things to consider and want some quietness.” Successfully pulling an excuse, he pushed Rui Mengqi down onto the bed. “Have a good rest. You’ve used your brain quite a lot today and will have to keep it up tomorrow. I will think of all the situations we can encounter so you can keep acting like today. “Sleep, my little maid, this is an order from your young master!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei said the last sentence with a smile. Rui Mengqi immediately gave up on the idea of getting up to struggle.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, Young Master. You rest early too…”</p> 
 <p>With a sweet smile, Rui Mengqi closed her watery eyes. Watching as she gradually fell asleep. Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help a sigh of relief.</p> 
 <p><em>Ahhh, my determination is getting worse and worse! If I had been a little closer just now, I would have lost control…</em></p> 
 <p>At this thought, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but glance at Rui Mengqi and instinctively swallowed a mouthful of saliva, and then shook his head like crazy.</p> 
 <p><em>No more sins!</em></p> 
 <p>“Aunt Gold,” he summoned Golden Feather. Without having to say anything else, she already understood what he needed.</p> 
 <p>“I wonder what others will think when they know that I, a sacred phoenix, have become a special hypnotist…” With a wry smile, Golden Feather then raised her hand.</p> 
 <p>“Heheh, who told you to be my aunt?”</p> 
 <p>With a sleazy smile, Bai Xiaofei closed his eyes. Golden Feather waved her hand, and a calm energy flowed in through his forehead …</p> 
 <p>Looking at the sleeping Bai Xiaofei, Golden Feather reluctantly shook her head.</p> 
 <p>After following him for such a long time, she had also roughly understood his situation. Putting aside all the other aspects, his matter concerning women was already beyond what normal people could handle. Flirting was easy, but managing the harem…</p> 
 <p>“Little guy, I can only wish you good luck.” There were not many things that could make a sacred beast helpless…</p> 
 <p>The next day, the sun rose as usual, but Windlove City was different.</p> 
 <p>There was only one such day in every month when Unify Business conducted auctions, and there was only one month in every year when Unify Business publicized themselves to the whole Windlove City as well as famous guests from afar.</p> 
 <p>According to past experience, the auction started in the morning and would not end until evening, due not only to the large quantity of goods but also the extremely fierce bidding competition!</p> 
 <p>On that day, one would get to see how rich the rich were!</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei did not panic. To support his aloof front, he had contacted Feng Wuhen and had all the liquid assets of Illusion Demon sent to himself. This day, he could squander at will. Not only that, he intended to find Lei Shan for the expenses later. After all, it was all for the mission! Of course, how to distribute the items later would still be up to him…</p> 
 <p>“Young Master, you are up.”</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei finished breakfast and walked out of his room, he was greeted by Shaman King, who was standing at the door with the other two.</p> 
 <p>“How long until the auction starts?” asked Bai Xiaofei indifferently as Rui Mengqi, who was buttoning up her shirt behind him, came out slowly.</p> 
 <p>Although the three experts had passed the age of being affected by beauty, Rui Mengqi’s actions still managed to stir them a little.</p> 
 <p>“There’s still fifteen minutes. If we go now, we’ll be just in time for the warm-up,” replied Shaman King. Last night, the three of them had guessed for a long time about Bai Xiaofei’s plan before concluding that it was the auction by Unify Business.</p> 
 <p>That was why the three were so attentive today. This level of auction would certainly have what they needed, and whether they could get their hands on them depended on Bai Xiaofei because their budgets were definitely not enough.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go. This is the only thing to do today anyway.” Bai Xiaofei took the lead.</p> 
 <p>Rui Mengqi walked by his side while the rest respectfully followed behind.</p> 
 <p>The auction site was not far away. Before long, the group of five arrived and was guided by a receptionist to the private room specially prepared for Bai Xiaofei. The room was at least two hundred square meters. Not to mention five, it was enough to fit even fifty people!</p> 
 <p>In addition to the luxuriously decorated private room, Qing Han had arranged the most capable staff of the branch to guide Bai Xiaofei, a woman who was no less beautiful than Rui Mengqi.</p> 
 <p>“Very nice to meet you, Young Master Bai. I am Qing Ya, the chief auctioneer here. I was supposed to preside over the auction today, but because you came, I gave this opportunity to another.” Her elegant voice was pleasant to listen to, and the speed and tone of her speech made people feel comfortable.</p> 
 <p>“Just sit down and watch how I buy everything!”</p>
