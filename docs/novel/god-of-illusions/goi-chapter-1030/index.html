 <p>Chapter 1030: Good News, Bad News!</p> 
 <p>Absence makes the heart grow fonder, especially when it had to do with life and death.</p> 
 <p>In the next three months, Bai Xiaofei and Nie Qing were isolated from the world as they traveled through Moonlight. During this time, no one heard from the two of them.</p> 
 <p>No, to be exact, the three of them.</p> 
 <p>“Bai Xiaofei! Come out for dinner!!” On the Windsurfing Ship, Tan Xin angrily kicked Bai Xiaofei’s door open.</p> 
 <p>“Go easy on him, you know he’s exhausted.” A smiling Nie Qing tried to hold her back.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Tan Xin blushed.</p> 
 <p>When she had first met Nie Qing, her first thought was that her position in Bai Xiaofei’s heart would be in danger. She had never expected that Nie Qing’s appearance would let her get what she had always wanted.</p> 
 <p>On a night that Tan Xin would never forget, a drunk incident completely made her Bai Xiaofei’s, at the same time marking the start of a happy period for both of them…</p> 
 <p>However, the past three months had not been so easy for him. The Revival Grass gave Nie Qing not only a new life but also a second special physique - Energy Storage, which improved the quality of her physical body and origin energy through daily cultivation. As long as she didn’t use energy to fight, she would be able to accumulate all the way to the Legend Rank!</p> 
 <p>Of course, this was only in theory. Unless she encountered treasures or special opportunities, it would take at least a few decades to get to that point.</p> 
 <p>And while the Legend Rank was unrealistic for now, it was already enough for an all-out ‘battle’ with Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>In the past, Nie Qing had been the one who begged for mercy in bed, but now, it could be said that the outcome was uncertain. And when adding Tan Xin to the equation, the women’s side won by a mile.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, being unable to get out of bed had become Bai Xiaofei’s daily routine for the past three months…</p> 
 <p>“Let me sleep for a while, at least until we arrive…” said Bai Xiaofei lazily, having no intention to get up at all. His days had been nothing but walking around sightseeing during the day and ‘fighting’ at night, it was exhausting…</p> 
 <p>“Aii, I wanted to tell you some good news, but since you don’t want to hear it, forget it.” Nie Qing sighed.</p> 
 <p>Just as the two women wanted to withdraw, Bai Xiaofei jumped out of bed.</p> 
 <p>“I’m fine! What good news?” He stood in front of them with a big smile.</p> 
 <p>Looking at Bai Xiaofei with a smirk, Tan Xin slowly raised her hand and pointed at Nie Qing’s stomach. “If we didn’t get it wrong, there should be someone living in there.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was dumbstruck for half a day.</p> 
 <p>“What’s with that reaction? You’re not ready for this? If so, I can find another father for my child. My brothers should be very happy to be the godfathers.” Nie Qing glared at Bai Xiaofei with displeasure.</p> 
 <p>“No, no, no, no! Absolutely not! I’m totally ready!! I’m just… I’m just shocked! I’m going to be a father!” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly replied.</p> 
 <p>Seeing him so flustered, the two women burst out laughing.</p> 
 <p>“When… How long has it been? Any movement from the child yet?” Bai Xiaofei rushed to Nie Qing’s side and stared at her flat belly as if he wanted to get in and see for himself.</p> 
 <p>“What are you looking at? I just had a reaction, so it’s been only a month at most. I only noticed it several days ago because my period didn’t come as scheduled,” Nie Qing replied, her heart filled with a sweet feeling to see Bai Xiaofei so excited. She had not only survived an extremely dangerous ordeal but even conceived a little life, which was something she had never dared to think about.</p> 
 <p>“Okay, good, great! From now on, you are not allowed to do anything but keep yourself safe! Wait, not, I have to go and study the things pregnant women should pay attention to. Wait, no, we first need to supplement your nutrition!”</p> 
 <p>After recovering from the shock, Bai Xiaofei was like a headless fly as he didn’t know what to do. Unable to watch on, Tan Xin took out a notebook and gave it to him.</p> 
 <p>“Here, read it, I already wrote everything down. Since you’re going to be responsible, this godmother leaves it to you,” she said.</p> 
 <p>Receiving the notebook, Bai Xiaofei quickly read two pages before his eyes shone brightly. <em>This is more precious than a godly technique!</em></p> 
 <p>“Qing’er, you go and rest. I want to go into closed-door study!” He closed the notebook with a determined expression.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Nie Qing shook her head with a wry smile and left him alone.</p> 
 <p>After leaving his room Tan Xin curiously asked Nie Qing, “They all say that a man will change when he has a child. What do you think he will become?”</p> 
 <p>“No matter what he becomes, he will still be Bai Xiaofei, don’t worry.” Nie Qing smiled and looked down at her stomach with overflowing happiness that earned Tan Xin’s envy.</p> 
 <p>“Hey… Can I ask a question?” Tan Xin hesitated as it was a question that she had held back from asking for a while now.</p> 
 <p>“Go ahead.” Nie Qing smiled playfully. She was ever so lively, and by just standing there she already gave people a refreshing feeling.</p> 
 <p>“Lil’ Bai said that you couldn’t accept him having other women before…” Tan Xin gulped. Despite knowing that this question was overboard, she was too curious as to why Nie Qing didn’t have any complaints about her presence.</p> 
 <p>“I’ve already died once. What else can I not open up my mind to? I only need to know that I’m very important to him.” Nie Qing looked into the distance. “After we arrive at the capital, it’s time to bid farewell to the people there…”</p> 
 <p>This reminded Tan Xin. She hurriedly controlled the Windsurfing Ship to land. The moment the ship touched the ground, a group of people jumped on board.</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother Fei!!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing the loud voice, Bai Xiaofei instantly rushed out of his room and appeared in front of the speaker in a flicker.</p> 
 <p>“Fang Ye?! Why are you here?” Bai Xiaofei scanned Fang Ye with a puzzled expression.</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye’s expression could be said to be extremely ugly. “Brother Fei, look at this.” He handed Bai Xiaofei a letter, his voice full of pain.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei dubiously took the letter and unfolded it. After reading what was inside, he froze in place. The paper slipped out of his hands and fell slowly…</p>
