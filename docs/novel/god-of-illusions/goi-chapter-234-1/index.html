 <p>“It’s really a royal. This is jackpot. Boss will definitely praise me for my contribution,” said the Berserk Gorilla, joy filling his face as he spoke human tongue.</p>
 <p>“Are you blind? With me here, will you be able to take her?” said the bear. It was obvious this bear was not on the Berserk Gorilla’s side. When he spoke, his voice was filled with disdain.</p>
 <p>“Stupid bear, don’t you know that I have been holding back against you all along? If we do fight, you won’t even be able to return in one piece. Piss off and go back to your female bear. You might be able to live longer doing that,” said the Berserk Gorilla. He showed no fear. Instead, a fanatical greed appeared on his face.</p>
 <p>As for the Toxic Overlord Butterfly, the first thing he did when seeing these two was flee. These two weren’t opponents he could provoke. They were at the peak stage of the King Rank, and their statuses were equally terrifying. Both of them were the trusted aides of the royals. And in the Infinite Mountain Range, the royals were inviolable and a symbol of strength.</p>
 <p>“Oh? Is that so? Sure, I don’t mind bringing an extra King Rank magic core with me,” said the bear. Origin energy started swirling around him, stirring the soil. Most beast-type magical beasts were good in controlling the earth element.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the Berserk Gorilla had no intention of stepping away either. He started glowing with a golden radiance, and his body grew by at least half his original size.</p>
 <p>Metal element!</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei watched on as everything happened. His anxiousness dropped when he saw them fighting each other.</p>
 <p><em>Fight! Even better, injure each other! Let’s see how you are going to survive this!&nbsp;</em>Bai Xiaofei thought to himself as he continued chewing on the Blood Zoysia.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The wounds on Hu Xian’er were nearly healed, and the Blood Zoysia was nearly finished as well. It wouldn’t take long before Hu Xian’er woke up. At that time, they would be able to decide if they wanted to fight or flee. Unfortunately, Bai Xiaofei had celebrated too early. The bear and the gorilla assumed a fighting stance yet did not fight. They paused for half a second before turning to look at Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“Kid, if you don’t stop, you might not be able to stay alive any longer,” said the Berserk Gorilla with a grin. The bear obviously agreed with this as well. They could clearly sense that the energy undulation within Hu Xian’er was growing stronger and stronger. They would not stand there and allow her to heal. Most royals had the ability to fight against those of a higher rank. If Hu Xian’er was allowed to heal, they might not be able to leave in one piece.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei sneered and replied, “You are mere King Rank beasts. Who gives you the guts to speak like that to me? Come, try attacking me. I promise you the instant you do, you will die!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He looked like he did not intend to stop, but his heart was beating wildly.</p>
 <p><em>What to do? What to do? What to do? Damn it! If I had known this would happen, I would have waited longer before using the Starnet Brilliance! Damn it! How am I supposed to stop them? I can’t even rely on the Earth Infants anymore. They have already done their best. I can’t expect them to sacrifice themselves, right?</em></p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was filled with anxiety, but Hu Xian’er still showed no signs of waking up. He was hit by a helpless and sorrowful feeling, a feeling that he couldn’t do anything even after trying his best.</p>
 <p><em>It is my fault for being too weak! If I was a Grandmaster and had a third puppet, I wouldn’t be so helpless right now! I am such a trash! What should I do?</em></p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei kept roaring to himself inwardly, yet the more anxious he got, the messier his thoughts became. It reached a point where he could no longer think of any solution.</p>
 <p>“F*ck. This is the first time I have seen such an arrogant human. Sure, watch as I beat you up!”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s feigned calm failed to scare the Berserk Gorilla off. Or to be precise, this was a species of magical beast that knew no fear. In fact, for Berserk Gorillas, injuries were akin to a great boon. Right after making his declaration, the Berserk Gorilla charged forward, his body still glowing with a gold radiance. His tightly clenched fist shone with a dazzling light, and he looked like he would kill Bai Xiaofei with a single punch.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei couldn’t even try to dodge the punch. Otherwise, Hu Xian’er would be dead. Taking it head on was his only choice. He placed Hu Xian’er on the ground and charged the Berserk Gorilla. Once again, Nightcharm appeared in his hand.</p>
 <p><em>Damn it! Fine, let’s all die! Don’t you dare dream of surviving after my death!</em></p>
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei had still underestimated the Berserk Gorilla. The Berserk Gorilla might look stupid, but his combat experience was far richer than Bai Xiaofei’s. He was not a trusted aide of a royal for no reason. He immediately stopped his advance before vanishing from Bai Xiaofei’s vision. By the time Bai Xiaofei realized what was happening, the gorilla was already behind him, the shiny fist already right above his head.</p>
 <p>“Human, you are too weak!” said the Berserk Gorilla as he smashed his fist downward.</p>
 <p><em>It’s over. Is this where I die?</em></p>
 <p>Indignation appeared on Bai Xiaofei’s face. He wanted to continue struggling, but he was completely helpless. He waited for his death, yet for some reason, death did not arrive. He turned around and found that, without realizing it, a golden barrier had appeared around him, blocking the Berserk Gorilla’s punch.</p>
 <p>And the Berserk Gorilla’s current condition shocked everyone. His head and half his body had seemingly disintegrated. When Bai Xiaofei looked at him, his body was already weakly collapsing onto the ground.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, it’s really you, boss. It has been a while. You haven’t forgotten me, right?” a crafty voice rang out. When Bai Xiaofei looked in the direction the voice came from, he saw Xing slowly slithering toward him. Hong, who had grown slightly larger, was following behind him. The protective barrier around Bai Xiaofei was definitely Hong’s work.</p>
 <p>“Ruindemon Flood Dragon?” the bear cried out in alarm, and an extremely human-like expression of fear appeared on his face. Even the two shivering Earth Infants were behaving similarly.</p>
 <p>“Heh, so I’m actually known around these parts? Damn, I’m turning into a celebrity…a celebrity beast!”</p>
 <p>With the threat of the Heart Devourer gone, Xing had been completely liberated, and his true nature had been completely unleashed.</p>
 <p>“Why is a snake beast mingling with a fox royal? Aren’t you afraid that your royals will punish you?”</p>
 <p>The only option the bear had was to scare them with words. With the assistance of a Lunapython, it was only a matter of time before this Ruindemon Flood Dragon eliminated him. No, that was inaccurate. They could very well instantly kill him.</p>
 <p>“When have you ever seen a Ruindemon Flood Dragon with a master? I am only here for my boss!” Xing declared before stopping beside Bai Xiaofei before glaring at the bear.</p>
 <p>“I am here to see which fool dares harm my boss!”</p>
 <p>The moment those words were uttered, the bear’s fur stood on end.</p>
 <p><em>It’s over!</em></p>
