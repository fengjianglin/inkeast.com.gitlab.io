 <p>Chapter 902: Who Is It?</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s proposal was quickly accepted by all. After that, the princes exchanged a look that he couldn’t understand.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai, it’s quite rare for us all to get together, and in a place like the Moon Beck Pavilion too. If you don’t do something here, it will be a little too sorry for the friendship between us men, won’t it?” Diplomat Ling Fan suddenly suggested.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s hair instantly stood up.</p> 
 <p>“Brothers, this isn’t good, the sisters are present. Also, I remember that the Moon Beck Pavilion isn’t that kind of place,” he hurriedly rejected the suggestion. If nothing else, Tan Xin would skin him.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I’ve told Wanqiu in advance, they probably have left to enjoy the streets now. And we aren’t so brazen as you think, we’re just going to watch a program,” said Ling Yue, looking quite honest.</p> 
 <p>“Then… okay.” Bai Xiaofei yielded. These princes obviously came prepared, and they set the banquet at the Moon Beck Pavilion for this reason. Bai Xiaofei even suspected that setting him up was their main purpose that was prioritized over discussing the throne competition.</p> 
 <p>In this way, an extra performance was forcibly held in the Moon Beck Pavilion in an even more extravagant fashion and had even more participants than its monthly top card competition.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei was not in the mood to enjoy the program, preoccupied with what the princes actually had in store for him. <em>Do they think these women can attract me? How the hell did they get this from their investigation…</em></p> 
 <p>However, when the last performance of the show began, his brain stopped working.</p> 
 <p><em>This… is…</em></p> 
 <p>“Silent play A Thousand Images﻿<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>, a program that became popular because of Starnet College.” Ling Fan’s lips curled up when he saw Bai Xiaofei’s reaction. <em>Looks like we made the right move!</em></p> 
 <p>Returning to his senses, Bai Xiaofei stared fixedly at the flickering light on the stage, as well as the dancing figure in it.</p> 
 <p>“It’s been prepared…” Ling Fan whispered to First Prince Ling Yue. The latter nodded.</p> 
 <p>When the performance ended, Bai Xiaofei’s little soul also returned to his body. <em>Is it really just imitation? Too similar… Was it her?!</em></p> 
 <p>Being submerged in countless question marks, he had forgotten where he was.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai, the performance is over.” Ling Fan patted Bai Xiaofei’s shoulder.</p> 
 <p>“Third Brother, can I meet the performer of The Thousand Images?” Bai Xiaofei asked.</p> 
 <p>This was the question Ling Fan had been waiting for. However, he put on a reluctant expression. “I will need to ask the performer. No one can force anyone in the Moon Beck Pavilion. This is the rule.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei nodded at once and said sincerely, “No problem, I can wait, but please convey my message to her that I really want to see her.”</p> 
 <p>Ling Fan left with the good news of Bai Xiaofei being swayed while the other princes chatted with him during the wait. However, Bai Xiaofei only absentmindedly responded as his mind had wandered off again.</p> 
 <p>Before long, Ling Fan returned with a smile.</p> 
 <p>Delighted, Bai Xiaofei bounced up from his seat. “What did she say?”</p> 
 <p>Seeing him like this, the princes were also delighted. <em>This looks promising!</em></p> 
 <p>“She agreed, but she asked you to come alone and not to allow anyone to disturb,” Ling Fan truthfully conveyed the performer’s request.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei nearly promised, but then he recalled Tan Xin.</p> 
 <p>“I’m fine, it’s just…”</p> 
 <p>“It’s Xin’er, right? I’ll just tell her that you have been called away by Imperial Father and ask her to go back and wait,” Ling Yue immediately volunteered to cover for Bai Xiaofei. </p> 
 <p>His age and dignified face gave people the impression that he would never tell lies. However, it was this kind of person that was the most ruthless when fooling people!</p> 
 <p>Yet Bai Xiaofei was only grateful at that moment. He said, “Thank you, big brother. I will go back as soon as possible so it won’t put you in trouble.”</p> 
 <p>With that, he followed Ling Fan to a separate quarter.</p> 
 <p>“This is it. I won’t disturb your good affair. A beautiful night as such is worth a thousand gold!” With a loud laugh, Ling Fan ran off.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei stood at the door, hesitant.</p> 
 <p><em>What if it’s her? What if it isn’t her?</em></p> 
 <p>For the first time, he was troubled by both possibilities of one matter.</p> 
 <p>“The door is not locked. You can come in. If you dare not to, please just leave.” A faint voice rang out from the room.</p> 
 <p>The familiar voice struck Bai Xiaofei dumb. <em>It’s really her!</em></p> 
 <p>He pushed open the door and was entranced to see a familiar figure and smell a familiar scent.</p> 
 <p>“Xue…”</p> 
 <p>“Xue Ying, right? Sorry, I’m not her.” The girl turned around and interrupted him.</p> 
 <p>Although her voice, the back profile, and even her scent were almost the same, the person standing in front of Bai Xiaofei was not Xue Ying.</p> 
 <p>“I’m Ni Xue, nice to meet you,” said Ni Xue at a relaxed pace, her voice was soft and sweet, unlike Xue Ying’s bold and vigorous voice in Bai Xiaofei’s memory.</p> 
 <p>“You… Nice to meet you, I’m Bai Xiaofei,” said Bai Xiaofei woodenly.</p> 
 <p>“I know you, and I know about your stories in Starnet Academy. I was interested in what you’ve been through even before I came here.” Ni Xue smiled.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was startled. “Interested? Me?” In his confusion, he carefully observed Ni Xue. Different faces, but the feeling she gave off was the same.</p> 
 <p>“Do you still remember the Blossom Pavilion? I had contact with the girls there, and they spoke highly of you. I had never seen them praise a man so much that I started to be very interested in you,” replied Ni Xue. Although her reason wasn’t quite sufficient, it was enough to persuade Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>After a brief silence, Ni Xue asked, “Your teacher… Has anyone ever asked you for her whereabouts?”</p> 
 <p>She once again startled Bai Xiaofei. <em>Just who is she?!</em></p>
