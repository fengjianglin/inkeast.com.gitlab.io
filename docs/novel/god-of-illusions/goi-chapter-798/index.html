 <p>Chapter 798: <a href="http://www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk/dictionary/words/57717/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wang Chuan</a>!</p> 
 <p>Despite staying up all night, Bai Xiaofei was quite chipper, as if he was not suffering a serious injury at all.</p> 
 <p>However, due to him being unable to muster any energy, Huskie and Blackie looked listless. The good thing was that they were not useless. This was the advantage of animated puppets. Even when their master could not use energy, they would still have some abilities.</p> 
 <p>As Fang Ye had once said, Bai Xiaofei currently could only rely on his puppets to support the rest.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Fei, you finally came down!” As soon as Bai Xiaofei appeared, Shi Kui went up to him, looking troubled as if he had encountered the problem of the century.</p> 
 <p>“Look at you, how is this the bearing of a high-ranked puppet master?” Bai Xiaofei smacked his head. <em>If you lot are still like this, how can this lord feel assured?!</em></p> 
 <p>“No, Brother Fei, you’ll be the same if you see this.” Shi Kui laughed bitterly and dragged Bai Xiaofei to the hall.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei wanted to ask what happened, but upon arriving at the hall, he instinctively gulped. <em>Wow damn! Shi Kui really can’t be blamed…</em></p> 
 <p>The whole inn had been booked by Bai Xiaofei’s group, so the people crowding the hall were all Bai Xiaofei’s people…</p> 
 <p>Or to be precise, his slaves, the girls with tragic fates who he had bought on the spur of the moment. Together with the rescued Paraselene girl, the strange teenager, and the Ghosting, everyone was staring at Bai Xiaofei, waiting for a verdict. He was the one who would decide their fate!</p> 
 <p>Everyone was displaying different emotions, such as curiosity, fear, caution, even reverence, and longing.</p> 
 <p>Qing Ya had done everything she could to explain the situation to them, but in the end, their identity as slaves prevented them from fully putting their trust in the person who bought them. Fortunately, Qing Ya had taken off the special collars, otherwise, they would not be quietly looking at Bai Xiaofei at the moment.</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother Fei, you should say something…” Shi Kui poked Bai Xiaofei and woke him up from his daze.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the members of the Savage Class were on the second-floor corridor looking down at the hall. No matter what expression they displayed, their thoughts were the same – <em>There’s a show to watch!</em></p> 
 <p>Suppressing the urge to drag them down and beat them up, Bai Xiaofei cleared his throat and looked at the crowd full of beauties.</p> 
 <p>At any rate, not one of them who was worthy of being put up for auction looked bad. Despite his rich experience with beautiful people, Bai Xiaofei still panicked a little.</p> 
 <p>“I think Qing Ya should have told you that I don’t intend to restrict your freedom. You can return to your home. From now on, you are no longer slaves.”</p> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei finished his words, the crowd’s reaction was not delight like he had imagined and instead desolation filled the air. Yes, they were told the same thing before, but many of them had been captured from their own homes…</p> 
 <p>“We have no place to go. Even if some do, it’s thousands of miles away. We can’t go back by ourselves.” The Paraselene girl seemed to have taken on the role of representative.</p> 
 <p>Her words struck Bai Xiaofei with realization, and when looking over at her, he was stunned.</p> 
 <p><em>Why does she look familiar?</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s eyes couldn’t help but linger on her face. His gaze was so obvious that her cheeks slowly turned red.</p> 
 <p>“Ahem,” Hu Xian’er on the second floor cleared her throat.</p> 
 <p>A chill ran down Bai Xiaofei’s back and he immediately returned to his senses. “Where is Fang Ye?”</p> 
 <p>“Here!” shouted Fang Ye. He knew the new group of people would be left to him for arrangements.</p> 
 <p>“From your expression, you must know what I mean.” Bai Xiaofei smiled.</p> 
 <p>His mysterious statement puzzled many people. <em>Ahh, exchanges between smart people can really make you doubt your intelligence!</em></p> 
 <p>“No worries, it’s on me.” Fang Ye patted his chest and turned to the crowd below. “You can rest assured that our Big Brother Fei is not the kind of person to leave things unfinished. Right now, you have two choices.”</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye paused a little to let his words sink. The beauties’ eyes immediately shone with hope.</p> 
 <p>“First option, we have a merchant group that’s in a dire need of personnel. I can arrange for you to work there, not as slaves, but as free people. Everyone is equal there. Second option, those who have a place to go can follow our people back to the merchant group and from there be escorted by workers to your destination. However, there won’t be any relation between us after that.”</p> 
 <p>With that, Fang Ye swept a glance around the hall.</p> 
 <p>“Those who choose the first, stand to the left, and the second one to stand to the right. You have ten minutes to think about it.”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Fang Ye’s voice fell, the girls seemed to not consider it at all, let alone take ten minutes, before standing uniformly to the left.</p> 
 <p>The only ones who stood still were the teenager and the Ghosting. The two had one thing in common: they did not understand what Fang Ye meant…</p> 
 <p>“Make arrangements and escort them back as soon as possible.” Bai Xiaofei smiled. Fang Ye’s plan was exactly what he wanted to say, but he would not have to lead these people in the future, so it was better to come from Fang Ye.</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye assented and withdrew with the group of beauties. However, three did not follow him: the immortal teenager, the Ghosting, and the Paraselene girl.</p> 
 <p>The first two Bai Xiaofei could handle, but the last one troubled him. The ‘big bosses’ were watching upstairs. Make a slight mistake and death would await! He had been brutally handled when demonized, let alone now when he was utterly powerless.</p> 
 <p>However, no matter what, these three could only be dealt with by him.</p> 
 <p>Biting the bullet, Bai Xiaofei first walked to the teenager.</p> 
 <p>“Do you have a name?”</p> 
 <p>In the face of his question, the teenager respectfully shook his head. The respect came from the beastly coercion previously from Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Then from today, you are Wang Chuan. No matter what you have been through, your life will be different from now on.”</p> 
 <p>“Wang… Chuan…” Slowly repeating his new name, the boy’s eyes turned red.</p> 
 <p>Before this, everyone only called him ‘monster’…</p> 
 <p>However, from today, he had a name, Wang Chuan!</p>
