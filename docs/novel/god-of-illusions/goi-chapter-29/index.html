 <p>The length of night was different for everyone.</p>
 <p>For a person like Bai Xiaofei who falls asleep upon touching the pillow, a night was something that passed in the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>But, to ordinary people like Mo Ka and the others, this night as absolutely the longest night in their over 10 years of life!</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Fei, it’s time to get up!” Mo Ka shook Bai Xiaofei lightly. He who basically hadn’t had a single wink of sleep had already become a panda, whereas, Si Kui and Wu Chi weren’t any better.</p>
 <p>“Eldest Mother, I’m going to sleep for a while longer....” Bai Xiaofei’s sleep talk caused a drop of cold sweat to be unable to help but flow out from Mo Ka and the others. Luckily, he’d called out ‘Eldest Mother’, otherwise, they really didn’t dare take advantage of it….</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Fei, it’s me, Mo Ka. We ought to go to class!” As he slightly increased the strength he exerted, Bai Xiaofei finally awoke from his hazy state, and he was shocked to the point of directly jumping up from his bed upon seeing Mo Ka’s face at a close distance.</p>
 <p>“F*ck! You’re going to scare me to death!” Bai Xiaofei looked towards the Origin Stone Clock on the table as he flicked his finger to strike Mo Ka on the forehead.</p>
 <p>“What’s all of you anxious about? It’s only eight.” Bai Xiaofei wore his clothes unhurriedly as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Fei, our class starts at 8, we’re already late now….” Mo Ka gulped down a mouthful of saliva before putting on a bitter face and actually spoke of a fact that he wasn’t willing to admit.</p>
 <p>Being late on the first day of classes was absolutely a step towards being targeted by the teacher yet they didn’t dare leave Bai Xiaofei behind. Because they were afraid of encountering Zhang Qingshan and the others, so suffering the fate of being cursed at together was their only choice.</p>
 <p>Now, all three of them just hoped that the words ‘the law excuses the masses’ had actual significance….</p>
 <p>However, reality was just so cruel, and Xue Ying who had a frosty expression was standing at the entrance waiting for them when they rushed hurriedly to the classroom.</p>
 <p>“Tsk, tsk. I truly admire the four of you. You dared to be late for the first class. Even though this is the first time I’m being a head teacher, I dare guarantee that there isn’t a single soul that’s as brave as all of you in this entire academy!” Xue Ying’s attitude instantly gave them the death sentence, and the last trace of hope in their hearts vanished like smoke.</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Xue, have you….”</p>
 <p>“Shut up! I don’t want to hear any flattery or explanations.” Bai Xiaofei had just spoken halfway when Xue Ying stopped him right away, and her attitude was simply as if she was a completely different person when compared to the day before.</p>
 <p>“I don’t like to talk nonsense. Get to your seats right now! All of you will get double of all the content in today’s class!” Contrary to Bai Xiaofei’s expectations, Xue Ying didn’t lecture them at all, and for a time, practically everyone had the misconception that Xue Ying was hard on the outside and soft on the inside….</p>
 <p>“Thank you, Big Sister Xue!” Bai Xiaofei grinned as he led the way into the classroom, and as soon as he returned to his seat, Lin Li who sat beside him revealed a relaxed expression before pulling on the corners of Bai Xiaofei’s clothes.</p>
 <p>“Dormitory…. So noisy….” Lin Li stuttered, and it caused Bai Xiaofei to blush with shame.</p>
 <p>If it was in terms of noisiness, then there ought to be no one that could compare with room 807 yesterday….</p>
 <p>“It was slightly noisy, but wasn’t it extremely interesting?” Bai Xiaofei chuckled. Playing with so many others of the same age was something that was unimaginable in the Gorge of Heroes.</p>
 <p>“Yes….” Lin Li replied lightly, and her slightly stiff face revealed a trace of a smile.</p>
 <p>It seemed as if being able to come into contact with so many people of the same generation was something new to Lin Li as well, and this was something that could be discerned from her completely obvious expressions.</p>
 <p>“Since everyone is here, then I’ll start the class officially now.” On the lectern, Xue Ying’s bearing still carried the formal feeling from at the entrance of the classroom earlier, and her icy cold face didn’t reveal the slightest fluctuation of feelings.</p>
 <p>“Firstly, I want to stress on one thing. If anyone dares to be late again, I’ll absolutely make that person suffer the consequences!” As she spoke, Xue Ying swept Bai Xiaofei and the other three with her gaze, and an unprecedented feeling of embarrassment gushed into Bai Xiaofei’s heart.</p>
 <p>“Of course, the four from today can’t escape this fate as well. &nbsp;I won’t allow it a single time! Even if it’s something I haven’t stressed upon, so long as anyone makes me unhappy, then that person will absolutely suffer!”</p>
 <p>A shapeless pressure was intentionally exerted by Xue Ying to descend onto every single student in the class, and even Lin Li who was at the Master Rank felt a trace of pressure.</p>
 <p>But, Bai Xiaofei and Lin Li weren’t very uncomfortable as both of them had experienced pressures that were much stronger than this.</p>
 <p>“Alright, no I need someone to answer my first question. What’s the most important quality to a puppet master?” As soon as she finished speaking, Xue Ying started scanning her gaze up and down the students in the entire class, and besides Bai Xiaofei and Lin Li, everyone else had fallen into deep contemplation at the same time.</p>
 <p>“Chen Hui, you answer it.” Chen Hui stood up directly when being named by Xue Ying, and he replied with a solemn expression. “The essence, energy, body, spirit, heart, and Origin Energy determine a puppet master’s strength, whereas, the spirit is the root, the Origin Energy is the foundation, and the heart is the core. So, I think these three things are the most important to a puppet master.” A trace of a confident expression had already appeared on Chen Hui’s face when he finished speaking because it was impossible to find a problem with an answer like this no matter where it was, and the reason was that it was common knowledge.</p>
 <p>“Well done. But, this isn’t what I want to teach all of you today.” Xue Ying had already charged to arrive instantly before Chen Hui before her voice finished resounding in the air, and a dagger that had suddenly appeared in her hand lay horizontally on Chen Hui’s throat.</p>
 <p>For a time, everyone was stunned on their seats, whereas, Chen Hui even started shaking uncontrollably.</p>
 <p>As she put the dagger away slowly, Xue Ying started to move around in the classroom, and no matter who she passed, she would tap the dagger on that person’s table.</p>
 <p>“No matter how formidable your puppets area, they would be useless if you don’t have the chance to utilize them. How to utilize puppets is something your new teachers will pass down to all of you after you’ve been divided into streams, whereas, I only want to pass down a single thing to all of you.” Xue Ying had already walked back to the lectern when she stopped moving, and the dagger in her hand was struck into the lectern before her with a clang.</p>
 <p>“Survival!” As soon as this word was spoken, everyone in the classroom was stunned, and even Bai Xiaofei who was accustomed to departing from established practices had never imagined that there would be such a statement.</p>
 <p>But when he thought about it carefully, there seemed to be nothing wrong with what Xue Ying said at all.</p>
 <p>“If one wants to survive in the complicated conditions of battle, then a puppet master must counter an innate weakness — The weakness of the puppet master’s own body!” Xue Ying started to expound on her unique idea, and at the very least, this was absolutely impossible to find in any of the other new student classes. Besides Xue Ying, all the teachers of the new students were speaking about the utilization of puppets and how to plan the type of puppet one would choose in the future.</p>
 <p>“In the following three months, no matter if it's my teaching or training towards all of you, it will circle around this single core, whereas, the main point in all abilities of survival is Physical strength!” As soon as she finished speaking, the corners of Xue Ying’s mouth curled slightly into a trace of an arc, and Bai Xiaofei who was stared at by her suddenly had a bad premonition….</p>
