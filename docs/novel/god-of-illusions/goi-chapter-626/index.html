 <p>Chapter 626: Illusory City!</p> 
 <p>With a wave from Bai Xiaofei, all the pedestrians around turned into light spots, followed by the disappearance of the buildings.</p> 
 <p>When it came to an end, the area was now empty, and what had been Doyle City seemed to have never existed at all. The only ones left were Bai Xiaofei and the Leng triplets standing behind him.</p> 
 <p>“Everything you saw just now was an illusion. The real Doyle City is still 10 miles away. All the people and buildings were built by me and my companions with illusions, so as long as you were still in ‘Doyle City,’ there was no secret to your movement.”</p> 
 <p>At Bai Xiaofei’s big reveal, Xiao Yao gulped with difficulty.</p> 
 <p><em>An illusory city?! What kind of masterpiece is that?! Such a huge illusion was created by only four people?!</em></p> 
 <p>There was a storm in Xiao Yao’s heart. He couldn’t believe it was true, but the fact was right before his eyes to deny it. However, he still ran his mouth.</p> 
 <p>“So, if I hadn’t run around the city like just now but simply ran out of it, you wouldn’t be able to do anything to me. I only lost to myself!” With a stubborn face, Xiao Yao made his final retort.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, it was meaningless.</p> 
 <p>“In that case, you wouldn’t be sitting here talking to me, you would already be a corpse,” as Bai Xiaofei used his most gentle tone to utter the most horrible words, one figure after another appeared in the surroundings.</p> 
 <p>The moment he saw these figures, Xiao Yao’s hair stood up – because they were all him!</p> 
 <p>“Let me introduce my companion’s ability. The second you stepped into our illusory city, you entered their illusion range. Every replica here comes from yourself. If they are hurt, a portion of the damage will be reflected back on you. If they all die at the same time, your Master Rank body won’t be able to bear the consequence.”</p> 
 <p>Saying this, Bai Xiaofei punched out and shattered a replica. Taking a part of the damage, Xiao Yao groaned. Bai Xiaofei didn’t lie to him…</p> 
 <p>“Convinced now?” Bai Xiaofei smiled as he looked down at Xiao Yao.</p> 
 <p>Their gazes collided. Bai Xiaofei’s eyes were full of confidence, while Xiao Yao’s had nothing but a dejected blank look.</p> 
 <p>He had lost, thoroughly! Whether Bai Xiaofei’s precise prediction that he would escape Doyle City or his illusion skills was not something that he was capable of.</p> 
 <p>“I see. Today is likely the last day of my existence. Who would have thought, huh? I, Xiao Yao, who have been free and unrestrained for over ten years, would meet my fate in this small place called Tranquil!” Xiao Yao smiled weakly. The depressed aura he exuded became even more dejected.</p> 
 <p>“Have I ever said that I wanted to kill you? If I really did, you think you’d have a chance to talk to me like this?” Bai Xiaofei burst out laughing. Xiao Yao was stupefied.</p> 
 <p>“I cheated 10 million Amethyst Coins from you. You’re not angry?” He was in disbelief.</p> 
 <p>“Of course I’m angry. Why else would I bother to go to such length to catch you? Do you think I’m that idle? However, no one says that you have to kill people when you’re angry. I prefer a win-win situation, and I also happen to cherish talents.” Bai Xiaofei chuckled. “However, you have to return my money first, and then compensate for my mental damage, lost time, and labor costs…”</p> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei finally finished listing, Xiao Yao swallowed several mouthfuls of saliva. <em>Motherf*cker, so many things?! How much money would that be?! I’d rather you just kill me!</em></p> 
 <p>“I don’t have that much money, but I have a genuine version of the fake knuckles earlier,” Xiao Yao took out another pair of knuckles with a pained expression.</p> 
 <p>Seeing the knuckles, Bai Xiaofei’s eyes lit up. He instantly put them on.</p> 
 <p>“No need to test. They are absolutely genuine. My life is in your hands, how dare I try any tricks?” Xiao Yao said.</p> 
 <p>“How did you make ordinary knuckles into equipment with the same effect?” Bai Xiaofei contentedly took off the knuckles. His eyes shifted from the knuckles to Xiao Yao, who was still in pain after submitting his precious treasure.</p> 
 <p>“It’s my puppet. It has the ability to change the characteristics of things I come into contact with. It’s a kind of illusion. When you are distracted, my illusion is easy to work,” Xiao Yao answered nonchalantly.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei’s eyes shone. This had been a valuable lesson for him. Before this, he had been relying completely on Huskie and Blackie for illusions. Xiao Yao’s information opened a new window for him. After all, this was the experience the guy had summed up after countless practices!</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei naturally wouldn’t let him know that. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to proceed with his next blackmail…</p> 
 <p>“These are good stuff, but still not enough. There must still be more in your rag.” Bai Xiaofei’s eyes drifted to the cloth hanging at Xiao Yao’s waist, scaring the guy so badly that he hurriedly moved it to his back.</p> 
 <p>“This is my life, my heart! Don’t you even think about it! However, as compensation, I can give you a piece of very useful information!” Xiao Yao tried to steer Bai Xiaofei’s attention away for fear that he would continue to stare at his ‘life and heart.’</p> 
 <p>“Very useful information?” repeating Xiao Yao’s words, Bai Xiaofei smiled faintly. “Are you sure what you have will interest <em>me</em>?”</p> 
 <p>In the face of Bai Xiaofei’s question, Xiao Yao’s mouth curved up.</p> 
 <p>“Of course. Do you think I just choose my target randomly? I did a preliminary investigation on you, and in the process, I discovered a secret.” Xiao Yao acted all mysterious, which successfully attracted Bai Xiaofei’s curiosity.</p> 
 <p>“Oh well, since you’re now a wingless bird, I guess it won’t hurt to hear what you have to say. If it’s really useful to me, I will let you go!” Bai Xiaofei stared fixedly at Xiao Yao and gave him the reply that he wanted.</p> 
 <p>Taking a deep breath, Xiao Yao spoke slowly, “How much do you know about this Tranquil Kingdom?” He didn’t get straight to the information Bai Xiaofei wanted but asked a seemingly irrelevant question.</p> 
 <p>“Why? Do you know Tranquil very well?” Bai Xiaofei asked back with a frown.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know much about it either, but there’s one thing I know that you don’t!” Grinning, Xiao Yao felt like he had seen his hope of survival.</p>
