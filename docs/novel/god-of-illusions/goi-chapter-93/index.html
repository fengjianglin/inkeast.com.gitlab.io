 <p><span style>It was common knowledge that dealing with beauties was a delightful thing. But, after an entire afternoon passed, Bai Xiaofei’s group of three that were both tired and hungry didn’t feel delighted in the slightest, but they were really in pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That type of exhaustion from exhaustion of both the body and mind!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Fei, we’ve only met five senior sisters so far. When will we even be done with all of them!?” Grumbled Wu Chi who was exhausted from appreciating beauties, and if he could choose, he would rather exchange places with Mo Ka now than ‘enjoy’ this opportunity to meet beauties.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During this entire afternoon, every single one of the five senior sisters they met possessed exceptional advantageous in various aspects, but similarly, they had their own unique characters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them talked aimlessly at the beginning and only got to the main point after one was already extremely tired….</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, after experiencing this afternoon, all three of them had understood a single thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, all the senior sisters on the Blossom Rankings were lonely, and they wanted to experience a period of grand love just like an ordinary girl. But, out of consideration for their identities, they kept having the feeling that those people who came looking for them carried malicious intentions. So, as time went by, they’d constructed a high wall in their hearts that blocked everyone out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three of them could be said to have gone around this wall by coincidence and successively witnessed the true appearance of many ordinary young women.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The label of beauty was a burden sometimes, so, the requirements put forward by these senior sisters basically had a common point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Genuineness!</span></p>
 <p><span style>They hoped that the people who passed through Bai Xiaofei’s tests to meet them would be genuine and allowed them to easily put down their defenses before experiencing a real relationship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, this ran slightly in the opposite direction of Bai Xiaofei’s initial thoughts because most of the people capable of passing the tests Bai Xiaofei and Fang Ye designed would surely be rich fellows, whereas, very few of these playboys would satisfy this requirement….</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Bai Xiaofei was Bai Xiaofei in the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With his silver tongue and ability to adapt to the situation, he suggested a plan to deal with this right away, and it gained the agreement of all the senior sisters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His plan was to provide a concealed message to them!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When there was someone that conformed to their requirements, Bai Xiaofei would add on a concealed message to the proof those that passed the test received, so when someone that possessed this concealed message were to appear, the senior sisters could open their hearts up completely, whereas, they only had to deal with them for a while if they didn’t.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this way, Bai Xiaofei and the senior sisters were able to attain a win-win situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was also during this time that Wu Chi and Shi Kui who were already accustomed to this had once again witnessed Bai Xiaofei’s ability to react to the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Err, more precisely speaking, it was his ways of thinking to earn money….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’re both of you getting anxious for? Have both of you forgotten what Fang Ye said? Earning money isn’t a simple matter, and it’s already not bad that everything has been able to go smoothly so far. Now we lack time, and money will fall into our hands sooner or later.” Bai Xiaofei who was similarly exhausted drank a mouthful of water before heaving a long sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though he was educating Wu Chi and Shi Kui, Bai Xiaofei was actually slightly anxious in his heart as well. The only difference was that he was able to control his feelings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sometimes, this was the difference between a leader and those who were led!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then will we be continuing at night?” Shi Kui asked while refusal was shown all over his face because he really didn’t want to go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course we are! But, both of you can find someone to take your places. Xing Nan and the others ought to be free, so ask them to come accompany me.” As soon as Bai Xiaofei finished speaking, Wu Chi and Shi Kui instantly revealed smiled of release.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Fei is the most considerate! I’ll go look for them right away!” His voice hadn’t finished resounding out in the air when Wu Chi had already charged off like the wind, and the effect of their training in the Infinite Mountain Range was vividly displayed at this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a good for nothing motherf*cker! I’ll surely reduce the amount of money he can use and cause him to be unable to afford a puppet when the time comes.” Bai Xiaofei spat, causing the nearby Shi Kui to be unable to restrain a drop of cold sweat from seeping out of his forehead.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I wouldn’t have been put on his blacklist as well, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As he thought like this, Shi Kui was slightly hesitant. But, he’d forgotten something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Chi didn’t need a puppet….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right, tell everyone later that they can start going to choose puppets in the next few days so as to avoid wasting time when the time comes, and we can buy it right away once we have the money.” As he finally spoke of a happy matter, Shi Kui instantly revealed a slight expression of happiness, and then he agreed before running off like the wind just as Wu Chi had.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei sighed to himself after Wu Chi left. </span><i><span style>A second puppet, when will I be able to f*cking get a second puppet. How will I f*cking advance this f*cking scam of a cultivation technique!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei cursed Old Man Revelations fiercely in his heart because even up until this moment, he still didn’t know what exactly had happened to him….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Time flowed by slowly. Xing Nan and Mo Ka came to see Bai Xiaofei as replacements before the three of them stepped foot on the path of no return to pay a visit to all those senior sisters on the Blossom Rankings….</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Fang Ye who was in charge of recruiting new members greeted a busy period of his own. After the matter that occurred yesterday, the New Student Mutual Aid Community instantly became a powerful magnet that caused practically all the new students to surge over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t for the girls coming over to help Fang Ye, he would absolutely be exhausted to the point of breaking down by now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, as the son of a merchant, Fang Ya enjoyed this sort of feeling because it was simply like the difference between the heavens and the earth when compared to his days of aimlessly letting the days pass by!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was also at this moment that Fang Ye started feeling fortunate that he decided to come study at Starnet Academy, and he felt fortunate that he’d encountered Bai Xiaofei and everyone else in the Savage Class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was said that Fang Ye used to be a son of the rich that only intended to loaf around, then he wasn’t anymore!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Brightmoon Merchant Group belonged only to him, Fang Ye!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rest for a while, you’ve already been busy all day.” Xu Chen blushed as she passed a towel to Fang Ye, and this only happened because Bai Xiaofei and the others weren’t here, otherwise Xu Chen wouldn’t even come over even if she was beaten to death….</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pressure of public opinion was too terrifying!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m fine. This is so much simpler when compared to a merchant group. Even though I never cared about it in the past, I’ve seen it more or less. Moreover, I’m taking it as laying down the foundation for the future.” Fang Ye grinned while he revealed an expression of delight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps Xu Chen’s existence was one of the reasons Fang Ye changed because he didn’t want to be unworthy of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, a formidable puppet master was much more valuable than a small merchant group!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then don’t exhaust yourself. Your body is your capital for growth, don’t forget what Big Sister Xue said.” Xu Chen revealed a trace of shyness that didn’t conform to her usual self as she spoke with persistence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother has also said that we should try our best while we’re young, and I’m gathering experience for the future right now. Opportunities like this are rare, not to mention everyone in our class is counting on this money to buy their new puppets.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei and Xue Ying were both dragged out at the same time in their conversation, and it obviously showed the influence both Xue Ying and Bai Xiaofei had on everyone in the Savage Class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then let’s work hard together!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Who said a tigress couldn’t be gentle? She got shy before the person she liked!</span></p>
