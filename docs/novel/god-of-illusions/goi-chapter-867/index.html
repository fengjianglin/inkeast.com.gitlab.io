 <p>Chapter 867: Golden Corpse’s Weakness!</p> 
 <p>“Senior, if you don’t mind, please tell me everything in detail, because I will definitely cross paths with that person again,” Bai Xiaofei said.</p> 
 <p>Pinocchio’s eyes lit up. “Are you certain?!” He trembled slightly as the expectation on his face could not be concealed at all.</p> 
 <p>“I am. I and Shadow Death shall not coexist in the same world!” Bai Xiaofei declared.</p> 
 <p>“Shall not coexist, huh?! Good, very good!” Pinocchio burst out laughing before a deep hatred descended on his expression. “It’s a long story, which started when I just became a godsmith. According to the usual practice, I would choose an apprentice to train as my heir. That was when I met Kim.”</p> 
 <p>As Pinocchio sank into memory, Bai Xiaofei pricked up his ears.</p> 
 <p>“Whether it was perseverance or talent, Kim could be said to be outstanding. He soon learned nearly 80% of my skills, and on top of that, he had a gift as a puppet master that I don’t. Almost overnight, he became widely popular in the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain.”</p> 
 <p>“One day, he set out to explore the world, only to return in excitement with a remnant blueprint. Despite that, I could see that once the design was realized, it would be at least a peak-grade violetgold puppet, and might even possibly reach the legendary blackgold rank with effort!”</p> 
 <p>“I could not resist such a temptation. I never left my room for three years on end, and only emerged with a prototype of that puppet. But on that day, the bastard moved against me. He had always been a member of Shadow Death, as it turned out. He had that blueprint from the start and approached me to craft the puppet. He attacked thinking I only emerged after refining the complete puppet.”</p> 
 <p>“Fortunately, I had a plan on that day to have a discussion with the other godsmiths about the final stage of the puppet. They arrived in time to save me from that bastard, while he escaped from the mountain with the golden corpse prototype.”</p> 
 <p>At this point, Pinocchio was shaking with anger. If it wasn’t that Bai Xiaofei had let him see the light of hope, he wouldn’t even think about recalling this memory.</p> 
 <p>“After that day, a Shadow Death assassin that gave everyone a headache appeared. After constant attempts, his golden corpse was built little by little. However, he underestimated the fury of the continent. Countless top-class puppet masters hunted him down and heavily injured him. He escaped and did not appear again for many years… until the anniversary of Starnet two years ago…”</p> 
 <p>Pinocchio looked at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“If I’m not wrong, that golden corpse is now at least high-grade violetgold. However, it is not without flaws. Since you’re going to deal with him, I will give you some advice,” said Pinocchio, his eyes desolate. “After all, this is the only thing that this useless old man can do…”</p> 
 <p>A short silence ensued, then he looked at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Although powerful, the golden corpse has weaknesses. First of all, anyone who links with it will lose all of their other puppets. Moreover, all the undead corpses made by the golden corpse have a fatal weakness: every once in a while, they must accept energy infusion from the puppet master, otherwise they will go out of control!”</p> 
 <p>“Note that this loss of control is not something like shutting down. They will become uncontrolled entities that attack friend and foe alike, and this is irreversible. Even if the puppet master infuses energy into them again, they still won’t regain control over them.”</p> 
 <p>“Besides this, the golden corpse requires a huge amount of origin energy to maintain, so the puppet master probably won’t have spare energy to do anything else aside from controlling it. In other words, he does not have the basic abilities that other Grandmaster Rank and Exquisite Rank puppet masters have. As long as you can get close to him, he will be dead without a doubt!”</p> 
 <p>It was as if Pinocchio had rehearsed this passage many times. What he lacked was a person who could get revenge for him.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you, Senior.” Bai Xiaofei solemnly bowed to Pinocchio as he firmly committed everything to memory. The information might probably save his life in the future!</p> 
 <p>“I should thank you instead. Alright, I’ve said everything. You can ask me anything, including tailoring a puppet for you. Consider it an advanced payment.” Upon mentioning his expertise, Pinocchio looked very proud.</p> 
 <p>If he declared to be the number two smith, no one in the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain would dare to call themselves number one!</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, Bai Xiaofei had to let him down…</p> 
 <p>“Then I won’t hold back.” Smiling, Bai Xiaofei took a deep breath. “Senior, what do you think of human puppets?”</p> 
 <p>His eyes shone expectantly as he asked this question. As the First Godsmith who had seen human puppets for himself, Pinocchio’s words were definitely of great referential value!</p> 
 <p>“Hmph! Except for that damn fellow, I can’t think of a second person who would do this kind of thing. Besides, only he would do something so cruel to me! Only when I die can he ascend to the position of First Godsmith!” Pinocchio, as always, did not beat around the bush. It could not be clearer who he was talking about.</p> 
 <p>The Second Godsmith, Nanmo Sheng!</p> 
 <p>Recalling what he knew about Nanmo Sheng, Bai Xiaofei hesitated. According to common knowledge, Nanmo Sheng boarded the godly rank by making gun puppets, which was a far cry from human puppets no matter how one looked at it.</p> 
 <p>“Senior, please forgive me if I offend you, but how did you reach that conclusion?”</p> 
 <p>Pinocchio instantly grew emotional.</p> 
 <p>“How?! Because that shitty puppet command technology is developed by him! He has wanted to steal my title for a long time now. Because he keeps researching shady things every day!”</p> 
 <p>Pinocchio’s words kept becoming more and more outrageous as he ranted. In Bai Xiaofei’s view, none of this was evidence that the human puppet matter was related to Nanmo Sheng. It sounded more like Pinocchio was taking the opportunity to vent.</p> 
 <p>Otherwise, Yun Tianhe would not go to the border to investigate.</p> 
 <p><em>Oh well, it seems I won’t get anything else here.</em> Bai Xiaofei thought.</p> 
 <p>Just then, Golden Feather’s voice rang out in his mind, “He may be able to help us!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p> 
 <p>“Senior, I still have a favor to ask,” he said with an anxious heart.</p> 
 <p><em>In any case, you need to help me with this, old man!</em></p>
