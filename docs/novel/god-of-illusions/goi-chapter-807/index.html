 <p>Chapter 807: A Storm Coming!</p> 
 <p>“How’s it going?”</p> 
 <p>In the city lord’s mansion, a group of people surrounded Tan Xin, looking at her in anticipation.</p> 
 <p>“They have entered the Windless Zone and are going deeper in,” said Tan Xin, whose eyes were closed. In her mind there was a projected scene of Tong Fei’s group and their conversation.</p> 
 <p>“As long as they don’t go someplace else, or else all the news we’ve spread before would be in vain.” Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p> 
 <p>The particularity of the Windless Zone, as well as the Blood Diamonds, made it easy for people to guess the location of the base of the All-Around Merchant Group. However, a guess remained a guess before it was proved.</p> 
 <p>“Does that mean we can proceed with our plan now?” said Fang Ye eagerly, looking as if he just wanted to rush into the Windless Zone.</p> 
 <p>“Of course!” Bai Xiaofei affirmed.</p> 
 <p>Everyone’s eyes shone. <em>This mission is finally reaching an end!</em></p> 
 <p>“I know you guys are very excited, but this time it is different from before and I want your utmost focus. No matter what happens, ensuring your own safety is the top priority,” said Bai Xiaofei as he suddenly grew solemn.</p> 
 <p>This cold water doused the group’s enthusiasm. They woke up with a start and also became more serious than ever.</p> 
 <p>Even though they had gone through a tragic experience with Ling Tianxia, in the end, it was Lei Shan who had forced him to retreat. This time, they had no absolute power backing them and only had themselves to rely on!</p> 
 <p>“Boss, tell that to yourself. You are the one with the worst survival ability at the moment.” Seeing that the atmosphere was about to turn cold, Mo Ka jumped out with a fact that rendered Bai Xiaofei speechless.</p> 
 <p>Indeed, the only one Bai Xiaofei was currently stronger than was Gu Lingyue. He could not beat any of the rest…</p> 
 <p>“Shut your trap and maybe you’ll have two more years to live.” Bai Xiaofei shot Mo Ka a glare and took a deep breath. “Let’s go!”</p> 
 <p>From the entrance of the city lord’s mansion, a black-clad Bai Xiaofei led at the front of the group of energetic Savage Class members. Behind them were the mighty-looking Windlove Army, who moved without making abundant noise.</p> 
 <p>From a normal point of view, their actions should have been executed in secrecy. However, Bai Xiaofei made it so extravagant as if afraid that others wouldn’t know.</p> 
 <p>“Captain, they have set out.” Not long after Bai Xiaofei and his party left Windlove City, the people of Devil Forest reported it to Zhu Wuxin.</p> 
 <p>“Tell our people to get ready. We will fully dispatch!” Zhu Wuxin icily ordered. His originally handsome face had been ruined with a ferocious burn scar.</p> 
 <p>“Captain, I think they may have other plans. This kind of movement is really abnormal!” said the vice captain anxiously.</p> 
 <p>However, Zhu Wuxin ignored his words. “We are obviously not that boy’s goal. They want us to muddy the waters, so I shall satisfy them, but I will not stand on their side! I want them to know what it means to be hoisted by their own petard!”</p> 
 <p>Zhu Wuxin obviously saw things very clearly, but it was exactly this that concerned the vice captain. Zhu Wuxin had been overtaken by hatred. If things really went as one imagined, there wouldn’t be so many accidents in this world. Moreover, the vice captain did not believe that Bai Xiaofei would lead people over without certainty…</p> 
 <p>However, Zhu Wuxin was the leader. His words were like an imperial edict to Devil Forest!</p> 
 <p>Just after the Devil Forest people were deployed, those in Windlove City who had been waiting on the sidelines grew excited. Certain affairs were hard for individuals to judge, but it was never wrong to follow big organizations!</p> 
 <p>The news released by Bai Xiaofei declared that this would be a profitable chaotic battle. As loners, they did not need to help any side, they just need to be there and reap the benefits. Those who looked on the bright side refused to believe that those big bosses would target them!</p> 
 <p>In this way, nearly the whole city rushed towards the Windless Zone, and such a grand occasion naturally did not escape the notice of Unify Business.</p> 
 <p>“We underestimated that boy!”</p> 
 <p>Inside the Unify building, several people sat together, each looking solemn except for the middle-aged man sitting in the most important seat. If Bai Xiaofei were here, he would be very excited, because this man was a branch president of Unify Business, Sikong Ming!</p> 
 <p>“Even so, they are just a group of children. You are too nervous.” Sikong Ming chuckled, his tone relaxed.</p> 
 <p>“Children? Don’t forget this group of children made Ling Tianxia and the headquarters eat a big loss,” a bony old man retorted.</p> 
 <p>“Elder Bone, do you mean we are as stupid as those idiots?” asked Sikong Ming.</p> 
 <p>Old Bone immediately quieted down. After all, it was impossible to admit that he was an idiot…</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, this is the Windless Zone. What we’ve accumulated over ten years here isn’t for nothing. The only troublesome thing is that little girl.” When mentioning Tan Xin, Sikong Ming looked troubled.</p> 
 <p>Back then, he had established a cooperative relationship with Windlove City instead of directly replacing it, and the reason was Tan Xin’s unpredictable strength, who clearly didn’t emit any energy fluctuations but was brutally powerful.</p> 
 <p>“In any case, the people from headquarters will come over this time. That Zhao Ji thinks he is so smart. Did he really think we wouldn’t know that the female worm had matured in advance?” said another person disdainfully.</p> 
 <p>“Since so many people are coming, this will be a rare lively event. Let us use this to make a name for ourselves. Nine big mercenary groups, the miracle generation of Starnet Academy, and in addition Windlove City. If they all die in our hands, the whole continent will be upturned!” Sikong Ming suddenly laughed hysterically in sharp contrast with his previous composed manner.</p> 
 <p>“Fair enough. It’s time for the continent to remember us. Let’s settle that debt while we’re at it!” The last person followed Sikong Ming’s words with a sneer.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go, we should head out as well!”</p> 
 <p>With a wave of Sikong Ming’s hand, the group headed out. The whole Unify Business also moved…</p> 
 <p>“They stopped!”</p> 
 <p>After entering the Windless Zone, Bai Xiaofei’s group quietly followed the route that Tong Fei’s group took. At the same time, they experienced for themselves how miraculous the Blood Diamonds were.</p> 
 <p>The Windless Zone that terrified all puppet masters had completely turned into a safe area with the Blood Diamonds. As long as one kept a Blood Diamond on them, the zone’s special effect would not pose any problems.</p> 
 <p>“The scent… disappeared…” Tan Xin was suddenly dumbstruck. This was the first time she had encountered this situation.</p> 
 <p>“It should be a formation that isolates their scent,” Golden Feather explained. She was definitely the best expert on formations among the people present.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei thought for a moment, then decided, “We’ll go as planned!”</p> 
 <p>They had executed the plan to wreck the base of the All-Around Merchant Group no less than 100 times in their minds, and so they were moving very smoothly. Before long, only six people were left around Bai Xiaofei: Hu Xian’er, Tan Xin, Wang Chuan, Wu Chi, Wang Hang, and Yu Linfeng, the captain of the Windlove Army.</p> 
 <p>In other words, everyone who stayed behind was a life-saving expert. Of course, except Bai Xiaofei…</p> 
 <p>Under Tan Xin’s guidance, the small group quickly arrived at the place where Tong Fei’s scent disappeared. There was nothing around but barren land littered with the skeletons of wild animals. Not a single shadow could be seen.</p> 
 <p>“Can this be a base camp?” Wu Chi was full of disbelief. He would rather believe that this was a wasteland.</p> 
 <p>“Soon you will know what it means to ‘hide a different world.’” Having seen a similar formation in the Snow Kingdom, Bai Xiaofei turned to Golden Feather. “Aunt Gold, all yours.”</p> 
 <p>Golden Feather looked around and before long, she smiled. The next second, a small flame flared on her palm, turning into thumb-sized flame snakes that swam out to the positions she selected. Then, with a snap of her fingers, the snakes exploded, and an energy fluctuation spread.</p> 
 <p>However…</p> 
 <p>“Is it over?” Looking around to find no changes at all, Wu Chi’s confusion deepened.</p> 
 <p>Even Bai Xiaofei was stupefied.</p> 
 <p>“I feel their presence again!” Tan Xin suddenly exclaimed. The scent of Tong Fei’s group had been restored.</p> 
 <p>“How is it?” Bai Xiaofei immediately went to her.</p> 
 <p>Before Tan Xin could answer, Wang Chuan suddenly pounced over. “Master, be careful!”</p> 
 <p>The moment Wang Chuan pushed Bai Xiaofei and Tan Xin away, a dazzling light pierced his chest. However, the wound recovered the next second. His Immortal Physique did not get its name for nothing.</p> 
 <p>“Get out here!!” After realizing what just happened, Tan Xin’s face darkened. Energy surged out from her, and the ground started to quake like crazy.</p> 
 <p>“Stabilize!”</p> 
 <p>Seven, eight figures shot out from the ground. One of them pressed their hands on the ground, and the violent quake instantly stopped.</p> 
 <p>“Underground, huh?” Hu Xian’er sneered. The next instant, Permanence activated and her figure flashed. The other party collapsed one by one until a person emitted a golden light that bounced Hu Xian’er away.</p> 
 <p>“Trigger-type puppet? Leave it to me!” Yu Linfeng joined the fight. His body vanished in a wisp of smoke and when he reappeared, the person who had just repelled Hu Xian’er had become a dry corpse.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Wang Hang had stabbed his dagger into the puppet master who had just stabilized the ground. In just a few blinks, the enemy party only had one person left. The small elite team was no laughing matter!</p> 
 <p>And it was only the beginning!</p>
