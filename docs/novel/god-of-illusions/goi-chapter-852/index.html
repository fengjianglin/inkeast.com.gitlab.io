 <p>Chapter 852: People are Divided by Status!</p> 
 <p>One had to admit that the Starnet Brilliance was very useful. After confirming that the piece in Bai Xiaofei’s hand was the real thing, the guard’s attitude suddenly turned into that of an enthusiastic restaurant’s waiter. It wouldn’t even be strange if he asked for Bai Xiaofei’s signature if he recognized who the latter was.</p> 
 <p>Entering the city, Huskie completely let go of himself as he plunged into the crowd. He had not forgotten that they were going to eat first!</p> 
 <p>“As expected of an empire. Even a border city is already comparable to the capital of many countries,” Bai Xiaofei commented heartily as he looked around the bustling streets.</p> 
 <p><em>If a border city is already like this, how prosperous will the imperial city be?</em> Walking as he thought, Bai Xiaofei started to look forward to his ultimate destination.</p> 
 <p>“Found it. Let’s go to Huskie,” mumbled Bai Xiaofei after he got a message from Huskie in his mind. Regarding finding food, Huskie was second to none.</p> 
 <p>Picking up his pace, Bai Xiaofei quickly found a drooling Huskie in front of a restaurant. He looked up at the name plaque and could not help but smile wryly.</p> 
 <p>Thousand Aroma Restaurant…</p> 
 <p><em>I pried Brother Lu from this place… I wonder how they’re doing now…</em> He sighed softly at the thought of his faraway friends.</p> 
 <p>“Honored guest, please come in! There just happened to be a vacant seat, you really came at the right time!” a waiter hurriedly came over and greeted Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Although the business was great, they did not neglect a single guest. A smart business never looked down on customers.</p> 
 <p>“Please forgive us. There are a lot of people since it’s mealtime.” The waiter once again showed his EQ as he led Bai Xiaofei to a table.</p> 
 <p>“It’s fine as long as the food’s good,” said Bai Xiaofei as he accepted the menu.</p> 
 <p>“You can rest assured, honored guest! We, Thousand Aroma Restaurant, won’t brag about anything else, but our food is absolutely top-class!” the waiter laughed amiably.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had also finished choosing the dishes. “This, this, this, and this.” He pointed at four in a row.</p> 
 <p><em>Just how… uninformed he is?! All of them are unpopular dishes!</em> The waiter thought, but as worried as he was about Bai Xiaofei’s ‘precision,’ he did not show it on his face.</p> 
 <p>“Just these four? I will inform the kitchen.”</p> 
 <p>“No, no, no, you got me wrong. I don’t want these four. I want the rest, one of each. No, wait, five servings for the Golden Hook Fish.” Thinking of Blackie’s favorite food, Bai Xiaofei hurriedly corrected.</p> 
 <p>The waiter was stunned. He stuttered, “Er… Honored guest, you…”</p> 
 <p>After all, this was the first time he had encountered this kind of situation.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry. I have money.” Bai Xiaofei took out an Amethyst Card.</p> 
 <p>The sharp-eyed waiter instantly judged the plausibility of the card. “No, no, no! My lord, this little one didn’t mean that. I mean it’s impossible to place so many dishes here.” The clever guy instantly found a good reason.</p> 
 <p>“Well, that’s true. Should I wait?” Bai Xiaofei frowned. He was so occupied by the thought of eating that he failed to consider this.</p> 
 <p>“That’s not necessary. Would you like to consider making a VIP card? There are two VIP rooms above. If you…”</p> 
 <p>“You mean this?” A jade-inlaid gold card appeared in Bai Xiaofei’s hand.</p> 
 <p><em>A Supreme VIP card!!!</em></p> 
 <p>The waiter froze on the spot. <em>Oh my Lord!! Who is he?! Why would this kind of character come to this small city?!!!</em></p> 
 <p>“My… my… my lord, please forgive this little one for my neglect!!” His whole body trembling, the waiter’s knees dropped to the ground before Bai Xiaofei could react.</p> 
 <p>Curious eyes in the restaurant immediately gathered at Bai Xiaofei’s table. However, upon seeing the VIP card, they turned their heads.</p> 
 <p>There were some shows one just could not afford to watch…</p> 
 <p>“Get up, get up, it’s not your fault, you only followed the rules. If you hadn’t mentioned it, I would have forgotten that I still have this thing.” Bai Xiaofei chuckled as he inwardly thanked Lu Lingyun. It seemed that this VIP card was not simple at all!</p> 
 <p>“Thank you for your magnanimity. Please come with me upstairs.” Feeling as if he just survived a disaster, the waiter quickly got up.</p> 
 <p>The VIP room deserved its name. It was luxurious enough to have a banquet in.</p> 
 <p>“My lord, do you need anything else? If you need entertainment, this one can arrange for you,” offered the waiter after Bai Xiaofei was seated.</p> 
 <p>“No, just bring the food quickly. I’m starving.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei smiled bitterly. Standing out too much was indeed inconvenient sometimes…</p> 
 <p>After the waiter left, Bai Xiaofei summoned Golden Feather, “Aunt Gold, let’s eat together.”</p> 
 <p>After such a long time, she looked much healthier.</p> 
 <p>“Are those little girls all gone?” This was the first thing she asked after coming out from the puppet space.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei felt a little ashamed. <em>Just how long has it been since Aunt Gold last came out?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Yes, all gone. They all have something to do,” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly glossed it over and shifted the topic to Golden Feather, “Aunt Gold, you seem to be…”</p> 
 <p>“Mhm, I ranked up,” Golden Feather announced, her tone nonchalant but the joy on her face was obvious.</p> 
 <p>She once thought that she could never advance again in her life, especially when her injury worsened every day after falling into the space cracks. Now, however, not only had the injury recovered, but the barrier that had stopped her for many years had also been broken through.</p> 
 <p>“Really?!” Bai Xiaofei was extremely excited. Golden Feather was already super strong before. He could not imagine how powerful she was after ranking up!</p> 
 <p>“You should know this better than me. After all, I advanced because of you,” Golden Feather said.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei stared blankly in confusion.</p> 
 <p><em>What the?! Because of me?? What did I do??!</em></p>
