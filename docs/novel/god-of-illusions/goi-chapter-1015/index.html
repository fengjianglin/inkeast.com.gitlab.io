 <p>Chapter 1015: Consider Yourself Formidable!</p> 
 <p>“Can’t you say it already?” urged Bai Xiaofei as Qiu Muxue remained silent.</p> 
 <p>With a reluctant expression, she took a deep breath and started talking.</p> 
 <p>“In fact, the reason why I could get to this position is because someone helped me.” At the mention of this person, she looked conflicted.</p> 
 <p>“This person has something for you, huh?” Bai Xiaofei immediately picked up on it.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, he… has feelings for me.” Qiu Muxue nodded with a wry smile.</p> 
 <p>Seeing her like this, Lan Shuang couldn’t take it anymore and jumped in, “Forget it, let me. He’s the only son of the Third Elder and a captain of 500. However, he got to that position not because of his father. He is quite capable and his strength is only below the five elders,” she spilled everything rapidly. “After Muxue and I returned from Starnet, he set his eyes on her, wanting her to marry him. We used him a little and made Muxue the Saintess, but Barbaric Godism isn’t so easy to fool. Without any contributions, her position would be unstable. However, that guy told Muxue not to worry and that even if all the troops she took out died, he would still guarantee her safety.”</p> 
 <p>In fact, before meeting Bai Xiaofei, Qiu Muxue was ready to sacrifice herself, but his emergence allowed her to see a glimmer of hope. She never had thought that it would still come to this in the end…</p> 
 <p>“You actually kept such an ace card from me?! If you had told me about it earlier, we would have penetrated the Sacks’ stronghold by now!” Bai Xiaofei sprang up in delight. Despite having no idea who the man was or what he looked like, his existence alone already enabled a plan that could make Barbaric Godism completely fall apart!</p> 
 <p>“You!” Qiu Muxue glared resentfully at Bai Xiaofei but didn’t know what to say next. In the end, she accepted her fate with a sneer. “Forget it, it’s what I already prepared for anyway. Tell me, what price are you going to sell me for?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was startled by the chilling air she emitted.</p> 
 <p><em>What’s going on? Did I say something I shouldn't have said?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Wait, what are you thinking? What do you mean by selling you?” He looked at her innocently.</p> 
 <p>“Didn’t you want to use me to exploit Mamba? Or do you have a more decent way to word it?” Qiu Muxue’s voice was ice-cold.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei burst out laughing. “So that's what you’re thinking!” His laughter kept getting louder and louder, and once he was done laughing, the two women were staring at him like he was crazy.</p> 
 <p>“I won't explain it, but you should understand after seeing this.” Bai Xiaofei raised his hand, which then released a faint light of energy.</p> 
 <p>Qiu Muxue and Lan Shuang stared in shock before their eyes shone with delight once they understood what it meant.</p> 
 <p>“I'm giving the order to abandon this place now! We’re returning to the grassland tomorrow! No! Tonight!” Qiu Muxue didn’t want to wait any longer.</p> 
 <p>Just like that, the last fortress still occupied by the Sacks was abandoned. When Moonlight finally noticed this, Qiu Muxue’s army was already returning to the Sacks clan.</p> 
 <p>“You’re the mighty Saintess of Barbaric Godism. Can’t you use a better carriage?” Bai Xiaofei complained as he was squeezed into Qiu Muxue’s small carriage with the person herself.</p> 
 <p>It couldn’t be helped, their current positions were too embarrassing. If Bai Xiaofei didn’t say something to ease the atmosphere, the embarrassment would kill him.</p> 
 <p>“Be grateful that we even have one. I don’t mind if you go out, but I can’t guarantee that everyone is friendly,” retorted Qiu Muxue as she stretched her legs to unwind them. However, to do this in the current situation…</p> 
 <p>“You are challenging my instincts as a man.” Bai Xiaofei tried to move away from those long legs, but there was no room to and the carriage swaying made him end up even closer to her.</p> 
 <p>“What can I do? It's been over three hours. If I don't move, I may lose my legs.” Her face was hot, but Qiu Muxue refused to lose verbally.</p> 
 <p>“Fine, whatever you say is right! How much longer is this gonna be?” Bai Xiaofei already began to regret hiding in this carriage. If he had known, he would have just disguised as a bodyguard!</p> 
 <p>“At least three days. What’s with you? I, a girl, am not worried about being taken advantage of, and yet you, a smelly man, thinks you’re in a place where you can complain about it?” Qiu Muxue rolled her eyes.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was speechless. <em>I'd rather not take this kind of advantage!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Shut up and sleep if you have nothing to do!” Qiu Muxue closed her eyes.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei sighed and leaned back his head on the carriage wall, forcing himself to sleep as well…</p> 
 <p>“Saintess, time to get off and have a rest.” Lan Shuang gently called out, but there was no response from the carriage.</p> 
 <p>The people around immediately looked at Lan Shuang curiously.</p> 
 <p>“What are you looking at?! Don’t you have work to do? The Saintess is obviously in a bad mood. Are you tired of living?” Lan Shuang reprimanded.</p> 
 <p>Hearing that the Saintess was in a bad mood, everyone immediately ran away like escaping from hell.</p> 
 <p>After confirming that there was no one else around, Lan Shuang slowly lifted the curtain, only to be shocked…</p> 
 <p>The two people inside were tangled in a strange posture, sleeping soundly as saliva trickled down from the corners of their mouths.</p> 
 <p>Stunned for a moment, Lan Shuang thought for a while before saying, “We’ve arrived.”</p> 
 <p>The two sleeping people were jolted awake. A loud thud rang out as their heads collided.</p> 
 <p>“Bai Xiaofei, you’re seeking death!!” Qiu Muxue roared in pain.</p> 
 <p>But when she wanted to attack, their tangled postures made both of them lose their balance. With another heavy thud, they collided again…</p> 
 <p>“Can you stop laughing?!”</p> 
 <p>In the temporary tent, Qiu Muxue, who was tentatively dabbing at the two big bumps on her forehead, glared at Lan Shuang who had been snickering nonstop. In a corner, Bai Xiaofei was applying ice to his forehead.</p> 
 <p>“Okay, okay, I won't laugh!” Lan Shuang said, but as soon as she finished, a snicker escaped her lips again.</p> 
 <p>“You over there, we will arrive at the territory of Barbaric Godism in two days. What is your plan?” Qiu Muxue ignored Lan Shuang and grumpily looked at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“I don't think it will take two days, so we will start with our roles tomorrow,” Bai Xiaofei unhurriedly replied as he enjoyed the precious break.</p> 
 <p>“Tomorrow?! You think you know the grassland routes better than I do?! And even if there is a shortcut, we still can’t arrive tomorrow with such a large army!” Qiu Muxue felt as if her authority had been challenged. Moreover, she had recently developed the habit of arguing with Bai Xiaofei and therefore could not hold back from retorting to his every sentence.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, she never won…</p> 
 <p>“If what you said before about that Mamba is true, then I can guarantee that we will see him tomorrow. If I’m wrong, I will do whatever you say,” said Bai Xiaofei nonchalantly.</p> 
 <p>“Very well! Don’t go back on your word then!” Qiu Muxue jumped up from the mattress.</p> 
 <p>“What if I’m right?” Bai Xiaofei countered.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Qiu Muxue instinctively panicked, but her stubbornness prevailed in the end.</p> 
 <p>“If so, I'll do whatever you say!” She bit the bullet and took on the bet.</p> 
 <p>“I'm not interested in that. If I'm right, just wash my socks for a month,” said Bai Xiaofei. Then, he ignored the shocked Qiu Muxue and summoned Huskie. Using the puppet’s ability, he slowly transformed into her.</p> 
 <p>Although they had heard about his ability, the two women still watched the process with curious eyes.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei's strategy was that he would pretend to be Qiu Muxue and deal with Mamba. Since the latter had feelings for her, Bai Xiaofei could do whatever he wanted to him.</p> 
 <p>For a pure martial artist like Mamba, a puppet master who could freely use their energy was nothing but a nightmare!</p> 
 <p>“Next, I'm going to have to wrong you, Saintess. I hope you can hold your own outside,” Bai Xiaofei said to Qiu Muxue with a smile, startling the latter.</p> 
 <p>“What do you mean?”</p> 
 <p>“What do I mean? I’m asking you to leave, of course. If someone sees two Saintesses here, this would all go down the drain no matter how good my acting is!” Bai Xiaofei stated matter-of-factly.</p> 
 <p>Qiu Muxue was so angry that she nearly vomited blood.</p> 
 <p><em>So you’ve been waiting for this!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Very good, Surnamed Bai! Consider yourself formidable! Just you wait!!”</p>
