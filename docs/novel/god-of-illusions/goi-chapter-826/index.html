 <p>Chapter 826: Finish!</p> 
 <p>“Die! Oblivion!!”</p> 
 <p>As Fang Ye pulled the trigger, the last ‘Ling Tianxia’ vanished under the bombardment of Into Oblivion.</p> 
 <p>With that, the entire battlefield came to a stop. Looking at their messy surroundings, everyone couldn’t help a wry smile. It had not been an easy fight.</p> 
 <p>Despite having Shaman King’s guidance, theory was simpler than action. The invincibility duration provided by Duan Yiyi and Zhu Nuo was not enough at all. In the end, they only brought down the six foes, one by one, by putting their lives on the line with the help of the Starnet Brilliances.</p> 
 <p>The result was absolutely the best possible. Everyone had light or heavy injuries, but none were fatal.</p> 
 <p>However, what was left on the ground were only dead bodies ––</p> 
 <p>Windlove soldiers who failed to withdraw in time, Devil Forest members and countless loners who got caught in the chaos while trying to escape, and all the Shadow Death assassins…</p> 
 <p>The battlefield was like a slaughterhouse. The pungent stench of blood permeating the air could not diminish one bit. If Shadow Death had sent more people over, the number of casualties wouldn’t have stopped there.</p> 
 <p>“Big Sis!!!” Mo Ka suddenly shouted as the group was resting.</p> 
 <p>Everyone looked over and saw Hu Xian’er slowly coming out. The most conspicuous was Bai Xiaofei, who was being carried on Wu Chi’s back.</p> 
 <p>After dealing with Tong Fei’s first body, Hu Xian’er had gone back with Wang Hang and Wang Chuan to help. However, when they arrived, the battle was already over.</p> 
 <p>“What happened to Boss again?!” exclaimed Mo Ka, who leaped over and saw the unconscious Bai Xiaofei. It could be said that he used the word ‘again’ incisively.</p> 
 <p>“His body got even more battered, but fortunately, the injuries have healed.” Even Hu Xian’er had become accustomed to this situation. Her faint tone was completely indifferent.</p> 
 <p>Her answer drew a long sigh from the anxious harem girls.</p> 
 <p>“Oh, you girls. Haven’t you heard that calamity lasts for thousands of years? Big Brother Fei has not wrecked this continent enough, how can something happen to him?” Qi Wei teased as she swept a glance at the calm faces around, knowing that each was actually more worried than the last inside. While no one paid attention, the talkative girl had unknowingly evolved into a mocker.</p> 
 <p>“Wait, where’s Commander Linfeng?” Min Xizi asked doubtfully. However, when seeing Tan Xin’s expression, he realized that he had put his foot in his mouth.</p> 
 <p>“He fulfilled his long-cherished wish,” Tan Xin replied, deadpan.</p> 
 <p>Everyone fell silent. Indeed, it was not the time to celebrate yet!</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go, there are a lot of things to deal with. This is not a good place,” Fang Ye reminded and broke the heavy atmosphere.</p> 
 <p>With that, everyone carried injuries as they walked back. They won and grew, but after calming down, the Savage Class felt not excitement, but an indescribably strange feeling.</p> 
 <p><em>Is this the real Starnet Continent? Sure enough, the academy is just an academy after all…</em></p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, on a mound deep within the Windless Zone, a man who had been sitting cross-legged, stood up slowly. Beside him stood a graceful woman in black combat attire.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go, we’ve obtained it,” the man announced with a look of victory.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, my lord!” the woman replied, but her expression was puzzled.</p> 
 <p>“If you want to say anything, just say it. After all, I am your master,” the man said, the smile on his face didn’t wane at all.</p> 
 <p>“My lord, you obviously could kill them and take away the completed worm king. Why did you show mercy?” the woman voiced her doubt.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t talk nonsense, I never have any mercy. The replica version of the golden corpse is still in the research phase. That was already their strongest combat power,” the man ‘corrected’ the woman’s statement as the smile on his face deepened. He walked to her and whispered to her ear, “Besides, do you really want me to kill your lovely students?”</p> 
 <p>The woman was stunned. When she came to her senses, the man had already walked far.</p> 
 <p>“You guys have really grown.” Unable to suppress the fluctuation in her heart, tears slid down from the woman’s eyes. Then, she turned and left…</p> 
 <p>Half a month later, in the Windlove city lord’s mansion.</p> 
 <p>“Are you guys leaving?” Min Xizi sorrowfully looked at the table full of people.</p> 
 <p>“Well, we’ve dealt with everything here,” replied Bai Xiaofei as he stuffed food into his mouth like he hadn’t eaten for decades.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t talk as if you did everything. You only woke up this morning, okay?” Tan Xin rolled her eyes.</p> 
 <p>Seizing the opportunity of that war with the All-Around Merchant Group, Tan Xin conveniently did a huge clean-up in Windlove. First, she eliminated the remnants of Unify and All-Around and took over their economic influence. Then, she carried out a series of measures and gained control over all the loners.</p> 
 <p>Windlove City had been lawless in the past, but now, it had a solid rule: ‘The city can protect you, and you can do what you want here. However, as long as the city lord gives an order, you have to obey no matter who you are!’</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin had lost count of how many citizens, who were dissatisfied with this new rule, that she had dealt with during the past two weeks. In the end, everyone succumbed to her absolute violence.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s not get too deep into details, alright? It’s rare for everyone to be in such a good mood.” Bai Xiaofei laughed it off and turned to Fang Ye. “Say, how are you going to plead this time? I asked you to call those people over, but I never got to see what they looked like even until the battle ended.”</p> 
 <p>Facing Bai Xiaofei’s questioning, Fang Ye chose to play dumb.</p> 
 <p>“They’ve contributed a great deal during the past days. However, before you woke up, they were summoned back by Brother Feng. They wanted to meet you, really.” Fang Ye successfully glossed it over. Otherwise, if the topic continued, his salary might go down…</p> 
 <p>“Alright, forget it. Let’s get to business,” Bai Xiaofei said and stood up, extremely formal as he raised his glass.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, the whole table followed and stood up with complicated expressions. Although the time they had spent in Windlove was long, no one could deny that they had developed feelings for this place where they had fought so hard.</p> 
 <p>“Blood Diamond mission, complete!” Bai Xiaofei declared and drained his glass.</p> 
 <p>The group who were waiting for him to deliver a speech shook their heads one by one. <em>So there are actually times when you don’t know what to say, huh?</em></p>
