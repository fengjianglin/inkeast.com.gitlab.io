<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>“He’s an expert in the top 100 of the Combat Rankings, all of you can’t defeat him.” Xue Ying explained the situation to Bai Xiaofei from behind him using a voice that only he could hear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Ying who’d been free for an entire month was like a computer. She’d transformed from someone who was ignorant to the point of being unable to find the infirmary to an encyclopedia of the academy, and she’d entered all the information into her mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, it even contained some personal secrets that was only known to a small group of people….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei was both happy and fearful of this. He was happy because he could spare himself the time for investigation when he wanted to know something as he could ask Xue Ying directly, and he was fearful because some of his little tricks couldn’t escape her detection….</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, it was a good thing under the current circumstances, and it allowed Bai Xiaofei to avoid choosing the wrong measure to deal with the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry for disturbing you, senior. I think you might have some misunderstandings towards me. Even though my relationship with many seniors isn’t really good, the precondition to that is that they offended me first, so if I didn’t take action, then wouldn’t I not live up to my identity as a man?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As for the matter just now, I represent my fellow students to apologize to you as it was really ill considered by us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei spoke in a neither humble nor arrogant manner. Who would have imagined that this was a little rascal that came from a gorge?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thanks to the interaction he had with the senior sisters on the Blossom Rankings during this entire month, the current Bai Xiaofei was even to speak even more formally!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiong Cheng didn’t pay attention to much of what Bai Xiaofei said, but he was unable to find anything that could be refuted. Even though he really disliked Bai Xiaofei’s actions, he wasn’t someone that intentionally tried to find faults in others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think we can compete if you enter the top 100 of the Combat Rankings one day. But, you’re not worthy of me making a move now.” Xiong Cheng left immediately after speaking these worlds, and every single step he took seemed to have been measured while the trace of overbearingness he exuded didn’t weaken in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the bearing specific to people that were on the Combat Rankings. Just as Xiong Cheng had said, unless one became a member of the top 100 on the combat rankings, one would never be able to experience that sort of feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you continue lining up. We’ll have this strength sooner or later as well.” Bai Xiaofei was entirely aware of what the other new students were thinking because he was a new student as well….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Bai, all of you should still go first. All of us feel ashamed to let you stand behind.” The new student that spoke at the very beginning spoke once more, and the first 10 plus people in the line directly gave away their positions because they felt heartfelt gratitude towards Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, alright, alright. Then I won’t be courteous.” Refusing too much would cause him to seem fake. Bai Xiaofei led the members of the Savage Class to walk to the front after he agreed, and Huang Tianhua was disregarded during the entire process.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hi, six people can enter at once to be tested. Who amongst all of you will go first?” The worker’s face revealed a grin that never changed, and he seemed to have not been affected from the previous clamor in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you go, I won’t be testing myself.” Bai Xiaofei took a step back as he spoke, and he had a helpless expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The members of the Savage Class originally intended to encourage Bai Xiaofei, but they swallowed back their words before it could escape their mouths because they were unable to persuade Bai Xiaofei after he made a decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, according to the principle of ladies being first, Xu Chen and the others stepped foot into the test room first, whereas, the boys waited anxiously and nervously outside.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Err….</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This scene is lightly strange, huh….</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The test of puppet control was divided into three parts. The first part was the test of Origin Energy. The process was very simple, and it was to pour Origin Energy with all one’s strength into a ball. The results would depend on how much Origin Energy could be poured out into the ball within two seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The second part was the test of one’s ability to separate one’s mind, and the method of it was via controlling white-grade magic ball puppets. This sort of elementary puppets didn’t require establishing any agreements, and the results depended on the amount of these puppets one could control. Under normal circumstances, one had to at least be able to control four magic balls to control two puppets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The third part tested one’s spirit. This decided if one was able to safely establish a second agreement because if one forcefully established an agreement with a puppet while one’s spirit was insufficient, it might cause one to suffer backlash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This test was the test that exhausted the longest period of time amongst the three tests. According to the different levels that one wanted to test, one had to enter an illusory formation of different levels, and one would be considered to have met the requirements if one was able to leave the formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the six girls entered, Lin Li was the first to walk out after around 30 minutes had passed. At the same time, her results were sent to Xue Ying.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Origin Energy – 2</span></i><i><span style>nd</span></i><i><span style> level of the Master Rank. Ability to separate the mind – four puppets. Passed through the peak Master Rank illusory formation. Final judgment, capable of flawlessly controlling four puppets!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin Li, you were able to control a second puppet since a long time ago, right? Why didn’t you choose one earlier?” Xue Ying’s words carried a slightly perplexed tone. She’d always wanted to ask this question, but she just never had the chance. After all, Lin Li was the daughter of Lin Nishang, so it was impossible for her to lack money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My mother said that my puppet is very special. I at least have to possess the ability to control four puppets before I can establish an agreement with a second puppet.” Lin Li spoke obediently, and her cute expression combined with her mature looks caused the new students in the surroundings to be stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Presently, there were already rumors spreading about how either Lin Li or Hu Xian’er would surely ascend the Blossom Rankings, and many seniors that heard of the rumor had started investigating the two of them. But, every single one of the new students were well-behaved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because besides the title of goddess, the two of them had the title of ‘sister-in-law’….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not a single new student was stupid to the point of fighting Bai Xiaofei for a woman. So, all of them could only drool when facing Lin Li and Hu Xian’er….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then did your mother prepare a second puppet for you?” Xue Ying asked another question as if she was deeply afraid of holding Lin Li back. Truthfully speaking, it was really the first time she’d come into contact with someone of Lin Li’s status.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My mother said that she has already taught me what she can, and I have to rely on myself for everything else.” Lin Li spoke sincerely, and then she ran over impatiently to Bai Xiaofei’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can possess a second puppet now. What type of effect do you want my puppet to have?” Even though Lin Li had frequently browsed through the Exquisite Pavilion with Xu Chen and the others, she’d never selected a puppet seriously. Originally, everyone thought that she had a plan in mind, but it didn’t seem that way now….</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was probably waiting for Bai Xiaofei’s opinion!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course it’s one that’s suitable for you. Something that’s able to allow you to freely kill your enemies under any circumstances. Otherwise, it would be bad if you’re in danger because I wouldn’t be able to help.” Bai Xiaofei pinched Lin Li’s nose, and his words caused her to smile sweetly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this short period of two months, Lin Li could be said to have undergone a tremendous change, and these changes were concentrated on the expressions and emotions she displayed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was said that Lin Li was only a six or seven year old child when she just arrived in the Savage Class, then she was at least 12 or 13 now. Moreover, her expressions were growing more and more richer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, these rich expressions usually only appeared in front of Bai Xiaofei….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pay attention to the situation, and don’t go too far!” Xue Ying’s voice resounded out, causing Bai Xiaofei’s back to involuntarily go cold, and when he turned around, Bai Xiaofei saw an expression that flashed briefly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A murderous expression….</span></p>
