 <p>Chapter 779: Luo and Xia!</p> 
 <p>“They are of the Eagleman Clan, a race with extremely strong combat ability and are born bearing the element of wind. Among known magical beasts, there are extremely few that can compete with the Eagleman in speed. Not only so, but their mastery of wind also gives them terrifying destructive power, making them natural warriors.”</p> 
 <p>Qing Ya suppressed her seething anger and explained in detail,</p> 
 <p>“Every Eagleman finds their one and only partner from birth and then protects each other for the rest of their life, willing to give everything for each other. If one of a pair dies, the other will immediately follow.”</p> 
 <p>“It is precisely because of this characteristic that humans created a way to control them: they would seize a pair of Eaglemen and proceed to control them separately. As long as the Eagleman can feel that their partner is still alive, they will agree to the controller’s every request.”</p> 
 <p>By the end of her explanation, Qing Ya’s eyes had become bloodshot.</p> 
 <p>“Although the method is indeed a bit cruel, why are you this angry?” Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help wondering as he saw Qing Ya’s reaction. There were many things in this world that were much crueler than this.</p> 
 <p>“You think they just want the Eaglemen as soldiers?!” Qing Ya glared at Bai Xiaofei. For the first time, she raised her voice at him.</p> 
 <p>“Otherwise? What else can they do?” Bai Xiaofei still didn’t understand what she meant.</p> 
 <p>“You can tell by looking at those people!” Qing Ya waved her hand, and the first floor appeared on the screen.</p> 
 <p>The bidders’ penetrating eyes when they looked at the female Eagleman made Bai Xiaofei sick in the stomach, and he even saw some people start to do disgusting things.</p> 
 <p>“Is this the fate of all the Eaglemen who were caught before?” Bai Xiaofei asked Qing Ya as he turned off the screen.</p> 
 <p>“Of all known Eagleman couples that have been caught, either the female committed suicide because the male died, or the female was tortured to death and the male committed suicide. There has been no exception!” Qing Ya clenched her jaw.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei shook his head and turned back to the Eagleman couple. Aside from a pair of wings and a part of their cheeks and arms that had feathers, they didn’t look too different from humans. Moreover, the male was handsome and the female beautiful, and their racial advantage gave them desirable body proportions.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei pressed the button and his voice then echoed, “Ten billion. They are mine. I won’t pay higher, but they are mine!”</p> 
 <p>He repeated his domineering declaration twice, but the meaning each time was completely different. The first time was that he had confidence in his bid, and the second time was a warning: no matter who bought the Eaglemen, he would still be the last one to take them!</p> 
 <p><em>Bid or not, weigh it yourself!</em></p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Qing Ya was staring at Bai Xiaofei in astonishment as her heart started to grow uneasy. <em>Why did he bid? To save them? Or for the same reason as the others?</em></p> 
 <p>However, Qing Ya could not guess the answer, nor could she voice that question.</p> 
 <p>It was unknown whether Bai Xiaofei’s cut-throat price overwhelmed the bidders’ lust or that his malicious words frightened them. He won the Eaglemen at ten billion Amethyst Coins.</p> 
 <p>Before long, the Eagleman couple was sent to Bai Xiaofei’s room, with their hands, neck, and feet all cuffed with the special shackles made by Unify Business. The female Eagleman was full of fear while the male held her tightly in his arms.</p> 
 <p>Qing Ya received the collar controller from the staff and slowly placed it in front of Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Picking up the controller, Bai Xiaofei walked toward the Eagleman couple. They instinctively retreated until their backs hit the wall.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei smiled and a flame flared on his palm, burning the controller into ashes. Then, the flame condensed into a thread that danced on the shackles. A few moments later, all the chains fell to the ground to the consternation of the Eagleman couple.</p> 
 <p>“When the auction is over, I will take you out, and then you can go. Remember, humans are a very dangerous race. Never come into contact with them again. If the same desperate situation happens again in the future, don’t hesitate to kill yourselves,” said Bai Xiaofei lightly before he returned to his seat.</p> 
 <p>The private room was dead quiet, and the only sound that could be heard was Bai Xiaofei’s footsteps as everyone was struck with disbelief.</p> 
 <p><em>Spending ten billion Amethyst Coins and offending the whole auction house just to set them free?! Is his brain normal?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Thank you.” Qing Ya got up, walked to Bai Xiaofei, and bowed deeply.</p> 
 <p>“This should not come from you, I didn’t save them because of you. You can’t imagine the relationship between magical beasts and me.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei said honest words, but Qing Ya did not believe it. In her opinion, this was ridiculous as an excuse…</p> 
 <p>However, the Eagleman couple quietly discussed something, and then to everyone’s shock, they both walked to Bai Xiaofei and knelt down on one knee.</p> 
 <p>“Eagleman Luo.”</p> 
 <p>“Xia.”</p> 
 <p>“Are willing to follow Master forever, never to leave!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing their determined voices, Bai Xiaofei stared blankly.</p> 
 <p><em>What the hell?! They can speak in human language?! Aren’t they magical beasts?!</em></p> 
 <p>“The Eagleman is a special race that’s categorized between humans and magical beasts. It is not a strange thing that they can learn human language,” Qing Ya was quick to notice Bai Xiaofei’s doubts again and immediately explained with a smile.</p> 
 <p>“You two don’t have to do this. I didn’t save you for your gratitude. I really just wanted you to be free.” Bai Xiaofei did not agree despite how tempted he was. No matter how he saw it, the Eagleman should be a race that loved freedom. He did not want their nature to be restricted.</p> 
 <p>“My lord, our clan has been destroyed. We are the last descendants. Although the sky is still there, our freedom is no longer. We wish to follow you and avenge our people!” Luo was the one who spoke. Although Xia didn’t say anything, they were one and the same.</p> 
 <p>“I’m a human. You trust me unconditionally just because I want to let you go? If you continue to be so simple, you may not get revenge even if you follow me.” Bai Xiaofei shook his head.</p> 
 <p>This time, Luo and Xia were silent.</p> 
 <p>“I will teach them so that they will not be so simple!” Qing Ya suddenly declared, her eyes firm as she stared fixedly at Bai Xiaofei. “So, are you willing to accept us three?”</p>
