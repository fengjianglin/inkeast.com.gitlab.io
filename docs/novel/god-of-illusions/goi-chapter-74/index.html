 <p><span style>Before Wang Ye and Zhang Hao could swing out the puppets in their hands, Xing Nan who carried a sly smile on his face instantly exerted force with his leg, and he smashed towards the two of them with speeds that far exceeded them!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This sudden event caused Wang Ye and Zhang Hao who originally intended to seal up Xing Nan’s path be thrown into confusion because this was the normal reaction of a person when there was discord between reality and expectation, let alone discord that went in the opposite direction of their expectations!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, before both of them could adjust themselves, Xing Nan’s right fist had already had an ‘intimate encounter’ with the left of Wang Ye’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Along with a muffled bang, Wang Ye fell to the ground in the next second, whereas, Zhang Hao who was a step behind Wang Ye stared his eyes wide open in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking about reacting was just nonsense because he had to pray that he wouldn’t receive a beating at this moment!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“See you!” Xing Nan took out half a second of time to lightly spit out these two words, and with a spin of his body, a left hook punch smashed heavily onto the back of Wang Hao’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clean and decisive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Nan knocked out his two opponents with two punches, and it was entirely impossible to discern that Xing Nan was a Ranged Stream puppet master…. Err, no. It was entirely impossible to discern that Xing Nan was a puppet master….</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the instant the battle ended, the over 100 people present here fell into shock in unison.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This was a battle of two against one?!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Someone from an ordinary class against someone from the Savage Class?!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>A Ranged Stream puppet master against Onslaught Stream Puppet Masters?!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The scene shouldn’t have f*cking played out like this!!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re at the Martial Warrior level?” Teacher Feng’s face was covered in shock as well, but his mind was still running.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher, I’ve said it before, I’m a puppet master.” Xing Nan grinned as he looked at Teacher Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Onslaught Stream?” A trace of excitement appeared on Teacher Feng’s face, and he seemed as if he wanted to take Xing Nan home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher, I’ve said it before, I’m from the Ranged Stream.” Xing Nan had obviously resolved to put on an act until the end, and it was extremely arduous for him to tighten his face and maintain this serious expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But you….” For the first time, Teacher Feng felt his cognitive ability was insufficient because this had overturned all his knowledge about puppet masters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It might be because they were slightly incapable of taking a beating because we use even greater strength to bash monkeys where I live.” Xing Nan puckered his lips and he was entirely unable to restrain his act any more….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beat… monkeys?” Teacher Feng was stunned as he hadn’t reacted that what Xing Nan meant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, I’m from the southern territory. There are numerous wild monkeys over there, and we beat these monkeys when we’re free to train ourselves.” Xing Nan swung his fist as he spoke, and he repeated the movements he used earlier to bash Wang Ye and Zhang Hao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher, I’ll be going back to my class if there’s nothing further.” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I can’t act any longer or I won’t be able to hold myself back….</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah….? Oh….! Cough! Cough! Err… go ahead.” Teacher Feng who realized he’d lost his composure quickly adjusted his expression and coughed twice before allowing Xing Nan to return to the Savage Class.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If I continue talking with him, then I’ll absolutely fall into his trap.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Teacher Feng thought like this and couldn’t help but take a deep breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does anyone want to put on a display next?” As he indicated for the members of class 450 to carry their classmates off, Teacher Feng asked once more, and his gaze couldn’t help but drift over towards the Savage Class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Merely Xing Nan alone had already changed his view of the Savage Class, and he faintly felt a trace of anticipation because he anticipated the Savage Class would still be able to give him new surprises!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xu Chen, Zhu Si’si. Both of you go.” Bai Xiaofei spoke once more. If it was said that the display from before was merely for the sake of establishing an impression, then there was a purpose this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Blitz Stream and Onslaught Stream were two branches within the Sword of Assault, so if both of them were able to obtain Teacher Feng’s approval right now, then everything would basically move smoothly for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, Bai Xiaofei firmly believed that both of them would surely be able to succeed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sure enough, Teacher Feng’s eyes obviously lit up when they declared the streams they belonged to, and at the same time, Teacher Feng’s eyes carried dense anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll take this class. We want to try exactly how formidable all of you are!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as her voice resounded out in the air, everyone was in an uproar.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>An… entire class?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The others couldn’t help but turn their heads and instinctively start counting exactly how many people had been selected by Xu Chen and Zhu Si’si.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>14…. 15…. 16….</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>18!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>An entire 18 people!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This meant that if the two forces were to enter into battle, then both of them would have to suffer encirclement of nine people each!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>They’re mad!</span></i><i></i><i></i><i><span style>They’re absolutely mad!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>No matter how strong you are, there no need to be so rash!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of them thought like this while causing the sound of saliva being gulped down to rise and fall in the surroundings, and the gazes they shot at the two young women contained a variety of strange expressions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, the reason Xu Chen and Zhu Si’si had chosen this class was actually very simple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When everyone was ridiculing the Savage Class earlier, this class had ‘participated’ the most and spoke the harshest!</span></p>
 <p><span style>What goes around comes around, this was one of the good qualities of the Savage Class!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? All of you don’t dare to come forward when each one of ours will fight nine of yours?! What’re you hesitating for? Aren’t all of you too cowardly!?” Mo Ka’s ridiculing and disdainful voice instantly resounded out, and the other sly fellows in the Savage Class instantly chimed in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In terms of provocation, Mo Ka and the others could go against over a hundred!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since both of you are so desperate to die, then don’t blame us for not holding back!” The male student that was the first to ridicule the Savage Class earlier grunted coldly, and he could be considered to have aroused a sufficient imposing aura to enter the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Subsequently, the remaining 17 people stood out successively. But, based on their disorderly formation, their communication between each other was absolutely limited, and it was even to the extent that there might be enmity between some people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was undoubtedly good news for Xu Chen and Zhu Si’si.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, once the number of people rose to a certain level, then they would surely offset each other’s combat strength if there was no cooperation between them. In the end, their strength might even be inferior to when they were divided into smaller groups.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words, a tray of scattered sand was inferior to grains of sands by themselves!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can we begin?” After she saw everyone had stood out, Xu Chen asked with a light voice while tightening her grip on the Crimsonflame Sword at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Both of you can go to hell now!” As he grunted coldly, the male student that took the lead earlier instantly took out his puppet — A crossbow that wasn’t very big, and then he aimed at Xu Chen who was more towards the front at the first possible moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Subsequently, the others moved along with him, causing the originally disorderly formation to instantly become even more disorderly. Those that fought in closed combat blocked the ranged students, whereas, the defense blocked the charge of the closed combat students….</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were an entire four places with similar situations like this, so when Zhu Si’si who’d charged with explosive speed arrived within their formation, many of them hadn’t even found their position.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next second, the first Ranged Stream puppet master was kicked flying by Zhu Si’si.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The horn that signaled the beginning of the battle was officially blown at this moment. Xu Chen who was slightly slower raised her sword horizontally to block the first arrow shot by the arrogant male student, and at the same time, she charged right at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t that she wanted to capture the leader first, and she purely wanted to take revenge on him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Exactly, it was just like that!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was just so vengeful!!!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>You can come at me if you’re disgruntled, so long as you’re sure that you can withstand my sword and Zhu Si’si’s shoe!</span></i></p>
