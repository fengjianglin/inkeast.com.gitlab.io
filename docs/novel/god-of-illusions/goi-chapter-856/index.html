 <p>Chapter 856: Omnipresent Old Enemy!</p> 
 <p>Per Bai Xiaofei’s suggestion, the group headed straight to the Mercenary Alliance. Along the way, Bai Xiaofei and Yun Tianhe got to know each other thoroughly, and so did Yun Tianhai and… Huskie.</p> 
 <p>Toward Huskie, a dog who could eat way more than his size and speak the human language, Yun Tianhai’s curiosity was completely ignited. His greatest interest now was to get Huskie to talk, and his randomness was completely on another level. It was the first time that Huskie could despise someone in terms of IQ.</p> 
 <p>Seeing Yun Tianhai like that, the last hint of agitation in Bai Xiaofei’s heart due to the earlier event also vanished. Who would hold a grudge with a child?</p> 
 <p>“We are being followed,” Golden Feather suddenly said.</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe instinctively wanted to look, but Bai Xiaofei stopped him.</p> 
 <p>“Big Bro, don’t. It’s very normal,” said Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe instantly calmed down. Indeed, as an important figure, it was not unusual for him to be watched. At a time like this, looking around aimlessly for the stalker would alarm the latter, so it was better to go along with the flow.</p> 
 <p>“It seems that we are going to have a new harvest.” Yun Tianhe smiled.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei made an expression of approval. Setting aside whether there would be any harvest from the ghost village, just the people watching them in the dark should already be somewhat useful.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was a rare one who was happy to be stalked like this.</p> 
 <p>Blackie quietly integrated into the surroundings while Huskie scratched twice with his claw. The group kept walking like nothing had happened all the way into the lobby of the Mercenary Alliance building.</p> 
 <p>“They have entered the Mercenary Alliance. Obviously, they want to start from the ghost village. Is everything there dealt with?” In a corner of the alley, a plain-looking old man was quietly conveying a message somewhere.</p> 
 <p>Although the old man was well hidden, he still stood out in front of Bai Xiaofei, who had the ability to monitor the surroundings.</p> 
 <p>“Hi, old man, who are you talking to?” Bai Xiaofei patted him on the shoulder.</p> 
 <p>The old man was startled by his sudden appearance but quickly reacted, “Nothing. When you get old, you just become fond of talking to yourself.”</p> 
 <p>The old man coughed as he decisively revised his plan. Behind his back, his right hand condensed energy into a knife before he suddenly swung it at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>However, a stronger hand grabbed him mid-swing.</p> 
 <p>“Old man, it’s not good for someone of your age to get too emotional,” said Yun Tianhe as his energy poured into the old man’s body.</p> 
 <p>From his right hand, the old man started to feel numb little by little. Realizing that he had lost all ability to fight back, the old man jerked hard, sacrificing his right arm. Then, he vanished into a wisp of smoke.</p> 
 <p>“Huskie.” Bai Xiaofei seemed to have expected this.</p> 
 <p>As he called Huskie, the place the dog had just scratched flared with Golden Feather’s flames. Meanwhile, Blackie had expanded the scope of its monitor to the whole city!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei revealed a smile as he quickly caught what he wanted. The Purple Luan wings appeared on his back and he disappeared the next second. In a flash, he reappeared behind a young man.</p> 
 <p>“Great disguise skill, but too bad your reaction exposed you. Your self-control still needs more training.”</p> 
 <p>The flames just now were only a distraction. The reactions of a normal person and one who was already alarmed upon seeing an offensive flame would certainly differ.</p> 
 <p>“You came here alone? You must have a death wish!” The young man – who was the old stalker just now – coldly snorted as he attacked Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>However, receiving his blow was Golden Feather.</p> 
 <p>“Gold Wire.”</p> 
 <p>A golden thread flew out of her palm. The speed was not fast at all, but the man found it impossible to dodge no matter how he tried. What’s more, he had a feeling that his life would be over if he let the thread connect!</p> 
 <p>At that critical moment, a scene Bai Xiaofei was very familiar with happened. A mass of blood fog burst and the young man disappeared.</p> 
 <p>Having changed his appearance again, the man had blended in with the crowd. Having learned from his mistake, he decided that no matter what happened, he would react with the mindset of a normal person.</p> 
 <p>However…</p> 
 <p>“Formidable. Consuming your own vitality to teleport twice in a row. Can you do it again? If you do, there’d be nothing I could do to you.” Bai Xiaofei once again appeared behind the man, bringing with him despair.</p> 
 <p>At the beginning, he had patted the stalker twice to leave Blackie’s marks on him. In other words, Bai Xiaofei had prepared for the possibility that this man would run twice.</p> 
 <p>“Too bad for you, I can!” The stalker gave up the plan to resist as he made a cruel decision to himself and vanished in front of Bai Xiaofei for the third time.</p> 
 <p>Then…</p> 
 <p>“Sorry, I lied to you. Although your ability is good, you’ve used the same trick too many times. I’d be useless if I can’t figure it out,” Bai Xiaofei said.</p> 
 <p>The stalker smiled bitterly. “As expected of Starnet’s savior. But you really shouldn’t have come this time. You will die!!!”</p> 
 <p>Bursting into crazed laughter under the gaze of the crowd, the man exploded into blood fog.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei quietly watched. Before long, Yun Tianhe caught up.</p> 
 <p>“Ready to die, wasn’t he?” Yun Tianhe shook his head and raised his hand, above which floated a gorgeous crystal ball.</p> 
 <p>“Just as you predicted, when forced into a corner, he exchanged his own life for the opportunity to send out a message. Brother Bai, you have my admiration.” Yun Tianhe sighed with emotion. He finally knew why his grandfather never stopped talking about Bai Xiaofei for a whole year.</p> 
 <p>“It’s nothing. Just that the first time he escaped, he gave me a very familiar feeling. It seems that I guessed right. To be so cruel to others and also themselves, and clearly targeting me at that, I’m afraid it’s an old enemy of mine,” Bai Xiaofei concluded with a long sigh and a hint of worry in his heart.</p> 
 <p><em>Shadow Death, Shadow Death… You guys are really everywhere!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Do you really have to force this lord to uproot you?!</em></p> 
 <p>“We should get going, or there will really be nothing left to find.” Seeing the crystal ball fluctuate, Yun Tianhe tensed. It concerned whether they would succeed this time!</p>
