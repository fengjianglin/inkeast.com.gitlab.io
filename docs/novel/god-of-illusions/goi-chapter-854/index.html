 <p>Chapter 854: Ethereal’s Four Great Clans!</p> 
 <p>The new voice stunned Bai Xiaofei as he was pondering how he should handle Yun Tianhai. <em>This new one sounds interesting!</em></p> 
 <p>“Friend, my brother is young and inexperienced. If there has been any offense, please forgive us. And if possible, we would be honored to be able to apologize to you in person.” Outside the door, a handsome uncle bent slightly, his face full of sincerity.</p> 
 <p>Although Bai Xiaofei didn’t answer, the door was already opened by the waiter earlier. Yun Tianhe raised his head and entered with a friendly smile. Behind him was Yun Tianhai, who was fuming but dared not speak a word.</p> 
 <p>“Yun, Hai, He, and Lan, the four great clans of the Ethereal Empire. What wind could have blown the First young master of the Yun clan, Yun Tianhe, to this remote border town, I wonder?” stated Bai Xiaofei without turning around.</p> 
 <p>On the Windsurfing Ship, Tan Xin had given him several days of lessons on the Ethereal Empire in order to let him act more smoothly. The speedy classes finally proved to be fruitful. At least, Bai Xiaofei could use the knowledge to act formidable…</p> 
 <p>“Master of a godly dog and mighty black cat, young and promising. The leading figure of the miracle generation of Starnet can come, so why can’t I?” Seeing only the figure, Yun Tianhe still quickly deduced Bai Xiaofei’s identity from his two puppets. He did not fall to a disadvantage in this round at all.</p> 
 <p>“Wanderer Bai Xiaofei. Nice to meet you.” Turning the chair, Bai Xiaofei got up and stood in front of Yun Tianhe with his hand amiably extended.</p> 
 <p>“Yun clan, Yun Tianhe. I’ve heard a lot about you. Nice to meet you.”</p> 
 <p>The two shook hands with smiles, completely skipping over the unpleasant dispute just now. Some people just had this kind of charm, and Yun Tianhe was one of them.</p> 
 <p>“I heard this room was originally booked by Brother Tianhe. If it’s only you two, how about appreciating our fated meeting by joining us for a meal?” Bai Xiaofei offered.</p> 
 <p>“Since you’re kind enough to invite me, I can’t be rude. When you come to the imperial capital, do give me a chance to return the favor,” Yun Tianhe immediately agreed with a generous laugh. Then, he turned to look at his reckless younger brother. “What are you waiting for? Apologize to Little Brother Bai. If it wasn’t for him showing mercy, you would already be dead by now!”</p> 
 <p>Facing his own younger brother, Yun Tianhe showed nothing that could be called elegance. However, he got one thing wrong.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had not intended to show mercy, Yun Tianhe just interfered quickly enough…</p> 
 <p>“I have offended you. I ask for your forgiveness, Brother Bai.” Although arrogant, Yun Tianhai was very obedient to his big brother. It could be seen that his apology was not forced.</p> 
 <p><em>This child can be taught! It seems none of those who come from a big clan is truly stupid.</em></p> 
 <p>“It’s nothing. Come and sit down.” Bai Xiaofei invited them to sit down and introduced Golden Feather, “This is Aunt Gold, a senior of mine.” Bai Xiaofei’s respect for her had never changed even though she was his puppet. He had always considered it as borrowing her strength.</p> 
 <p>“Tianhe greets Aunt Gold,” Yun Tianhe immediately got up and greeted.</p> 
 <p>Golden Feather said nothing. She only smiled with an air of a respected senior.</p> 
 <p>“Go and prepare the food. If your boss troubles you, say that we are acquaintances and were only joking.” Bai Xiaofei turned to the anxious waiter.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you, Master Bai! Thank you so much!!” Knowing that he survived a disaster, the grateful waiter hurriedly ran out.</p> 
 <p>When there were only four people in the room, Bai Xiaofei asked Yun Tianhe, “Big Brother Yun, surely you didn’t come here for fun?”</p> 
 <p>It was impossible for Bai Xiaofei to ignore such a good intelligence source. He had kept Yun Tianhe to dig up as much information as possible from him.</p> 
 <p>After all, Lan Qiushuang, the person he wanted to find, was Yun Tianhe’s biological mother!</p> 
 <p>“There has been a situation here recently that alarmed the imperial capital. It happens that my father is a court minister and he accepted this task. Since I’ve been quite idle lately, I came to check it out,” replied Yun Tianhe.</p> 
 <p>Although his tone was nonchalant, Bai Xiaofei could tell the seriousness of the situation. How could a situation in a border town that could alarm the imperial city be small? On top of that, the one in charge was the future leader of the Yun clan!</p> 
 <p>“Oh? To tell the truth, I also came across something interesting on my way here.” With a look of surprise, Bai Xiaofei began to lead the topic to his own affairs.</p> 
 <p>“Do tell.” Yun Tianhe’s curiosity was piqued. The name Bai Xiaofei might be just a distant legend to others, but it was like thunder to Yun Tianhe’s ears.</p> 
 <p>After his grandfather, Lan He, lost his ability as a puppet master during Starnet’s grand celebration, the old man brought back not only a Starnet Brilliance but also the story of a legend.</p> 
 <p>Ever since then, the words Yun Tianhe heard most from Lan He were Bai Xiaofei. He knew his grandfather very well, and Bai Xiaofei was the first one that the latter had ever praised so highly.</p> 
 <p>“The entire village became walking dead, madly attacking anyone who approached. They could even blow themselves up, leaving me with nothing to investigate who’s after my life!” Bai Xiaofei concluded emotionally.</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe’s eyes widened upon the story. Right at that time, the food was delivered into the room one by one, and the waiter earlier chimed in,</p> 
 <p>“My lord, you must be talking about the ghost village. It’s been causing such a big commotion recently, that even the imperial city has been alarmed. I heard they’ve sent someone to handle it.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Yun Tianhe looked a little embarrassed. That ‘someone’ was sitting right there!</p> 
 <p>The waiter retreated after getting his words in, successfully helping Bai Xiaofei open up the topic.</p> 
 <p>“My brother, I can only depend on you this time. If I don’t find out who wants my life and take my revenge, I won’t be able to sleep well!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei sounded particularly reasonable and sincere and Yun Tianhe found himself unable to turn him down. However, what he wanted to ask was another matter.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai, we’ll talk about it later. I want to ask, did you know we were coming? All this food is…” Looking at the two stories of dishes all over the table, Yun Tianhe really could not imagine that all this was for two people plus a cat and a dog!</p> 
 <p>However, that was really the case…</p>
