 <p>Chapter 866: Pinocchio!</p> 
 <p>“Little brat, keep looking at me with those eyes and I’ll gouge them out!” declared Pinocchio viciously as he glared at Bai Xiaofei. His serious expression made it obvious that he was not joking at all.</p> 
 <p>“Sorry, sorry, elder. I didn’t mean to be rude, I’m just a little surprised,” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly apologized with a wry smile. He really couldn’t control his instinctive reaction.</p> 
 <p>“Humph. Good for you.” Pinocchio retracted his glare with a cold snort, his aged expression looked extremely out of place with his size. He turned to Shi Kui. “Smelly boy, who is he? You can’t just bring people back so casually. And what’s with these two Moon Beck girls?”</p> 
 <p>“Master, this is Big Brother Fei who I often mention to you. Didn’t you always want to meet him? These two sisters are with him, they have nothing to do with me!” Shi Kui decisively sold Bai Xiaofei out. </p> 
 <p>Luckily for Bai Xiaofei, Bai Xing and Yue Bai were from the Moon Beck Pavilion. If they were from any other entertainment places, Pinocchio would have driven them out on the spot.</p> 
 <p>Members of the Moon Beck Pavilion never came out casually with a guest.</p> 
 <p>“Good for you.” This sentence seemed to be Pinocchio’s pet phrase. Throwing Shi Kui a glare, he then looked at Bai Xiaofei again. “You are that Bai Xiaofei who saved the day during Starnet’s grand celebration?”</p> 
 <p>Pinocchio was not stingy with his words, and Bai Xiaofei did live up to having ‘saved the day.’</p> 
 <p>“I am, but you flatter me. It was just luck. What I did was very limited.” Bai Xiaofei still knew when modesty was due. No matter how he looked at it, Pinocchio did not look like the kind who liked boastful juniors.</p> 
 <p>“There is nothing to be modest about. Just say the facts. Don’t treat me as an outdated old man. Your flowery twisty talking is useless on me.” Pinocchio’s tone didn’t change at all.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was embarrassed. <em>Ugh, wrong judgment…</em></p> 
 <p>“Since you are a guest, let’s go. I still need to give the Thunder Emperor and Revelation face. Besides, I can’t let others say that I, Pinocchio, can’t even accommodate a junior.”</p> 
 <p>It was unclear what Pinocchio thought when he said this. Anyhow, Bai Xiaofei was completely dumbstruck.</p> 
 <p>As the godsmith turned around to lead the way, Shi Kui immediately came up to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Fei, don’t think too much about it. His personality is just like that. It is difficult for him to say nice words. Since he is willing to keep you, it means that he has a good impression of you. The way he expresses it is just a little bit… unique,” Shi Kui explained. </p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei instantly understood. He shook his head. <em>In short, this is an eccentric, tactless old man! No wonder they all say nine out of ten puppetsmiths are stubborn old men…</em></p> 
 <p>“Although my place is very big, the five of us teacher and students are its only residents in a long time, so it may look a little dusty. If you dare to slander me after you leave, you will die,” said Pinocchio.</p> 
 <p>After understanding his character, Bai Xiaofei knew what he meant: ‘My place is a little messy, don’t laugh at this old man…’</p> 
 <p>“Big Cow, Small Cow!” arriving at the main hall, Pinocchio suddenly shouted. </p> 
 <p>Moments later, two burly men with bare upper bodies hurriedly ran out. After just one second, their attention shifted from Pinocchio to Bai Xing and Bai Yue, and then their eyes were completely unable to move away.</p> 
 <p>“Believe it or not, I will dig out your eyeballs!” Pinocchio’s coldly said.</p> 
 <p>Big Cow and Small Cow immediately bowed and turned their gaze back to Pinocchio.</p> 
 <p>“Master, have mercy on us. We do nothing but strike the iron on the anvil every day. Now that there are finally two sisters visiting, they’re already hooked up with Junior Brother,” complained Big Cow, whose face was full of grievances, as Small Cow nodded like crazy.</p> 
 <p>In this scene, Bai Xiaofei almost couldn’t control himself. <em>I’ll be damned! They all say fish begins to stink from the head, who would have thought it applies to the way one talks as well? Is that something you can say in front of outsiders?!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but glance anxiously at Shi Kui.</p> 
 <p><em>Heaven bless, this brat Shi Kui is already silly enough. Please don’t let him be infected by this master and his senior brothers!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Little girls, do you need tailor-made puppets? Although these two apprentices of mine aren’t very bright, their craftsmanship is first-class. There are absolutely no more than twenty smiths better than them in this mountain.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei thought Pinocchio would reprimand Big Cow and Small Cow. Even if it killed him, he would never expect the old geezer would play the match-maker on the spot!! </p> 
 <p><em>Damn you! Can you be more obvious?!!</em></p> 
 <p>“We…” The quick-witted Bai Xing was speechless.</p> 
 <p>Even Bai Xiaofei’s worldview was overturned, not to mention the two girls. Before coming here, they always thought that Pinocchio was like a high and mighty god… This contrast was too big!</p> 
 <p>“Such an opportunity is rare, just grasp it. Don’t tell me you never thought about going back with a puppet when you came here? Or, do you guys want something else?” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly reminded the two shocked girls.</p> 
 <p>His implication was obvious. Only fools would fail to take advantage of such a great deal. As for the so-called match-making, it wasn’t like they could be tied down by those two idiots…</p> 
 <p>The two girls instantly understood and hurriedly bowed to Pinocchio. “Thank you, Godsmith. We cannot refuse such generosity.”</p> 
 <p>Big Cow and Small Cow immediately became excited.</p> 
 <p>“Please come with us. Our furnace is not far from here. The material library is over there. Whatever you want, you need only ask!” said Big Cow eagerly as he almost said ‘If you need you can take me as well.’</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Bai Xiaofei wiped the cold sweat on his forehead, completely giving up on getting to know the trio of teacher and pupils any further. After all, he didn’t want to be led astray…</p> 
 <p>After Big Cow and Small Cow led Bai Xing and Bai Yue away, Pinocchio brought the group into the lobby. Sitting down, he looked at Shi Kui and Yan Ran’er. “Go to the foot of the mountain and fetch some water, it must be fresh. Don’t be in a hurry about coming back.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei then got to witness the crudest way of dismissing people. Not to mention him, even Shi Kui couldn’t help but feel embarrassed for his master…</p> 
 <p>“Yes, master, we will try to come back as late as possible.” Shi Kui tried his best to cooperate with Pinocchio. In any case, he didn’t have the face to stay any longer. His master was only great at refining puppets. As for the rest… Never mind, saying any more would make him tear up…</p> 
 <p>“Lad, do you know why I kept you here?” Pinocchio suddenly became serious after everyone else left.</p> 
 <p>“If this junior didn’t guess wrong, it should be about the human puppets,” replied Bai Xiaofei confidently. Besides this matter, he and Pinocchio seemed to have no other topic in common.</p> 
 <p>However…</p> 
 <p>“What the hell?! Human puppets?!! That brat Shi Kui even told you about this too?!!” Pinocchio sprang up in shock, looking as if he wanted to grab Shi Kui back and tear him apart.</p> 
 <p><em>Damn it! Wrong again…</em></p> 
 <p>“Ahem… I already knew about this long ago, it has little to do with Shi Kui…” an embarrassed Bai Xiaofei hurriedly spoke up for Shi Kui. Otherwise, he felt that Shi Kui might not see the sun tomorrow.</p> 
 <p><em>This old man is really unreliable!! But then again, why else would you keep me?!</em></p> 
 <p>“You don’t have to plead for him. That brat has a big mouth, I need to pay attention to his education. He has no tact at all and just spills whatever he knows! I don’t believe that his mouth doesn’t cause him trouble in the future,” Pinocchio said solemnly, </p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was speechless… <em>Tact? You and your disciples all seem to have none of that. Moreover, as far as I’ve seen, Shi Kui is much more tight-lipped than you…</em></p> 
 <p>“Please don’t be angry, Senior. So, I’m wondering why you kept me here…” In order to save Shi Kui, Bai Xiaofei decisively changed the subject. At the same time, he readied himself to be shocked again. Who knew what heaven-shaking thing this old man would say at this rate?</p> 
 <p>“I want to ask if you came across a golden corpse during the Starnet grand celebration,” Pinocchio finally got to the point. </p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was struck with realization. <em>So it’s about that!</em></p> 
 <p>Golden corpses indeed deserved the curiosity and attention of a puppetsmith, but Bai Xiaofei was even more curious about how Pinocchio got wind of it. According to the modus operandi of Shadow Death, those who saw their secrets would be quickly silenced…</p> 
 <p>“Senior, how did you know?” Bai Xiaofei frowned.</p> 
 <p>Pinocchio didn’t answer. He lifted his sleeve and revealed a ferocious-looking scar on his right arm.</p> 
 <p>“The method of refining it came from me, but it was only discovered by accident, and because of that puppet, I almost died,” Pinocchio said with a long sigh and an expression of anguish that finally matched his identity.</p> 
 <p>“Not only in Starnet. Not long ago, I ran into another golden corpse that had obviously matured compared to the previous one.” Bai Xiaofei put away his doubts as Pinocchio was straightforward about it. After all, if he had not revealed it himself, few people in this world would know that he had such a relationship with the golden corpse.</p> 
 <p>“He has fixed the defects by himself, it seems… Sin, oh, sin.” Pinocchio sighed.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s curiosity was piqued. <em>There’s a story behind this!</em></p>
