 <p>Chapter 832: Un-get-ridable Tail!</p> 
 <p>“Today is a happy day for us ordinary people~”</p> 
 <p>Rarely having no burdens on him, Bai Xiaofei leisurely strode on his path humming a little song, with Blackie on his shoulder and Huskie trotting behind. Knowing that endless farewell and crying faces were a normal part of graduation ceremonies, he decisively slipped away ahead of time.</p> 
 <p>Before leaving, Bai Xiaofei only saw Hu Xian’er and confirmed her plan that she would stay in the Infinite Mountain Range to restore her clan. The two had an intimate conversation before Bai Xiaofei slipped out.</p> 
 <p>As for the tail that remained in the Demon of Illusions, Bai Xiaofei asked Hu Xian’er to give Fang Ye a letter asking him to make arrangements for them. That was why Bai Xiaofei was so comfortable at the moment.</p> 
 <p>However, little did Bai Xiaofei know, some things just could not be rid of.</p> 
 <p>“Hey! Aren’t you tired from walking? Wanna try taking a boat~?” A familiar demonic voice rang out.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei started and then slowly looked back, praying to gods and demons to go easy on him. However, when he saw the three people behind him, his hope crumbled.</p> 
 <p><em>Tan Xin, Rui Mengqi, and Gu Lingyue!</em></p> 
 <p><em>My three biggest headaches all at once!!!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Oh my great ancestor! Can’t you just come alone? Why bring the other two?!!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had expected that he might not be able to get rid of Tan Xin. After all, her strength was still a mystery. However, he really didn’t think Tan Xin would bring two more with her!!</p> 
 <p>“Well, about that… I knew you could catch up, so I didn’t disturb your rest, um… that’s right! You can understand me, right?!” Biting the bullet, Bai Xiaofei gave a reason that even he didn’t believe.</p> 
 <p>“Mhmm, we understand. So, there is no problem bringing us with you, right?” Blinking her big eyes, Tan Xin’s well-behaved manner showed nothing of the fact that she was a legendary figure who had ruled Windlove City for so many years.</p> 
 <p>“Of course there’s no problem!” replying firmly, Bai Xiaofei felt like he was bleeding inside. <em>Damn it, do I still have a choice?!</em></p> 
 <p>“That’s great.” Tan Xin laughed.</p> 
 <p>The three immediately flocked to Bai Xiaofei. Tan Xin jumped and latched on his back, while Rui Mengqi and Gu Lingyue hugged his right and left arm respectively.</p> 
 <p>If Lin Li and the other girls could be this bold, Bai Xiaofei would have been envied by even immortals.</p> 
 <p>“Master, where are we going?” Gu Lingyue asked.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei, who had no love for life at the moment, mechanically answered, “Ethereal.”</p> 
 <p>“Ethereal is so far, are we really going to walk there? Boss, you don’t have a fever, right?” Rui Mengqi touched Bai Xiaofei’s forehead then her own. After confirming that there was nothing wrong with his temperature, she was puzzled…</p> 
 <p>“No, I just want to appreciate the scenery and local customs along the way. I’m not in a hurry.”</p> 
 <p>“Hey, can you put some emotion into that?” Tan Xin glared unhappily at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>At near point-blank range, Bai Xiaofei could even clearly see her eyelashes. If it wasn’t for Tan Xin’s loli appearance, he wouldn’t be able to hold back.</p> 
 <p>“I’m just thinking,” Bai Xiaofei’s mechanical answers continued.</p> 
 <p>The three ‘accessories’ collectively made a noise of confusion, “Hmm?”</p> 
 <p><em>I’m thinking about how I’m going to face death, okay?!!</em></p> 
 <p>“I’m thinking, should I really walk there? If I walk so far, I think I will be exhausted.” Changing what he wanted to say, the desire to survive saved Bai Xiaofei’s life.</p> 
 <p>“Well, I have a proposal!” Tan Xin raised her hand. At the same time, a map appeared in front of the four. “We are here. This is the Ethereal Empire. There are about eight interesting cities and countries along the way. How about we set these eight places as our supply points and just fly? That way, we can both appreciate the local customs and save effort!”</p> 
 <p>Looking at the detailed, marked map, Bai Xiaofei completely conceded to his fate. <em>All planned and organized! My sneaking away was definitely counted in!</em></p> 
 <p>“What place is this?” Bai Xiaofei pointed to a location on the map. For some reason, he felt a connection with it.</p> 
 <p>Soon, he knew why.</p> 
 <p>“Revelation Pavilion, the place where old man Revelation resides. I have long wanted to visit this legendary puppet master. I heard that his divination is very formidable!” Tan Xin’s eyes twinkled.</p> 
 <p>However, all Bai Bai Xiaofei thought of was the scene of the old geezer vomiting blood after making a divination. <em>Formidable? He’s just so-so…</em></p> 
 <p>“Let’s make it the first stop.” Bai Xiaofei pointed at the Revelation Pavilion, thus setting their first goal.</p> 
 <p>“That’s a bit difficult. The Revelation Pavilion never receives outsiders. We won’t get to see anything,” Tan Xin said while frowning.</p> 
 <p>Rui Mengqi immediately chirped, “No, no! Old man Revelation is our boss’s teacher. If we count by generation, Boss is actually considered the ancestor generation of the pavilion. Last time, some guy called Heartseer came, and he was very respectful to Boss!”</p> 
 <p>As the person who had been with Bai Xiaofei for the longest time among the three, Rui Mengqi sold out Bai Xiaofei cleanly.</p> 
 <p>“Really?! Then let’s go!!” Tan Xin excitedly jumped down from Bai Xiaofei’s back and summoned the Windsurfing Ship, which looked much smaller than before.</p> 
 <p>“The size can be adjusted? It’s really a treasure.” Bai Xiaofei sighed with emotion as he boarded the cruise ship. <em>There’s no escape, I’ll just accept my fate!</em></p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the graduation ceremony had officially ended. The graduates left Starnet Academy one by one, officially becoming elites of the continent.</p> 
 <p>As Lei Shan had said, the overall strength of this year’s graduates was much higher than that of the previous years. The experience from the bicentennial celebration made everyone’s growth speed soar to higher levels.</p> 
 <p>And the best among them was the group of people around Bai Xiaofei!</p> 
 <p>Stepping out of the academy’s gate, everyone in the Savage Class headed in their own direction, but the unstoppable confidence they exuded was the same!</p> 
 <p>“Why do I have the feeling that the next ten years may be the most interesting years of Starnet Continent?”</p> 
 <p>The four principal-level figures stood together as they watched the graduates leave the academy.</p> 
 <p>“Ten years? Oh, that’s way too little. I think the continent will be very interesting in the next twenty years!“ Chu Qingtian gave the graduates a greater affirmation.</p> 
 <p>“I think your estimation is way under. At least fifty years!” Luo Xi was even bolder.</p> 
 <p>“No, you are all wrong. Not just interesting, Starnet Continent will be turned upside down!” Lei Shan smiled, his deep eyes seemingly seeing through everything…</p>
