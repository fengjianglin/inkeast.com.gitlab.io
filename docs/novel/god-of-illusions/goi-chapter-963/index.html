 <p>Chapter 963: Rogues!</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness, the person in charge of the Northern District asks for an audience.”</p> 
 <p>In the only luxurious building of the whole former prison, Ye Tong was enjoying a table full of snacks when the voice of the door guard reported. Hearing the word ‘Northern,’ she immediately looked delighted.</p> 
 <p>“Let her in, I can’t wait to hear about how horrified that scum was!” Ye Tong chortled.</p> 
 <p>The head of the Northern District entered with a hesitant expression.</p> 
 <p>“Tell me, is that guy one breath away from death?” Ye Tong looked at the woman with anticipation, but what she saw was not the expression she expected.</p> 
 <p>“Reporting to Your Highness, a lot of people in the warehouse ran out. According to them, Fickle Bai has made the rest submit to him…” said the woman nervously as this sounded nothing like good news at all.</p> 
 <p>Sure enough, Ye Tong’s brow creased as soon as she heard this. However, she was not furious like the woman had feared.</p> 
 <p>“It seems this scum can’t be underestimated. If those men can’t handle him, gather the strength of the whole Northern District. No matter what, I must teach him a memorable lesson!” Ye Tong declared savagely and stood up from behind the pile of snacks. “I will personally go there and see what kind of storm he can create!”</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>In the central square, over 50,000 contestants had gathered. Because there were guards stationed around, the sea of men didn’t even dare to breathe loudly.</p> 
 <p>Of course, except for Bai Xiaofei’s group of three hundred people.</p> 
 <p>When that many muscular men stood together, no one dared to say anything no matter how noisy they were. After all, it looked quite intimidating…</p> 
 <p>“Listen carefully to what I’m going to say!” declared Ye Tong after she got on the high platform at the center, flanked by two guards, attracting everyone’s attention. “You have come all the way from all over the kingdom to this place, and being able to stand out from many servants shows that you are a little better than them, but this does not change the reality that you are still scum!”</p> 
 <p>Ye Tong’s voice echoed throughout the whole square. None of the tens of thousands of men dared to raise an objection of any kind.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but sigh. <em>Let’s just hope they can still be saved…</em></p> 
 <p>“There are three days until the birthday of the emperor, and this period will be the elimination round. Three days later, five hundred of you will be personally received by the emperor. If you want this honor, you need to give your best performance. If someone is found to be unruly, you can just pack up and leave immediately!”</p> 
 <p>When saying this, Ye Tong’s eyes rested on Bai Xiaofei, who had been shaking his head and sighing nonstop.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, now you can ask questions, but my patience is limited. If your questions are pointless, you can scram.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, many men who were full of questions kept their mouths shut, which triggered Bai Xiaofei!</p> 
 <p>“I have a question!” He raised his hand high and said loudly.</p> 
 <p>“Speak!” Ye Tong’s lips slightly curled up and her eyes flashed with a hint of ruthlessness. <em>You actually dared to throw yourself at my sword, huh?</em></p> 
 <p>“For the last standing five hundred, it won’t be just as simple as getting to have an audience with the emperor, right? Can we know what our ultimate goal is?” Bai Xiaofei asked.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the contestants all felt the same way. But even more so, they were curious if this kind of question would get Bai Xiaofei expelled from the competition.</p> 
 <p>“When you become one of those five hundred people, the emperor will tell you in person,” replied Ye Tong with a snort. Since her big sister had especially told her to state this to the contestants, she could not give Bai Xiaofei trouble for asking.</p> 
 <p>Having gotten the answer, Bai Xiaofei fell silent.</p> 
 <p>“No more questions?” Ye Tong asked with a frown while looking at Bai Xiaofei, her eyes obviously saying ‘Give me a reason to find fault!’</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei guessed her thoughts completely. No matter how much she wanted to stomp her feet, he showed no intention to speak at all.</p> 
 <p>“Cowardly trash!” Ye Tong coldly cursed, then concluded the event. “You will receive the schedule for tomorrow’s competition shortly. Tonight will be your last peaceful evening, so cherish it!” With that, she jumped down from the platform, followed by her two guards.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, the aroma of a delicious meal penetrated everyone’s nostrils.</p> 
 <p>“You have one hour to eat. After you finish, go back to your respective areas to rest. Those who wander around will be regarded as disturbing the peace!” a guard announced.</p> 
 <p>The food was placed in a common area before all the guards retreated, leaving only the contestants in the huge square.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, what does this mean?” Zhuang Shuo asked in confusion.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t you think one hour is too long for a meal?” Bai Xiaofei sneered.</p> 
 <p><em>This just keeps proving my guess!</em></p> 
 <p>“Zhuang Shuo, there’s a mission for you.”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Bai Xiaofei said this, Zhuang Shuo immediately listened with rapt attention, his face full of expectation.</p> 
 <p>“Take two hundred people and find the area with the best environment here. When you get there, take anything that you think can be of use to us. If someone stops you, just knock them down!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Zhuang Shuo’s eyes widened. Then, his face became ecstatic.</p> 
 <p>“Rest assured, Boss! I’ll definitely complete the mission!” he cried and led two hundred men in the opposite direction of the crowd.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go, we should get to work, too,” Bai Xiaofei said to the remaining one hundred people and cracked his neck.</p> 
 <p>“What do we do?” asked Zhu Chunyang.</p> 
 <p>The next second, Bai Xiaofei rushed out. “Grab food!”</p> 
 <p>Watching as Bai Xiaofei plunged toward the food, Zhu Chunyang and the remaining men stood in shock briefly before deciding to catch up with him.</p> 
 <p>“Open the way for Boss!” one yelled.</p> 
 <p>The one hundred muscular men immediately became qualified bodyguards, punching and kicking anyone who neared Bai Xiaofei to the ground. Before long, Bai Xiaofei became the first person to reach the food despite being the slowest to set out.</p> 
 <p>“Surround this place!” shouted Bai Xiaofei as he sent a contestant who rushed at him flying with a kick.</p> 
 <p>The group of muscular men instantly acted per his order. <em>Come, let us show you what’s called being rogues!</em></p>
