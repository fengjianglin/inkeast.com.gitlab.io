 <p><span style>As Zhu Si’si and Qi Wei swiftly approached, the other Earth Dire Bear realized that its companion had fallen into danger, and it forcefully endured its pain right away and intended to stop the two of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, the Ming brothers that had just withdrawn themselves turned around once again, and their shields instantly lay before the second Earth Dire Bear and forcefully obstructed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A battle between experts didn’t allow for the slightest error!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Relying on the safe environment created by Ming One and Ming Two, Zhu Si’si and Qi Wei successfully attained their objective, and their heavy blows smashed onto the joints of the Earth Dire Bear, causing the latter’s body that was large like a mountain to instantly lose its balance before falling down with its back towards the ground!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After obtaining success, Zhu Si’si and Qi Wei instantly withdrew themselves. But, this wasn’t the end because the Earth Dire Bear falling to the ground was only an opportunity, and the main event was Wang Hang!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Wang Hang was running madly towards Wu Chi, and at the instant they met, Wang Hang stepped onto Wu Chi’s hands that were overlapped on each other before he was directly sent up into the air by Wu Chi’s full forced toss!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Spiral Assassination!” Relying on the downward force from his descent, Wang Hang resolutely activated his strongest attack, and the point he aimed at was precisely the chest of the Earth Dire Bear that had its defenses blasted open by Fang Ye and Xing Nan earlier!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both the Earth Dire Bears noticed this scene. But, the Earth Dire Bear on the ground was completely out of time to dodge, and the only thing it could do was cover a layer of yellow glow on its body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other side, the other Earth Dire Bear that was unable to break through the obstruction of Ming One and Ming Two let out a furious howl as a trace of resolution flashed within its eyes!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s going to try to bring both of you down with it! Face your shields downward!!!” Bai Xiaofei roared out this time, whereas, Ming One and Ming One resolutely split their shield apart before placing them beneath their feet, and it was in the next second that earthen spikes tore through the ground and directly blasted the two of them up into the sky. The standing Earth Dire Bear seized this opportunity to give each of them a slap, but fortunately, their reactions were swift enough, and they utilized their shields to protect themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, the Earth Dire Bear’s strike of fury wasn’t a joke, and both of them were at least blasted over 20 meters away and rolled an entire seven or eight rounds after hitting the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re fine!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you continue!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their mouths were filled with the taste of blood, yet Ming One and Ming Two still made their status clear at the first possible moment. But, they could dream of participating in the remaining part of this battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the Earth Dire Bear that had finally broken through the line of defense was dashing madly towards Wang Han that was descending from midair, and it wanted to slap him flying like it did to the Ming brothers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, right at this moment, Fang Ye’s puppet launched an attack once more. His heavy rifle puppet’s bullets carried enormous kinetic energy as they forcefully stopped its forward footsteps and forced it back. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next second, Wang Hang who was spinning at high speeds struck the Earth Dire Bear that had fallen to the ground with extreme accuracy, and the earthen yellow glow merely sustained itself for less than half a second before shattering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An assassin was always the nightmare of those that were heavily injured and weak!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a deafening shrill cry resounded out, the Earth Dire Bear that had been practically pierced through raised its bear paw before slapping flying Wang Hang that wasn’t able to withdraw in time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, the strength of this strike was far inferior to the strike the Ming brothers suffered earlier, and Wang Hang had already readjusted himself while in midair before flawlessly doing a backflip in midair and descending safely to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a short moment, this Earth Dire Bear that was already almost at the end of its life struggled to crawl up, and it roared at its companion before both of them stared at Bai Xiaofei at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei seemed to have expected this scene since the beginning, and not only did he not move aside, he made a light taunting gesture with his finger towards them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Provocation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sometimes, possessing intelligence might not be a good thing because Barbaric Rank Magical Beasts relied on their instinct to make reactions, but once a Magic Beast possessed intelligence, provocation became an extremely interesting thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because you wouldn’t know if the person who made the provocative action wanted you to come over or didn’t want you to come over!</span><span style>But, at this moment, the Earth Dire Bears had firmed their resolution to kill Bai Xiaofei! So, Bai Xiaofei’s provocation at this moment had undoubtedly strengthened their thoughts even more! </span></p>
 <p><span style>As an earthen yellow glow covered their bodies once again, the two Earth Dire Bears charged swiftly towards Bai Xiaofei with heavy footsteps, and their terrifying speed was actually even slightly faster than when the members of Bai Xiaofei’s group charged earlier!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, right at the instant the two Earth Dire Bears started moving, both Xing Nan and Fang Ye launched their attacks, causing Origin Energy arrows and bullets to strike the same Earth Dire Bear one after the other, and it hit the Earth Dire Bear that wasn’t injured this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Both of you have come to the wrong place!” Right at the second before the two Earth Dire Bears were about to bring Bai Xiaofei into their radius of attack, an enormous medicinal cauldron shook slightly in the air that no one had paid attention to, and it caused numerous and enormous streams of river water to pour down. Lin Li wore luxurious clothes that seemed like those of a female emperor as she stood beneath the medicinal cauldron, and the tremendous work of lifting the medicinal cauldron was completed by her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gold-grade puppet, Divine Phoenix Feather Dress!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Its effect? control!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was capable of controlling a single attribute of choice in the surroundings and transform it into an extension of one’s self, and its might was decided by distance and the amount of Origin Energy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>With Lin Li’s current Origin Energy at the Master Rank, it was more than enough for her to move a medicinal cauldron that was completely filled with water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The river water that poured down created a certain level of obstructive effect, but it wasn’t everything that Bai Xiaofei had prepared, and the person that came onto the stage next was Chen Hui!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Snowfreeze Pearl!” The energy of ice stretched out, causing the river water that had poured out from the medicinal cauldron and was beneath the legs of the Earth Dire Bears to freeze into a layer of ice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Presently, Chen Hui wasn’t the newbie that was only capable of freezing an expanse of river water for five seconds. After the tempering of an entire month, he’d already advanced to the Proficient Rank, and so long as he didn’t undo it, this river water would remain as ice forever!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, Bai Xiaofei didn’t need it to be frozen for so long, and merely an instant was sufficient!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The friction of ice couldn’t be compared to the ground, causing the two charging Earth Dire Bears to fall onto the ground successively, and they were like two mountains that had fallen before Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shi Kui!” It was the final card up his sleeve. Shi Kui that was hidden near Bai Xiaofei directly leap out. Puppetsmiths were more or less similar to Alchemists, and their first puppets were similarly the fellow they used to make a living, a hammer!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, unlike Alchemists, hammers could be utilized as weapons!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under the effect of Origin Energy, the hammer instantly enlarged before smashing down directly towards the heavily injured Earth Dire Bear’s head….</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, this Earth Dire Bear was unable to stand up because it was already relying on its last breath and being able to persist until now was already its limit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the other Earth Dire Bear finally stood up, Wu Chi, Wang Hang, and the others had already made an encirclement and were about to charge forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While carried a trace of grief in its eyes, the last remaining Earth Dire Bear roared furiously as the remaining energy within its entire body erupted, causing circles of earthen spikes to spread out with it as the center, and it directly forced everyone back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When everyone encircled over once more, it had already dashed towards the one and only opening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It could flee yet it was impossible for it to flee while being completely intact. Fang Ye and Xing Nan launched attacks once more, and they directly struck the back of the Earth Dire Bear and split its flesh open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s over.” As he looked at the direction the Earth Dire Bear was fleeing towards, Bai Xiaofei revealed a grin of victory.</span></p>
