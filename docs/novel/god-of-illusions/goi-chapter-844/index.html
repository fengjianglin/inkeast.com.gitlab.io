 <p>Chapter 844: Overbearing? It’s Only Just Starting!</p> 
 <p>“Calling you an idiot is already flattering. You are worse than shit,” Bai Xiaofei spat out coldly.</p> 
 <p>Reading his tone, Tan Xin understood. In a flash, she zoomed past the man. When she returned to Bai Xiaofei, the man had collapsed on the ground.</p> 
 <p>“I cut his hand and foot tendons and abolished all of his energy points. He will be a cripple for the rest of his life,” Tan Xin said indifferently.</p> 
 <p>This sentence was worse than death for any puppet master.</p> 
 <p>“To someone who bullies ordinary people just because you’re puppet master, not killing you is already being kind. Were you born already a puppet master? Have you forgotten your roots?” Bai Xiaofei snorted and looked at the other three.</p> 
 <p>The three instantly knelt.</p> 
 <p>“This subordinate greets future madam!” they sang in unison. As far as they were concerned, ‘Yun Ni’ would be the madam of their president sooner or later as it was too easy for such a puppet master to kill the current madam.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t you know what you should do yet?” Bai Xiaofei coldly said.</p> 
 <p>After a brief confusion, one of them hurriedly crawled to the business permit and picked it up, presenting it to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Taking the permit, Bai Xiaofei walked to Yun Ye. “Your problem ends here. Leave the rest to me, I will handle it.”</p> 
 <p>Not caring if Yun Ye understood what he meant, Bai Xiaofei left with Tan Xin. The three puppet masters also hurriedly followed.</p> 
 <p>After settling down in the carriage to the Vivid Wing branch president’s place, Tan Xin frowned. “Aren’t we a little too overbearing? This isn’t like the Yun family’s style.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei laughed. “Overbearing? I have only just started. And you can rest assured that they won’t think I’m not Yun Ni herself,” he replied. Ever since he experienced that puppet master’s attitude, he had been furious.</p> 
 <p>For him to grow to who he was today, his perverse physique was only a part of it. The rest was thanks to having so many people supporting him. Under such influence, Bai Xiaofei developed a mentality to view everyone equally. What the Vivid Wing branch people had done trampled on this.</p> 
 <p><em>No matter what, I will make them regret it!</em></p> 
 <p>The carriage was not slow. They soon arrived at the house of the greedy and licentious branch president.</p> 
 <p>Getting off the carriage, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help a cold snort. A small branch president who was only responsible for expanding a minor business chain of the Vivid Wing Chamber actually got to live in such a magnificent manor. It seemed that he had really bagged some good money!</p> 
 <p>No wonder he dared to take in one concubine after another and even hired puppet masters.</p> 
 <p>“Not even a single welcome receptionist? Is this the way you do things around here?” Bai Xiaofei asked icily.</p> 
 <p>The three puppet masters immediately panicked.</p> 
 <p>“I’m sorry, Miss, the merchant group may be a little busy and forgot to make arrangements.” One hurriedly came up with a reasonable excuse.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, Bai Xiaofei had no intention of buying it.</p> 
 <p>“What does that have to do with his house? Don’t tell me that your president is the kind who forgets to eat and sleep because of work. You really think I know nothing? I shall wait here. Don’t even think of making me go in without any ostentation,” he said and went back into the carriage.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin, who didn’t say a word during the whole process, burst out laughing after she entered the carriage.</p> 
 <p>“You are making it hard on them to the end, huh?” Her interest was roused when she figured out Bai Xiaofei’s plan.</p> 
 <p>“As I said, it has just begun. The good show is still to come. If you don’t overturn their place, I will have come here for nothing.” Bai Xiaofei sneered.</p> 
 <p>This was the first time Tan Xin had seen this side of him, but it was understandable. From the day she first met him, Bai Xiaofei was in a powerless state. Although the truly important thing was his brain, the Blood Diamond mission required him to be extremely careful and therefore he had not been this overbearing.</p> 
 <p>However, now that Bai Xiaofei had regained his strength, he resumed his normal style and pace, and the Vivid Wing Chamber just happened to be the first touchstone!</p> 
 <p>“What do we do? If we go to report this, we won’t end up well!”</p> 
 <p>Outside, the three puppet masters were in a discussion. Since their leader was destroyed, they had lost their backbone.</p> 
 <p>“You think we will have any good results if we don’t report? Do you really think she’s willing to wait for a long time? If she erupts again, one of us will be next!”</p> 
 <p>Recalling the horrifying state of their leader just now, the three men subconsciously shuddered. It was not easy for them to become Proficient Rank puppet masters. They did not want to die before they could fully enjoy the life of a puppet master.</p> 
 <p>“I’m going to find someone. In any case, you guys must reassure her first.” One decided to take the matter into his hands.</p> 
 <p>As he ran into the manor, the remaining two looked at the carriage, trembling. <em>Please, just don’t come out and make it hard on us!</em></p> 
 <p>Praying silently, the two experienced what people called ‘a second feels like a year’ for the first time in their lives. Fortunately for them, Bai Xiaofei did not intend to torture the two small fries. He quietly waited for the arrival of the main player.</p> 
 <p>After a short while, the puppet master who had gone in came out. Walking before him was a man so fat he had three chins.</p> 
 <p>“You little b*tch dare to make a fuss at my place?! You’re tired of living already?!!” the fat man’s abusive voice rang out as soon as he came out of the entrance.</p> 
 <p>As soon as he finished his words, a figure shot out. With a loud bang, the fat man’s chin kissed the ground.</p> 
 <p>“How dare you talk to our young miss like that?! I think <em>you</em> are tired of living!” Tan Xin stepped on the fat man as she thoroughly implemented Bai Xiaofei’s domineering plan.</p> 
 <p>“I want you f*cking dead!” cursed the man as he sprawled on the ground like a lump of fat, thinking he could scare Tan Xin.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, he thought too much.</p> 
 <p>“Do you know the price of angering an Exquisite Rank puppet master?” Tan Xin lightly uttered.</p> 
 <p>Everyone around was thunderstruck. <em>What the hell?! Exquisite Rank puppet master?!</em></p> 
 <p>Before they could recover from the shock, a scream like that of a pig being slaughtered filled the air…</p>
