 <p>When Bai Xiaofei stepped outside the Babel Merchant House once more, he had earned a profit so huge not even the term “bountiful harvest” was sufficient to portray what he had just earned.</p>
 <p>“Brother Feng, thank you so much. I wouldn’t have been able to earn that much without you here.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was speaking from his heart. Without Feng Wuhen, not to mention getting all those vestige treasures, he wouldn’t even have been shown those treasures.</p>
 <p>“You are too polite, Brother Bai. I had gotten a Feature Locking Pill worth at least five billion Amethyst Coins for free. I couldn’t have asked for anything better than this. If such opportunities turn up again in the future, do not forget me, brother.” Feng Wuhen replied with a hearty laugh. His outspoken and direct character was not a pretense.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“We will have plenty of opportunities in the future. In any case, I will keep this favor close to heart, Brother Feng. If you require my help in the future, feel free to look for me. I have something else to do so I’ll stop holding up your time.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei and Feng Wuhen said their goodbyes with their fists cupped. After Feng Wuhen left, only Bai Xiaofei’s group of three was left.</p>
 <p>“Give me your Amethyst Card.” Bai Xiaofei said with a smile on his face. When Fang Ye heard that, he was slightly stunned. But he still did as told instinctively. His trust toward Bai Xiaofei was comparable to Hu Xian’er’s.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“I always keep my promise. Since you have given up on your family because of me, I will give you an opportunity to create a miracle.” While speaking, Bai Xiaofei transferred the money in his Amethyst Card to Fang Ye. All 1.5 trillion Amethyst Coins were transferred over. When the Amethyst Card was returned to Fang Ye, he was completely stunned, unaware of what Bai Xiaofei was trying to do here.</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Fei, what…is this for?” Still in a daze, Fang Ye asked. His hand that was holding the Amethyst Card trembled. When one stored money in an Amethyst Card, the cardholder would be earning a monthly interest of 0.005%. In other words, even without doing anything, he would be earning an interest of 7.5 billion Amethyst Coins every month with the money currently in his card.</p>
 <p>“Invest the money. I trust the money will grow in your hands. Give it ten years. In ten years, I will come looking for you. Hopefully, the 1.5 trillion would have transformed into 150 trillion or even more by then!” Bai Xiaofei smiled calmly and said something that caused Fang Ye to be in disbelief.</p>
 <p>“Calm down. Don’t feel too pressured. For me, these are ill-gotten gains anyway. And I have no idea what to do with them. The money will be much more useful in your hands as I believe you are a person capable of creating history in the business world.” Bai Xiaofei said as he patted Fang Ye’s shoulder to calm him down. As for Fang Ye, he looked at Bai Xiaofei with an extremely complicated gaze. His trembling lips and misty eyes made his current emotions clear.</p>
 <p>“No, don’t you start crying. I don’t know how to coax guys. Don’t forget that I have countless ways of making money in the academy. Do you think I will be poor after giving you the money? I will never be poor.” Bai Xiaofei comforted Fang Ye again before turning to leave. He had no intention of staying behind and listening to Fang Ye’s heartfelt words.</p>
 <p>“I still have something else to do. You may continue wallowing in your emotions alone here.”</p>
 <p>After leaving behind those words, Bai Xiaofei and Hu Xian’er vanished from Fang Ye’s vision. Standing there, Fang Ye lowered his head and gazed at the Amethyst Card in his hand. The swelling emotions in his eyes vanished, replaced by an unprecedented resoluteness.</p>
 <p><em>I can do it!</em></p>
 <p>When Fang Ye raised his head once more, his temperament had gone through a complete change, as if he was a kid who had just grown up. Nobody would stay a child forever. At times, growth could occur over a fleeting moment. In recent times, such growth had happened to Fang Ye twice: once from this incident and once when he spent the night drunk after severing his relationship with his father.</p>
 <p>A brand new Fang Ye was appearing in the world. But he was not the main character today. Instead, the main characters were Bai Xiaofei and Hu Xian’er who had just left on a pretext of having something to do.</p>
 <p>Finally alone with each other, the two no longer needed to constrain themselves. But to be perfectly clear, this statement was definitely not referring to <em>that</em>. What they no longer needed to constrain were their emotions. With their repressed emotions fully unleashed, joy was all over their faces. Even Hu Xian’er who was usually cold and lofty had a look of extreme bliss on her face.</p>
 <p>“Wait, not here. We need to leave. There are too many pairs of eyes in the academy.”</p>
 <p>The more people Bai Xiaofei knew, the more unsafe he felt in the academy grounds. You would have no way of knowing if you were being monitored at any particular moment, or to be precise, even if you realized that you were under monitoring, you wouldn’t be able to do anything about it.</p>
 <p>“After your previous injury, our regular escape route from the academy has been sealed. How can we sneak out now?” Hu Xian’er asked with a sullen tone. Losing the freedom to leave as she wished was not something good for her.</p>
 <p>“There are no perfect defenses. Even with the barrier around the academy, with me here, we won’t have trouble locating a loophole.” Bai Xiaofei said. With a smile on his face, he released Huskie from his arms. But instead of leading the way, Huskie turned and barked twice at Bai Xiaofei instead.</p>
 <p>“Shit, you are getting very capable nowadays huh, you silly dog! You have the guts to talk terms with me?” Bai Xiaofei berated Huskie. He was about to teach Huskie a lesson before he felt a chill up his spine.</p>
 <p>“It’s just a fruit. Why are you being so stingy? You promised to give me some, right? Just deduct one from my portion and give it to the silly dog.” Hu Xian’er’s frosty voice rang out. Immediately after she spoke those words, Huskie rushed over to her and jumped into her arms.</p>
 <p><em>Damn it! No wonder you are being so gutsy… So you have a backer today.</em></p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei grew timid after seeing the grave expression Hu Xian’er had.</p>
 <p>“It’s a joke! A joke! When am I ever stingy toward my own people?” Bai Xiaofei slammed his own chest as he declared. But Huskie was uncooperative as he barked twice upon hearing Bai Xiaofei’s words, putting him in great frustration.</p>
 <p>“What do you have to say? Between Huskie and you, who do you think I’ll trust?”</p>
 <p><em>Why bother asking that question? The look in your eyes is the answer!</em></p>
 <p>“Fine, fine, it’s my bad. I promise I will do my part as a master from now on. I will put all my heart into serving my puppets.” Bai Xiaofei vowed solemnly, feeling like the roles of the master and the puppet were being reversed.</p>
 <p>“That’s more like it. Let’s go.” Hu Xian’er said with a satisfied smile on her face before she started walking toward where Huskie was pointing. Slowly, her graceful figure vanished into the dark of the night.</p>
 <p>“Blackie, what do you think about forming an alliance against Huskie? He is getting worse nowadays!”</p>
 <p>With an intense indignation, Bai Xiaofei tried to recruit a comrade in arms. Unfortunately, the result of the recruitment was a disappointing one. Blackie merely glared at him as a response. In truth, Blackie resented Bai Xiaofei more than she resented Huskie.</p>
 <p>“Sigh, public morals are degenerating with each day, and the beasts are losing their hearts. Where is the loyalty of animate puppets? Are my animate puppets fake?”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei stared at the sky as he lamented the injustice he had just witnessed. As he lamented, he revealed an expression of an indignant hero about to sacrifice himself. Unfortunately, nobody was here to appreciate his top tier acting.</p>
 <p><em>Forget it, I should just catch up to them and not get sidetracked.</em></p>
