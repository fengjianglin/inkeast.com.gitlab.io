 <p>Chapter 521: The Same Place…</p> 
 <p>Unknown whether it was due to his fear for Luo Xi or because it was so relaxing to be with Luo Han, Bai Xiaofei didn’t feel tired at all despite spending a whole day walking around. In the same situation with the other girls, he would already have whined non-stop about how much hard work it was.</p> 
 <p>After trying out everything there was to play, Luo Han let loose, which was clear from the constant smile on her face and the increase in her words, only that her cheeks still blushed red when looking at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Anywhere else you want to go?” asked Bai Xiaofei with the utmost sincerity. Different from his original mindset of treating this date as a task, he had very much enjoyed this one-day tour around Starnet.</p> 
 <p>After getting to know a girl like Luo Han, one couldn’t help but meet all her wishes. Any normal boy wouldn’t be able to refuse her.</p> 
 <p>“Well…” Luo Han softly spoke in hesitation.</p> 
 <p>“Just tell me where you want to go. Even if you want to go out of Starnet, I can take you,” Bai Xiaofei patted his chest and promised.</p> 
 <p>This promise actually struck at Luo Han’s true desire.</p> 
 <p>“Really?!” Luo Han looked up with expectation.</p> 
 <p>Her stare gave Bai Xiaofei a bad feeling. <em>She’s not gonna want to really leave Starnet, is she…? Stupid mouth, why won’t you ever learn?!</em></p> 
 <p>Of course, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t say what he thought. Now that he had made a promise, his only choice was to follow through.</p> 
 <p>“Of course. Where do you want to go?” Bai Xiaofei asked with an uneasy heart. It was getting dark soon and Blackie’s ability was still on cooldown. While it wasn’t a problem to ensure self-protection against normal magical beasts by relying on Huskie and Purple Luan, they’d be in grave danger if they came across one of those rare, super powerful beasts. And this was quite possible considering the turbulence in the Infinite Mountain Range.</p> 
 <p>“I want to go to the back cliff…” Luo Han revealed slowly as her eyes shone.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was relieved to hear this. The back cliff was the place where Luo Xi had taken him previously. It wasn’t far from Starnet and was on the edge of the Infinite Mountain Range, so there were Starnet members active nearby and there were no high-ranked magical beasts.</p> 
 <p>“No problem!” Bai Xiaofei agreed without a second thought, fearing that Luo Han would change her mind if he was any slower.</p> 
 <p>Following Bai Xiaofei, Luo Han finally walked the road out of Starnet that she had never dared to set foot on before. After Luo Xi adopted her as a baby, she had never left the academy, and all her perceptions of the outside world came from the stories of others.</p> 
 <p>She had never even seen the nearby Infinite Mountain Range, so this was a significant event for her. As for why she chose the back cliff was because this was the only place she knew in the Infinite Mountain Range which she learned from Lei Shan. And there was also a story about her mother that she had carved into her memory…</p> 
 <p>A story that could have been beautiful but ended tragically…</p> 
 <p>“This can’t be your first time going out of Starnet?!” exclaimed Bai Xiaofei in surprise. His eyes as sharp as ever, he had immediately noticed from Luo Han’s expression that she found everything outside very novel.</p> 
 <p>Sure enough, Luo Han nodded gently with a hint of embarrassment. At that moment, Bai Xiaofei suddenly felt pity for her.</p> 
 <p>For more than ten years, she had never left the place called Starnet, and even so, she hadn’t even experienced all the fun that it offered. It could be seen that her life until now had included nothing special other than cultivation…</p> 
 <p>No wonder she was so introverted and shy. It wasn’t that she was unwilling to have contact with others, but that she didn’t know how to and then grew too afraid to!</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter? Is there anything wrong?” asked Luo Han softly when she saw Bai Xiaofei stood blankly on the spot, her voice was still gentle as before. However, this was already good progress. At least she would take the initiative to talk to him now and dared to look straight at him.</p> 
 <p>It was really not easy to make such a big change in just a day.</p> 
 <p>“There’s nothing wrong, I just think you are a little pitiful…” Bai Xiaofei blurted out and immediately regretted it, but it was too late to take it back.</p> 
 <p>Luo Han’s reaction was only a smile. Having little contact with people didn’t mean that she was stupid. On the contrary, she was quite smart and she instantly understood what Bai Xiaofei meant by ‘pitiful.’</p> 
 <p>“I don’t feel that I’m pitiful. I would have died as a baby if it wasn’t for Mother. Although I haven’t left Starnet in the past seventeen years, I became a Master Rank puppet master despite having little talent thanks to her guidance. I am already very satisfied.” Luo Han never told anyone this, because no one ever asked.</p> 
 <p>“After that? Are you going to stay in Starnet for the rest of your life?” Bai Xiaofei asked with a hint of sympathy. If he could, he really wanted to get Luo Han out to experience the world. For a girl her age, it was a pity to remain in Starnet for the rest of her life.</p> 
 <p>“I haven’t thought about it, but I can already feel that my strength has reached a bottleneck. If there are no accidents, the Grandmaster Rank will be my limit, and at that time, Mother should allow me to leave Starnet,” Luo Han said slowly. There was loneliness in her voice.</p> 
 <p>She had followed Luo Xi’s arrangements because she was still young. Now that she had grown up, the outside world posed a fatal attraction for her.</p> 
 <p>“Even if Aunt Luo doesn’t let you, I will persuade her!” said Bai Xiaofei resolutely. Fighting for the weak was in his nature, which could be seen from many past events. Not only so, he even saw them through made sure to achieve a perfect end.</p> 
 <p>This promise brought a slight smile to Han Luo’s face, a smile brimming with happiness. What could make people happier than the promise of the person they liked? Even if this promise might not be realized in the end…</p> 
 <p>“Did Mother tell you what happened here before?” After a brief silence, Luo Han suddenly changed the subject. Her head lowered and her voice became soft again.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Bai Xiaofei instinctively gulped. He knew what Luo Han was referring to.</p> 
 <p>“My father wronged Aunt Luo. He couldn’t carry out his promise,” replied Bai Xiaofei as his heart tightened. The atmosphere was ripe, so he could anticipate what Luo Han was about to say…</p> 
 <p>“If you want, I won’t be as stubborn as Mother. I can leave Starnet!” Luo Han suddenly raised her head, her pair of big eyes intently staring at Bai Xiaofei, flashing with an unprecedented resolution.</p> 
 <p>Decades ago, in the same place, Bai Longfei had racked his brains and exchanged a promise for Luo Xi’s heart.</p> 
 <p>In the present, the location had not changed, but the characters and story had…</p> 
 <p>So, would the regret as well?</p>
