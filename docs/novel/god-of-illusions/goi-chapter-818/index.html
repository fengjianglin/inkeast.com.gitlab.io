 <p>Chapter 818: Zhao Ji!!!</p> 
 <p>“Give them a hand.”</p> 
 <p>Glancing at the victims struggling on the edge of death, Bai Xiaofei looked up, barely controlling his trembling body as he said those words with difficulty. He was unable to respond to those begging eyes. He was a man, not a god. Those people could no longer be saved…</p> 
 <p>“Leave it to me.” Seeing no one in the flustered team knew what to do, Golden Feather took it upon herself. Despite finding the scene shocking, she wasn’t as affected as the rest.</p> 
 <p>A golden flame spread and killed the worms along with the victims, but the terrifyingly high temperature didn’t make them feel any pain at all.</p> 
 <p>“There is still a battle ahead, are you ready?” Bai Xiaofei asked, his voice icy and his fists clenched.</p> 
 <p>“I cannot wait!” Gripping his dagger, Wang Hang answered on behalf of everyone.</p> 
 <p>Thus, they set out towards the final battle!</p> 
 <p>…</p> 
 <p>“We have guests.” On the seventh floor, the silent Zhao Ji suddenly laughed out of nowhere.</p> 
 <p>Outside the barrier, Sikong Ming snorted and turned to Ruthless Dragon. “They are yours. Do not let them in.”</p> 
 <p>Without a word, Ruthless Dragon got up, turned, and went straight out.</p> 
 <p>“Oh? Not sending some more people? Those children are not so easy to deal with!” Zhao Ji taunted in amusement, as if watching a good show.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t compare your trashy underlings with my people. Each of us climbed out of a bloody sea of corpses,” Bony Dragon retorted.</p> 
 <p>However, Zhao Ji was more malicious than he expected. “Don’t brag. Aren’t those slaughtered dogs on the surface not your people? Unify Business, Shadow Death, how capable of you all. Say, if news of this gets out, do you think your Unify Business can last?”</p> 
 <p>Hearing Zhao Ji’s playful tone, Bony Dragon’s mouth twitched in speechlessness.</p> 
 <p>“No one will know if all the people here are dead. And just if, even if something gets out, our branch alone will take responsibility for it. It won’t be able to affect the foundation of our whole organization,” said Sikong Ming indifferently as he stood up. “However, you are right, those people are not to be underestimated, so I won’t accompany you.”</p> 
 <p>With that, Sikong Ming also headed out, but with some last words.</p> 
 <p>“I hope that when I return, I can have a face-to-face conversation with President Zhao Ji.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bony Dragon and the other two shivered. The last time Sikong Ming spoke like that, someone of their rank died! The three immediately increased the energy output to sap away at the barrier.</p> 
 <p>“The troublesome fellow is gone!” Zhao Ji burst out laughing after Sikong Ming disappeared from sight.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, the barrier suddenly expanded. Before Bony Dragon’s group could react, it had grown to include them within.</p> 
 <p>“What is the meaning of this?!”</p> 
 <p>The three people instantly sprang up with their puppets summoned, looking nervously at Zhao Ji.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t you want to kill me and control the mother worm? I’m giving you a chance. You don’t want it?” Zhao Ji smiled as the blood pool started to churn. “However, I am not going to sit still, so I’ve called for some help.”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Zhao Ji finished speaking, six human figures without an inch of skin rose from the blood pool. The instant they opened their eyes, six violent aura waves swept through the whole area!</p> 
 <p>“Tear them apart and you will be free.”</p> 
 <p>Before Bony Dragon’s group could understand what those words meant, the six muscular figures rushed up to them. There were no fancy movements, only speed and strength!</p> 
 <p>“Bonify!” Bony Dragon was the first to respond. A fine layer of unknown white material seeped out from his skin and turned him into a skeletal creature with bone spikes all over his body, looking quite resistant to beating.</p> 
 <p>After Bony Dragon, Sun Shadow and Moon Trace acted. A burning sun and a crescent moon appeared above them. At the same time, a wave of freezing energy and a wave of hot energy crashed down at the six approaching bloody figures.</p> 
 <p>Alternating between hot and cold, the figures’ naked muscles ruptured and revealed the white bones inside. However, their speed did not slow down at all!</p> 
 <p>Seeing as Sun Shadow and Moon Trace were about to be hit, Bony Dragon appeared in front of them in a flicker. “This old man orders you to stop!” He used his body to take the opponent’s group attack head-on.</p> 
 <p>Bony Dragon was sent flying, his bone spikes and bone armor shattered. The strength of the six figures was obviously beyond his expectations. However, he was not beaten up for nothing. The moment he had contact with the bones of the six people, Bony Dragon had launched his skill and changed their bone structures. Currently, the six figures were unable to move.</p> 
 <p>“The sun burns everything!”</p> 
 <p>“The moon looms over all!”</p> 
 <p>Sun Shadow and Moon Trace immediately seized the opportunity as sharp attacks accurately struck at the bones of six figures. Their skeletal frames broke apart inch by inch before exploding!</p> 
 <p>“Dodge!!”</p> 
 <p>At the moment of the explosion, Bony Dragon realized that something was wrong. However, his warning was too late. The hollow bones of the six figures were filled with black particles the size of sesame seeds. With the explosion, the particles burst in all directions and got all over Sun Shadow and Moon Trace.</p> 
 <p>“What the heck?!!”</p> 
 <p>The two screamed but did not have a chance to react. The black particles suddenly became ‘alive’ and drilled into their bodies.</p> 
 <p>No pain, just like nothing happened, but when the two used internal sight to check their bodies, their expressions were filled with horror. They had been infested by Blood Worms!</p> 
 <p>“One slipped away, but no matter. This is now my home field.” Zhao Ji smiled as he looked at the three with great interest. The next words coming from his mouth nearly broke them. “So, in front of life and death, how will you choose? Kill your teammates for the chance to survive, or sacrifice yourself to continue targeting me?”</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Ruthless Dragon had engaged in a battle with Bai Xiaofei’s group.</p> 
 <p>With Ruthless Dragon as the center, a turquoise toxic gas had diffused into the whole space. Beasts formed from the gas kept harassing Bai Xiaofei’s group, forcing them to back up.</p> 
 <p>“You lot actually dare to come here with this kind of strength. Looks like all you did back in Starnet was rely on that old guy Lei Shan!” Ruthless Dragon’s disdainful voice rang out as his energy surged, “Time to end this!”</p>
