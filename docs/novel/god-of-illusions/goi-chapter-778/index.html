 <p>Chapter 778: Tri-Form Stone!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s domineering declaration echoed in the whole hall. Verbal combat was the ability that his career in Starnet was built on. In regards to turning black into white with words, he refused to lose to anyone.</p> 
 <p>“The auction of puppets ends here. I hope you got what you wanted, honored guests. Let us take a break in wait for an even more excellent round!” Sensing the sparks in the atmosphere on the verge of exploding, Qing Han quickly stepped out to save the day. If these kinds of guests started a fight, the building would be destroyed!</p> 
 <p>Qing Han’s words also reminded everyone that they were in the territory of Unify Business, where one must weigh their power before deciding to make a scene!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei gave Qing Han some face and quieted down. At the same time, he started to look forward to the grand finale puppet that he had just paid a sky-high price for. <em>Just what is that puppet that they don’t even dare to let others even know the name?</em></p> 
 <p>“You can tell me what it is now, can’t you?” Bai Xiaofei looked at Qing Ya again.</p> 
 <p>However, the latter only smiled. “Young Master Bai, it will be much more interesting to uncover the mystery yourself.”</p> 
 <p>By keeping Bai Xiaofei in suspense, Qing Ya earned a bout of laughter from him. Her charm was really above that of her brother.</p> 
 <p>Soon, the item was delivered. Looking at the small box placed in front of him, Bai Xiaofei rubbed his hands. <em>This is 50 billion Amethyst Coins!</em></p> 
 <p>The box was slowly opened, but the stunning, colorful picture that Bai Xiaofei imagined did not occur. Lying quietly inside was a stone of three colors: purple, blue, and black.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei instantly frowned and shot Qing Ya a puzzled look. His reaction drew the curiosity of the three Exquisite Ranks and they took a peek at the content. The next second, the three froze in place.</p> 
 <p>“Tri… Tri-Form Stone?!” exclaimed Shaman King before Bai Xiaofei could ask Qing Ya what the stone was.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately turned around. “You know this thing?”</p> 
 <p>“Young Master, you don’t know?!” Shaman King made a face of disbelief, but he quickly realized that he had said something wrong. “I’m sorry for running my mouth, Young Master.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei snorted and ignored him. He turned back to Qing Ya.</p> 
 <p>“This is the Tri-Form Stone, a quasi-violetgold puppet that established the fame of Violethorn Empire’s Exquisite Rank grand general – Martial Overlord. Three months ago, the general died mysteriously in his home along with his whole family of five hundred and sixty-one people. His Tri-Form Stone was found missing.”</p> 
 <p>“For the past three months, Violethorn has invested a lot of manpower and resources but failed to identify the culprit even until now. There are various speculations on this matter all over the continent. After all, the fact that there’s someone with the ability to do that to the General Overlord in his own home is a problem in itself.”</p> 
 <p>“In the end, the Violethorn Empire simply announced that no matter who it is, if they dare to use the Tri-Form Stone, it will be regarded as provocation against Violethorn and will be killed unconditionally!”</p> 
 <p>Qing Ya’s long explanation grabbed Bai Xiaofei’s attention. However, he was not interested in the part about Violethorn. No matter who would come for his life, he was not worried at all. One would be really stupid to deny the good stuff sent to their hands!</p> 
 <p>“I’ve already bought it, so that’s all meaningless. Tell me about this puppet’s ability.” Bai Xiaofei’s tone was indifferent as if he did not take the Violethorn Empire seriously at all.</p> 
 <p>Which was true. He could not actively provoke Violethorn, but the other way around also applied. He could just choose either Starnet Academy or the Revelation Pavilion to turtle in, and Violethorn could only gawk then!</p> 
 <p>“Despite its rank, the Tri-Form Stone itself has no active ability. Its only function is to become an accessory of another puppet. However, the puppet it attaches to will undergo a qualitative change. Not only will its grade be forcibly raised to at least quasi-violetgold, but it will also gain an ability called Tri-Form Transformation. What the transformation will be depends on the host puppet, but no matter what, the result will not disappoint,” explained Qing Ya.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei picked up the stone while recalling the stuff in his possession. Then, a hint of jealousy appeared on his face. <em>Damn it, if I had known, I would have saved a spot! Now this thing can only benefit another!</em></p> 
 <p>“Next is the auction of magical beasts, right?” Stowing the stone, Bai Xiaofei reconfirmed with Qing Ya.</p> 
 <p>“Yes,” Qing Ya replied calmly, but was inwardly doubtful.</p> 
 <p>Although she didn’t know the reason, she could see that Bai Xiaofei was looking forward to the magical beast and slave auction very much, and not for the same reason as others.</p> 
 <p>“Young Master Bai, if I may ask, are you in great need of certain magical beasts and slaves?” Qing Ya decided to voice her doubt, but unfortunately, Bai Xiaofei could not answer this question.</p> 
 <p>“I am interested in all living things. Is this a good reason for you?” Bai Xiaofei smiled.</p> 
 <p>Qing Ya immediately understood his subtle refusal to answer and did not say anything else.</p> 
 <p>Along with the mixed feelings of the guests, the penultimate round arrived. Unlike before, not many people showed enthusiasm.</p> 
 <p>Magical beasts had always been an embarrassing existence because there were too few tamable kinds. The reason why Unify Business could auction them was that they invented a collar that could control magical beasts. However, the collar was not as reliable as it should be. Since the emergence of magical beast trading, there had been many cases in which a magical beast and its buyer ended up dragging each other to their deaths.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, those who weren’t that confident in their ability were apprehensive toward buying magical beasts.</p> 
 <p>“We’ve prepared a total of five magical beasts in this auction. I hope they can find their new owners today,” announced Qing Han. But if he was honest, he had no confidence in this auction stage either. The reputation of magical beast trading was currently extremely bad!</p> 
 <p>Sure enough, three magical beasts were wheeled up, and all three failed to get any bids.</p> 
 <p>This was not a question of Qing Han’s ability. Even Qing Ya would get the same result if she was standing there.</p> 
 <p>However, with the fourth magical beast, or to be more exact, a pair of magical beasts, being taken up to the stage, the sounds of gasping filled the whole hall.</p> 
 <p>“I bid fifty million!”</p> 
 <p>Qing Han didn’t even need to say anything before someone already bid.</p> 
 <p>“One hundred million!”</p> 
 <p>The price kept soaring, and in a blink of an eye, reached a point where even Bai Xiaofei was appalled.</p> 
 <p>“Are they really worth this price?” Bai Xiaofei asked in confusion.</p> 
 <p>Then, for the first time, he saw anger on Qing Ya’s face.</p> 
 <p>They were really worth the price, and Qing Ya knew very clearly what those who bid wanted from them!</p>
