 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei who couldn’t figure it out no matter how he wracked his brains to the verge of exploding apart walked towards the third test.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Perhaps the cultivation technique restrains the soul. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei thought like this, but for some unknown reason, a trace of anticipation appeared in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, Bai Xiaofei could be sure that he wasn’t looking forward to the opportunity to possess a second puppet, yet he was unable to grasp what exactly he was looking forward to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Bai Xiaofei knew that he had the answer in his heart, and he was just unable to recall it now….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Along with Bai Xiaofei walking into the illusory formation, a ball of light instantly lit up in the surroundings and enveloped him before the scene in the surroundings changed right away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, Bai Xiaofei was dazed as soon as the illusory formation was activated.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Can this be f*cking considered as an illusory formation?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Isn’t it too f*cking fake!!!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>How stupid does one have to be to be unable to get through this?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In Bai Xiaofei’s eyes, all the scenes in the surroundings were illusory, and he was to discern that the scenery in the surroundings was changing as he moved, but it also made the true path even more obvious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, this illusory formation was only a matter of walking a few steps to Bai Xiaofei….</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, at the instant Bai Xiaofei arrived at the end, a voice resounded out within the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations, you’ve passed the final test, and your results are flawless. The strength of your soul is entirely capable of enduring a second puppet of any grade!” Bai Xiaofei was stunned once more.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I passed just like that?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Where’s the limitation that Old Goat Revelation told me?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was it a lie?!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Impossible! No matter what, I’m still his f*cking disciple, and there’s no reason to deceive me in this matter!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Then this is….</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but gulp down a mouthful of saliva when he suddenly thought of something because these thoughts were too terrifying!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could it be that I lost my virginity under the circumstances that I was completely unaware?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>With who?!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>When?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A string of questions surged into his mind, yet Bai Xiaofei was still unable to figure it out. Under his helplessness, he could only leave the test area for now.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ll found out about something like this sooner or later!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The girl would surely be even more anxious than me, right!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, she was indeed more anxious that you, and she almost bashed you up on many occasions!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, while everyone else was chattering away, Bai Xiaofei walked out from within, and everyone was stunned when they noticed the trace of bewilderment that hung on Bai Xiaofei’s face.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s already out?!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Did he fail?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations, you’re capable of flawlessly controlling a second puppet, do you wish to try for a third puppet?” The attendant’s words caused the eyes of everyone to be opened wide, and there was even a trace of disbelief on their faces.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How could he possibly have been so quick?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“No, two are sufficient for now.” How could Bai Xiaofei dare to continue testing himself because if he were to pass, then the people he had to find would multiply from one to two!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei wiped off the cold sweat on his forehead before looking at his delighted classmates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Fei, I knew you’d be fine. How did you get through the illusory formation? You’re so formidable! Even I wasn’t so quick when I passed through the illusory formation for my second puppet!” The person that spoke was Xing Nana. Even though he’d barely passed through the test for a third puppet, the time it took him to pass through the illusory formation for his second puppet wasn’t as swift as Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was just luck, just luck. It might be because I have an advantage as an Illusion Stream puppet master.” Bai Xiaofei casually made an excuse and fooled them. But, Xing Nan’s words caused him to think about his cultivation technique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Revelations could be said to have not deceived him because this cultivation technique was really unique. Now it would see that so long as Bai Xiaofei satisfied the conditions to improve the cultivation technique’s grade, he would be able to be completely immune against illusions of the same rank, and he would be able to flawlessly control the corresponding number of puppets!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have all of you not finished talking nonsense? Why do all of you intend to go buy puppets? All of you were still so anxious earlier!” As soon as Xue Ying spoke, the group that was asking all sorts of questions were instantly interrupted, and they hurried off as if they were avoiding the god of plagues.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was to the extent that only Lin Li was left behind on the spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Motherf*cker! When will all these fellows be a bit more reliable.” Bai Xiaofei cursed fiercely, and then a smile instantly appeared on his face as he looked at the other new students that were waiting for him. “Everyone continue with your tests, we’ll speak again if we have the opportunity to meet each other next time!” As he spoke, Bai Xiaofei led Xue Ying and Lin Li along as he followed up to the others. Being too famous wasn’t always a good thing….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under Xue Ying’s guidance, Bai Xiaofei saw his jubilant classmates on the second floor, but, their current state ought to be described as mad dogs….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to the number of puppets Fang Ye ordered, the Ethereal Pavilion had specially arranged for someone to entertain them. At this moment, this person in char was already encircled tightly while all of them were asking him if their puppets had arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone, don’t be anxious. We’ve prepared a special room for all of you, and you can slowly select your puppets there. Because all of you have given us a rough description of the direction of your choices, and there are numerous puppets of the same kind, so we’ve brought in many different types of puppets.” The attitude of this person in charge from the Ethereal Pavilion was really good as he’d already been encircled to such a state by the members of the Savage Class, yet he still revealed a light smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can all of you stop embarrassing our class? All of you are here to buy not seize puppets.” As soon as Bai Xiaofei spoke, all of them instantly stopped what they were doing, and the girls stuck out their tongues in embarrassment while the boys acted as if nothing had happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is…?” This person in charge had seen everyone from the Savage Class, but it was the first time he’d seen Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Manager Feng, this is our class monitor and our Boss.” Fang Ye made a simple introduction, whereas, Manager Feng instantly walked over to Bai Xiaofei and stretched out his hand. “Bai Xiaofei, right? I’ve heard about you, you’re a famous person right now! I’m Feng Wuhen, and I’m one of the managers here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Manager Feng, you’re too kind. That little reputation of mine is useless, and it’s just everyone giving me face.” Bai Xiaofei spoke modestly before leading Feng Wuhen to Xue Ying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is our head teacher, Xue Ying, and it’s all because of her that we were able to attain our current improvements.” The mood of Xue Ying who was originally slightly unhappy instantly turned better. Actually, she cared the most about Bai Xiaofei’s attitude towards her, and she could understand it if the others forgot about her in their excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because they were children….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nice to meet you, teacher. Since you were able to teach such outstanding students, you’re surely not an ordinary person.” As Feng Wuhen spoke, Xue Ying’s mood that had just turned slightly better instantly fell once more, and her gloomy face showed that she was on the verge of erupting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Sister Xue, Big Sister Xue, calm down, calm down. It’s the first time Manager Feng met you, so he was being polite to you!” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly grabbed Xue Ying’s hand and the volcano that was about to erupt instantly became a calm lake. Moreover, it was a pink colored lake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Wuhen had a dazed expression as he looked at Bai Xiaofei, and he carried a puzzled faze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Our Big Sister Xue is actually very young, so….” Bai Xiaofei had only spoken halfway when Feng Wuhen instantly understood what he’d done wrong, and he hurriedly sent an apologetic gaze to Xue Ying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry. It was ill-considered of me. You look like a beauty that really has an enormous gap in age when compared to most teachers.” After he corrected his mistake, Feng Wuhen hurriedly skipped this topic of conversation. “Let’s go look at the puppets.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they returned once more to their main objective, the hearts of everyone from the Savage Class that had just jumped into their throats because of Xue Ying burned once more with excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It’s time!</span></p>
