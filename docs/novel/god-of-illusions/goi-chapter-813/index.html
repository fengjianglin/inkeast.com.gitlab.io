 <p>Chapter 813: Burning Vitality vs Divine Beast Transformation!</p> 
 <p>“Fire Ocean!” Hu Xian’er fully released her power and turned the sealed space into a sea of fire.</p> 
 <p>Yet, within the fire, Ji Xian stood unaffected as a colorful light enveloped his body and isolated him from the flame as well as its temperature!</p> 
 <p>“That’s useless. My puppets are all resistance and counterattack-type puppets. The stronger your output, the stronger my ability. Death is your only result!”</p> 
 <p>Knowing that he couldn’t keep up with her speed, Ji Xian simply put his whole energy on defense. He, who was an Onslaught Stream puppet master, was forced into defending by Hu Xian’er. However, Ji Xian was telling the truth. Every time she attacked him, the energy reflected made her particularly irritated.</p> 
 <p>“Flame Spears!” Hu Xian’er traveled through the fire as if she hadn’t heard Ji Xian’s warning at all and relentlessly attacked. A hundred flaming spears condensed and shot at Ji Xian from all directions, sapping away his colorful shield while the rebound force from them also damaged Hu Xian’er.</p> 
 <p>Gradually, her persistence troubled Ji Xian. At the end of the day, he was an Onslaught Stream puppet master. While he seemed steady at the moment and Hu Xian’er’s attacks had done no harm to him at all, he knew full well that this state could not continue for long. His defensive ability came entirely from his armor-type puppet, which was approaching its limit after such a long time of defending!</p> 
 <p>Therefore, both sides were gambling. Gambling that the opponent would be the one to fall first!</p> 
 <p>“Why don’t you continue? Can’t maintain it, can you?!” After another blinding explosion, Ji Xian taunted with the pride of a winner.</p> 
 <p>“Isn’t your turtle shell gone? It’s just beginning!” Wiping off the blood from the corner of her lips, the fighting spirit in Hu Xian’er’s eyes had not diminished at all.</p> 
 <p>“Didn’t I tell you? Defense is but the weakest of my abilities!” Ji Xian rushed at her.</p> 
 <p>Although his speed was not comparable to the peak speed of Hu Xian’er, he was a three-aperture Exquisite Rank puppet master. In her present state, Hu Xian’er could not respond at all. An energy sword pierced at her waist.</p> 
 <p>What surprised Ji Xian was that she didn’t even make the slightest effort to evade! <em>Aren’t you scared of death?!</em></p> 
 <p>“I knew you’d try to torture me to death, idiot,” Hu Xian’er coldly uttered. Her left hand suddenly grasped Ji Xian’s arm and her right hand caught his head!</p> 
 <p>The Claws of Torment was no laughing matter. Ji Xian’s energy armor was as fragile as paper in front of Hu Xian’er as her claws easily penetrated it. Seeing this, Ji Xian was quick to swing his left hand and cut off his own right arm, allowing him to pull away and barely escape his head being crushed.</p> 
 <p>However, as he pulled away, Hu Xian’er clawed his chest into a mangled mess.</p> 
 <p>“Now we’re even!” Ignoring the blood flowing out from her lips, Hu Xian’er pulled out Ji Xian’s sword from her body and crushed it with the Claws of Torment.</p> 
 <p>With his puppet damaged, the already seriously injured Ji Xian spat out a mouthful of blood, and he looked at Hu Xian’er with complicated eyes. The outcome had become difficult to predict…</p> 
 <p>“I underestimated you, little girl, but the one who’ll die is definitely you!” he coldly spat. Then, his body emitted a golden light.</p> 
 <p>This light was no stranger to Hu Xian’er. Lin Li had used it during Starnet’s grand celebration. It was the sign of one’s vitality being burnt!</p> 
 <p>“You are still underestimating me, because I will not die! There is someone waiting for me!” Hu Xian’er gritted her teeth and her faltering aura suddenly began to climb constantly, even catching up with Ji Xian who was burning his vitality!</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Ji Xian could no longer maintain his calm. Burning vitality was no joke. He could not afford to drag this on. He had to attack first!</p> 
 <p>Consuming his vitality, Ji Xian’s speed soared to an extreme. Without any fancy movements, his energy armor condensed into a sword as he shot toward Hu Xian’er like a bullet. This time, he aimed at her head!</p> 
 <p>“Divine Beast Transformation, Phantom Fox!”</p> 
 <p>Ji Xian’s idea was good, but he could not catch up after all. The moment he neared Hu Xian’er, the latter had completed her energy accumulation. In a flash of light, her delicate figure disappeared and was replaced by a huge lilac Phantom Fox!</p> 
 <p>The fox’s three tails of different colors were at least five meters long, among which the lilac tail bloomed with a purple radiance that let her speed soar as well. She dodged Ji Xian’s attack and smacked him flying.</p> 
 <p>Upon falling on the ground, Ji Xian bounced up instantly. The wound he just received from the smack quickly recovered under the effects of his burning vitality.</p> 
 <p>“Using Divine Beast Transformation at the peak of the Grandmaster Rank is but another way to burn vitality!” Staring intensely at Hu Xian’er, Ji Xian was on the verge of insanity.</p> 
 <p>“Before I fall, I shall kill you first!” Executing her declaration, Hu Xian’er moved. This time, Ji Xian could not even react at all and was sent flying without suspense.</p> 
 <p>In this way, the two entered a new loop of wearing each other out. Last time, they consumed energy, this time, it was their life force! Whether the first to run out was Hu Xian’er’s Divine Beast Transformation or Ji Xian’s vitality, the result would be decided quickly.</p> 
 <p>While Hu Xian’er was engaging in a tragic battle, the rest also welcomed their own opponents. No one had it easy, especially Wu Chi!</p> 
 <p>From the beginning when he had faced the other Blood Demon master to the emergence of the sealed space, Wu Chi’s opponent never changed. And, his opponent never thought that he could persist until now!</p> 
 <p>“Smelly boy, I don’t believe you can still live after this! Blood Shadow Kill!” roared the opponent as his entire body turned into blood and shot at Wu Chi. This ultimate skill had allowed the man to kill many people above his rank.</p> 
 <p>However, it was exactly what Wu Chi was waiting for!</p> 
 <p>The Starnet Brilliance shone and wrapped Wu Chi in an invincible shield. At the same time, from his arms that had been cut off at the elbow, blood surged and condensed into the missing parts!</p> 
 <p>“Only a Blood Demon can seize a Blood Demon. This is what you just told me!” Wu Chi sneered. When the opponent approached, Wu Chi, whose body was covered in wounds, tightly hugged him and a violent aura erupted. “Brother Fei, my mission is finished! However, Wu Chi won’t be able to accompany you in the future! Remember to come and see me!”</p> 
 <p>In a hysterical laugh, a blood vortex appeared around Wu Chi and engulfed the two.</p> 
 <p>“Blood Storm!”</p>
