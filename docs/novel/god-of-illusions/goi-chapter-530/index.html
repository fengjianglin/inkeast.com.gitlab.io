 <p>Chapter 530: Great Great Great… Granduncle<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>!</p> 
 <p>Qin Lingyan’s angry departure resulted in a sleepless night for Bai Xiaofei. He spent the night considering a lot of things, most of which were about how to placate her. In the end, he concluded that there was no other way except to completely resolve Chu Yue’s matter.</p> 
 <p>However, this was easier said than done!</p> 
 <p>Not to mention how difficult Ling Tianxia was to deal with, just his present situation alone didn’t give Bai Xiaofei much time to spare.</p> 
 <p>The preparations for the grand celebration took shape as he learned about every alumni returning to the academy, otherwise, there would be mistakes during the celebration activities.</p> 
 <p>When he got up the next morning, he went back to devoting himself to the ocean of various files and information, and it would continue until the celebration began…</p> 
 <p>During such an important event, personal enmity could only be left behind. Time would not be suspended because of anyone, and Bai Xiaofei was not the kind of person who was good at making choices.</p> 
 <p>The information obtained from all the sources warned that the celebration would not be as simple as it appeared. Just one wrong move and Bai Xiaofei might even become a big sinner in the history of Starnet!</p> 
 <p>At this time, Bai Xiaofei suddenly missed his unreliable master. If the old man could draw him a fortune stick to divine how the celebration would go, perhaps he would feel more confident…</p> 
 <p>However, it seemed that the difficulties he was facing never crossed Revelation’s thoughts at all. He hadn’t once shown up as the date drew closer. But just as Bai Xiaofei had almost lost all hope in the unreliable old man, a special guest arrived at the Demon of Illusions…</p> 
 <p>Rushing to the living room, Bai Xiaofei’s face darkened the moment he opened the door.</p> 
 <p>A young man who looked clean and sweet and exuded the vibe of a big brother next door was confidently chatting with the Leng triplets, occasionally making them laugh happily.</p> 
 <p>At least ten tons of sour vinegar<span id="fnre2"><a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a></span> poured over Bai Xiaofei’s heart, and the triplets immediately smelled it from afar.</p> 
 <p>“You’re finally here. Senior Heartseer has been waiting for you,” said Leng Liuli as she walked over.</p> 
 <p>Leng Liushuang and Leng Liuying wisely followed. If they continued to chat with Heartseer, Bai Xiaofei might just explode.</p> 
 <p>“Fortunately I did. If I came any later, my people might have been abducted.” Bai Xiaofei could hide his emotions very well, but obviously this didn’t apply to his jealousy…</p> 
 <p>When he said ‘my people,’ the Leng sisters all blushed, but still masked their response with a hint of anger.</p> 
 <p>“Who told you to take so long? It’s not like we can let our guest sit around!” Leng Liuying made an unconvincing explanation. From their delighted manner just now, it didn’t look like they were just trying to complete a task.</p> 
 <p>“Take back your worries. Us Snow Kingdom girls don’t have the habit of philandering around. Look at you, too bad we didn’t think of recording your reaction.” Leng Liuli suddenly moved close and softly whispered into Bai Xiaofei’s ear. The warm breath instantly blew away his jealous feelings.</p> 
 <p>Men were most afraid of seeing their women laughing with other men, and were happiest when their women had intimate actions with them in front of other men.</p> 
 <p>The former made them feel like their sovereignty had been violated, while the latter affirmed that sovereignty.</p> 
 <p>“I will remember this. Just you wait, I will take good care of you three tonight!” Bai Xiaofei coldly threatened, but Leng Liuli didn’t feel threatened at all.</p> 
 <p><em>You say it like you don’t already do this all the time… Ever since the first time, when have you stopped?</em></p> 
 <p>Thinking this, Leng Liuli’s face reddened. As the less eloquent two among the three, she and Leng Liushuang had become the main force to help Bai Xiaofei ‘release,’ while the bold-mouthed Leng Liuying was still holding her ground…</p> 
 <p>“In your dreams. I will lock the door when I go back!” Leng Liuli weakly resisted and walked away. Leng Liuying and Leng Liushuang also followed her, the former threw Bai Xiaofei a glare while the latter passed by with her head lowered.</p> 
 <p>After such a long time, their characters were still so distinct…</p> 
 <p>With the departure of the triplets, there were only two people in the living room. Bai Xiaofei slowly walked towards Heartseer while donning his usual casual smile.</p> 
 <p>If anyone familiar with Bai Xiaofei was present, they would get a bad premonition. That smile… was the introductory phase when Bai Xiaofei planned to trick someone!</p> 
 <p>“Sorry for making you wait, Senior. I just have too many things on my plate, please forgive me.” Despite plotting his ‘revenge,’ Bai Xiaofei was still polite with his words.</p> 
 <p>Heartseer, having graduated from Starnet five years ago, was now a member of the Revelation Pavilion and had come to deliver Revelation’s words to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Heartseer, the 18th generation disciple of the Revelation Pavilion, greets Great Great Great… Granduncle!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had just finished speaking when Heartseer suddenly jumped out of his seat, plopped on his knees, and bowed his head to the floor in a solemn greeting.</p> 
 <p>The sudden scene scared Bai Xiaofei witless. When he finally reacted and reflected on the greeting, he was baffled.</p> 
 <p><em>What the heck is this?! Why are you paying me such a ceremonial respectful greeting?! What the hell is Great Great Great… Granduncle?! Does this kind of super long stuttering actually exist? There were at least a dozen greats!</em></p> 
 <p>“Er… Ermm… You… You get up first!” After faltering for half a day, Bai Xiaofei finally found the right sentence for the situation.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you, Great Great Great… Granduncle!” With joy in his voice, Heartseer quickly stood up and looked at Bai Xiaofei with a big smile and a face full of respect.</p> 
 <p><em>He’s not faking it!</em> Seeing Heartseer’s expression, Bai Xiaofei felt even more stupefied.</p> 
 <p>They said it was impossible to hit a smiling face, and this was the extreme of one! Let alone hitting it, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t even bring himself to say one negative word!</p> 
 <p>“Erm, so… what did you just call me?” Bai Xiaofei gulped with difficulty, his voice was full of doubt and shock.</p> 
 <p>“Great Great Great… Granduncle!” Heartseer was neat and straightforward with his words. “Before I came here, Master Revelation personally explained to me your identity. Master Revelation has only three disciples, and the first two are only nominal, his only real disciple is you. I am a disciple of the 18th generation. According to seniority, you are my Great Great Great… Granduncle.”</p> 
 <p>Upon finishing his explanation, Heartseer bowed in another formal ceremonial act.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei understood now, but he still needed more time to accept this…</p> 
 <p>After all, this was too outlandish! A senior ten years older than you suddenly stood in front of you and said that your seniority according to generations was his ancestor. Could you immediately accept that?!</p> 
 <p>In any case, Bai Xiaofei could not!</p>
