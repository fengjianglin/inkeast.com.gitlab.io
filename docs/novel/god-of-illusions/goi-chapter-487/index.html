 <p>Chapter 487: The Third Puppet!</p> 
 <p>As the coin was tossed into the air, so was Bai Xiaofei’s heart. When he tried to catch it, his hand trembled a little and missed. Chasing the coin that rolled all the way to the door, uneasiness washed all over him again.</p> 
 <p>“Damn you! Messing around with me?!” Bai Xiaofei cursed as he stared at the gold coin that stopped at the door.</p> 
 <p><em>What the f*ck is this?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Xiaofei!”</p> 
 <p>When he was just about to pick up the gold coin and try again, the door was suddenly pushed open by a hurried Yun Sheng, who then stepped on the gold coin with his big foot.</p> 
 <p>“Eh… What are you doing?” Looking at Bai Xiaofei squatting on the ground right before him, Yun Sheng was embarrassed and confused.</p> 
 <p>“Lift your foot! Lift your foot now!” Bai Xiaofei grabbed Yun Sheng’s foot and lifted it, frightening the latter into jumping aside.</p> 
 <p>Staring at the coin on the ground, there was relief in Bai Xiaofei’s eyes. <em>Perhaps this is the result I wanted.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Heads!</em></p> 
 <p>“Hey, Xiaofei… Did something happen to you?” asked Yun Sheng with hesitation in his voice, waving his hand in front of Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Nothing. What can happen to me? Big Brother Yun, you seem to be in a hurry. What happened?” Bai Xiaofei stowed away the coin and chortled strangely. The laughter made Yun Sheng panic.</p> 
 <p><em>It doesn’t seem like nothing. Did he hit his head somewhere yesterday?</em></p> 
 <p>With doubt in his heart, Yun Sheng examined Bai Xiaofei closely, and then tentatively talked about his own matter.</p> 
 <p>“Well, about that… This morning, the principal issued a notice that our academy will hold a celebration to mark the two hundredth year of its establishment, which sounds like that we can make a profit again…” said Yun Sheng while staring intensely at Bai Xiaofei, still worried that something was wrong with his brain. Anyone could go insane except for Bai Xiaofei, or the Demon of Illusions would suffer a big loss!</p> 
 <p>“Oh, this? I already know.” Bai Xiaofei smiled wryly with a hint of embarrassment. He should have informed the Demon of Illusion about this earlier, but he never had the time.</p> 
 <p>“You already know?” Yun Sheng’s surprised expression was basically asking Bai Xiaofei why he didn’t say so earlier.</p> 
 <p>“When I went to see the old man, he told me about it himself. I was going to tell everyone after everything on my side was handled, but I didn’t expect the academy to be in such a hurry.”</p> 
 <p>At Bai Xiaofei’s simple explanation, Yun Sheng had a look of enlightenment.</p> 
 <p>“Ah, I thought it would surprise and delight you, but it was actually me in hindsight…” Yun Sheng heaved a long sigh, feeling a bit lost. “I bet you’ve made all the arrangements. Is there anything I can do?”</p> 
 <p>This was the real purpose of Yun Sheng’s visit. Bai Xiaofei wasn’t the only one who would be ill at ease when he was too idle. However, unlike Bai Xiaofei who had one thing after another coming to him, Yun Sheng had to wait.</p> 
 <p>Wait until the arrival of this explosive news!</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother Yun, don’t be so impatient. There will definitely be things for you to do, but you have to wait for the freshmen to arrive first.” Bai Xiaofei patted Yun Sheng on the shoulder with an understanding expression. He had been idle, so he knew how uncomfortable it must feel.</p> 
 <p>“Wouldn’t it be a long time to wait? There’s not even a ghost where I live now, I panic every day!” Yun Sheng started complaining. He was coerced into moving away during the Blossom Competition, but everyone just forgot about him, and no one ever mentioned about letting him come back.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, alright. You will be busy, I promise. I need to visit the Ethereal Pavilion to buy something, do you want to co…”</p> 
 <p>“Yes!” Yun Sheng agreed before Bai Xiaofei could finish. “But what are you doing there? Could it be that you’re linking a new puppet again?!”</p> 
 <p>Yun Sheng had a delayed realization. He looked at Bai Xiaofei’s eyes full of excitement.</p> 
 <p>“Well, if there is no accident, I should be able to control a third puppet perfectly now!” Bai Xiaofei said confidently. The excitement on Yun Sheng’s face deepened.</p> 
 <p>“What are you waiting for? Hurry up!” Yun Sheng pulled Bai Xiaofei and ran like the wind. Even Bai Xiaofei felt he was inferior when it came to such enthusiasm…</p> 
 <p>It didn’t take long for the two people to arrive at the Ethereal Pavilion after running non-stop.</p> 
 <p>There was something everyone had to admit: the Ethereal Pavilion had a firm position in their lives. The success of a merchant group was definitely never accidental. This seemingly inconspicuous persistence was enough to make many small businesses feel ashamed.</p> 
 <p>After explaining their purpose to the assistant, they were immediately treated like gods. Bai Xiaofei’s identity was quickly known. Before long, they entered a private room and Wei Feng came in smiling.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Wei, you shouldn’t have!” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly came over and greeted Wei Feng. After all, the latter was the manager of a branch, which called for necessary courtesy, not to mention the relationship between Wei Feng and Feng Wuhen.</p> 
 <p>“It’s that fellow Wuhen. He told me again and again before he left to take care of you, even using the favor I owed him for it!” Wei Feng laughed, having no intention to hide anything.</p> 
 <p>However, after hearing these seemingly teasing words, Bai Xiaofei felt warm in his heart. Feng Wuhen was really too thoughtful…</p> 
 <p>“How long are you two planning to chat? Can we get down to business?” Yun Sheng couldn’t wait. He was currently desperate to see the high-quality goods that might become Bai Xiaofei’s new puppet.</p> 
 <p>“Indeed. Do you have any special requirements this time, Lil’ Brother Bai?” Wei Feng became formal.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei stated his own requirements. As soon as he finished speaking, Yun Sheng exploded.</p> 
 <p>“Flight for the third puppet?! Are you sure you’re not mistaken?!” Yun Sheng felt that he needed to remind Bai Xiaofei. Unfortunately, he didn’t understand the situation.</p> 
 <p>“I will explain this later. You only need to watch, Brother Yun,” Bai Xiaofei said, then looked at Wei Feng in expectation.</p> 
 <p>“Since you have decided, Lil’ Brother, I won’t say anything more. According to your requirements, I indeed have a high-grade one that meets your demand!” Wei Feng said. His storage ring flashed, and a pair of palm-sized items floated above his palm. “Winged puppet, Purple <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luan_(mythology)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luan</a>!”</p> 
 <p>Winged puppets were one of the many branches of flying puppets. It wasn’t difficult to create winged puppets. Take a pair of wings from any flying magical beast and add some more complementary materials, and any mid-rank puppetsmith could build one.</p> 
 <p>Moreover, the grade of winged puppets generally had nothing to do with the forging method of the puppetsmith. Instead, it was mainly decided by the quality of the main material, most of which weren’t very high.</p> 
 <p>However, this one in Wei Feng’s hand was a bit unexpected…</p> 
 <p>It was gold rank!</p>
