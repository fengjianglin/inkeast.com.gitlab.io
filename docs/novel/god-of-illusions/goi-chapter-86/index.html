 <p><span style>Half the afternoon had passed when they left the 100 Flavor House, and Qin Lingyan had gone to prepare according to Bai Xiaofei’s request, whereas, Bai Xiaofei himself ran hastily back to the dormitory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Fei!” Mo Ka moved over at the first possible moment when he saw Bai Xiaofei come over. At this moment, the ground floor of the dormitory was already fully surrounded, and everyone had come to see the remarkable sight of ‘hanging seniors’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, they were very interested in the upcoming show.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Bai Xiaofei’s return naturally didn’t escape the eyes of everyone, and for a time, various discussions resounded in the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get them down and let them leave.” Bai Xiaofei didn’t engage in too much small talk before ordering right away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get them down? We aren’t hanging them anymore?” Mo Ka was slightly stunned while his face was covered in a trace of disbelief. After all, the influence of these three being hung here was rather great.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We need time, and it’s mostly because they aren’t sure about my background that there hasn’t been anyone that has come to save them until now. But, they ought to have already found out many things after such a long period of time, and if we still don’t let them down, then someone will probably come probe us directly, whereas, if we let them down, we’ll have a buffer instead.” After Bai Xiaofei’s clear and logical analysis, Mo Ka who came to a sudden understanding hurriedly brought a few people from the nine classes over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In next to no time, the three seniors that already desired to bore a hole into the ground were let down, and they even felt slightly fortunate now that they were beaten to the point of being impossible to recognize.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Otherwise, they would really be unable to continue staying in Starnet Academy….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go back and tell those above you that I, Bai Xiaofei, will do as I say. If they’re displeased, then I’ll be waiting here for them at nine tonight. Tell them to bring more people so I can deal with them in one go!” Bai Xiaofei revealed a ferocious expression as he spoke fiercely, and at the same time, he gestured at Mo Ka to undo the ropes on their bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck off!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>At the instant they were released, the three seniors fled instantly, whereas, the surrounding crowd of spectators took the initiative to open up a path for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A tiger that had descended the hills and arrived in the plains was still a tiger. Most of the new students were still fearful of the inherent model in Starnet Academy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone, since you’re able to be watching here, I presume you’re mostly new students. Of course, it’s fine even if there are some seniors hiding amongst all of you.” After he let the three seniors go, Bai Xiaofei turned around to look at the surrounding crowd of spectators, whereas, those who stood at the first row had even heard what Bai Xiaofei said before, so the gazes they shot at Bai Xiaofei at this moment carried a trace of a complicated expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m Bai Xiaofei, that person all of you are discussing, and a new student that’s unwilling to be oppressed by the seniors.” Bai Xiaofei raised his voice to the limit while everyone couldn’t help but prick up their ears to listen attentively at the same time, causing the clamorous sounds of discussion to stop along with this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fellow Students, there are an entire 500 classes and almost 8,000 people when all the new students are added together! But, there are only 5,000 seniors in the first year, whereas, it’s probably less than half of them that took great pains to target us. Besides that, there are even lesser people in the second year. So why do all 8,000 of us have to be afraid of a few seniors?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could it be that it’s because they arrived here a year earlier? Because their strengths are more formidable than ours? Then let me ask all of you, if a Master Rank puppet master is capable of defeating two Proficient Rank puppet masters, then what about five? Ten? The three seniors we hung here today were at the Master Rank as well, but it was only the 10 of us that dealt with them, and the strongest amongst us is only at the Proficient Rank!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We came to learn, to become stronger! We didn’t come to be exploited, nor did we come to wag our tails and flatter someone! Everyone that came here has their own dream to become an expert. But, if you’re willing to be exploited now, willing to become the meal on the plates of others, then let me ask you how you will accomplish this dream? What right does someone who chooses to compromise at the first step have to dream such a dream!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As far as I’m concerned, all those people who only dare to pay for peace are only worthy to be the lowest trash! So, trash or heroes, all of you can stand out and make your own choice!” His words were spoken resolutely, and everyone present couldn’t help but be stunned on the spot when Bai Xiaofei finished speaking. Moreover, even Mo Ka and the others were no exception.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After over a month, they’d never imagined that Bai Xiaofei had such a side, and the three of them were even unable to distinguish if Bai Xiaofei was acting or this was his true self….</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could it be that this is the highest level Bai Xiaofei spoke of?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Freely controlling one’s own character?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Tonight, at nine, I’ll lead all the new students in the New Student Mutual Aid Community to challenge these so-called ‘rules’! If all of you have any self-respect, then come and stand behind me!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I, Bai Xiaofei, will always be here waiting for all of you!” As he spoke, Bai Xiaofei casually pulled over the stool Mo Ka and the others used when they went to spread the news, and he sat on it before slowly closing his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, Mo Ka and the others very sensibly stood behind Bai Xiaofei, and then it was the class monitors of the nine classes and the members of their classes that were still present here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first group of forces was formed just like this, and this force quickly became a magnet that caused numerous people to walk out slowly from amongst the surrounding spectators to stand behind Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once there was one, there was a second, a third, a fourth….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some chose to continue watching, some chose to return and discuss it with their fellow students and friends, whereas, some even intended to return and bring more people with them. Of course, there were also those ‘hiding’ seniors that Bai Xiaofei mentioned, and they chose to return and report the matter….</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a time, the group of spectators in the surroundings reduced by more than half, and there were an entire five hours before nine!</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those three seniors that were allowed to leave had ran to the class of their boss at the first possible moment, and this place was in disorder as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Motherf*cker! What happened to the three of you? My Big Brother said the entire situation has gone f*cking out of hand! Are all of you idiots!?” The boss of those three seniors didn’t ask anything before immediately cursing them in their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Tan, we didn’t wish for this to happen as well. That Bai kid is too f*cking ruthless. Moreover, he’s full of sneaky moves. The three of us were taken by surprise!” The leader of the three seniors hurriedly explained, and he tried his best to describe Bai Xiaofei as extremely difficult to deal with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, this was beneficial to reducing the scolding they would get, but it wasn’t beneficial to Tan Qiusheng’s judgment of Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell me what exactly is going on with this kid? Is there someone above him?” Since he started investigating up until now, Tan Qiusheng still only possessed a meager amount of information about Bai Xiaofei. But, he was able to discern from the information he obtained that Bai Xiaofei really was slightly strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the reason why he hadn’t made a rash move until now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since his boss had asked, the leader of the three followed the principle of ‘the more the better’, and he started a ten minute long description. Of course, most of it was made up by him….</span></p>
 <p><span style>The key was that Tan Qiusheng believed him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Bai Xiaofei was here at this moment, he would surely give him a ‘like’, and then he would say. </span><i><span style>‘Thank you, brother, for this assistance….’</span></i></p>
