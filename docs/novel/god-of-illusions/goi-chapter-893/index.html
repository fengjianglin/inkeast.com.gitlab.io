 <p>Chapter 893: Familiarizing or Probing?</p> 
 <p>“What do you think of the order I just issued?” replied the emperor with a question as he straightened up and turned serious.</p> 
 <p>“It’s formidable!” Bai Xiaofei praised from the heart. “Avoiding unnecessary trouble and ensuring the safety of the princes, and no matter whether they turn against each other or not, they will not hold grudges and at most will only be upset from failing the competition. Your move is unprecedented but wise.”</p> 
 <p>The evaluation drew a joyous laugh from the emperor. He was happy not because of the praise, but for Bai Xiaofei’s vision. If Bai Xiaofei had expressed doubts and incomprehension, there wouldn’t have been any need to continue this conversation.</p> 
 <p>“What do you think they will do?” the emperor asked a question that even he did not have a definite answer to. All he could do was ensure the safety of his children. He could not guarantee anything else, which was why he summoned Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Facing this problem, Bai Xiaofei had a troubled look on his face.</p> 
 <p>“Just freely say what you think. When I decided to have this kind of conversation with you, I’m no longer the emperor of Ethereal, but an old man seeking your help over his worry for his family.” Seeing through Bai Xiaofei’s hesitation, the emperor quickly dispelled his worry.</p> 
 <p>“In that case, I will be straightforward.” Bai Xiaofei firmly looked the emperor in the eyes. “How long do you have?”</p> 
 <p>This question was ruthless and realistic. Touching this topic with a dying person was definitely taboo everywhere, which was why Bai Xiaofei had hesitated.</p> 
 <p>“Exactly half a month. During this time, I’m able to act normally, but when the time is up, I will die.” The emperor was truly calm. Setting aside everything else, this attitude alone showed how exceptional a person he was.</p> 
 <p>“Do the five of them know about this?” asked Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The emperor nodded with an amused smile. “I made it clear to them, wanting to see what they would do next. You should be able to guess what I was curious about.”</p> 
 <p>“What I know about the five princes is too limited for me to guess what they will do. All I know is what they gained their reputation for. It’s too hasty to make a judgment yet,” said Bai Xiaofei honestly.</p> 
 <p>The emperor did not look disappointed. “Don’t worry, you’ll get to know them soon. Both the Yun and Lan clan appear quite concerned about your opinions, and those two clans are what they all strive for. Therefore, you will surely know them very well before I go.” He finished with a proud smile, proud of the two cards that he played that were the two clans.</p> 
 <p>“No, I don’t think so.” Bai Xiaofei doused cold water on him with a serious expression. “Although both clans have their own private armies stationed around the capital, only one person can win them over. I believe that at least one of the princes will wisely give them up because of this, and therefore will pass on me as well. I can tell that you want me to play a mediating role in half a month so that the situation won’t spin out of control. The influence of the Yun and Lan clans is not enough to do this.”</p> 
 <p>Upon hearing this, the emperor frowned and looked inquiringly at Bai Xiaofei. “Then what do you think is enough?”</p> 
 <p>“I remember that the Imperial Guard only listens to you alone,” Bai Xiaofei stated.</p> 
 <p>The emperor was astonished. “Young man, your appetite is not small!”</p> 
 <p>The Ethereal Imperial Guard wasn’t like the small fries of the other nations that Bai Xiaofei had seen before. Its overall strength was even above that of the Windlove Army. The entry bar was to be at least a Master Rank puppet master, and everyone’s puppet was custom-made.</p> 
 <p>Although the Ethereal Imperial Guard only consisted of 8,000 guards, these 8,000 were famous all over the continent as Ethereal’s steel guards!</p> 
 <p>“The size of one’s appetite depends on the size of their responsibility. You should know this better than me.” Bai Xiaofei nodded and his attitude was sincere. The last ordeal between them was trust!</p> 
 <p>Handing over the Imperial Guard was equivalent to handing over the security of the whole palace, as the 8000-strong army could overturn the capital’s sky. Whether he was willing to trust Bai Xiaofei unconditionally to surrender his whole palace was a test that the Ethereal emperor needed to face!</p> 
 <p>“I’ll think about it. Besides, I have something else to ask you.” The emperor changed the topic.</p> 
 <p>“If it’s about the human puppets, then I really have nothing to say. Even I am confused as the information I’ve gotten is extremely fragmented. I can’t say anything for sure before piecing them all together,” Bai Xiaofei said without worry that his honest answer would affect the emperor’s trust.</p> 
 <p>“You are really smart, but you got me curious, why does trouble follow anywhere you go? As far as I know, your four years in Starnet were all nearly spent on dealing with trouble.” The emperor chortled in amusement.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei was more cautious than ever when answering this question. All the previous ones were about Ethereal, while this one was aimed at him!</p> 
 <p>“Maybe you are thinking of it the wrong way? Troubles exist everywhere in this world and aren’t born from a person alone. I may have accelerated the speed at which the troubles breed, but am definitely not the reason. The troublemakers are just too nervous by my appearance that they hasten their plans. In other words, I don’t want to get into trouble, I’m just a little nosy.”</p> 
 <p>Finishing his explanation, Bai Xiaofei quietly looked at the emperor, who couldn’t help but burst out laughing with applause.</p> 
 <p>“Hahaha, nosy, huh? Young man, you are truly the most eloquent person I have met. I hope that you will carry forward this advantage in the days to come!”</p> 
 <p>Lan He, who had been eavesdropping outside the door heaved a sigh of relief. <em>Since he’s laughing like that, there is no problem…</em></p>
