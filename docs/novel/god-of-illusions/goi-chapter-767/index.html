 <p>Chapter 767: Real Boss!</p> 
 <p>“I want to find some people,” replied Bai Xiaofei as he ignored the piercing eyes from the surroundings.</p> 
 <p>“Find some people? A hundred thousand Amethyst Coins just to find some people?!” the staff exclaimed in disbelief, unable to believe his ears.</p> 
 <p>“Not just ordinary people, they are Exquisite Rank puppet masters. It won’t be too difficult because they’re here in Windlove City,” Bai Xiaofei explained as he took a pen and a piece of paper and wrote down the names.</p> 
 <p>“Shaman King, Blood Wolf, Strong Steel, and Absolute Blade. You’re looking for all four of them?!” Receiving the paper handed to him, the staff was dumbstruck again. Putting aside the difficulty of the task, it was already terrifying enough to see all four of those names together.</p> 
 <p>“With all due respect, what is your purpose of finding them?” The tone of the staff became respectful. Someone who dared to trouble those four people was definitely not a simple character. At least not a fat sheep like the people around thought!</p> 
 <p>“I don’t have any subordinates yet, I want them,” Bai Xiaofei said casually as if it was a sure thing, which was not the case to everyone else.</p> 
 <p>After three seconds of dead silence in the whole hall, someone burst out laughing.</p> 
 <p>“Hahahaha! Did you hear what that boy said? He wants the four renowned Exquisite Rank experts to be his underlings!!”</p> 
 <p>Everyone else joined in and laughed their heads off, looking at Bai Xiaofei like looking at a fool. Even the staff reluctantly shook his head.</p> 
 <p><em>Turns out he’s a brainless idiot…</em></p> 
 <p>“Was it you who laughed first?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei slowly walked to the bearded man who had just spoken and looked up at him as he was much burlier and taller than himself. His composed expression stimulated the man’s ego.</p> 
 <p>“What about it? Can’t accept that fact? An idiot like you…”</p> 
 <p>However, before the bearded man could finish his words, a sense of dizziness had assaulted him. Under the gawking eyes of everyone, Bai Xiaofei jerked the man by the arm at the speed of lightning and swung him onto the ground.</p> 
 <p>In an instant, a Martial Master was knocked unconscious just like that!</p> 
 <p>The whole hall quieted down once again. <em>To be able to insta-KO a Martial Master, he must be at least a Grand Martial Master! How does he train to be so strong at such a young age?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Can you release the mission now?” Bai Xiaofei returned to the staff and rapped gently on the table.</p> 
 <p>Returning to his senses, the staff replied in panic, “Yes, yes! I’m doing it now!” The staff was glad that he had not said any nonsense just now, otherwise, he would have ended up like the bearded man… No, he’d end up worse! He did not have the physical qualities of a Martial Master!</p> 
 <p>Omitting the unnecessary steps, the staff posted the mission issued by Bai Xiaofei in less than five minutes.</p> 
 <p>The next second, everyone flocked like crazy to the registration desk to accept the mission. The four people listed were so famous in Windlove that finding them was no different from a walk in the park. It would take two hours at most, but the payment for those two short hours was a hundred thousand Amethyst Coins and the points for an S-rank mission!</p> 
 <p>Who wouldn’t go crazy for it?</p> 
 <p>In the end, after some fierce competition, a man as thin as a monkey slipped out of the crowd. Seeing that he had accepted the mission, the rest gave a loud, long sigh.</p> 
 <p>It was not about how formidable the little guy was, but he was as slippery as a loach. Those who had wanted to harm him barely did anything and even ended up disadvantaged.</p> 
 <p>“Master, my name is Snakehead. You can just call me Lil’ Fish.”</p> 
 <p>Snakehead didn’t report his real name as few used their real names in Windlove City.</p> 
 <p>“Skip the useless talk. Take me to them, starting from Shaman King,” Bai Xiaofei coldly replied.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei could tell from a glance that Snakehead was a Blitz Stream Master Rank, which was nothing to worry about.</p> 
 <p>“Good, Master. I will lead the way.” Snakehead immediately started moving.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei and Rui Mengqi followed him toward the west side of the city.</p> 
 <p>“Master, you are a fresh face. Is this your first visit to Windlove City?” Lil’ Fish probed. In Windlove City, intel was the most precious asset, especially the intel on big people.</p> 
 <p>“Why? What’s wrong with coming here for the first time?” Bai Xiaofei asked back, his tone lukewarm.</p> 
 <p>“No, no, no. It’s just… There are things that if no one has told you, Lil’ Fish can,” Lil’ Fish quickly expressed his harmlessness, fearing that Bai Xiaofei would rage if he said a wrong word.</p> 
 <p>“Oh? What are you trying to say? “ Bai Xiaofei scanned Lil’ Fish with an enigmatic smile.</p> 
 <p>“This city is a mix of all kinds of people, Master, and the four people you are looking for are in the formidable category. Although you are very strong, once they know your purpose, a fight is absolutely inevitable. When that happens, please remember not to alarm the Windlove Army. It’s extremely ruthless.”</p> 
 <p>“Aside from the army, the local tyrants are not easy to settle either. Although they are not well known, things won’t go smoothly here if they repeatedly create small obstacles for you.”</p> 
 <p>Listening to Lil’ Fish summing up his years of experience in Windlove, Bai Xiaofei nodded.</p> 
 <p>“You don’t have to worry about the first one. I have no plans to provoke the army yet. As for the local tyrants, you are overly worried. Locals are only locals at the end of the day,” he said.</p> 
 <p>Lil’ Fish was baffled.</p> 
 <p><em>What do you mean you have no plans to provoke the army ‘yet’? You’re gonna do that in the future?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>F*ck! This is a real boss!</em></p> 
 <p>“Lil’ Fish understands.”</p> 
 <p>With that, Snakehead didn’t open his mouth again. He found that he and Bai Xiaofei were not on the same level at all. He guessed that Bai Xiaofei was not a Grand Martial Master, but at least a Grandmaster Rank martial artist!</p> 
 <p>Snakehead then wholly focused on the road. Before long, the three arrived at the edge of the west side. Different from the hustle and bustle in the rest of the city, the west side was surprisingly quiet.</p> 
 <p>“Master, up ahead is where Shaman King stays. He barely comes out from his place, so you’ll have to go in, but I can’t go with you,” said Snakehead with an embarrassed expression. When giants clashed, small fries would die! And he was only a little Master Rank puppet master.</p> 
 <p>“Wait outside, I’ll be out in an hour at most.” With a smile, Bai Xiaofei went straight towards the courtyard where Shaman King was located.</p> 
 <p>Rui Mengqi did not hesitate to follow him. <em>In this world, there is no place safer than behind him!</em></p> 
 <p>Feeling sweet in her heart, Rui Mengqi walked faster…</p>
