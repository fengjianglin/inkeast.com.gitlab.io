 <p>Chapter 827: Question and Answer!</p> 
 <p>Bidding farewell to Windlove City, Bai Xiaofei’s group once again embarked on the long journey back. However, the transportation this time was much better than carriages as Tan Xin generously took out a treasure that shocked everyone.</p> 
 <p>A Windsurfing Ship, a huge flying ship capable of holding up to 880 people!</p> 
 <p>Only, this thing burned money…</p> 
 <p>It could not fly without origin stones, and the number consumed daily was astronomical to ordinary people. Bai Xiaofei originally did not want to spend this kind of money, but if he didn’t pay, he would not be able to make it in time for his graduation ceremony…</p> 
 <p>That’s right, counting in the time it took to return, Bai Xiaofei’s four years of student life was over. Since entering the academy at the age of sixteen, he had grown into a promising twenty-year-old young man before he knew it.</p> 
 <p>“I thought that there were already many people when we set out, who would expect that there would be more people when we returned?” Sitting on the deck and enjoying the breeze, Fang Ye really valued this opportunity to talk with Bai Xiaofei alone.</p> 
 <p>This could not be helped. Although the mission was over, there were still many things he had yet to figure out, and Bai Xiaofei was the only one he could think of to answer those doubts.</p> 
 <p>“Cherish this time, it will not be easy for us to gather like this in the future.” With a long sigh, Bai Xiaofei suddenly became sentimental.</p> 
 <p>They had just bid farewell to Windlove City, only to be facing an even more worrying separation after going back. This was why Bai Xiaofei didn’t say much back in Windlove City, because it was not the time yet.</p> 
 <p>However, Fang Ye could not have said it better. In addition to the Savage Class plus Hu Xian’er, Luo Han and Rui Mengqi, was a big group of people: Gu Lingyue, Wang Chuan, Luo and Xia, the Shaman King trio, Hu Ji – Hu Xian’er’s clan sister, and Tan Xin, who gave Bai Xiaofei a headache.</p> 
 <p>Despite his reluctance, Min Xizi was entrusted with the heavy responsibility of watching over Windlove City, which was expected to become a great supporting force in the future.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, let’s not talk about this. I barely managed to get the chance to be alone with you. You are too popular now,” Fang Ye said with a wry smile.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s expression instantly clouded. This ‘popularity’ was not what he wanted at all.</p> 
 <p>“If you have nothing better to say, I’m going to get some rest. As you said, I seldom get idle time.” Rolling his eyes at Fang Ye, Bai Xiaofei acted like he wanted to leave.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t, don’t, don’t go. I was wrong, alright, my good brother Fei!” Fang Ye hurriedly stopped Bai Xiaofei. Then, he instantly grew solemn. “What do you think about this incident?”</p> 
 <p>Getting to the main business, Bai Xiaofei took a deep breath.</p> 
 <p>“It’s in fact very simple. Tong Fei, who mastered the cultivation of blood worms, wanted to strengthen himself and therefore cooperated with Shadow Death, who also had their own ulterior motive to come up with such a thing as the Blood Diamonds. In the end, they turned on each other and benefited that brat, Wu Chi.”</p> 
 <p>Mentioning Wu Chi, Bai Xiaofei’s heart was filled with joy. <em>That brat, he’s really so lucky!</em></p> 
 <p>After Wu Chi completed the contract with Goldie in his own consciousness, he also figured out what had happened to himself.</p> 
 <p>He wanted to drag his opponent to mutual destruction, but because of the rules of the sealed space, one would live, and as the initiator of the last attack, he got that right to live, which was why the Demonic God of Pain said he held the power of rules.</p> 
 <p>However, although he was saved by the rules, Wu Chi had already destroyed his own body. Right at that time, the blood worms who had been absorbing the vitality of the dead underground sucked him over as well.</p> 
 <p>Thus, Wu Chi quietly appeared in the last battlefield. What happened thereafter was simple. He condensed a new body with the blood from the blood cocoon and won Goldie during the process.</p> 
 <p>Now, Wu Chi could be described as being thoroughly remolded.</p> 
 <p>Except for his special puppet Blood Demon, which was preserved because it melted into his blood, the rest were destroyed and he became a single-puppet puppet master. However, due to having Goldie, he could no longer link any more puppets in the future.</p> 
 <p>However, this did not mean that Wu Chi had become weaker. It was the contrary!</p> 
 <p>First, his ability to control blood had reached a peak, at least ten times better than when he only had Blood Demon! Second, Goldie had provided his body with a terrifying ability to heal. Goldie was a top-class assistant capable of attacking, defending, and curing, and it itself had a considerably keen perception.</p> 
 <p>In other words, Wu Chi could be said to be without a weak point! At the very least, Bai Xiaofei would have a headache to have Wu Chi as his opponent.</p> 
 <p>“What about you? Wu Chi told us that your final performance was very strange, not like you at all. And, how did you manage to fight again?” Fang Ye voiced the biggest doubt of many people. He really wanted to know how capable the boss was.</p> 
 <p>“This is a long story. Actually, there is a formidable fellow living in my consciousness. His energy is also stored in me. However, his energy is very burdensome to my body and I can’t control it. At the last moment, I reached an agreement with him, so he came out to help,” Bai Xiaofei explained in as much detail as he could give.</p> 
 <p>“Ohhhh, I see,” Fang Ye stretched. Although Bai Xiaofei sounded nonchalant, he could feel that this ‘formidable fellow’ was not so friendly! After knowing what he needed to know, he changed the subject, “What about Tan Xin? What are you going to do with her? And Gu Lingyue and Rui Mengqi too. They look like they’re set on following you. Are you really taking them all with you after graduation? In that case, I am afraid that some people will not sit still.”</p> 
 <p>This time, it was not to poke fun at Bai Xiaofei. He was really worried about Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Can you not mention this? I’m already having a headache!” Bai Xiaofei instantly looked like he wanted to cry. Before, he never thought that women were so difficult to deal with!</p> 
 <p><em>Is this the so-called adult world? If so, let me go back. It’s too hard here!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Alright, alright, I won’t. Last question: What are you going to do after graduation? Go to Illusion Demon?”</p> 
 <p>With this question, Fang Ye rendered Bai Xiaofei speechless. </p> 
 <p><em>Where to go after graduation?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Shit, I’ve never considered this!!</em></p>
