 <p>Chapter 965: Brains and Brawn!</p> 
 <p>A night quietly passed. Early the next morning, after domineeringly hoarding the best food, Bai Xiaofei brought his group to the central square, where, according to the schedule, the first round of the competition would be held and the result would be the elimination of up to 60% contestants!</p> 
 <p>It did not take long for the rest of the contestants to arrive. After the lesson learned from Bai Xiaofei the previous evening, they had formed groups, which was obvious from how they stood together.</p> 
 <p>Under everyone’s expectant gaze, Ye Tong boarded the high platform, and at the same time, tables were moved to the central square.</p> 
 <p>Watching the guards’ actions, the contestants grew nervous. They had only been provided with the schedule, but it mentioned nothing about the content of the competition and so no one knew what they were going to face.</p> 
 <p>“In this round, you have two options.”</p> 
 <p>As Ye Tong started speaking, everyone became all ears.</p> 
 <p>“Either literature or martial arts. Choose the former, and you will get a test paper, and the top 40% will pass. Should you choose the latter, you are free to form a team, with whom you will be combating together against the responding number of soldiers. As long as you persist for more than 30 minutes without everyone being taken down, then your whole team will pass.”</p> 
 <p>The rules were not complicated, but all the contestants looked confused.</p> 
 <p><em>Is this really a servant competition? When did the requirements for servants become so high?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Putting aside the literature test, what the hell do you mean by combating soldiers?! How can a man beat a well-trained woman?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Only idiots would choose the second option!</em></p> 
 <p>“Are you ready?” Ye Tong asked.</p> 
 <p>While everyone questioned whether the existence of the second option was necessary, Bai Xiaofei stood up and looked at the three hundred men who followed him. Not to disappoint him, none of them had hesitation on their faces!</p> 
 <p>“Northern District, Warehouse 10. We choose the second option. The number of participants: 302 people!” Bai Xiaofei’s voice echoed in the square.</p> 
 <p>The rest of the contestants instantly turned to gawk at him. <em>Heavens!! Someone’s really out of his mind?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Is there anyone else with the same choice?” Ye Tong was pleased by Bai Xiaofei’s choice. Her rubbing her palms together showed how much she looked forward to the fight – Yes, she was going to personally participate!</p> 
 <p>After ten minutes, the remaining tens of thousands of contestants all chose the first option. It was a consensus for them that it was impossible to win against trained Moonlight soldiers. Many were ready to watch Bai Xiaofei’s group make a fool of themselves.</p> 
 <p>“The competition officially begins now. Those who chose the second option, you have 30 minutes to choose suitable weapons in the nearby arsenal and prepare yourselves before welcoming attacks from the troops. Good luck!” Ye Tong was looking at Bai Xiaofei when she said this.</p> 
 <p>He also looked at her. Although it was too far to see each other’s expressions clearly, there was a spark of animosity between them.</p> 
 <p><em>Come, scum. I shall have my revenge for last time!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Come, Your Highness, I’ll show you what a man is capable of!</em></p> 
 <p>“Let’s go!” Bai Xiaofei commanded and headed toward the arsenal.</p> 
 <p>Ye Tong descended from the platform and said to her guards, “I’ll leave this place to you. I’ll deal with them myself.” Then, she waved her hand.</p> 
 <p>The deputy commander instantly understood and selected 301 heavily armed soldiers from the troops.</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>“You have ten minutes to choose a weapon that you’re most comfortable with. Just leave the heavy armor. Then, take all the ropes, oil, arrows, and spears here!” After a quick glance at the entire arsenal, Bai Xiaofei already had devised a plan.</p> 
 <p>Despite having no idea what he wanted to do, the group of muscular men who had come to idolize him quickly carried out his order and completed it in just eight minutes.</p> 
 <p>“Back to the Northern District!” said Bai Xiaofei. To fight a defensive battle and then counterattack, it had to be at a place they were familiar with!</p> 
 <p>While the group plunged into the Northern District where Bai Xiaofei began making elaborate arrangements, Ye Tong was also starting her pre-war mobilization.</p> 
 <p>“Although our opponents are scum, be on your guard and take this as a real war! Show no mercy! Fifteen minutes, within fifteen minutes, I want all of them down!” Ye Tong’s voice was dead serious. “We will be divided into three teams. Each of you will lead one, and I will lead one myself. My team will charge head-on while yours will be intercepting them to prevent them from stalling.”</p> 
 <p>Finishing her commands, Ye Tong’s lips curled up.</p> 
 <p>In fact, the contestants were right to doubt the martial arts option, because it was certainly extremely unfair. The group that Ye Tong led were all soldiers who had returned from the border, all of them puppet masters!</p> 
 <p>In other words, the next battle would be the desperate situation of ordinary people against puppet masters!</p> 
 <p>Moving back to the square, where the contestants had all gone crazy… </p> 
 <p>There were only two kinds of questions on the test paper: history and military affairs!</p> 
 <p>The history part quizzed about all the major events between Moonlight and the Sacks in the past one hundred years. The military part questioned one’s conception of wars and demanded one to think from the perspective of the losing side: what would they do to overturn history?</p> 
 <p>In other places, these might be common questions, but for Moonlight men, these were all in their blind spot of knowledge. The only thing they ever thought about was how to please their master and to make themselves more pleasing to their masters!</p> 
 <p>The vast majority fell into the predicament of having nothing to write, while a small number who had dabbled in history could answer some questions and then blindly made up the rest.</p> 
 <p>However, there were a few rare ones whose faces were always wearing confident smiles.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, the guards in charge of invigilation couldn’t help but shake their heads. <em>It’s unrealistic to rely on men!</em></p> 
 <p>“Can I hand in my paper?” an aloof voice suddenly rang out.</p>
