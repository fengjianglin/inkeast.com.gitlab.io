 <p>Chapter 1003: Fickle’s Might (2)</p> 
 <p>“Fast attack!” commanded the captain of the first wave of people who boarded the wall.</p> 
 <p>The troops quickly shuttled across, turning the enemies in their paths into corpses before they could even react. The four walls were quickly breached, but the next actions of the four teams that captured them went differently.</p> 
 <p>Except for Tan Xin’s team who continued to aggressively attack, the other three sides arranged troops to change into the Sacks soldiers’ clothes and feigned keeping watch on the walls, while the rest snuck into the fortress while Tan Xin attracted their attention.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t engage! Fight as you move along the east of the fortress!”</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin entered from the north side of the fortress while Ye Qingtong entered from the east. The former carried out head-on attacks while the latter sneak attacked, quietly swallowing any small teams they came across!</p> 
 <p>However, against the tens of thousands of soldiers in the fortress, Tan Xin’s group of 100-odd were pitifully few and their situation was quickly exposed under the continuous probing of the Sacks.</p> 
 <p>“The invaders are only a small team! Besiege and annihilate!”</p> 
 <p>Once the Sacks came around, they advanced orderly and narrowed the activity scope of Tan Xin’s group little by little.</p> 
 <p>“Deputy Tan, they’ve responded. We can’t delay any longer.” Tan Xin’s teammates learned of the Sacks’ reaction before they were completely surrounded. While the situation was not optimistic, it was still within control –</p> 
 <p>Because their goal had been achieved!</p> 
 <p>“Stop fighting and move toward the east!” shouted Tan Xin.</p> 
 <p>The team immediately acted as per her order. At the same time, Ye Qingtong saw the signal sent by Tan Xin.</p> 
 <p>“Get ready to coordinate with Deputy Tan, they are coming!” Ye Qingtong immediately stopped their sneak-attack operation as her team had basically figured out the situation inside the fortress.</p> 
 <p>On the way to meet Tan Xin’s team, Ye Qingtong came across her only obstacle – a small army of nearly a thousand people!</p> 
 <p>“Inform Deputy Tan about the number and position of the target,” ordered Ye Qingtong.</p> 
 <p>Immediately, the signalman climbed up on the wall and played an intricate whistle, sending out an owl-like noise.</p> 
 <p>“Stop! Stand by and get ready to meet the enemy! Deputy Ye is already in place! In a while, we will each fight our own. The priority is staying alive!”</p> 
 <p>After receiving the signal, Tan Xin calculated the distance before decisively ordering her team to stop. They quickly dispersed to the surrounding buildings in groups of three.</p> 
 <p>Not long after Tan Xin’s team got ready, the small squad of a thousand Sacks soldiers appeared. Despite being in their own territory, they were being even more careful than the Fickle group. However, sometimes, being careful was useless…</p> 
 <p>Small arrows shot out from every tricky angle, and none was wasted as over a hundred Sacks soldiers collapsed!</p> 
 <p>However, this also exposed the Fickle soldier’s positions. The Sacks immediately got into formation and headed towards those locations. But to their surprise, the other party went completely silent after the first wave of attacks.</p> 
 <p>Facing the advancing Sack soldiers who had their shields up, arrows were no longer effective. Instead, the silence could actually impose tremendous pressure on them!</p> 
 <p>Analyzing the opposing party’s psychological state was the biggest lesson that Bai Xiaofei had taught the Fickle Army, which even physical fitness and fighting skills came second to!</p> 
 <p>“KILL!”</p> 
 <p>Battle cries echoed as soon as the front row of Sacks soldiers entered the Fickle team’s attack range. The next second, they rushed out with their blades raised high and hacked down at the enemies. And this was only the beginning. After cutting down the first row, they proceeded to use various strange-looking attack methods to insta-kill the targets!</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, their battle cries also served as a signal for Ye Qingtong’s group who had been lying in wait behind the Sacks squad.</p> 
 <p>Similarly, the spring-loaded arrows were shot first and reaped the lives of a large number of Sacks soldiers at the rear. A short while later, Ye Qingtong led her team directly into the enemy, executing Bai Xiaofei’s surprise-attack lesson to perfection!</p> 
 <p>“Die!!” Ye Qingtong went straight for the commander of the Sacks squad.</p> 
 <p>The Sacks soldiers quickly reacted and stood in her path. Too bad for them, it was not a close-quarter fight like they had expected. The Fickle Army never specialized in close combat in the first place!</p> 
 <p>While fighting off those who came at her, Ye Qingtong turned and threw out her lock hook, which shot through the crowd of enemies right at their squad commander, slicing off the man’s head and hooking it back to its master. Then, Ye Qingtong’s combat talent was fully demonstrated as she utilized her blade, spring-loaded daggers, and hook lock in turn to take down six Sacks fighters in less than ten seconds.</p> 
 <p>Raising the squad commander’s head high, Ye Qingtong shouted, “Your commander is dead, surrender if you want to live!”</p> 
 <p>This startled the Sacks, but not the Fickle soldiers! They seized this opportunity and launched another harvest with their weapons. It was also due to this that the remaining Sack soldiers completely gave up on resisting. After the first man dropped his weapon, the remaining 300-odd followed and got down on their knees.</p> 
 <p>The opening battle was a victory for the Fickle Army!</p> 
 <p>“Deputies, what do we do with these people?”</p> 
 <p>The Fickle soldiers were at a loss as to how to handle their prisoners. It would be much easier if this was outside as whatever would do, but this was inside the enemy fortress and it wouldn’t take long for their comrades to arrive.</p> 
 <p>“Knock them unconscious!” ordered Tan Xin. Breach of promises on the battlefield was a big taboo. If one promised not to kill, then one must not kill.</p> 
 <p>After quickly taking care of the prisoners, the group headed in the direction where Tan Xin had come from, but not before creating traces that indicated they had run in the opposite direction.</p> 
 <p>Sure enough, it didn’t take long for the Sacks reinforcements to arrive. After a brief look at the area, they immediately decided to head east to give chase, not even noticing that their comrades were only unconscious and not dead.</p> 
 <p>On the ever-changing battlefield, no one could be too careful. Paying more attention to details than one’s enemy and one would gain an absolute advantage!</p> 
 <p>After Tan Xin and Ye Qingtong were safe, their missions were also considered completed. At that moment, there was finally movement from the group on the west side. A blazing fire lit the west sky and shrill cries attracted the attention of the whole fortress.</p> 
 <p>“Not good! They were stalling! To the west side!!” The Sacks soldiers searching for Tan Xin’s group instantly realized what was going on. They flocked to the west side of the fortress, thinking they had just fallen for the enemy’s diversion.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Zhu Chunyang’s group at the west of the fortress put down the torch in his hand with a smile. His teammates who had just finished creating a commotion also returned to his side.</p> 
 <p>“They should be rushing over right now. In the following fights, prioritize your life. Fight while retreating until we reach the fortress gate!” Zhu Chunyang said.</p> 
 <p>Receiving his order, the team quickly dispersed under the cover of the fire and smoke.</p> 
 <p>Soon, the Sacks soldiers arrived, only to be ambushed by the scattered Fickle soldiers in the area. The effect of this tactic gave the Sacks the illusion that the other party had over a thousand people, which also convinced them that the west side was the main attack direction of the invaders.</p> 
 <p>After this information was sent back to their higher-ups, more and more Sacks troops poured towards the west side for what they thought to be the decisive battle.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, the groups of Tan Xin and Ye Qingcheng were completely out of danger and became active again. This time, their mission was no longer attracting attention, but much simpler – kill every opponent they could find!</p> 
 <p>There were 30,000 Sacks troops in this small fortress. Even if Bai Xiaofei cut down their leader as planned, the rest might not surrender or abandon the fortress. To ensure success, the Fickle Army had to kill until the Sacks felt they could no longer win. And the rare opportunity to realize this goal was being presented. If they delayed, it would not be as simple later.</p> 
 <p>“What is the situation?! How did those people just suddenly appear in the fortress?! I thought only the south wall was breached?!!”</p> 
 <p>In the command post at the center of the fortress, the grand commander, Baijiang, was in the middle of a raging outburst. If his fortress had been invaded and crushed by a big army, he would have been absolutely convinced, but the current situation was an insult to him.</p> 
 <p>Many of his troops had been killed while he still didn’t know what the opponent looked like, how many people they had, and even when they had breached the fortress!</p> 
 <p>“The situation at the other three sides was actually all normal just now, but all of a sudden, except for the north wall who has just responded, the other three have already fallen…” reported a soldier who shook like a leaf.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Baijiang was stunned.</p> 
 <p>“The situation is not right! It’s the north side!! Call everyone back to aid!!!”</p>
