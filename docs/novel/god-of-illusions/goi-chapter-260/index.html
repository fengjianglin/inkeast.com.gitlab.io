 <p>Chapter 260: Bai Xiaofei Just Can’t Stay Idle!</p> 
 <p>News of Di Jiang's death spread like wildfire. This match between the academy and the students had ended with the latter’s victory, and the name ‘Bai Xiaofei’ was once again remembered by everyone. If Bai Xiaofei was only a legend before, he was now worthy of the title ‘hero’!</p> 
 <p>To put it bluntly, some people might know all of the four principals, but now in the entire Starnet Academy, there was absolutely no one who didn’t know of Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>However, being famous also had its worries. Currently, Bai Xiaofei would have countless eyes on him once he walked out of the Demon of Illusions, and no matter where he went, people would come up to him. Therefore, he didn’t dare to go out without changing his appearance first…</p> 
 <p>As for Lei Shan, there had been no movement from him. No one knows what he was thinking, but he didn’t seem to have any intentions of holding Bai Xiaofei accountable, which could be considered good news for him.</p> 
 <p>After the ‘Di Jiang incident’ was over, Starnet entered a long period of adjustment. Neither the excited students nor the confused teachers who didn’t know how to handle themselves right now had no mind to face what they should do. In other words, the academy needed an adjustment, one adjustment that could completely drag everyone out of the Di Jiang incident!</p> 
 <p>Of course, there was none other than Bai Xiaofei who was deemed capable of such a thing. Therefore, Luo Xi sought him out.</p> 
 <p>Fate did seem to like playing tricks on people. Of the four principals, Luo Xi had now become the closest one to Bai Xiaofei. However, of course, Luo Xi's aversion to people surnamed Bai hadn’t changed one bit. So, the meeting between the two was nothing less than the drama of the century…</p> 
 <p>“You know, I really didn't want to come and find you!” With her first sentence right after they met, Luo Xi lowered the atmosphere to below freezing. Fortunately, it was Bai Xiaofei who stood opposite her.</p> 
 <p>Facing Luo Xi, Bai Xiaofei had reason to meet force with force.</p> 
 <p>“To be honest, I am also very scared of you, Vice Principal Luo. You didn’t come to beat me up, right?” With a wry smile, Bai Xiaofei's response was equally peculiar.</p> 
 <p>“Then let's make a long story short.” Luo Xi still cherished words like gold, as if talking to Bai Xiaofei too much would make her allergic.</p> 
 <p>“Mhm, the shorter the better!” Bai Xiaofei agreed very straightforwardly.</p> 
 <p>“The principal hopes that you can hold an activity. The academy will provide any help you need as long as you can get the students back on track.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei's eyes lit up after hearing Luo Xi's words. He hadn’t expected such a pleasant surprise!</p> 
 <p>In fact, even if Luo Xi didn’t come, he was still planning to make a move. There was no other choice, he owed too many favors from others. They would come to find him if he didn’t deal with it all.</p> 
 <p>“What does this ‘any help’ include?” Adding a hint of hesitation to his tone, Bai Xiaofei began to test Luo Xi’s bottom line.</p> 
 <p>How much waves could be stirred up would depend on how much water was provided, and this water was in the hands of the academy.</p> 
 <p>“Don't even try to start pricing, don't forget that you’re also a member of Starnet!” The sensitive Luo Xi immediately understood Bai Xiaofei’s idea and knocked him down a peg.</p> 
 <p>But who was Bai Xiaofei?</p> 
 <p><em>You need a favor from me, yet want to limit me? Not a chance I’ll let you take advantage of me for nothing!</em></p> 
 <p>“Then this will be difficult. As you know, principal, my identity is very sensitive at the moment. I may seem famous, but there are not just a few people hiding in the dark, aiming to trip me up. I have many enemies in Starnet.” Bai Xiaofei replied ambiguously with an embarrassed expression.</p> 
 <p><em>If I don't drain you guys, I’ll write my name backward!</em></p> 
 <p>“As long as it is related to the management of the academy, you will have no problem going through everything smoothly, but the academy won’t provide you any other help!” Flashing the ultimate card, Luo Xi’s tone didn’t allow any rejection.</p> 
 <p>However, this was enough for Bai Xiaofei, because this was exactly what he wanted!</p> 
 <p>“Deal! Just wait for my good news!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s instant agreement gave Luo Xi a feeling of being tricked, so she threw him a vicious glance.</p> 
 <p>“If you can't do as promised, just you wait!” Dropping some harsh words, Luo Xi stood up and left, not wanting to remain there a second longer. Being around Bai Xiaofei really reduced one’s lifespan. If you said one wrong sentence, you’d fall into his schemes!</p> 
 <p>After Luo Xi left, Bai Xiaofei nearly went out of control due to overexcitement. Originally, he had been wondering how to launch the first step of his plan, and just when he was in need, Luo Xi delivered the means right to his doorstep. With this, he could do pretty much everything!</p> 
 <p>When his thoughts reached this point, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help himself and rushed out the door.</p> 
 <p>“Little Feifei, the meal is ready. Aren’t you going to eat?!” Leng Liushuang’s voice resounded behind Bai Xiaofei, but it couldn’t stop his footsteps.</p> 
 <p>“Just keep it for me. I'll eat it when I come back!”</p> 
 <p>As his voice echoed, Bai Xiaofei had already disappeared from sight. Chu Liuyun’s group sitting around the table couldn't help but sigh.</p> 
 <p>“Sister Liuyun, we’ve run out of money. If we don’t do anything, we won’t be able to afford any food after this month's payment…” Putting down the last dish of vegetable soup, Leng Liushuang raised a problem that demanded serious attention from everyone.</p> 
 <p>In fact, the monthly allowance that Chu Liuyun and the others received from their families wasn’t low, but every department in Starnet required contributions for monthly maintenance, so what was left wasn’t very much.</p> 
 <p>“I'll talk to him when he comes back!” Her hand holding the chopsticks trembled, as Chu Liuyun looked a little embarrassed.</p> 
 <p><em>Aiii, have to use the beauty move again…</em></p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>As he left the Demon of Illusions, Bai Xiaofei's appearance rapidly changed with Huskie’s help, while Blackie turned into a fur shawl that wrapped around his shoulder. Although this wasn’t quite right for the current weather, Bai Xiaofei's costume didn’t look that strange in Starnet.</p> 
 <p>There were plenty of people with strange accessories in Starnet. A shawl was nothing!</p> 
 <p>Before long, Bai Xiaofei once again arrived at the place where he had made his fortune. It was just after lunchtime. Yun Jingshuang, who was drinking his afternoon tea in comfort when he saw Bai Xiaofei rushing towards him, sighed softly.</p> 
 <p><em>Peaceful days are coming to an end again…</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was a perfect example of what was called ‘only bothers you when there’s trouble.’ Whenever he visited the Blossom Pavilion, Yun Jingshuang would definitely get busy beyond battered.</p> 
 <p>As for how he was able to recognize Bai Xiaofei, it was very simple. There was no other male with a normal, working brain and no desire to die who would barge into the Blossom Pavilion like that.</p> 
 <p>“When will you ever come to my place without looking anxious?” Put down the teacup, Yun Jingshuang gently shook his head. After Ling Luo’s case was settled, he could be said to be completely relieved and had started enjoying the life like that of retired elders.</p> 
 <p>“Time is precious, alright? How can a person as efficient as I be slow?”</p> 
 <p><em>Right. You, Bai Xiaofei, who never wake up in the morning, value efficiency.</em></p> 
 <p>“Let me guess, is your next sentence to ask me if I am interested in doing something big?” Yun Jingshuang really had become a worm in Bai Xiaofei's stomach as time passed.</p> 
 <p>“It’s a big deal this time!”</p> 
 <p>Just like dogs couldn’t change the habit of wagging their tails, if Bai Xiaofei stayed idle, he might just really be idle to death…</p>
