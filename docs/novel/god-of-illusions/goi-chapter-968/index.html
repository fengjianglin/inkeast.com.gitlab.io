 <p>Chapter 968: The Emperor’s Plan!</p> 
 <p>Facing Zhu Chunyang’s soaring speed which he realized that he could no longer keep up with, Bai Xiaofei released Blackie.</p> 
 <p>“Seal him!” shouted Ye Tong right at that moment.</p> 
 <p>The soldiers at the back immediately flashed their weapons and the energy in Bai Xiaofei’s body instantly stopped circulating. This was something that he who was about going all out for a fair fight never expected.</p> 
 <p>During his brief shock, he was sent flying by Zhu Chunyang’s attack.</p> 
 <p>“Godly Speed Fifth Realm!” Zhu Chunyang showed no intention to stop at all. His energy surged and he became so quick that he was a phantom. Another muffled sound rang out as Bai Xiaofei was helplessly beaten again.</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, the one-sided abuse did not last. Before long, Zhu Chunyang stopped and Bai Xiaofei fell heavily to the ground.</p> 
 <p>“You’re lucky I’m resistant to beating, or you would have killed me! Didn’t we agree to put on a show only? Why the hell did you get serious?” Bai Xiaofei mumbled as he crawled up.</p> 
 <p>However, Zhu Chunyang gave no response. A moment later, he suddenly fell over.</p> 
 <p>“What the?!” Bai Xiaofei quickly caught Zhu Chunyang, only to discover that the guy had fainted from the burden on his body…</p> 
 <p><em>Dammit, so you weren’t just serious, you were risking your life?!!!</em></p> 
 <p>Bitterly complaining about Zhu Chunyang in his heart, Bai Xiaofei looked at Ye Tong, who was running over.</p> 
 <p>“Your wish has been realized, but the fellow was too stupid and used a speed that his body couldn’t bear. See for yourself what state he’s in now.” He handed Zhu Chunyang to Ye Tong, then walked towards his group while wincing in pain.</p> 
 <p>“Take him back!” ordered Ye Tong with a complicated expression. After handing Zhu Chunyang to the soldiers, she directly turned and left.</p> 
 <p>Once Ye Tong disappeared from sight, the group of muscular men broke into cheers. The ones around Bai Xiaofei even lifted him and threw him into the air.</p> 
 <p>“Long live Boss Bai!”</p> 
 <p>“Long live Boss Bai!”</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>Their celebration never ceased until the day ended. For them, that day was a memorable one!</p> 
 <p>However, for Bai Xiaofei, this was only the beginning. His mission was to lead these three hundred men to pass the ultimate trial!</p> 
 <p>The round in the morning officially ended with the majority of the contestants being eliminated. According to the schedule, there was going to be another test in the afternoon with the pass rate even lower than the morning test, as it would only leave 1000 contestants in the camp!</p> 
 <p>When the rest at noon began and the contestants saw that not a single person of Bai Xiaofei’s group had been eliminated, they all lost the courage to compete with Bai Xiaofei over food and could only watch as he took the best away. The pitiful ones whose furniture had been taken away by Bai Xiaofei’s group earlier also put an end to their plans of reasoning with him. A group that could fight against the official army, no matter what method they used, was certainly not to be provoked.</p> 
 <p>Currently, the only hope of the other contestants was that Bai Xiaofei’s group would fail the afternoon test!</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, in the palace,</p> 
 <p>The emperor was watching the recordings of the first test with great interest. On the desk in front of her were several essay papers full of beautiful handwriting.</p> 
 <p>“So there are still talents among men. Although not many, they are all useful. Let’s hope that our chance really lies among these people…” the emperor muttered to herself with a trace of despondency.</p> 
 <p>On her right side was a pile of reports from the border. The situation was not optimistic, the border could collapse in another month. If it wasn’t for her holding her position, Moonlight would have experienced civil strife by now.</p> 
 <p>“Sister, I’m back!” Ye Tong’s crisp voice rang out in the hall. The smile on her face showed nothing of the feud she had with Bai Xiaofei just now.</p> 
 <p>“My, aren’t you chipper? Did something good happen?” The emperor smiled as she looked deeply at Ye Tong. As the latter’s sister, she knew her too well.</p> 
 <p>“What good thing?! Big Sister, don’t talk nonsense!” Her cheeks flushed, Ye Tong hurriedly changed the topic. “Do we need to carry out the next test according to plan? I’m afraid something will go wrong. Although we did investigations, I can’t guarantee that there aren’t Sack spies among those people.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing Ye Tong’s concern, the emperor shook her head with a smile. “I actually wish there were. It’s not like this imperial city can’t tolerate a few spies.”</p> 
 <p>These light words had Ye Tong speechless. Indeed, the emperor was right.</p> 
 <p>“Big Sister, don’t tell me you’re really going to send men to the frontier? Are you sure they can convince our troops?” Ye Tong voiced her next concern.</p> 
 <p>“Well, it is hard with just them, so I’m going to go there myself,” replied the emperor.</p> 
 <p>Ye Tong stared in shock. Then, she yelled, “No way! Absolutely not! Big Sister, if you…”</p> 
 <p>The emperor cut her off, “You think there’s anyone besides me who can change the current border situation? Things are no longer as simple as we thought. We still don’t know who the person behind the Sacks is. I’m afraid that except me, no one else can stabilize the morale of the army.”</p> 
 <p>“But Big Sister, what if that’s exactly what the Sacks want? Two of our generals were captured alive by them. If you…” Ye Tong lowered her head when mentioning this.</p> 
 <p>“My silly sister, aren’t you looking down on me too much? Capture me? Even if the Sacks mobilized everything they have, they can only dream!” declared the emperor domineeringly.</p> 
 <p>“I know, but if you leave, the capital…” Ye Tong’s worries continued one after another.</p> 
 <p>The emperor had already thought about that. “Don’t worry, we have your second sister. Although her mentality changed, she already has had a long time to adjust. If she still hasn’t recovered, then she wouldn’t be our second sister.” The emperor smiled and stood up from her phoenix chair. “You haven’t seen your third sister in a long time. It’s time to catch up.”</p> 
 <p>With that, the emperor walked straight out of the room. At the same time, a clear and crisp cry echoed in the air, and a moment later, a giant, colorful bird descended.</p> 
 <p>It was Moonlight’s sacred protector and the exclusive mount for its reigning emperors, an Emperor rank magical beast, Auspicious Cloud!</p> 
 <p>An empire, after all, was an empire. One could never imagine how unfathomable its foundation could be!</p>
