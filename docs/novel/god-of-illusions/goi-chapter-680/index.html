 <p>Chapter 680: Meeting Jackdaw Again!</p> 
 <p>Carrying the last of his four companions over, the bandit’s face couldn’t be uglier. Never in his dreams did he expect his entire group would be wiped out by one just like that. There were even two of them that no one had any idea how they were taken down…</p> 
 <p>“Take out all your storage props. Don’t try to hide anything, or you won’t like the result,” said Bai Xiaofei aloofly.</p> 
 <p>The poor survivor hurriedly did as ordered for fear of making him unhappy. Placing five storage items in front of Bai Xiaofei, the last survivor didn’t even dare to have any ideas to oppose.</p> 
 <p>Stowing away the storage props, Bai Xiaofei took out a rope.</p> 
 <p>“Tie them up tightly. If any of them breaks free, you will be the first to die,” he ordered with a malicious expression, successfully frightening the person into feeling that he’d rather be knocked unconscious with his friends.</p> 
 <p>Without any options, the guy did as told. After he was done, Bai Xiaofei tossed him a porcelain bottle.</p> 
 <p>“Let them smell it. I need to talk to your boss personally.”</p> 
 <p>This time, Bai Xiaofei’s words made the last survivor feel relieved. <em>I’m finally free of this torture!</em></p> 
 <p>The bottle worked effectively as its smell woke the four people, who were then stupefied by their situation.</p> 
 <p>“Let me introduce myself, you can call me Boss Feng. Now that all of your possessions are in my hands, you better take my next words seriously if you don’t want your years of effort to go down the drain,” said Bai Xiaofei slowly.</p> 
 <p>The four people immediately tried to check their storage props before revealing bitter expressions. At the same time, they looked at the only free companion who knew what had happened. Pitifully, the guy didn’t even have the courage to look up.</p> 
 <p>“In order to distinguish you, each of you take a number from A’First to A’Fifth. That will be your code names from now on.” Bai Xiaofei took out a Crystal’s Longing and chewed it, his relaxed manner extremely inconsistent with the present atmosphere.</p> 
 <p>“A’First…”</p> 
 <p>One had to bow under another’s roof. The leader of the five squeezed out his chosen code name through his teeth. With this beginning, the remaining four also accepted their fate. The ‘lucky’ one just now was the fourth of the five people, so he was A’Fourth…</p> 
 <p>“Don’t pull a long face. Compared with becoming cold corpses, your situation is much better. At least you still have the possibility to enjoy this bustling world.”</p> 
 <p>While Bai Xiaofei’s comfort was cruelly realistic, it actually made the five people feel much better. If one really died, then that was when there was truly nothing left.</p> 
 <p>“You are the knife and we are fish. Tell us whatever you want us to do…”</p> 
 <p>A’First hadn’t finished his words when Blackie shot out from Bai Xiaofei’s shoulder and clawed his face. Bright red blood trickled down as the guy looked like he wanted to explode from fury due to the pain, but the rope was too tight.</p> 
 <p>“Didn’t I tell you to call me Boss Feng? Moreover, you don’t seem to understand the situation. This is not the relationship between a knife and fish, but master and slave!” Bai Xiaofei stressed each word.</p> 
 <p>The ‘slave’ part deeply hurt the five, but no one dared to say a word this time…</p> 
 <p>“Do you understand?” Bai Xiaofei stared at A’First with murderous intent.</p> 
 <p>“A’First understands…” After a long time, A’Da struggled to utter an answer that completely destroyed his own self-esteem. From this moment on, he was no longer the leader…</p> 
 <p>“Great. Now, remember what I say next word for word, and I hope there will be no deviation in your implementation!” After a final warning, Bai Xiaofei announced their missions one by one and threw 50 Amethyst Coins at them. “These are your funds for the next several days. After finishing what I’ve told you to do, you may be able to get back what belongs to you.”</p> 
 <p>Upon finishing, Bai Xiaofei summoned Purple Luan. His wings flapped and he shot into the air, disappearing from the sight of the bandit group.</p> 
 <p>After Bai Xiao left, A’Fourth freed the other four. The five people then began a messy quarrel. Some wanted to run away, but more disagreed. As Bai Xiaofei had said, their entire wealth was on him. Running away was equivalent to going back to zero and starting all over, which they no longer had the energy for at their age.</p> 
 <p>In the end, the five reached an agreement to be obedient…</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei had once again returned to the trading area, now having assumed another appearance. Not an ordinary passer-by like the previous one but Qiu Feng, the deputy head of the Jackdaw Mercenary Group!</p> 
 <p>Blackie’s alert from before wasn’t because of the bandit group, but because she spotted the people of the Jackdaw Mercenary Group. Bai Xiaofei was going to scheme against them right at that time, but the bandit group of five unwisely hindered his plan, which was why he had been so ruthless when dealing with them.</p> 
 <p>Walking through the trading area for a while, Bai Xiaofei soon found his target. Over 20 people from the Jackdaw Mercenary Group were gathered around a small booth. Judging from the strength of the puppet master leading this group, it was obviously a squad leader.</p> 
 <p>If his memory served him right, according to Xiong Shou, a squad leader in any of the nine major mercenary groups should be at least an Exquisite Rank…</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had never seen that person before, so he didn’t know who he was, but it did not affect what he planned to do. After all, who would dare to be rude to their deputy head?</p> 
 <p>“Brother, this thing is useless to you, not to mention that you are in urgent need of money. We are offering the highest price possible. Please rethink, or it may not be certain who will have it if you are targeted by that bandit group,” the squad leader earnestly advised the stubbled uncle, but the latter showed no intention to budge.</p> 
 <p>“Five million Amethyst Coins. One less and don’t even think about taking it from me. As for your so-called bandit group, I’m not even scared in the slightest. I can even fight it out with you if your Jackdaw group wants to rob me!” said the uncle coldly as if his patience had run out.</p> 
 <p>Sneaking up on their conversation, Bai Xiaofei was delighted.</p>
