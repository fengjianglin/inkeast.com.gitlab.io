 <p>Chapter 752: A Chain of Schemes! (2)</p> 
 <p>With the support of his ‘good friend,’ Old Song selectively ignored the death of the spy group and decisively contacted the higher-ups. However, the reply he received was absolutely negative, unless he could ensure Bai Sicheng’s reliability.</p> 
 <p>Naturally, the news reached Bai Xiaofei’s ears.</p> 
 <p>“What do we do now? Old Liu, that was the only batch of spies we brought here!” An anxious Old Song felt like he was dying inside at the thought of his money flying away.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the fuss? All we need to do is make sure that the guy is reliable. Who says that a person’s reliability can only be confirmed by investigation?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei rolled his eyes. Although the expression was not consistent with Liu Heng’s character, Old Song didn’t have the mind to notice as he was stunned by Bai Xiaofei’s following words.</p> 
 <p>“Have you forgotten our mission? If he can help us solve our problem, it can prove that he is reliable enough, don’t you think?”</p> 
 <p>Although Old Song never said it, Bai Xiaofei could almost be certain after days of observation that the purpose of Old Song’s group was Starnet. And sure enough, Old Song’s reaction confirmed his guess.</p> 
 <p>“That’s right! Why didn’t I think of this!” Old Song exclaimed in joy, but then hesitated. “But it’s Starnet Academy we’re talking about. Will they be willing to help…”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei revealed a mysterious smile.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t forget that he is a businessman, and a businessman only goes after benefits. As long as we give him enough benefits, what do you think he will choose?” Bai Xiaofei patted his chest. “You wait here, just leave the talking to me.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing that, Old Song hugged Bai Xiaofei with one arm.</p> 
 <p>“That’s my good brother! Old Liu, as long as you handle this, no matter how much we earn, you’ll get 60!” said Old Song excitedly.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei pushed him aside in disdain. <em>To hell with you! Only my girls can hug me!</em></p> 
 <p>“I’ll go contact them. Moreover, I think there will be movement from Starnet soon.”</p> 
 <p>With that, Bai Xiaofei left the inn and headed to the Fragrant House. Before long, he arrived and saw Hu Xian’er’s group who had just returned from a fun trip outside. They immediately surrounded him.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, if you came back any later, the madams would probably think you’ve found a new love.”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Rui Mengqi opened her mouth, Bai Xiaofei had the urge to sew it up.</p> 
 <p>“Huh?! Boss, what’s with your expression? You really found a new love?! When are you gonna bring her back? We’d love to see the new lady!” Rui Mengqi grew more and more animated as she talked.</p> 
 <p>The creases on Bai Xiaofei’s face kept getting deeper.</p> 
 <p>“Mengqi, have mercy on your boss. He can’t take any more of your attack.”</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye was the only one who dared to come forward to salvage the situation. Bai Xiaofei immediately seized the opportunity and got down to business.</p> 
 <p>“Fang Ye, did you contact Starnet? When will they arrive?”</p> 
 <p>When it came to business, everyone instantly became serious. Bai Xiaofei had already made arrangements before he had left. In the past several days, eating, drinking, and having fun were not the only things that they had done.</p> 
 <p>“They’ve already arrived in the nearby forest. Once we send the signal, they will come in half a day and ensure that the scene is big enough!” Fang Ye laughed with a sinister expression similar to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>He who stays near ink gets stained black indeed.</p> 
 <p>“Tell them that they can come in now. Then just follow the plan. Remember to cause a big fuss!” said Bai Xiaofei as he looked at everyone’s excited face. “In half a month at most, we can leave this place!”</p> 
 <p>Everyone’s excitement climbed to a new peak upon those words. They knew what it meant to leave Starflame City: the official start of the SSS-rank mission! No matter what situation they would encounter and what kind of people they would meet, it would be a fantastic experience!</p> 
 <p>“Boss, my life is in your hands. You can’t make me go to the front line!” a grinning Mo Ka broke the quiet excitement.</p> 
 <p>Then, one by one, the group declared that they would definitely not risk their lives. Bai Xiaofei scolded them, but he knew they were just joking.</p> 
 <p>When such a difficult time came that required them to risk their lives, absolutely no one would hesitate. What Bai Xiaofei had to do was to prevent such a moment from ever happening.</p> 
 <p><em>Blood Diamonds, this lord will wipe you out from the face of the earth!</em></p> 
 <p>…</p> 
 <p>On the way back from the Fragrant House, Bai Xiaofei carefully sorted through the details in his mind. Despite the limited information he held, he could still draw a clear route. No matter what, their identity as members of the Illusion Demon Merchant Group would be an important point to make progress.</p> 
 <p>“Old Liu! You’re finally back!” Old Song, who had been pacing around at the inn door, immediately came up to Bai Xiaofei with inquiry in his eyes.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, he agreed. However, he demanded that we lower the price of Blood Diamonds. I’ve promised our best to give him the lowest price,” said Bai Xiaofei indifferently.</p> 
 <p>Old Song’s anxiety instantly turned into jubilation. “As long as he agreed! After all, the decision for the price is all up to us. So what if we really give him the lowest price? Hahahaha, my good days are near!”</p> 
 <p>Old Song was so excited that he didn’t know how to express his feelings. Before, he didn’t want to cross any people from Starnet Academy, but now, he looked forward to the arrival of Starnet students more than anyone else.</p> 
 <p>“In any case, we must gather ourselves. The opponent is Starnet and this is close to their territory. Remaining cautious is our priority,” Bai Xiaofei solemnly advised.</p> 
 <p>Poor Old Song had no idea that standing in front of him was the deadliest person in Starnet.</p> 
 <p>“Our task is only to monitor. There won’t be any problem even if we don’t have direct contact with them. What’s more, even if there is, it’ll be that guy’s problem. Since he dared to cooperate with us, his organization must have some special methods.” Old Song’s mind was still very clear. He just couldn’t have expected that he had already fallen into the net of schemes weaved by the opponent.</p> 
 <p>“I hope so!” Bai Xiaofei sighed and headed straight to his room.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Old Song ran to the city gate and waited for the arrival of Starnet people like waiting for his loved ones. To his delight, the other party didn’t keep him waiting for long!</p> 
 <p>As soon as the sky was dark, a huge team of 30 Starnet students poured into Starflame City. The leader was none other than the current president of the Student Community, who was a very important character on the list that Old Song got.</p> 
 <p>An opportunity had finally arrived!</p>
