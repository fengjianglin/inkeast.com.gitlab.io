 <p>Chapter 863: Puppetsmith Holy Mountain; Excited Golden Feather!</p> 
 <p>“Bai Xiaofei, remember what you’ve said today!”</p> 
 <p>Struggling to squeeze out a final threat, Hai Jun turned and left. The sister in charge of receiving Hai Jun quickly ran after him.</p> 
 <p>When there was only the trio of Bai Xiaofei left, Bai Xing and Bai Yue sighed.</p> 
 <p>“It seems that he will not let this go.” Bai Xing could not hide the concern in her voice.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei smiled indifferently. “Ethereal’s four great clans – Yun, Hai, He, Lan – in which Yun and Lan are like siblings while Hai and He are on the same side. Since I have decided to side with the Yun family, I am already unable to make friends with the Hai clan. Therefore, I have no need to give Hai Jun face. In fact, it’s much better for me to declare my stand,” he briefly explained in order to ease the two sisters’ worry.</p> 
 <p>“But Hai Jun said one thing right. Even a powerful expert cannot repress a local tyrant. The Hai clan is the second most powerful clan in Ethereal and their influence permeates every corner of the imperial city. Hai Jun was very clear about his intention, Mister Bai, your next days in the city won’t be easy…” Bai Yue frowned, confused by Bai Xiaofei’s confidence.</p> 
 <p>“You two are responsible for my daily life. No matter how powerful the Hai clan is, they should not be able to influence the Moon Beck Pavilion, right?” Bai Xiaofei smiled. “After leaving the Moon Beck Pavilion, my scope of activities will be fixed and I will rarely deal with other people. As long as I make sure that the people around me aren’t ones the Hai clan can provoke, how will Hai Jun create trouble for me? Besides, unless they send Exquisite Rank puppet masters to deal with me, there’s nothing they can do to affect me in the slightest.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the two sisters were stunned. <em>He has risen to such a height now?! To the point where he can ignore everyone below the Exquisite Rank?</em></p> 
 <p>They misunderstood Bai Xiaofei a little. What he was afraid of were Exquisite Ranks who possessed a large number of high-ranked puppets. As for normal Exquisite Ranks, very few could be regarded highly by him.</p> 
 <p>“So, can we set out now? I’m very much looking forward to visiting the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain!” Bai Xiaofei changed the subject, pulling the two girls’ attention back to the main focus.</p> 
 <p>They were going out to play today. How could they let a person ruin it?</p> 
 <p>When the trio left the Pavilion, a luxurious carriage had long been waiting at the entrance. Such was the style of the Moon Beck Pavilion. A guest who was attended to by the members would not have to worry about anything at all!</p> 
 <p>In the carriage,</p> 
 <p>“Do you two know anything about the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain?” Bai Xiaofei felt that he would be stared at to death by the two girls if he didn’t find a topic. This was the first time he really believed that people’s eyes could transmit energy!</p> 
 <p>“Of course, this is one of our compulsory courses.” Bai Yue instantly showed her interest.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xing did not join in, because her basic knowledge was not as solid as Bai Yue’s…</p> 
 <p>“The Puppetsmith Holy Mountain is actually an active volcano covered in a big magical formation. The energy from its regular eruption is stored in the formation. The numerous small formations then refine the energy into the purest earthcore flames for the puppetsmiths’ use. Those who officially join the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain will get to use a formation according to their rank, while outsiders can only spend money to rent it.”</p> 
 <p>“The mountain is jointly managed by five great divine smiths: First Godsmith Pinocchio, Second Godsmith Nanmo Sheng, Third Godsmith Blossom, Fourth Godsmith Heartless Snow, and Fifth Godsmith Thousand Flames.”</p> 
 <p>“Under the five great divine smiths, the status of the puppetsmiths in the mountain is decided by their smithing rank. The five godsmiths only organize the rank assessment once a year, so the puppet masters in the mountain all attach great importance to this.”</p> 
 <p>When Bai Yue finished the introduction, Bai Xiaofei seemed puzzled.</p> 
 <p>“So to speak, the puppetsmiths there basically depend on themselves. The Puppetsmith Holy Mountain is so yearned for just because of its pure flames? I thought it had an extraordinary system for teaching apprentices,” Bai Xiaofei voiced his doubts.</p> 
 <p>This time, Bai Xing, who knew the answer, quickly seized the opportunity to explain, “I know. Due to the nature of forging puppets, a puppetsmith won’t accept a herd of students at once, but will carefully guide several successors to see who has the highest achievement and then keep that person only. What those who join the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain want is the attention of a godsmith.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Yue added, “Apart from this, the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain regularly organizes lectures by godsmiths as well as workshops for puppetsmiths. These are things that outside puppetsmiths cannot get.”</p> 
 <p>With that, Bai Xiaofei gained a certain understanding of the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain. However, there was still one thing he was not clear about.</p> 
 <p>“The relationship between the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain and… the imperial city…” Bai Xiaofei’s voice was extremely light, because he did not know if this could even be asked. For some reason, he felt that Ethereal did not have much influence and restraint over the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain.</p> 
 <p>“No one knows for sure.” Even Bai Yue shook her head. “But what we know is that the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain will satisfy every request from the emperor of Ethereal. Conversely, when the Mountain needs anything from him, the emperor will agree right away. Maybe their relationship is complementary?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei smiled.</p> 
 <p><em>How can there be a relationship between such behemoths? How can one allow an outsider to sleep on their bed?</em></p> 
 <p><em>It seems something big is still waiting to happen here in Ethereal!</em></p> 
 <p>“Mister Bai, we have arrived,” Bai Xing informed as she lifted the curtain, interrupting Bai Xiaofei’s thoughts. She then took out an ice-blue crystal. “Please wear this on your body to avoid discomfort after getting out of the carriage.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Yue took the crystal that looked like a delicate pendant and hung it on Bai Xiaofei’s waist. Soon, he knew what it was for.</p> 
 <p>As soon as he got off the carriage, a horrifying heatwave comparable to that when he first met Golden Feather washed over him. Instantly, the crystal opened a light blue barrier and blocked the heat.</p> 
 <p>“It’s a Fire Separation Formation! If you can, take me close to where the formation core lies! Don’t worry, I won’t affect the operation of the formation, I just need it to aid me in advancing my power!” Golden Feather’s excited voice rang out in Bai Xiaofei’s mind.</p> 
 <p>“Aunt Gold rarely needs anything from me. I naturally will do my best!”</p>
