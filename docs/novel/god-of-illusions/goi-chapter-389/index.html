 <p>Chapter 389: First Clash, the Big Fish Takes the Bait!</p> 
 <p>Shang Youdao left in shock. Before he came here, his expectation was Lei Shan’s all-crushing power, but now, it was Bai Xiaofei’s monstrous intelligence. After returning to his study, he made one arrangement after another according to Bai Xiaofei’s instructions without any delay. Different from before, this time he was full of hope.</p> 
 <p>The next day arrived after a night of uneasy sleep for most people. A well-dressed, solemn-looking Shang Youdao gathered the teams with a dignified face. Looking around, there were at least 200 people, fully demonstrating what was called ‘high rewards lured in many brave souls.’ All the hustle and bustle of the world revolved around benefits, but most people selectively ignored the dangers hidden behind their interests.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you very much for giving our Bright Road Merchant House face and rushing here from all corners of the continent. While some of you may give up the opportunity to remain today, our merchant house will send off those who choose to leave with a gratitude gift,” announced Shang Youdao with a heavy voice.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, a group of servants came up, each carrying one wooden box. After the boxes were opened, the glittering gold bars inside attracted everyone’s eyes. A bar of gold was equal to 1000 gold coins, so this pile of boxes was a huge sum of money!</p> 
 <p>“Now, please make your choice. Anyone who leaves can take two gold bars.”</p> 
 <p>“Since President Shang is so generous, we won’t act courteously!”</p> 
 <p>One person spoke as soon as Shang Youdao had just finished, rubbing their hands with obvious delight on their face. Getting 2,000 gold coins without doing anything was something that rarely happened!</p> 
 <p>With someone taking the lead, the rest quickly followed. This ended with less than half the boxes still remaining. Over one hundred people, equivalent to two-thirds of the number of teams, declined the mission. They left the Bright Road Merchant Group with satisfaction. Some chose to leave the city straight away and others chose to stay.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, Bai Xiaofei’s group was nervously waiting in their room. Whether what Bai Xiaofei had said yesterday was nonsense or insightful would depend on what would happen next. In the former case, they could just pack up and return to Starnet.</p> 
 <p>Because they wouldn’t have the face to stay…</p> 
 <p>Heaven fortunately decided not to play such a big joke on Bai Xiaofei. Before long, news of those who left the city being ambushed came back! Just as everyone was frightened into disgrace, Bai Xiaofei’s group made their move because they got some even more shocking news and it was told to them only.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei and his teammates were heading in a certain direction as their Blackscale Horses galloped at the fastest speed possible. Some might notice them, but it didn’t matter as it was impossible to catch up. Spiritual Rank magical beasts weren’t just for show.</p> 
 <p>Up ahead in the direction that Bai Xiaofei was going, a team of five was galloping like crazy on horseback. Although their faces were serious, they didn’t actually seem to worry.</p> 
 <p>“Crimsonblaze Slash!” Qin Lingyan leaped, her puppet sword burning with fire hacked straight towards the group of five.</p> 
 <p>The air billowed and the explosion threw the speeding horses, but all the people on them landed safely. The heavily armed Qin Lingyan stood up and scanned the surroundings. The sword in her hand flashed with fire, ready to display its might again at any time.</p> 
 <p>The five who landed on the ground fixed their eyes on her nervously, but they dared not make any movement. Moments later, Bai Xiaofei and the others arrived, completely cutting off the possibility of their targets escaping.</p> 
 <p>“Ladies and gentlemen of Starnet, our mercenary group has not offended you in any way, so can you explain what this is all about?” Holding his long staff, the captain of the team stared fixedly at Qin Lingyan as his palms started to get sweaty.</p> 
 <p>“All of the teams that left the city were ambushed. The Bright Road Merchant House sent us to pick you up, as a responsible attitude towards you all. You can leave after the situation is confirmed to be completely safe. Our attack just now was merely out of desperation,” Bai Xiaofei stepped forward and said to the captain of the other team with a smile.</p> 
 <p>“We don’t need it. We can leave safely with our ability. We won’t bother you.” As the captain replied, his team members gathered around him, everyone seemed extremely nervous.</p> 
 <p>“Then my apologies. Since we’ve taken on this task, we will take you back even if it takes a battle!”</p> 
 <p>At Bai Xiaofei’s declaration, the rest of the team got into their battle stances in excitement. <em>Why waste your breath when you can just fight?</em></p> 
 <p>“Starnet is going a little too far in bullying others!” the captain shouted as his final struggle. They were no match for Bai Xiaofei’s group in a fight, with only two Master Rank puppet masters while the rest were only Proficient Rank.</p> 
 <p>“If you blame this on Starnet, nothing I can do,” said Bai Xiaofei with a smile.</p> 
 <p>Qin Lingyan was the first to sprint out as her long sword transformed into a fire snake. As someone who also practiced an extreme stream, three of her four puppets were concentrated on the Violetflame Sword in her hand, only the last one was on her light armor.</p> 
 <p>“Violetflame Demon Snake!” The sword swung lightly, and the fire snake shot out from the blade straight towards the opponent’s captain.</p> 
 <p>“Fair Replacement!”</p> 
 <p>At the same time, Chu Yue raised his right hand at the captain, and a red light shone from his combat gloves. The captain, who wanted to dodge the fire snake, was immediately set in place.</p> 
 <p>Fair Replacement: designate one person within the influence range of the puppet. Upon effect, the designated person would take the same action as the puppet owner.</p> 
 <p>In other words, if Chu Yue didn’t move, the captain could not move!</p> 
 <p>“Barrier!”</p> 
 <p>Realizing that their captain was under control, another person in the team immediately raised their staff. A transparent barrier appeared and blocked the Violetflame Demon Snake. However, the snake obviously exceeded the defense limit of the barrier. The barrier began to crack.</p> 
 <p>“Explode!” shouted Qin Lingyan without waiting for the snake to break the barrier.</p> 
 <p>The snake exploded and a terrifying fire wave instantly destroyed the barrier, blowing away the ones behind it. During the chaos, Bai Ye, who had already snuck his way over, attacked. His boots flashed and his figure blurred as he zoomed past three opponents.</p> 
 <p>“Wind of Entanglement!”</p> 
 <p>When Bai Ye stopped, the three opponents were fixed in mid-air. The seemingly harmless breeze limited their ability to move.</p> 
 <p>In only one round, Bai Xiaofei’s group already had the situation firmly in control!</p>
