 <p>Chapter 764: Assigning Tasks!</p> 
 <p>“We have four goals, so we’ll be acting in four groups.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing Bai Xiaofei’s plan, everyone was stunned. They thought it was going to be a team operation and had not expected to be divided right at the start.</p> 
 <p>“The first group will include Li Li, Xing Nan, Sisi, and Yiyi. Li Li will lead. Your mission is to investigate the Devil Forest Mercenary Group and its status in the Blood Diamond chain. If possible, establish a good relationship with them.”</p> 
 <p>Lin Li’s face instantly turned red upon being addressed by Bai Xiaofei. Even though she was closer with him than before, her shyness had not changed at all.</p> 
 <p>“I will do my best!” Lin Li promised as she stared straight at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the other three assigned to her team were delighted. There was no doubt that in the team, Lin Li was the strongest aside from Bai Xiaofei and Hu Xian’er, and could even beat Hu Xian’er in some aspects. It was almost impossible to go wrong with her leading the team.</p> 
 <p>“I believe that.” Bai Xiaofei smiled at her before turning to Hu Xian’er.</p> 
 <p>Even the current him could not guarantee that he would win against her in a one-on-one fight as he still had no way to counter her Permanence.</p> 
 <p>“The second group includes Xian’er, Ming One, Ming Two, Chen Hui, and Zhu Nuo. Your captain will be Xian’er. You’ll be investigating the All-Around Merchant Group. It is absolutely no coincidence that they rose with the emergence of Blood Diamonds, so you must be careful.”</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er quietly nodded. Her team was absolutely complete, with support, tank, Energy Stream as damage output, and the strongest attacker that was Hu Xian’er, as well as Xiaoluo and Xiaobu. They were enough to react to all kinds of sudden situations.</p> 
 <p>However, Hu Xian’er also understood that this was not because of any special relationship, but because this mission was demanding. The All-Around Merchant Group was new but able to stand firm in a place like Windlove City as soon as it appeared. Even Bai Xiaofei did not dare to think about the strength behind it. Therefore, this mission could only be handed to Hu Xian’er.</p> 
 <p>“The third group includes Fang Ye, Xu Chen, Luo Han, and Shi Kui. Your job will be monitoring Tong Fei. He will definitely go around, and I need to know his attitude and who he sees. If you can, follow him. I want to know his specific whereabouts.” Bai Xiaofei looked at Fang Ye. “In addition to your team mission, you also need to contact our merchant group. Remember the team I especially asked you to train?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s lips curled up. The rest of the team except Fang Ye was confused.</p> 
 <p><em>What team?!</em></p> 
 <p>“I’ll tell them to come at once. They have been waiting for this day for a long time, and they really want to see the big boss.” Fang Ye laughed in excitement.</p> 
 <p>“Tell them not to let me down and that I look forward to their performance.”</p> 
 <p>With that, Bai Xiaofei swept a look at the rest. They who hadn’t yet been named were anxious like cats on hot bricks.</p> 
 <p>“The fourth group: Wang Hang, Wu Chi, Mo Ka, and Qi Wei. Wang Hang will lead. You have ten days to find out who the city lord of Windlove is, and if you can, create an opportunity for me to meet him.”</p> 
 <p>If the mission Hu Xian’er’s group was assigned was the most dangerous, then this was the most difficult. It was unknown how long Windlove City had existed, and yet after such a long time, no one had ever found out the identity of its lord. No one even knew if this person was in the city, but Bai Xiaofei only gave them ten days.</p> 
 <p>“A week,” uttered Wang Hang with an expressionless face before Mo Ka covered his mouth.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Fei, he was just uttering nonsense. In fact, what he wanted to say is to give us one more week,” Mo Ka remedied.</p> 
 <p>However, it was no use as the team leader was not him.</p> 
 <p>“Very well, I await your good news.” Bai Xiaofei smiled as he ignored Mo Ka.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the rest of Wang Hang’s group looked bitter. <em>Finding the city lord of Windlove in one week? We’re gonna die to exhaustion!</em></p> 
 <p>“What about Unify Business?” Fang Ye asked.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had assigned everyone their tasks, but only an obvious target like Unify Business was left behind.</p> 
 <p>“That’s right! And what about me?! I don’t have a task yet!” Rui Mengqi hurriedly chimed in, her face full of curiosity and expectation. Only she and Bai Xiaofei didn’t have an assignment yet. <em>Can it be that we’ll make a team?</em></p> 
 <p>“I’ll handle Unify Business, and you will follow me,” Bai Xiaofei said slowly, putting her anxious heart at rest.</p> 
 <p>The rest didn’t say anything. As far as they were concerned, Rui Mengqi was still that creature who only had one brain cell and was ignorant of adult stuff.</p> 
 <p>Who would have thought any different?</p> 
 <p>Anyway, they thought that Bai Xiaofei chose to team with her so that his three ladies would not get jealous. However, Bai Xiaofei’s idea was different.</p> 
 <p>He only divided the groups after careful consideration toward the balance of strength needed for their respective tasks. As for Rui Mengqi, he teamed with her out of worry that she would carelessly reveal her true thoughts to the others, which was no different from a calamity for him…</p> 
 <p>“Well, go get ready. Our missions start as soon as it gets dark,” announced Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Everyone gathered together according to their groups and left to discuss a concrete action plan.</p> 
 <p>“Xing Nan, Sisi, you two stay.”</p> 
 <p>Walking at the tail of the group, Xing Nan and Zhu Sisi were surprised. The rest looked back curiously, but they did not ask and just left one by one.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter, Boss?” Xing Nan asked in confusion.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Zhu Sisi seemed to have guessed something.</p> 
 <p>“There is one thing that I have long wanted to ask you.” Bai Xiaofei took a deep breath. “You two are from the Southern Border, right?”</p> 
 <p>Xing Nan was thunderstruck.</p> 
 <p>Zhu Sisi sighed. <em>I knew it.</em></p> 
 <p>“Idiot, stand aside.” She pushed Xing Nan to one side and sat opposite Bai Xiaofei. “Ask away, Class Monitor. As long as it’s something I can talk about, I will tell you everything.”</p> 
 <p>With Zhu Sisi stating her stance, the veil of the Southern Border was going to be revealed…</p>
