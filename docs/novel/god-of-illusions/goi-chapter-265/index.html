 <p>Chapter 265: Didn't have the heart to extort</p> 
 <p>As Lu Lingyun’s voice sank, Bai Xiaofei also grew nervous for him. He had promised to help Lu Lingyun do well in Starnet, but if things ran ahead of schedule, Bai Xiaofei might have to go back on his word.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei could afford to return 10 billion, but the important thing was that he didn’t want to break his promise to others.</p> 
 <p>“How much longer?” Swallowing a mouthful of saliva, Bai Xiaofei asked.</p> 
 <p>He didn’t need long, only a month, and Bai Xiaofei could guarantee to bring the Thousand Aroma Restaurant back to life!</p> 
 <p>“Two weeks at the fastest. The slowest is only one month,” Lu Lingyun replied and drained his cup. Using alcohol to drown sorrows was exactly his state in recent days, although he didn’t want it.</p> 
 <p>“When did you get the news?”</p> 
 <p>“Half a month ago,” Lu Lingyun’s answer was so straightforward that Bai Xiaofei was a little bit ashamed.</p> 
 <p>He didn't ask why Lu Lingyun didn't tell him about it, because it wouldn’t make any difference…</p> 
 <p>“Half a month is enough, believe me!” Gazing at Lu Lingyun, Bai Xiaofei's eyes were firm.</p> 
 <p>“I hope so, you are my last lifeline anyway.”</p> 
 <p>With disaster soon at his doorstep, Lu Lingyun actually calmed down. Even if Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help him, he wouldn’t complain. After all, the Thousand Aroma Restaurant ending up in this situation today had nothing to do with Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Don't worry, I, your last lifeline, will definitely pull you out of this drowning state,” Bai Xiaofei raised his glass and proposed to Lu Lingyun before finishing it in one go.</p> 
 <p>“Can you tell me the specifics?”</p> 
 <p>The smile back on his face, Lu Lingyun didn’t hide his interest. He had been paying attention to Bai Xiaofei during this period of time, whether it was his blockbuster entrance at the New Student Competition or his turning the tide in the Di Jiang event, they all tacked a ‘reliable’ title on Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Just like how the Demon of Illusions members were expecting Bai Xiaofei to create miracles, miracles were also Lu Lingyun's last hope.</p> 
 <p>“Take a look at this,” said Bai Xiaofei and handed Lu Lingyun a little book, the same one that was given to all the girls on the Blossom Ranking.</p> 
 <p>Receiving the book, Lu Lingyun carefully leafed through it. As he did, a light started to shine in his blank eyes. Unlike the girls, he saw the opportunities hidden in this activity!</p> 
 <p>“Are you going to make my place a broadcasting point?”</p> 
 <p>The idea Lu Lingyun caught was that the Recording Eyeballs would record the whole process. Bai Xiaofei only mentioned that he’d broadcast it to the public, but he didn’t specify the location, and this was indeed a well-designed point.</p> 
 <p>However, it wasn’t the only one!</p> 
 <p>“Not just broadcasting. I'll have the first few performances of the first stage held right here. Otherwise, why do you think I’d want you to renovate the Thousand Aroma Restaurant? Although my original plan wasn’t this big, this idea was still there from the start!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei really didn't lie about this. Originally, he only planned for the girls on the Blossom Ranking to perform, but when the pressure finally fell hard on his shoulders, he had to come up with a more effective method. That was why he took it to the next level and chose to ‘renovate’ the ranking itself.</p> 
 <p>“It's really a good idea, but it still can't bring long-term customer flow to the restaurant. What will we do after the Blossom Ranking activity is over?”</p> 
 <p>Lu Lingyun was a businessman. Businessmen didn’t only value short-term interests, they also always looked far ahead.</p> 
 <p>“After the Blossom Ranking election, performances by the beauties will be normalized. I’ll help you to reach a partnership with some of them. At that time, all you have to do is provide them satisfactory conditions. In addition, after the election is completed, I will increase the number of activities in Blossom Pavilion, and I’ll make Thousand Aroma Restaurant the venue for the activities whenever possible. After long enough when the existence of the restaurant is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, it won’t be hard to crush the Hundred Flavor House even without external force.”</p> 
 <p>Quite a long time after Lu Lingyun had paid the fee, Bai Xiaofei finally gave him a complete plan. What was unfortunate was that this plan might not be even given the chance to be implemented…</p> 
 <p>“So, as long as we survive this ordeal, we can welcome the spring of the Thousand Aroma Restaurant?” Lu Lingyun’s eyes lit up after thinking for a moment.</p> 
 <p>“This depends on what kind of person your so-called inspector is. If he has a flaw, then it’s not ‘can,’ but this spring will definitely come!” claimed Bai Xiaofei with a reassuring smile.</p> 
 <p>“Flaw? What do you mean?” Lu Lingyun creased his brows and gulped. At the same time, he rummaged through his memories for a list of people who might be sent here to inspect. Face after face flashed in his mind as the black cloud over him finally dispersed.</p> 
 <p>No businessmen were honest businessmen. It was nearly impossible for a businessman to have no flaw!</p> 
 <p>“Any flaw will do. As long as there’s a crack in the egg, I can pry it open!” Bai Xiaofei had already made up his mind to give his all on this. There was no way out, this was what he owed Lu Lingyun. Even though Lu Lingyun didn't think he owed him, Bai Xiao couldn't get it past himself.</p> 
 <p>“I can be sure that all those who’d come are eggs full of cracks. I actually want to see how you’ll pry them open!”</p> 
 <p>Once again, Lu Lingyun filled their glasses. The difference was that this time it wasn’t to relieve the sorrow but to celebrate in advance.</p> 
 <p>After a toast, Bai Xiaofei stood up from the soft sofa. He had initially planned to make some more big bucks from Lu Lingyun when he came, but now he was really embarrassed to carry out those plans…</p> 
 <p>“Wait for my good news!” Leaving behind a hopeful Lu Lingyun, Bai Xiaofei hurriedly ran out of the Thousand Aroma Restaurant while Rui Mengqi hadn’t discovered that he was there.</p> 
 <p>Every time he hid from Rui Mengqi, Bai Xiaofei had a kind of surreal feeling. This was probably what they called ‘picking up a stone and dropping it on your own foot.’ Or perhaps Bai Xiaofei actually picked up a hill?</p> 
 <p>Who knew? Anyway, Bai Xiaofei now regretted it every time he neared the Thousand Aroma Restaurant…</p> 
 <p>Leaving the Thousand Aroma Restaurant, Bai Xiaofei pondered for a while before finally headed towards the Demon of Illusions. There was still plenty of time. It was getting late today, so there was no need to run around anymore for the day. However, what Bai Xiaofei didn’t expect was that the Demon of Illusions had been waiting for him, everyone's face was full of excitement at that.</p> 
 <p>Chu Liuyun was no fool. After reading the book sent by Bai Xiaofei, she knew that Bai Xiaofei was going to make a big move, and this move was probably related to solving the dilemma of the Demon of Illusions!</p> 
 <p>So, before they got an affirmative from him, they really couldn’t calm down.</p> 
 <p>“Xiaofei, you’re back!”</p> 
 <p>As the first to welcome Bai Xiaofei, Yun Sheng was definitely the most excited one. This was no surprise as he was the one that could eat the most in the Demon of Illusions after Bai Xiaofei. If the Demon of Illusions went broke, he’d absolutely be the first to starve to death.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Yun, you… won the lottery or something?” Looking at enthusiastic Yun Sheng, Bai Xiaofei put an awkward smile on his bitter face.</p> 
 <p>“No, no, but it's about the same. The sisters just told us about the Blossom Ranking. Are you going to… going to…” Yun Sheng suddenly stuttered at the end due to embarrassment, even if Bai Xiaofei was already one of their own.</p> 
 <p>“Well, yes, no good to keep dragging, better to settle it earlier than later,” replied Bai Xiaofei softly. Hearing this sentence, the six people froze in place at the same time, the expressions on their faces kept changing.</p> 
 <p>In the end, thousands of words all turned into a cheer…</p> 
 <p>Sometimes, happiness is just as simple as this!</p>
