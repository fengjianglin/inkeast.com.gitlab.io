 <p>Chapter 598: Persuade Them with Reason, Move Them with…<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p> 
 <p>“Please send your father my regards. If there is a chance, I will definitely pay a visit!” Seeing off another ‘debt collector,’ Chu Qingtian couldn’t help a long sigh of relief. After so many days, he felt like his mouth had been getting thinner and thinner from all the talking. Never had he had a better understanding of the phrase ‘running out of flattering words to say.’</p> 
 <p>The rest were going through the same situation. More and more people had been coming to Starnet to cause trouble. Dividing the work, everyone received those who they were acquainted with and repeated the explanation all over again.</p> 
 <p>And this kind of explanation relied on face and promises, and if both of those failed to do the job, compromises had to be made. After all, no one really wanted to fight Starnet to the end. The majority came for a reasonable statement.</p> 
 <p>However, there were exceptions…</p> 
 <p>Passing by Bai Xiaofei’s office, Chu Qingtian’s mouth twitched.</p> 
 <p>Everyone would deal with whoever they were familiar with, but there would always be people who no one knew, the number of which wasn’t small. These people would be taken to Bai Xiaofei’s office. Considering the job, they thought that Bai Xiaofei would be the slowest one, but in reality, Bai Xiaofei was the only one who actually had time to rest!</p> 
 <p>No one remained in his room for more than ten minutes. And when the guests left, they all looked despondent!</p> 
 <p>More than once, Chu Qingtian had wanted to go in and see how he was able to do that, but he really had no free time, so Bai Xiaofei’s operation became a mystery.</p> 
 <p>“Your Starnet has really run out of people, huh? Making second-year students receive me?!” said a guest coldly after being introduced into Bai Xiaofei’s room and getting seated, their tone full of disdain for Bai Xiaofei and Wu Chi.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was accustomed to this kind of reaction. There were very few people who he had welcomed in the past few days that weren’t like this from the start.</p> 
 <p>“Then, who do you think should receive you? From the principal to the teachers of each department, they are all members of our reception group. If any one of them at all is familiar with you, you wouldn’t have been brought here to me,” Bai Xiaofei replied with an annoying indifference.</p> 
 <p>“What do you mean?!” The angry guest smacked the table and bounced up from his chair, glaring down at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei lazily tilted his head and rolled his eyes with a displeased expression. At the same time, cold air spread in the room.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, in the adjacent room, Chen Hui was urging his Snowfreeze Pearl little by little with Mo Ka watching him…</p> 
 <p>The guest naturally didn’t know what was going on, but the chill creeping down his back couldn’t feel more real. He grew flustered.</p> 
 <p>“It’s obvious what I meant. I am the only one who can talk to you. If you don’t want to talk, just head for the door and leave. This academy is not the falling tree you think it is. If you don’t believe me, you can try and see if you can bring down Starnet!” Bai Xiaofei said coldly without showing a hint of weakness.</p> 
 <p>Standing next to his chair, Wu Chi snorted with great cooperation and glared at the man. This one glare made the man’s heart turn cold in fear.</p> 
 <p>The man gulped and his arrogance vanished without a trace, replaced by guilt and apprehension. After all, he was only a Master Rank puppet master, not something that could let him have his way in Starnet. The reason why he dared to be so haughty previously was all because he felt that he was the one on the reasonable side.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, Bai Xiaofei didn’t seem to care about this…</p> 
 <p>“Our Honorable Guest Elder<span id="fnre2"><a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a></span> died in Starnet. We demand an explanation.” The man tried to keep his tone as normal as possible while sneaking glances at Bai Xiaofei. Every time he did, he saw Bai Xiaofei staring straight at him. In the end, he ran out of courage and stopped looking.</p> 
 <p>“For this matter, we are deeply sorry. Our preparation and investigation before the event were insufficient. We didn’t expect the Globe Merchant Group and Shadow Death to join hands in a plot against us, which led to the death of a large number of alumni including your Honorable Guest Elder. We will take responsibility,” Bai Xiaofei said. At the same time, Wu Chi presented a folder with a series of clauses about the compensation in detail.</p> 
 <p>“We will send people to communicate with the families of the deceased and give them appropriate financial compensation. As for the losses of your merchant group, we will also compensate so that you can replenish personnel as soon as possible.”</p> 
 <p>“However, please understand that we are not doing this to silence anyone. The deceased all died for Starnet, so this is purely our duty. Their names will forever be carved in the history of the academy. As for the views of the outside world, we don’t really care that much,” Bai Xiaofei said lightly.</p> 
 <p>“If you are interested, I suggest a shopping tour in Starnet. It’s a rare opportunity that we open to the outside world. While you are at it, you can see for yourself if the current Starnet is as unbearable as they say.” After Bai Xiaofei finished his words, Wu Chi invited the man out.</p> 
 <p>“Bring in the next person,” Wu Chi told the freshman guarding at the door after the man left.</p> 
 <p>In his seat, Bai Xiaofei heaved a long sigh of relief. It was actually a rare case for a meeting to go this smoothly. The next one might not be so easy to scare. The only thing he could do now was to wait quietly.</p> 
 <p>And waiting was what the whole academy was doing at the moment…</p> 
 <p>While they were working tirelessly, the rest of the students weren’t idle. Some of the fourth-year students took charge of receiving new students, while the rest gathered and attended the open training course.</p> 
 <p>The content of this course was specially planned by Bai Xiaofei and the teachers. The students attending the classes were only their secondary purpose. The main purpose was to display Starnet’s strength!</p> 
 <p>In the academy square, the students sparred with their all, as the divine grade formation had been activated to make sure there would be no casualties. Once one side fell, the instructor would analyze and conclude what they could learn from the duel before starting the next one.</p> 
 <p>This kind of teaching method was absolutely unique because there was no other divine grade formation on the continent!</p> 
 <p>The ‘bloodiness’ of the duels scared all the people who came to watch. <em>If Starnet students are all trained like this, wouldn’t it mean they’d graduate with the experience of countless life-and-death battles?! Where can anyone else find this combat experience?! It seems that they weren’t exaggerating. It’s not time for Starnet to fall yet!</em></p> 
 <p>This thought arose in the mind of one guest after another. Those who initially came with the intention to make a fuss started to re-evaluate their plan.</p> 
 <p>Sometimes, reasoning alone was not enough. When there were too many scoundrels, a little terror was necessary!</p>
