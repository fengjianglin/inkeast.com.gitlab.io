 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei ran back to the academy like the wind and headed straight for the female dorms. Presently, his mind was completely bank, and all he wanted was to see Hu Xian’er as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, he’d forgotten something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Male students and dogs couldn’t enter the female dorms!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It just happened that Bai Xiaofei was male, and Huskie was a dog….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey! Stinking kid! Are you tired of living? How dare you trespass into the female dorms!?” He’d just step foot into the ‘restricted area’ when an aunty that held a broom charged over. Even though this aunty that wore an apron seemed easy to bully, but countless ‘beasts’ that wanted to enter the female dorms were stopped by this aunty alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was even to the extent that the aunty was given a resounding nickname.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Barrier God!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The barrier that stood in the path of male students on their road to happiness, and this was the extremely clear meaning of this nickname.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aunty, I really have an important matter to discuss with someone inside. Please, let me in, I guarantee not to cause trouble!” Bai Xiaofei spoke sincerely, but the expression of the aunty didn’t change in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone that wants to go in says they have important matters, so what do you think is special about you?” Her voice was cold while her expression seemed to be saying ‘I’ve seen many people like you’, and the broom in her hand was even suffused with a violet glow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Exactly, there was no mistaking it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The broom was a Violet-grade puppet!!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ‘Great Barrier’ part of her nickname was related to her character, and the ‘God’ part referred to her strength. She was a true Grandmaster Rank puppet master! And her broom had crushed countless ‘geniuses’ on the Combat Rankings!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw this, Bai Xiaofei who was unable to think of a reason accepted his fate. It was absolutely impossible to trespass by force because just the aunty alone was capable of dealing with 10,000 of him….</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could it be that I can only wait for tomorrow?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But, I really can’t f*cking wait!!!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei roared in his heart, and then he suddenly looked at the cage he held in his hand….</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Something sent over by the geezer is probably not trash, right!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As he thought like this, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but gulp down a mouthful of saliva. It was absolutely impossible for him to go through by relying solely on Huskie, so this was his last resort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei walked over to the side with the cage in hand, and then he squatted down before it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Fellow, I know you’re pretending to be asleep because I’ve never heard that any cat has such good quality of sleep!” Bai Xiaofei lowered his voice as he spoke. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The black cat within the cage slowly opened its eyes, and then…. It rolled its eyes at Bai Xiaofei!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Exactly, it rolled its eyes at Bai Xiaofei, and Bai Xiaofei was even able to discern deep disdain coming from its eyes!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the f*ck!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Motherf*cker! Not only did that aunty f*cking bully me, even a little black cat like you dares to f*cking look down on me!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve probably not figured out the relationship between us. Now, you’re my cat, and I’m your owner. If you aren’t obedient, then trust me, I’ll send you to hell in a moment!” Bai Xiaofei revealed a ferocious expression as he spoke. However, the black cat seemed as if it didn’t hear him at all, and it continued to mind its own business and lie there in the cage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Err, good kitty. I was in the wrong earlier and shouldn’t have shouted at you. How about we become companions forever!?” Since threats didn’t work, Bai Xiaofei instantly turned his strategy around, yet he received a new expression from the black cat this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, it was rejection….</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the f*ck!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the f*ck did that perverted geezer give me!? This motherf*cker neither yields to reason nor force!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Under normal circumstances, there were two methods to transform a magical beast into an animate puppet. The first method was the magical beast willingly becoming one’s animate puppet. This was the safest method, and the harm inflicted on both parties would be reduced to the lowest level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The second method was to utilize special medicines to place the magical beast in a semi-conscious state. Even though the magical beast wouldn’t cooperate, one could at least guarantee it didn’t resist. This method had a comparatively higher requirement towards the puppet master, and it was very likely that one would lose their mind if their soul wasn’t strong enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, besides these two methods, if one were to forcefully form a contract with a magic beast, then so long as it resisted, there was a 99% chance for the puppet master to lose his mind. But, the magical beast would perish along with this as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Bai Xiaofei didn’t have anywhere to find such medicines that could knock out a magical beast, so the first method was his one and one choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, this black cat seemed to have no intention of cooperating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What Bai Xiaofei didn’t know was that since this black cat was in Lei Shan’s possession, there had been countless puppet masters that had tried to form a contract with it. But, not a single one succeeded. Moreover, this black cat was completely immune to all types of medicines, so the second method was completely unusable against it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, Revelations firmly believed that Bai Xiaofei surely had a way to deal with it. So, he helped Lei Shan predict Lei Shan’s future in exchange for this black cat that Lei Shan regarded as a treasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now it would seem that Revelations might have been overconfident.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The helpless Bai Xiaofei was anxious to the point of stamping his feet, and then his gaze descended onto Huskie….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huskie, can you discern if it’s a male or female cat?” Bai Xiaofei rubbed Huskie’s head and grinned as he asked, whereas, the pitiable Huskie didn’t sense that a devil was waving at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Woof! Woof!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huskie cried out excitedly, and then he wagged his tail with extreme happiness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, so it’s a female cat.” Bai Xiaofei chuckled before his entire face instantly warped slightly and transformed into the face of a devil.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huskie, do you want me to make it my puppet and be a companion for you?” Bai Xiaofei raised his brows at Huskie and started digging a hole for Huskie to jump in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Woof! Woof!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once again, Huskie wagged his tails excitedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t think too much about it, and he only thought that once Bai Xiaofei had a new puppet, Bai Xiaofei wouldn’t torture him alone!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, I’ll absolutely satisfy your wishes.” After he appeased Huskie, Bai Xiaofei turned around to look at the black cat that was pretending to sleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, little fellow, I’m back! Wake up! I have good news for you this time!” Under Bai Xiaofei’s ‘sincere’ cries, the black cat faintly woke up, and its pair of black eyes stared fixedly at Bai Xiaofei while filled with vigilance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now, I’ll tell you something, and since your intelligence is so high, you’ll surely be able to understand it.” Bai Xiaofei paused for a moment, causing the black cat to reveal a rare trace of bewilderment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are two paths before you. The first, obediently become my puppet and form an agreement with me.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>His voice hadn’t finished resounding out in the air when the black cat rolled its eyes at Bai Xiaofei once more, and it assumed the posture of wanting to lay down and go back to sleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The second path is to not be my puppet. But, you see this dog, right? I’ll put him in your cage, and I’ll make him violate you and kill you! And violate you over and over again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black cat that was just about to lay down instantly jumped up while the fur on its entire body stood on end like a hedgehog, and then sharp and ear piercing cries sounded out without end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huskie cried out with grievance from the side as well, and he expressed that it wasn’t his intentions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s useless. Listening to this dog is useless. He’s already my puppet, and it’s impossible for him to go against my wishes. Moreover, even though he’s refusing in words, he’s actually very happy in his heart. Besides that, my cultivation technique is very special. Trust me, I’m absolutely capable of making you go into heat!” Bai Xiaofei promised solemnly, causing the round eyes of the black cat to be filled with flames of rage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the first time, Bai Xiaofei occupied the initiative in this confrontation!</span></p>
