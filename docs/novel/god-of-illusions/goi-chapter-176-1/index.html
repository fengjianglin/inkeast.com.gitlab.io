 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>

 <p>Not long after the waitress went inside, Rui Mengqi rushed over. The manager uniform she wore was much more conservative than what she wore at Babel Merchant House. This red cheongsam, however, still accentuated her figure very well, and it was only considered more conservative because it was longer.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Boss, you’re here,” Rui Mengqi cried out in surprise, slightly stunning everyone there.</p>
 <p><em>Boss? What is she talking about?</em></p>
 <p>“Don’t misunderstand. I am only the boss of her alone. I was the one who introduced her to this job.” Bai Xiaofei promptly explained, feeling somewhat awkward when everyone looked at him. Even so, Revelation still looked at him thoughtfully. Bai Xiaofei immediately knew that Revelation was thinking something dirty.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei did not bother explaining himself, and he started telling Rui Mengqi why he had come. “Is the chef here? Get him to cook a meal for us. It has been a while since we have last seen each other. We are trying to look for a quiet place to talk.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Ok. I’ll go talk to the chef. Little Ai, bring them to the VIP room.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was glad to see Rui Mengqi handling her job well. He had previously thought that she was only someone who was responsible and serious at her job. Now that he looked at her again, it seemed like Rui Mengqi was in fact also quite capable.</p>
 <p>At this realization, a smile crept onto Bai Xiaofei’s face. Of course, this smile didn’t escape Revelation, who was thinking about something dirty. When the old man saw how Bai Xiaofei was behaving, Revelation’s smile grew deeper.</p>
 <p>Shortly afterwards, Little Ai brought them to a VIP room. Here, Bai Xiaofei witnessed for himself what luxury truly meant. The room was nearly fifty square meters in size and was so lavishly decorated that Bai Xiaofei wondered if the cost of decorating the room was the reason why Lu Lingyun hadn’t been able to turn a profit.</p>
 <p>“There are only two of us. We don’t need such a big table. Is there a smaller table?” Bai Xiaofei asked with a helpless smile.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With contempt on his face, Revelation interrupted before the waitress could even reply. “Don’t let anyone know I’m your master. You will embarrass me.”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, he walked to the table, placed his palm onto it, and channeled his energy into the table. Then, the table large enough to be used by several dozen people started folding in on itself. In the blink of an eye, it turned into a small table that could be used by four.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s eyes went wide with shock.</p>
 <p>“Stinky brat, it’s clear you haven’t been paying attention during class. This table is actually a very common white-grade puppet. Anyone can control it by channeling some origin energy into it. Don’t think that puppets can only be used for battle. They can be used for daily activities as well.” Revelation gave Bai Xiaofei a short lecture before glancing over at the waitress. She was standing there with a smile on her face.</p>
 <p>He pushed Bai Xiaofei away and started flirting with the waitress, not feeling the slightest bit of shame for the difference in their age. “Beauty, do you mind leaving me your contact details? I can help divine your future love life. If I get it wrong, you can ask me to do anything you want.”</p>
 <p>The waitress was at a loss of what to do. Bai Xiaofei was so embarrassed that he didn’t even feel like berating Revelation. He only wished that there was a hole he could hide in.</p>
 <p><em>Oh, worry not. I won’t go around admitting that I’m your disciple. That will be way too embarrassing for me!&nbsp;</em>Bai Xiaofei thought. But before long, he was flabbergasted by what he saw.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The conversation had started in a way that seemed like it would go nowhere, but for some reason, Revelation had ultimately managed to start a lively conversation with the waitress, with her giggling nonstop. Bai Xiaofei was certain that if he wasn’t present, Revelation might directly take this waitress back home with him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Realizing he was witnessing an expert at work, Bai Xiaofei gulped.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, it didn’t take long for Bai Xiaofei’s savior to come save him from third-wheeling: it was Rui Mengqi.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The kitchen worked at full capacity and shortly afterwards, the first round of dishes arrived. Revelation had no choice but to stop demonstrating his flirting prowess and return to the table.</p>
 <p>“More dishes are coming, and feel free to order anything you want as well. The kitchen will be able to prepare any dish you can name.” Rui Mengqi had a satisfied look on her face. She was living a very different life here compared to her life at the Babel Merchant House, and the difference was as huge as the earth and sky. All this had been brought to her by Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“But try to not eat too much,” she said. “We don’t have many fresh materials left in the kitchen…”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was just about to praise Rui Mengqi, but when he heard this, he swallowed down his praise.</p>
 <p><em>Fine, it is still better to not praise her, lest she forgets herself…</em></p>
 <p>“Ok. Stop speaking. My stomach is hurting…”</p>
 <p>“Why is your stomach suddenly hurting? Do you want me to go look for some medicine for you? I’m sure you do. I’ll go now!” As soon as she finished speaking, Rui Mengqi rushed out of the room, and she didn’t even give Bai Xiaofei a chance to stop her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Revelation was stupefied.</p>
 <p><em>That girl didn’t realize he’s only messing around with her?</em></p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei and Revelation exchanged gazes. From the helpless look in Bai Xiaofei’s eyes, the situation immediately became clear.</p>
 <p>“Disciple, you are quite capable, eh? Before getting a wife, you are already collecting mistresses!” Revelation spoke with a perverted smile. Bai Xiaofei blushed with shame.</p>
 <p>“Master, eat. I thought you were hungry?”</p>
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei spoke, he placed two pieces of meat in Revelation’s bowl, trying to stuff Revelation’s mouth with food. If Revelation was allowed to continue speaking, more bullshit would come out of his mouth. Revelation sat back and enjoyed Bai Xiaofei’s service with a smile on his face.</p>
 <p>After eating some food, a serious expression appeared on Revelation. He asked, “Stinky brat, answer me honestly. Who taught you your melee techniques?”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei sighed.</p>
 <p><em>Here he comes. I knew this meal was a trap, one that would not end peacefully…</em></p>
 <p>“Master, if I tell you that I can’t answer your question for my own reasons, will you still continue to ask? I can guarantee that I have no malice towards Starnet Academy. I have also never lied to you.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei spoke earnestly. He would prefer to not lie to Revelation if possible. Although he had obtained this master out of nowhere – a master who, by the way, was somewhat unreliable – a master was still akin to a father. It was one of the few honors Bai Xaiofei would abide by.</p>
 <p>“It’s fine if you can’t say it. I believe my disciple is trustworthy.” Revelation answered with a smile. He didn’t feel displeased by Bai Xiaofei’s rejection. Rather, he felt a sense of accomplishment.</p>
 <p>“I have a question, master.” Bai Xiaofei didn’t intend to let this go, even though Revelation was no longer interested in pressing for an answer. When Revelation saw how Bai Xiaofei was acting, he was slightly stunned.</p>
 <p>“What is it?” Revelation replied doubtfully.</p>
 <p>“Why do Grandpa Lei and the others care about my combat techniques so much? Do my combat techniques come from somewhere special?”</p>
 <p>The question stunned Revelation, but he recovered shortly afterwards and assumed a solemn yet profound expression.</p>
 <p>He said, “Have you heard of the Dark Death?”</p>
