 <p>Chapter 628: Beat Him to a Pulp!</p> 
 <p>“You seem to have something on your mind, Brother Bai?” An Bang Ting’s eyes were very sharp. He noticed that Bai Xiaofei felt off at just a glance.</p> 
 <p>“I do, but now is not the right time to talk about it. Let us see the princes’ progress first.” Bai Xiaofei didn’t evade, but he didn’t give An Bang Ting any chance to ask questions either.</p> 
 <p>As the topic was led back to the princes, the other three Grandmaster Ranks were finally able to join the conversation.</p> 
 <p>“The continent has always lauded Starnet. We may finally have the opportunity to witness its excellence today,” provoked Liu Rushi.</p> 
 <p>He obviously came prepared, because right after he finished speaking, the other two Grandmasters immediately chimed in.</p> 
 <p>“I believe Little Brother Bai will not let us down.”</p> 
 <p>“Yes, yes! Although Brother Bai is young, he is a holder of the Starnet Brilliance that represents one of the most outstanding students of Starnet. I’m sure our eyes will be opened today!”</p> 
 <p>The two sang one after the other, trying to put Bai Xiaofei at a disadvantage by excessive praises.</p> 
 <p>“Then you guys may be disappointed. An Yue this silly child… I really have no way to get it through to his brain. It’s been more than half a month, yet he hasn’t made any progress at all,” sighed Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>An Yue wisely went along and lowered his head. This wasn’t acting. He really felt wronged, only that his grievance was seen as ‘shame’ by others.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t be modest, Brother Bai. It’s not fair for the Sixth Prince either. This is an event that will affect his future, you should at least give him a chance!” Liu Rushi hurriedly said. It wasn’t one or two days that he had been looking forward to Bai Xiaofei making a fool of himself, how could he let go now that he finally had this opportunity? “Moreover, I think the princes’ father must also want to know what they have learned so far.”</p> 
 <p>Saying this, Liu Rushi looked at An Bang Ting. This pushed the latter to a corner without a second option.</p> 
 <p>“I do indeed, but let the duel stop where it’s enough. This isn’t the only thing I want to see.” With a smile, An Bang Ting found a balance between Bai Xiaofei and Liu Rushi. As a former emperor, he was particularly good at this.</p> 
 <p>“Duel? Then just count us out.” Zhi Daoyuan waved his hand dismissively. Everyone immediately understood what he meant.</p> 
 <p>An Feng was an Illusion Stream. He had no advantage in combat.</p> 
 <p>Seeing malice flashing through An Ming’s expression, Leng Liuying whispered to Bai Xiaofei, “If you don’t let Yue Yue do his best, I’m afraid that he will be beaten to death.”</p> 
 <p>“It’s okay. I’ll be watching. He can’t stir a wave,” Bai Xiaofei smiled and rejected her advice.</p> 
 <p>However, she didn’t stop there and released a big blow.</p> 
 <p>“That lecher has been stealing glances at us three. You don’t care?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei looked over and immediately saw a lewd Liu Rushi. He shouted, “An Yue, come here!”</p> 
 <p>Men became terrifying when they became overprotective over their wives!</p> 
 <p>An Yue’s eyes lit up and he hurriedly ran over. When he passed by Leng Liuying, she gave him a wink. As slow as he was, An Yue wasn’t stupid enough to fail to understand this. He cast her a grateful look, before standing straight in front of Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Teacher!” Looking at Bai Xiaofei with excitement, An Yue was ready for some good news.</p> 
 <p>“In a while, except for exposing your Proficient Rank, you use everything I’ve taught. If you can, beat that eldest brother of yours to a pulp, beat him till he can’t get up!” Bai Xiaofei viciously said, looking completely different from his firm and calm manner just now.</p> 
 <p>“Yesh! Teacher, please rest assured. This student will not let you down!”</p> 
 <p>Getting Bai Xiaofei’s permission, the cloud hanging over An Yue instantly cleared. Although the Mastery Rank was one whole rank lower than the Proficient Rank, the actual gap was not so big as the difference was only the amount of origin energy. As long as he could quickly conclude the battle, this gap would be nothing.</p> 
 <p>And how to quickly take down a puppet master was one of the key lessons taught by Bai Xiaofei during the past over half a month!</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Liu Rushi was also reminding An Ming something. However, judging from their expressions, they didn’t take An Yue seriously at all.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Bai Xiaofei’s face grew a little more vicious.</p> 
 <p>“Remember, hit as hard as you can!“ he added.</p> 
 <p>An Yue understood the implication and nodded. He had been waiting for this day too long. One was to test the fruits of his training, and two was to take revenge!</p> 
 <p>Despite being biological brothers, the relationship between these princes might be even worse than strangers. Brotherhood in the royal family was simply a joke. Having the same father was not enough to have close bonds, not to mention that there might even be grudges between their mothers that had passed down to them…</p> 
 <p>Therefore, after the go-ahead from Bai Xiaofei, An Yue definitely would not have mercy!</p> 
 <p>Soon, An Yue and An Ming stood in the center as the first pair. After simple greetings, the two who nursed different ideas got into their combat stances.</p> 
 <p>“Start!”</p> 
 <p>As the high-pitched voice of An Bang Ting’s eunuch resounded, the duel between the ‘dragon’s sons’ officially kicked off.</p> 
 <p>As an offensive-type puppet master, An Ming took the initiative, relying on his advantage of being a rank higher. Holding his ice-blue dagger horizontally, he charged at An Yue and waved his right hand. Three ice spikes shot out at An Yue’s vital points.</p> 
 <p>An Yue’s reaction was not slow. Moreover, he seemed to have plenty of dealings with An Ming before as that trick did not surprise him at all. His body armor glowed as he covered the weak points that were being aimed at, obviously intending to take the attack head-on.</p> 
 <p>This was what An Ming thought as well, and a sneer climbed to his lips. <em>My brother, I didn’t know you are still so stupid!</em></p> 
 <p>“Break!”</p> 
 <p>Just when Liu Rushi thought that the battle was going to end, An Yue suddenly shouted. The next second, the armor covering him instantly shot out in all directions!</p> 
 <p>“Armor disintegration?!” exclaimed the audience in unison.</p> 
 <p>Armor disintegration was a function that basically all armor puppets had. Originally, this ability was only used to act cool. Think about it, after mightily killing around the battlefield, your armor would disperse by shooting out in all directions. Wouldn’t that look very domineering?</p> 
 <p>Therefore, it was completely understandable for the audience to be floored.</p> 
 <p><em>What is he doing?! Surrendering?! Waiting to die?!</em></p>
