 <p>Chapter 871: The Fifth Puppet!</p> 
 <p>In his crimson sea of consciousness, a pitch-black phantom of Mind Sunder quietly floated. The fact that it appeared in this place only meant one thing –</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had created a puppet link with it!</p> 
 <p>Sure enough, with just a thought from Bai Xiaofei, Mind Sunder flew out of his consciousness and floated in front of him. Recalling the description of this blade, he instinctively swallowed. <em>Oh brother… I’ve just grown a little more formidable, I can’t let this thing toy me to death!</em></p> 
 <p>Stretching out his trembling right hand, he slowly grasped the handle. The moment he touched it, a series of scenes flashed in his mind.</p> 
 <p>“Those were… memory fragments of your previous masters?!” Stunned, Bai Xiaofei looked at the saber that was deemed a curse by the whole continent and sighed. “So you were just misunderstood.”</p> 
 <p>The so-called curse was absolute nonsense. The reason why the former owners died so quickly was simply because they let themselves go wild after getting the saber. However, it was understandable. Mind Sunder was just too perverse!</p> 
 <p>It could change the element memory of whatever it cut<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>! Though seemingly a little difficult to understand, it was actually quite simple.</p> 
 <p>For example, a piece of stone was stone because it had the characteristics – its elements were arranged in a fixed sequence, and this arrangement was called the memory of elements. By the same token, everything in this world was made up of various elements. Mind Sunder was an element-level puppet that could alter the memory arrangement of various elements according to its owner’s wishes.</p> 
 <p>Soft stone, hot water, cold fire, etc., Bai Xiaofei could make everything in this world become what he wanted!</p> 
 <p>Of course, the change would not be permanent as the duration was related to energy output. With the increase of duration, the energy consumed also needed to increase geometrically. Even Bai Xiaofei, who could be called an energy engine at the moment, could not use this ability excessively.</p> 
 <p>However, nothing could change the fact that Mind Sunder was a BUG! Not to mention that Bai Xiaofei had Spiritualization. He very much looked forward to the changes that it would bring about when they fused together!</p> 
 <p>“Heheh, let’s leave myself a little suspense. I believe that you will not let me down.” Stowing Mind Sunder, Bai Xiaofei looked around. “It’s remarkably rare that anyone gets to visit such a place like this. I’ll leave after I get familiar with my new body.” Having made this decision, he stretched his naked body…</p> 
 <p>However, he forgot about something very important: Time…</p> 
 <p>For one whole month he was underground, everyone thought that he was dead. No outsider knew what the formation within the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain was, but everyone in the Ethereal capital knew how terrifying the core of the formation was. Not to mention a month, an hour was enough to turn a top-class solid material into ashes, let alone a human.</p> 
 <p>Outside, Bai Xiaofei’s funeral had already been arranged…</p> 
 <p>However, the particularity of his identity prevented the matter from being spread. There was no news coming out from the imperial city, only the sadness of those who knew Bai Xiaofei well.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Shi Kui, do you really need to ignore Master like this? He is innocent. You also saw the written guarantee left by Brother Fei. He wanted to go in. Also, you know Master’s ability, he is no match for Brother Fei!” Yan Ran’er appealed to Shi Kui, who was expressionlessly forging a puppet.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t believe he is dead. Even a Legend Rank puppet master may not be able to take his life, I don’t believe that a formation can kill him! I’m going to look for him! He must still be here!!” yelled Shi Kui with bloodshot eyes where tears had all dried up. Even if Bai Xiaofei was really dead, he would only believe it after he went into the formation and saw it for himself.</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother Shi Kui, can you please stop?! Don’t talk about the core, you can’t even stay too long in the central area. Do you really want to leave Yan’er alone?” Holding Shi Kui from behind, Yan Ran’er’s tears flowed like a waterfall.</p> 
 <p>Not to mention a softie like Shi Kui, even a hard-hearted person could not stand this kind of persuasion. However, “He is my big brother Fei. I have to find him!” Tears of blood seeped out from the corners of his eyes, which drained the last bit of his strength.</p> 
 <p>Shi Kui had not rested for a whole month. Forging fire-resistant equipment, failing, trying again, failing again… That was how he had spent the month. He didn’t even eat any meals.</p> 
 <p>For Shi Kui, nothing in the world could trigger him more than the death of Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Since you believe him, how about we wait together? As long as he doesn’t come out, we will stay on this mountain until he does. He will not want to see you like this,” said Yan Ran’er softly as she wiped his tears.</p> 
 <p>Shi Kui suddenly froze, as if struck with a realization.</p> 
 <p>“That’s right! Brother Fei will definitely come out! I promised to tailor him a puppet. Brother Fei always keeps his word, he will definitely wait for me to become a divine smith!” Shi Kui murmured.</p> 
 <p>“You are correct, I always keep my word,” a familiar voice rang out.</p> 
 <p>Shi Kui immediately went blank. Slowly turning around to see Bai Xiaofei, shock flashed across his face. “Brother… Brother Fei…” he called out, thinking he was dreaming.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, it’s me without a doubt. Do you know anyone else as handsome as me?” Bai Xiaofei raised an eyebrow.</p> 
 <p>The next second, Shi Kui threw himself into Bai Xiaofei’s arms.</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother Fei! You finally came out!!” Although Shi Kui had run out of tears, the emotion in his voice was definitely touching enough to move heaven…</p> 
 <p>“Tch, look at you. You keep saying you believe me, but the amount of your trust is questionable. Remember, no matter what happens in the future, stay calm for me. As long as you don’t see my body with your own eyes, then your Big Brother Fei is definitely still alive, alright?” Bai Xiaofei scolded.</p> 
 <p>However, there was no response from Shi Kui.</p> 
 <p>After seeing Bai Xiaofei, the last bit of energy that kept Shi Kui hanging also left his body. He had completely passed out…</p> 
 <p>“Nothing to worry about. He’s just exhausted. Take him to rest.” Giving Shi Kui to Yan Ran’er, Bai Xiaofei sighed.</p> 
 <p><em>I’m in trouble… It must be chaotic outside because of this…</em></p>
