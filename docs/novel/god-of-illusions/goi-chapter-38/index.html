<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>After beating Fei Gou and Chu Gan to the point their faces were swollen like pigs once again, Xue Ying patted her hands in an extremely relaxed manner as she walked over towards Bai Xiaofei and Xue Ying</p>
 <p>“Tell me everything that should be told. Don’t tell me that both of you were pursued because of a disagreement because that isn’t something you’re capable of.” Even though she’d merely come into contact with Bai Xiaofei for a little over a day, Xue Ying already had a deep understanding of Bai Xiaofei’s character that was capable of surviving everywhere.</p>
 <p>Lin Li looked at Bai Xiaofei with a bewildered expression when Xue Ying asked this because he’d only told her that they had to run earlier yet didn’t make the reason clear to her. Actually, if they really were to fight each other, then merely she herself was enough to deal with both Fei Gou and Chu Gan.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei who didn’t know if he should feel happy or helpless while being stared at by the questioning gazes of two beauties let out a long sigh, and he started telling the story from the moment he arrived at Starnet Academy.</p>
 <p>“Wait, transform? This husky is a puppet capable of Mimicry?!” Bai Xiaofei had just told the story halfway when Xue Ying had instantly interrupted Bai Xiaofei with a face covered in shock.</p>
 <p>Even though he was asked this question again, Bai Xiaofei nodded very patiently, and then he noticed Xue Ying’s gaze that seemed as if she was looking at a treasure.</p>
 <p>“How much fortune have I accumulated in my previous lifetimes to actually encounter two treasures at once!?” Xue Ying’s face carried a trace of an overjoyed expression as she charged instantly at Bai Xiaofei before embracing him up and spinning around twice. After that, she picked up Huskie who was on the ground before rubbing her face on him.</p>
 <p>“Little Fellow, tell Big Sister if anyone bullies you in the future. I guarantee that I’ll beat him up to the point his mother can’t recognize him!” Xue Ying guaranteed seriously, causing Huskie’s eyes to lit up before slowly turning his head towards Bai Xiaofei, and then he revealed a sly smile that was exactly alike to Bai Xiaofei’s.</p>
 <p>On the other side, Bai Xiaofei hurriedly stretched out two fingers yet Huskie instantly shook his head, and he only revealed a satisfied expression when Bai Xiaofei added on finger after finger until the fifth.</p>
 <p>“What? Did he bully you?” Xue Ying turned around, and Bai Xiaofei hastily put his palm away.</p>
 <p>“How could that be possible? Huskie is my puppet. I don’t even have enough time to dote on him, so how could I possibly bully him? You can’t ask him if you don’t believe me!” Xue Ying held an attitude of extreme distrust towards Bai Xiaofei as she really asked Huskie for show.</p>
 <p>What she never expected was that Huskie actually nodded in an extremely human manner.</p>
 <p>“He can understand?” Xue Ying couldn’t help but exclaim with surprise once again, and then a trace of bewilderment arose on her face.</p>
 <p>Animate puppets were usually obtained from signing a contract with Magical Beasts, whereas, the rank of a Magical Beast basically decided the initial rank and limit of advancement of an animate puppet.</p>
 <p>Moreover, the characteristic of being able to act like humans usually only appeared in Enlightened Rank Magical Beasts. But, Enlightened Rank Magic Beast corresponded to red-grade puppets. Even if the Magical Beast had undergone the consumption of strength from the transformation into an animate puppet, the initial rank of the puppet would absolutely not be lower than the yellow-grade.</p>
 <p>But, according to what Bai Xiaofei had said earlier, not only was Huskie at the blue-grade, Huskie had just advanced to this grade. So, this was a contradiction that was difficult to understand.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know. According to what my foster fathers and foster mothers said, Huskie was forcefully made into my puppet by my father when I was just born. So, even I don’t know what rank he was at in the past.” Bai Xiaofei shrugged as he spoke yet Xue Ying was stunned once more. <i>Binding an animate puppet to an infant isn’t something an ordinary person is capable of accomplishing. If one wants utmost certainty, then this puppet master is at least an Exquisite Rank expert!</i></p>
 <p>“Your father is….”</p>
 <p>“I’ve never seen him in my life. He gave me to my foster fathers and foster mothers while I was still an infant, and I only know his name.” Bai Xiaofei’s face seemed to not carry any sorrow when he spoke, and it seemed as if he didn’t feel anything for his father. But, Xue Ying revealed an expression that Bai Xiaofei was unable to understand instead.</p>
 <p>“Forget it, let’s not mention him because I can’t count on him. If you weren’t here, Big Sister Xue, then my butt would have definitely been split open.” Bai Xiaofei felt sincere gratitude as he spoke, and he deeply felt a single thing. The Starnet Academy couldn’t be compared to the Gorge of Heroes because no matter what trouble he caused in the Gorge of Heroes, he had his foster parents standing behind him, so no one dared to do anything to him. But, it wasn’t the same here.</p>
 <p>“If you said you’re a Mimicry Stream puppet master since the beginning, then I would have placed emphasis on protecting you a long time ago. How could you possibly be pursued by others?” Xue Ying raised her head slightly, and her complacency crept onto her face.</p>
 <p>“Continue. I haven’t figured out how you got targeted by her.” After being proud for a second, Xue Ying instantly became a little girl that wanted to listen to a story, whereas, Bai Xiaofei’s experiences in this time of a little over a day could absolutely be written into a textbook for Mimicry Stream puppet masters….</p>
 <p>So, Bai Xiaofei completely and utterly gave an account of all the ‘evil doings’ he’d committed since entering Starnet Academy. During this period, Xue Ying had repeatedly roared with endless laughter, and even Lin Le occasionally revealed a trace of a smile.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Bai Xiaofei’s courage and decisiveness entered deep into the hearts of the two women.</p>
 <p>“So in this way, the entrance to our classroom will be extremely bustling tonight?” Xue Ying smiled lightly and seemed to be slightly anticipating the arrival of tonight. She seemed as if the ‘warmup’ she had earlier wasn’t to her heart’s content.</p>
 <p>“It wouldn’t just be bustling, and it ought to be seething with noise and commotion….” Bai Xiaofei frowned slightly and couldn’t help but laugh bitterly. <i>I’ve really overdone it this time.</i></p>
 <p>“Then do you think I should borrow a student’s uniform?” As he looked at Xue Ying who was itching for action, Bai Xiaofei suddenly had the impulse to mourn for those seniors that might come.</p>
 <p>“Why do you need to borrow a student’s uniform?”</p>
 <p>“The academy explicitly prohibited teachers from making a move against students. Of course, self-defense is excluded. So, it would save me a lot of trouble if I wear a student’s uniform.” Xue Ying raised and lowered her brows twice, and the playful Xue Ying couldn’t be related to the word ‘teacher’ in the slightest, whereas, Bai Xiaofei revealed a speechless expression instead.</p>
 <p>“I didn’t see you considering this when you bashed those two seniors earlier….”</p>
 <p>“I was worried earlier. Who asked you to be pursued all the way back? Moreover, I’ve assumed the position of headteacher for a short period of time after all, so I might accidentally forget many rules.” Xue Ying’s gaze had already drifted towards the distance as she spoke, and it caused Bai Xiaofei to have no choice but to deeply believe that the latter half of what she said was the true reason she dared to make a move boldly.</p>
 <p>“Actually, I can find a way to deal with it even if you don’t help….”</p>
 <p>“It’s decided!” Bai Xiaofei hadn’t finished speaking when Xue Ying had already made the final decision, and based on her attitude, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t stop her even if he wanted to.</p>
 <p>“Little Li’Li, bring me one of your uniforms later. It just so happens that our figures aren’t much different.” Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but glance at the two of them while Xue Ying spoke.</p>
 <p>It would have been fine if he didn’t look, but blood almost sprayed out of Bai Xiaofei’s nostrils as soon as he took a look.</p>
 <p>For the sake of convenience, Xue Ying who wore combat clothes didn’t obstruct the view of all the things that should be revealed while those that shouldn’t be revealed weren’t completely obstructed either, and the snow white that invaded his eyes caused Bai Xiaofei’s eyes to hurt.</p>
 <p>On the other side, Lin Li who wore the student’s uniform possessed a trace of reserved beauty, and her exquisite features seemed even more beautiful.</p>
 <p>“Aiyoyo, our Little Fei Fei’s face has gone red. Come, why don’t you tell us which of us looks better?” As soon as she finished speaking, Xue Ying revealed her proud figure even more boldly, and at the same time, she didn’t forget to tighten Lin Li’s clothes, causing a pair of proud peaks that refused to be outdone to emerge.</p>
 <p>Moreover, for some unknown reason, Lin Li actually didn’t refuse Xue Ying’s actions, and she stared fixedly at Bai Xiaofei with a flushed face instead.</p>
 <p>A question that kills, to answer or not to answer?</p>
