 <p>Chapter 745: A Game Begins!</p> 
 <p>Leaving Starnet Academy, Bai Xiaofei’s party picked up speed. Their four Blackscale Horse-drawn carriages ran like flying.</p> 
 <p>“With this current speed, we should be able to get to Starflame City before dark. Although it’s just a small town, it’s good enough a place to rest,” Fang Ye informed. Compared with the other people in the carriage, he looked composed and business-like.</p> 
 <p>Because no one else in the carriage listened to a single word.</p> 
 <p>“What? Old Fang, what did you say?” asked Wu Chi, his lips all greasy after he chomped on the chicken leg in his hand.</p> 
 <p>Around him, Mo Ka, Shi Kui, and Xing Nan were fighting for the chicken legs on the plate.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, it’s nothing.” An angry Fang Ye facepalmed and shook his head. <em>I think I made a mistake in choosing this carriage…</em></p> 
 <p>“Wang Hang, where are we?”</p> 
 <p>In another carriage sat the rest of the boys. Unlike the chaotic people in the first one, each person was more stable than the last: Bai Xiaofei, Wang Hang, Chen Hui, Ming One, and Ming Two.</p> 
 <p>“We should be two hours away from Starflame City. Looks like we are resting there tonight,” Wang Hang made the same conclusion as Fang Ye.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei frowned. Pondering a little, he asked, “If I remember correctly, Starflame City is the only city that we’ll see on the way for a while, right?”</p> 
 <p>“Yes, almost everyone would stop to rest there after leaving the academy. The citizens there are very friendly to Starnet students,” replied Wang Hang with a hint of yearning. He had failed to grasp Bai Xiaofei’s point.</p> 
 <p>“Inform everyone to stop, we will camp in the wild tonight and go around Starflame City tomorrow!” said Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the rest of the people in the carriage were stunned before someone reacted.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll inform them.” Chen Hui pulled on the reins and got off to stop the carriages behind.</p> 
 <p>“Why…”</p> 
 <p>“Is that?”</p> 
 <p>The speaking habits of Ming One and Ming Two still had not changed during the years at all.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll let Wang Hang explain it to you.” Bai Xiaofei then jumped out of the carriage and summoned Huskie and Blackie.</p> 
 <p>Golden Feather also took this rare opportunity to come out. Her three children were left to the Leng triplets, which she was upset about for a long time, but it was obviously a better choice for them.</p> 
 <p>“Check the surroundings for any suspicious people,” Bai Xiaofei told Huskie and saw the latter hold out his paw. He scolded, “You little sh*t! No benefits, no work, huh?!”</p> 
 <p>In the end, however, Bai Xiaofei still took out a bag of treats…</p> 
 <p>As the puppets went to scout, the convoy had stopped. Ming One and Ming Two asked Wang Hang why they had to skip Starflame City, but Wang Hang had no idea either. And not just him, everyone else was also confused.</p> 
 <p>“We’re almost at Starflame City, why stop? Are we going to sleep in the wild?” Xu Chen was frank with her thoughts. In front of the Savage Class, she didn’t need to put on a senior-front like in the Sword of Assault.</p> 
 <p>“You are right, we are going to camp in the wild,” replied Chen Hui who had started to take the tents out of his storage ring. Four years had turned this once introverted boy into a reliable youth.</p> 
 <p>“Why?” Xu Chen was still inquisitive.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, he will explain soon.” Chen Hui smiled. He had actually learned how to keep people in suspense.</p> 
 <p>Although most were confused, Bai Xiaofei’s decision was followed. Before long, several tents were set up at the same time the puppets returned.</p> 
 <p>“Nothing out of the ordinary. There’s no one else within 30 miles,” Golden Feather reported.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei revealed a smile upon hearing this. <em>It seems that I overestimated the opponent!</em></p> 
 <p>“Now you can tell us why we are sleeping at this barren hill instead of warm beds in Starflame City,” demanded a frosty Hu Xian’er. She didn’t mean to make it hard for Bai Xiaofei, but she just couldn’t take it anymore after being ceaselessly questioned by the others. After all, Lin Li’s character made it impossible for her to question Bai Xiaofei like this.</p> 
 <p>Indeed, Hu Xian’er was very useful.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, alright, I’ll explain!” With a helpless sigh, Bai Xiaofei felt as if he had his belief in the wrong person… <em>Eek, I forgot she’s not a person…</em></p> 
 <p>“We investigated the person who came to Starnet for help. Although the person himself didn’t leave any useful information, his puppet was a rare long-distance teleportation type, but unfortunately, it was random teleportation. So, I reached the conclusion that before asking for help, he must have been locked up somewhere and escaped by luck, which is why he was so urgent. Unfortunately, he underestimated the power of the worms inside his body.”</p> 
 <p>After a brief pause, Bai Xiaofei continued,</p> 
 <p>“So from what we know, the producers of the Blood Diamonds must have a strict watch on the hosts of the worms. This is probably why there have been no investigations about this. Therefore, the people behind it must be very nervous when someone escapes.”</p> 
 <p>Many people were struck with realization.</p> 
 <p>“You mean, there may be eyes in Starflame City already?!” For once, Mo Ka grasped the point right away.</p> 
 <p>“That’s right. It’s impossible for them not to leave a tracking signal on the hosts. Therefore, it’s likely that they have put up their guard against Starnet. Moreover, after so long, they should have planted people in Starflame City to watch out for movement from our academy,” Bai Xiaofei finished his explanation. This time, everyone understood.</p> 
 <p>“Even if we go around Starflame City, we’ll eventually be discovered for acting in a big group like this, though. Are you saying we need to give up our student identity?” Duan Yiyi frowned as she was unable to think of any way they could disguise themselves.</p> 
 <p>“Not necessarily!” Fang Ye chuckled. Then, under the gaze of everyone, he took out a Fei token made for executives. “Don’t forget that I’m a senior manager of the Illusion Demon Merchant Group. There should be no problem for the personnel of a branch to go around and inspect the market, right?”</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye looked proud, but what he earned were a bunch of eye-rolls. Considering their relationship, anyone present could get a senior manager token if they wanted to.</p> 
 <p>No matter what, however, Fang Ye correctly guessed Bai Xiaofei’s idea this time. They didn’t make this trip as people of Starnet, but Illusion Demon!</p>
