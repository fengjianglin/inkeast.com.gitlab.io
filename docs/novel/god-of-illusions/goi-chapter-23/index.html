 <p>Chapter 21 – A Lawless Place!</p>
 <p>Zhang Qingshan had reacted at the first possible moment when Bai Xiaofei made a move, but, this reaction was still slower than Bai Xiaofei’s actions.</p>
 <p>At the instant those two balls exploded, a pungent stench gushed practically instantly into Zhang Qingshan’s nose.</p>
 <p>Since the day he was born, Zhang Qingshan had never imagined that when a pungent and foul smell was mixed together, it would actually be so terrifying!</p>
 <p>It was terrifying to the point that even breathing had become an indescribable torture!</p>
 <p>But, this was far from the end. Unlike Zhang Qingshan, Bai Xiaofei and the others were practically completely unaffected, and the most direct embodiment of this was the wooden stool that was approaching Zhang Qingshan’s head….</p>
 <p>Zhang Qingshan wanted to resist, and he who was an Onslaught Stream puppet master of the Mastery Rank did indeed possess the strength, but….</p>
 <p>Even a f*cking Grandmaster Rank puppet master would be unable to make a move in such an adverse environment!!!</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>A muffled sound resounded out, and this was the last shred of impression Zhang Qingshan had towards dormitory number 807.</p>
 <p>Zhang Qingshan was only the first to bear the brunt of the attack, and the seven others that he brought over didn’t fare any better than him because the gas Bai Xiaofei released had swiftly spread throughout the entire room.</p>
 <p>Huskie who had the advantage of a smaller body size had snuck to the door and closed it at the first possible moment, and he turned the entire room into a closed up gas chamber.</p>
 <p>On the other side, at this moment, Mo Ka and the others hadn’t quite understood what had happened yet, but even though they didn’t understand, they heard Bai Xiaofei say ‘attack’ extremely clearly.</p>
 <p>As the person with the strongest combat strength amongst the three of them, Wu Chi charged forward in almost the first possible moment, and then he noticed something.</p>
 <p><i>Why aren’t all these people fighting back?</i></p>
 <p><i>Why are some of them vomiting?</i></p>
 <p><i>Why is that person over there even crying?</i></p>
 <p><i>Isn’t it slightly too inhuman to beat them up when they’re like this….</i></p>
 <p>In the second that Wu Chi hesitated, he turned around to look at the other three people, and when he witnessed the scene of wooden stools and sticks flying about in unison, he put away his naïve thoughts and swung his iron fists….</p>
 <p>What was the outcome of a group of Mastery Rank and Proficient Rank puppet masters being beaten up by a martial artist without restraint?</p>
 <p>In the past, such a question might never have an answer, because such conditions would never occur.</p>
 <p>But, from today onward, the person that created the answer to this was Wu Chi….</p>
 <p>The gas dispersed completely. Bai Xiaofei’s group of three were already exhausted to the point of gasping for breath, and even Wu Chi’s forehead was slightly sweating from all the beating.</p>
 <p>Everywhere the eye could see, there wasn’t a single place in the entire room that was intact. The beds that had just been made were in a complete mess and were no different from a state of being plundered, whereas, the entire floor was covered with vomit and unknown liquids of various colors….</p>
 <p>But, it was precisely within such a disgusting environment that Bai Xiaofei’s group of four looked at each other and smiled.</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Fei, that was f*cking awesome! I’ve never beaten someone up like this!” Mo Ka spoke while he grinned foolishly from ear to ear.</p>
 <p>An Alchemist really didn’t have any chance to fight. Because, Mo Ka didn’t have the ability, and he would at most be the one that suffered a beating….</p>
 <p>“What do we do with these people?” Shi Kui leaned on the side of the bed as he asked while gasping for breath. Even though he seemed to be quite robust, yet his qualities were actually more or less like Mo Ka, and it was just that the things he did were different.</p>
 <p>“Do the members of the academy manage our dormitories?” Bai Xiaofei didn’t answer Shi Kui’s question but asked a question that seemed to be completely unrelated.</p>
 <p>“No. The senior that sent us over here earlier said that besides being responsible for teaching, then so long as no one dies, the academy won’t care about anything else.” Wu Chi’s face had a sense of loss as he spoke.</p>
 <p>It was precisely because of these words that they were utterly helpless when facing the plundering of the seniors.</p>
 <p>But, Bai Xiaofei was overjoyed when he heard this.</p>
 <p>“Plunder! Search for their jade tokens and transfer all the Starnet Stones within!” Mo Ka and the others were instantly stunned when they Bai Xiaofei finished speaking.</p>
 <p>“Isn’t this slightly bad….” In the end, the three of them were slightly afraid.</p>
 <p>“What are all of you afraid of. Could it be that they’ll let us off if we don’t do anything to them? In any case, this enmity is sowed, so why not just go all the way?” After all, Bai Xiaofei was from the Gorge of Heroes, so the idea of carrying something through no matter the consequences had entered deep into his bones.</p>
 <p>The three of them looked at each other, and then a wisp of firmness appeared in their eyes at the same time.</p>
 <p>In the next moment, the three of them had leaped up and disregarded whether this group of people on the ground were dirty or not as they directly activated their search mode.</p>
 <p>After a short while, an entire eight jade tokens lay before Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“Two per person, and how much you get depends on your luck. All of you can choose first.” This moment wasn’t the time to be greedy, and instead of being happy alone, why not allow everyone to be happy. Not to mention, even if all the Starnet Stones these people possessed were added together, it might not be as much as what Bai Xiaofei possessed.</p>
 <p>But, Mo Ka and the others were extremely excited.</p>
 <p>With their results during the entrance test, any normal person would have absolutely obtained more Starnet Stones than them!</p>
 <p>Mo Ka and the other gulped down a mouthful of saliva before taking away the jade token they felt was the wealthiest. But, no one touched the jade token that belonged to Zhang Qingshan.</p>
 <p>There was no need to think about it, it would absolutely possess the most Starnet Stones. But, all three of them weren’t stupid. It wouldn’t be right for anyone but Bai Xiaofei to take it.</p>
 <p>After he transferred the Starnet Stones within the remaining two jade tokens into his own jade token, Bai Xiaofei revealed a satisfied smile.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t that his gains were great as they only numbered 34 Starnet Stones, and what really caused Bai Xiaofei to be satisfied was the reactions of Mo Ka and the others.</p>
 <p><i>I was right to take these three as ‘little brothers’!</i></p>
 <p>“Wu Chi, find a rope and tie all of them together.”</p>
 <p>After he obtained some benefits, Wu Chi’s movements became slightly faster. Now, Bai Xiaofei’s words had already been given top priority to be carried out on his list.</p>
 <p>Once Wu Chi brought the rope back and under their ‘all-out effort’ of tying, Zhang Qingshan’s group of eight had quickly become into eight wrapped dumplings.</p>
 <p>“Let them smell this.” Bai Xiaofei tossed a small porcelain jar to Mo Ka as he spoke, and the pungent smell that came out from it when he opened it out caused Mo Ka to be unable to help but frown.</p>
 <p><i>Am I the Alchemist or is he? Why does he have more strange and exotic things than me…. </i>As he muttered in his heard, Mo Ka quickly suffocated Zhang Qingshan and the others awake from their fainted states.</p>
 <p>The sounds of coughing rose and fell as it reverberated within this room that contained a mix of various smells, and the eight people that gradually recovered their consciousness had completely lost the spirited feeling they revealed at the very beginning.</p>
 <p>“Kid….’ Zhang Qingshan hadn’t finished speaking when Bai Xiaofei swung a slap at him.</p>
 <p>“What did you call me?” As he glared coldly at Zhang Qingshan, Bai Xiaofei was like a completely different person than before.</p>
 <p>“Do you know my Big Brother….”</p>
 <p>Slap!</p>
 <p>Another slap was swung over, and Bai Xiaofei utterly didn’t have the intention to listen to Zhang Qingshan speak.</p>
 <p>“Let me tell….”</p>
 <p>Slap!</p>
 <p>Three consecutive slaps had finally struck Zhang Qingshan sober, and he realized that the person before him was a person that couldn’t be reasoned with at all.</p>
 <p>Zhang Qingshan took a deep breath and completely let go of his attitude.</p>
 <p>“Big Brother, I was wrong. Please let us go.”</p>
