 <p>Chapter 458: Six Days; Don’t Tell Him…</p> 
 <p>Seeing Bai Xiaofei come out of his room, the eyes of the group of people waiting anxiously outside lit up at the same time, pleasant surprise written on their faces.</p> 
 <p>However, none of the Thunderstorm Bandits were there. They knew for sure that he would appear, but they had no desire to see it. They knew what the price was, and for them, it was too heavy…</p> 
 <p>After some chatting, the crowd dispersed. Bai Ye watched Nie Qing and Bai Xiaofei’s intimate actions and could not calm down for a long time.</p> 
 <p>However, he accepted it. Without Nie Qing, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t have survived. Although he didn’t know what she had done, he knew that she must have paid a high price. Otherwise, He Rushi would have mentioned that there was a solution from the beginning.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, when Bai Xiaofei proposed to stay for a few more days, Bai Ye made no objections.</p> 
 <p>In the next six days, Bai Xiaofei and Nie Qing hardly slept a wink. They traveled everywhere during the day and went crazy in bed over and over again at night.</p> 
 <p>After touring Nabu, they visited the surrounding cities. In just six days, they enjoyed an eventful life that equaled months of others. Bai Xiaofei was fortunately to have such a physique and six days without rest was nothing for him. As for Nie Qing, the effect of the Final Radiance allowed her to go on without resting at all…</p> 
 <p>However, in this madness, Bai Xiaofei still felt that something was off. On the sixth night, instead of going crazy in bed as usual, they sat quietly on the roof, watching the stars in the sky and snuggling together.</p> 
 <p>“Are you hiding something from me?” Bai Xiaofei felt a weight pressing on his heart as he slowly voiced this question. He wanted an honest answer, but he was a bit scared.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, but you already know that I’m hiding it. How can I tell you then?” With a smile, Nie Qing rendered Bai Xiaofei speechless. Not giving him a chance to ask more questions, she looked at the night sky yearningly. “Say, do you think people will become stars in the sky?”</p> 
 <p>“People are people, how can they become stars?” As if to retaliate, Bai Xiaofei gave an irritatingly unromantic answer, but before Nie Qing could get angry, he barely sidestepped the risk with a sudden turn of words. “Although we can’t become stars, our hearts can turn into something more eternal than the stars. Even if the stars fall, some things will not dissipate.”</p> 
 <p>Nie Qing, who was already on the verge of an outburst, instantly had a smile on her face. “Smart mouth.” With a snort, she tightened her grip around Bai Xiaofei’s arm.</p> 
 <p>“What if one day, you can’t find me?” Silent for half a day, Nie Qing asked another silly question. At the same time, she looked at Bai Xiaofei with a hint of expectation, but she herself didn’t know what she was looking forward to…</p> 
 <p>“Isn’t that simple? Then I will keep looking until I find you, and teach you a good lesson!” said Bai Xiaofei ‘maliciously,’ and Nie Qing gave him an annoyed look.</p> 
 <p>“Why would you want to teach me a lesson?!”</p> 
 <p>“You want to hide from me, why would I not teach you a lesson? If you don’t learn to behave, who knows where you will run off to next time.” He knuckled her forehead, earning an exaggerated eye-roll.</p> 
 <p>“Hum! You dare hit me! I’ll run and hide from you! I’ll hide from you for the rest of my life. If you want to look, then you just keep looking! When you do, you’ll already become a white-haired old man!” Seemingly very angry, Nie Qing let go of Bai Xiaofei’s arm and turned around.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, that won’t happen,” said Bai Xiaofei nonchalantly as he remained seated where he was. Nie Qing couldn’t help but turn back with a puzzled look.</p> 
 <p>“Why?”</p> 
 <p>“Because your man is ambitious. Before I become an old man with white hair, I will have an intelligence network all over this continent. When that time comes, I’ll find you even if you hide in the deep mountains!” Bai Xiaofei declared seriously as if it had already come true.</p> 
 <p>“Tch, I don’t believe it.” Nie Qing expressed her disdain with another snort. “Who can’t talk big? I have seen many similar people but have never seen any of them take practical actions. Your words don’t cost you a thing.”</p> 
 <p>This time, Bai Xiaofei didn’t refute and only revealed a meaningful smile.</p> 
 <p>“That’s actually true. Since my words aren’t reliable, I can only use my second method,” saying this, the smile on his face grew mysterious.</p> 
 <p>“What method?” Nie Qing gulped. She had been pulled into Bai Xiaofei’s pace.</p> 
 <p>“Something unforgettable that engraves me into you!” Bai Xiaofei instantly became a pervy wolf and jumped directly towards Nie Qing.</p> 
 <p>“Ah! No! We’re outside!” Nie Qing instinctively yelped. However, her attitude was ambiguous, fanning the flames in Bai Xiaofei’s heart.</p> 
 <p>“Blackie is on the lookout, there is no one around!” said Bai Xiaofei, who had it all planned from the start.</p> 
 <p>These words convinced Nie Qing. Gradually, her ambiguous manner turned into compliance and catering…</p> 
 <p>It was like dry wood ignited by a fire, only that the area that it took place was a little too bold and open. Undeniably, Bai Xiaofei carried out his words. This experience was really unforgettable!</p> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei woke up again, he was already in his room. Last night, it was Nie Qing who won the ‘battle.’ For some reason, she who was easily bullied had suddenly become a different person…</p> 
 <p>Sure enough, there were no bulls that didn’t get tired from plowing for too long, only land that could never be cultivated enough<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>!</p> 
 <p>“So punctual?” Bai Xiaofei sighed as he looked at the empty space next to him. Although he already grasped every second, he didn’t expect six days to pass so fast…</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Nie Qing finally returned to the headquarters of the Thunderstorm Bandits after six crazy days, and saw the rest of the group who had been so idle that mushrooms could have grown on them.</p> 
 <p>“I have one last request. You will promise me this, right?” asked Nie Qing slowly and seriously.</p> 
 <p>“If you mean for us to keep your matter a secret from him, you can rest assured.” His face filled with grief, Fang Lei didn’t embarrass Nie Qing in the end.</p> 
 <p>“That’s right. If you can, please never, never ever tell him what happened…”</p>
