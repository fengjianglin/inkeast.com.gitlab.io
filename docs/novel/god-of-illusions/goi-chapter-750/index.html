 <p>Chapter 750: Sneaking in!</p> 
 <p>As night fell, Starflame City also grew quiet. However, on that day there was a man who refused to be quiet.</p> 
 <p>Liu Heng, after a big fight with Old Song due to their disagreement on the matter with Bai Xiaofei, went out drinking alone as what had happened during the day kept replaying in his mind.</p> 
 <p>The people they sent to check on Bai Xiaofei’s background would take at least six or seven days to report back, but although there was no result yet, the more Liu Heng thought about it, the more he felt that there was something wrong with Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p><em>How can a person have no openings? Besides, is there really such a coincidence in this world?!</em></p> 
 <p>In the end, Liu Heng shook his head. In any case, he had to be careful. If both of them failed to maintain a clear head, their mission on Starnet this time might be ruined. </p> 
 <p>Reaching this conclusion, Liu Heng put down his cup as well as a dozen copper coins on the table and left.</p> 
 <p>Little did Lu Heng know how unfriendly this night would be.</p> 
 <p>He had just walked out of the alley when a group of masked people suddenly jumped out. As a Master Rank puppet master, Liu Heng instinctively summoned his puppet, but he was too slow.</p> 
 <p>A figure appeared behind him and knocked him unconscious.</p> 
 <p>“Want to fight back? In your dreams.” The leader of the masked group kicked Liu Heng before waving his hand.</p> 
 <p>The underlings instantly tied Liu Heng up before putting him into a sack. A while later, they disappeared into the night, as if they had never been there at all.</p> 
 <p>After some time, Liu Heng slowly woke up to find his origin energy and body being restrained by special handcuffs and chains. The surroundings were pitch-black with only a dim light from far away. Between Liu Heng and the light was a tall iron fence.</p> 
 <p>At that moment, Liu Heng confirmed that there was definitely something wrong with Bai Xiaofei. Unfortunately, he could not get the news out…</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, another ‘Liu Heng’ was heading to a certain location found by Fang Ye. The expression on his face kept changing until he gradually matched Liu Heng’s vibe.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Liu, you are back. Brother Song has been waiting for you,” greeted the underling guarding the entrance respectfully as his eyes fell upon the tag on Liu Heng’s waist.</p> 
 <p>After confirming Liu Heng’s identity, the guard stepped aside.</p> 
 <p>“Keep a watchful eye. There may be a situation recently. If there’s a problem, we won’t be able to afford the consequences.” Mimicking Liu Heng’s tone of voice, Bai Xiaofei coldly warned the guard, who assented with a fawning smile, before adding, “Send someone to tidy up my room, I want to rest. By the way, tell Old Song that I have something to discuss with him tomorrow.”</p> 
 <p>To pretend to be Liu Heng, Bai Xiaofei especially drank a whole lot of wine and was now reeking of alcohol, which made the underling panic. Who knew what a drunk boss would do?</p> 
 <p>Another underling was called over to clean Liu Heng’s room. Following him, Bai Xiaofei successfully passed the problem of not knowing where his room was. After the underling finished cleaning up and left, Bai Xiaofei called out Blackie.</p> 
 <p>“Take a good look at this place and tell me if there’s anything special.”</p> 
 <p>Blackie vanished upon the order. The moment she did, the door was flung open.</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother Liu, I’ve come to apologize.” Donning a smile, Old Song put his arm around Bai Xiaofei’s shoulder.</p> 
 <p>“I was wrong too, for being too sensitive.” Bai Xiaofei sighed, his face forlorn. After a little pause, he probed, “But our mission is too special. If anything goes wrong, the two of us are finished.”</p> 
 <p>The reaction he got from Old Song pleased him.</p> 
 <p>“My brother, you can rest easy. We already sent people to check on him. After that, there’s nothing left to worry about.” Old Song laughed ingratiatingly.</p> 
 <p>“I hope, but are you really going to contact above?” asked Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Old Song pondered before replying, “If there is no problem with his background, I will. After all, this level of cooperation is impossible to handle by us two alone. Moreover, if we really make it happen, we won’t have to worry about money for the rest of our lives!” The more Old Song said, the more excited he became. He assessed that the benefits outweighed the risks.</p> 
 <p>“Then let’s wait for the results. I hope it will be in our favor,” Bai Xiaofei concluded and lay down on the bed. “I’m tired. Let’s talk tomorrow if there’s anything else. I’ll just leave this matter to you.”</p> 
 <p>With that, Bai Xiaofei closed his eyes. Before long, his breathing grew even.</p> 
 <p>Bored by himself, Old Song got up and left. When he was out the door, his eyes flashed with a cruel glint. <em>Some things are better for just one person than two!</em></p> 
 <p>Not long after Old Song left, Blackie returned after checking the entire inn. She didn’t find any valuable information aside from the location where Blood Diamonds were stored. As Bai Xiaofei thought, the purpose of the other party was to monitor Starnet. It was impossible for them to bring anything more important.</p> 
 <p>“Looks like there’s no need to stay here any longer. Must quicken the pace,” Bai Xiaofei mumbled before closing his eyes again.</p> 
 <p>However, even quickening the pace had to wait…</p> 
 <p>Just like that, Bai Xiaofei stayed in the inn with Old Song for a week. During this period, Bai Sicheng announced he was sick and refused visitors, while Hu Xian’er’s group thoroughly implemented his plan: their only mission to eat, drink, and have fun around the city.</p> 
 <p>Their actions gradually dispelled Old Song’s doubts about them, and Bai Xiaofei’s version of Liu Heng naturally would not say anything bad about himself, so the cooperation was basically a sure thing. What they waited for at the moment was the people that had been sent out to investigate them.</p> 
 <p>Although Fang Ye had informed Feng Wuhen to create a suitable identity for them, it was hard to tell if the opponents would be able to verify their ‘authenticity.’ Therefore, Bai Xiaofei had been paying attention every day for those investigators’ return.</p> 
 <p>That moment finally came, and it was also on that day that Qin San, the city guard that Bai Xiaofei had bribed, delivered a pleasant surprise. After learning that Old Song’s people were from a business group, Qin San detained them with the reason that there was a problem with their identity.</p> 
 <p>To this, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but smile. Who would have thought that such an insignificant profiteer would end up being of help?</p>
