 <p>Chapter 743: Persuading!</p> 
 <p>“You snuck out?” Lei Shan cared not about how much information Bai Xiaofei had found, but what he did.</p> 
 <p>“Gramps, you know full well that I’ve been hanging around in the academy every day, and Huskie can’t maintain transformation for that long.” Bai Xiaofei declared his innocence with a shrug.</p> 
 <p>“Then how did you find out all that?!” Lei Shan’s question was also what everyone in the room was curious about.</p> 
 <p>“You want to know?” Bai Xiaofei grinned with an expression that asked for a beating.</p> 
 <p>“Smelly brat, confess now if you don’t want to be struck into a pile of ashes!” Lei Shan stood up and slammed the table. He had lost patience.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei was fearless. He sat down, cupping his chin with his palms, and looked at Lei Shan quietly before finally stating his condition, “Let me out, or I won’t tell you! This matter cannot be handed over to anyone except me!”</p> 
 <p>Lei Shan had expected this. After staring at Bai Xiaofei for half a day, he sighed.</p> 
 <p>“Smelly boy, you should know why I don’t want to let you go. In fact, you are really the best option,” Lei Shan said helplessly as he sat down. As the principal of Starnet, he enjoyed the respect of the vast majority of people on the continent, but when serious matters happened, he discovered that he was no longer what he had been back then.</p> 
 <p>Starnet shackled his footsteps, but as an academy, there were very few things it could actually do. Just like now, Lei Shan wanted badly to handle the Blood Diamond matter, but the intelligence system he had even lost to Bai Xiaofei who had not taken one step out.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, gramps, I cherish my life very much. Even an Emperor Rank magical beast couldn’t kill me. Is there anything more dangerous than that?” Bai Xiaofei never stopped smiling. For him, being idle was worse than death…</p> 
 <p>“Your gut should tell you already, this matter is different from any previous one.”</p> 
 <p>Lei Shan still hadn’t given up on dissuading Bai Xiaofei, but it was useless. Bai Xiaofei wouldn’t be Bai Xiaofei if he let it be.</p> 
 <p>“Gramps, that man turned into a pile of Blood Diamonds right before my eyes. Do you know the expression on his face when he begged for help? If I don’t investigate this, I’m afraid I won’t be able to sleep well for the rest of my life.” Bai Xiaofei grew solemn as these words came from the bottom of his heart.</p> 
 <p>There was no way to describe the feeling of watching a person die while begging for help.</p> 
 <p>After a long silence, Lei Shan took a deep breath. “I can let you go, but only after you make a detailed plan!” he conceded. Believing was his only option!</p> 
 <p>As soon as Lei Shan finished, the lonely expression on Bai Xiaofei’s face instantly vanished and his whole aura grew vibrant!</p> 
 <p>“Easy peasy!”</p> 
 <p>Jumping up from his chair, Bai Xiaofei took out a Recording Eyeball, which projected all of the information he had on the Blood Diamond matter. What he had just told everyone was only the tip of the iceberg out of his two weeks’ investigation.</p> 
 <p>“I established a merchant group outside the academy. Although it’s not well-known yet, its special operation method provides me with a huge intelligence network. During the past half month, they put aside all of their work to investigate and this is what they found.”</p> 
 <p>Listening to Bai Xiaofei while reading the intel, everyone gulped. They thought they already regarded Bai Xiaofei highly, but he proved them wrong every time with practical action!</p> 
 <p>“Blood Diamond is not an ore. There is no such mineral ore on the continent nor any news of such discoveries, so it can only be artificial. Then, such a large supply would suggest a huge production system, and that system must be close to the source of ‘raw materials.’”</p> 
 <p>Along with Bai Xiaofei’s explanation, the projection changed again and again until it finally locked onto a deserted place.</p> 
 <p>Windless Zone!</p> 
 <p>“Windless Zone, one of the six forbidden areas in the continent, is desolate and hidden enough to provide a wide enough activity space. On top of that, it’s near the largest slave-trading market on the northern border. If the raw materials for Blood Diamonds are really humans, then this area is the best choice!” Bai Xiaofei looked at Lei Shan. “It will be my first stop.”</p> 
 <p>The room fell silent and all eyes fell on Lei Shan, waiting for a word from him.</p> 
 <p>“You call this a complete plan? You only know where the people… no, it’s still just a conjecture even. Moreover, the Windless Zone is extremely dangerous. You really think you alone are that capable?” Lei Shan fired off, obviously trying to make it difficult for Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t say I was going alone.” Ignoring most of the old man’s questions, Bai Xiaofei picked the only one he could immediately answer to steer the subject away.</p> 
 <p>“What do you mean?” Lei Shan was stunned.</p> 
 <p>“I take this as a graduation task, and I remember that there is no limit to the number of participants in a graduation task above rank S, so I’m bringing some friends with me,” replied Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Lei Shan’s expression relaxed in relief. Although Bai Xiaofei was a trouble-maker, everyone somewhat figured him out after the previous events. As long as he was not alone, he would have scruples, and when he did, considering his ability, the safety rate would soar!</p> 
 <p>“When are you setting out?” Lei Shan finally said what Bai Xiaofei wanted to hear.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, Luo Xi beamed in delight. <em>So I made the right suggestion after all!</em></p> 
 <p>“I’m gathering people now. We’ll leave tonight,” Bai Xiaofei speedily replied. Everything was already in place, all that he had lacked was only a nod from Lei Shan.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, you can mobilize the academy’s resources at will, but you must ensure to report your safety to me every once in a while!” Lei Shan voiced his final demand.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei naturally would not object. <em>Report? No problem, but the validity? Who knows?</em></p> 
 <p>After reassuring Lei Shan, Bai Xiaofei ran out with a grin. “I won’t bother you further, enjoy the food! I promise to come back as soon as possible, see you then!”</p>
