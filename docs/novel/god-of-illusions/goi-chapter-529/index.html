 <p>Chapter 529: Completely Breaking off…</p> 
 <p>“Or? Why else do you think I am here?” Qin Lingyan’s voice grew even colder at Bai Xiaofei’s question. Obviously, his reaction had displeased her.</p> 
 <p>Heaving a long sigh in his heart, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t bring himself to refute her with the guilt he was feeling. Owing an emotional debt to a girl was definitely the scariest!</p> 
 <p>“About what happened…”</p> 
 <p>“Don’t mention it ever again. I did everything of my own free will. I don’t need you to repay it. Now I just want to know what you and Ling Tianxia talked about and when will Chu Yue be avenged!” Qin Lingyan interrupted Bai Xiaofei with an utterly resolute expression.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was completely caught off guard by her defensive response. He who was used to having his way with women had formed a weak point: he didn’t take well to setbacks.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, this kind of blow shocked him for half a day.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t understand what I said? Or did you already put what happened in Ancient Yue behind you after you returned to your gentle land of beauties?” Her words triggered Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>It was absolutely impossible that he could put it behind him! Bai Xiaofei was the type that sought revenge for the smallest grievance, not to mention over a friend’s death! And frankly, he blamed himself the most for Chu Yue’s death.</p> 
 <p>“Even if I forget my name, I will never forget Senior Chu Yue!” His eyes were firm as he buried the hint of guilt he felt towards Qin Lingyan in his heart.</p> 
 <p>“It’s best that you don’t. Now tell me about what you got from Ling Tianxia!” With a sneer, Qin Lingyan went back to the original topic. At her demand, Bai Xiaofei looked begrudging…</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t succeed. I thought I could pry out something, but the result is completely different from what I imagined. I was even persuaded a little…” There was shame in his voice as he hung his head.</p> 
 <p>This was the first time Qin Lingyan saw him like this, but she didn’t seem very surprised.</p> 
 <p>“You were persuaded? About what?” She dubiously frowned.</p> 
 <p>“Ling Tianxia said that he had no idea about the event in Ancient Yue and the masterminds are likely to be some other people in the Globe Merchant Group who have opposing viewpoints to him.”</p> 
 <p>“Impossible!” Qin Lingyan shouted emotionally as soon as Bai Xiaofei finished speaking.</p> 
 <p>“Please calm down. In fact, I thought so too at first, but I tested him from all aspects. He didn’t reveal any flaws. The character he displayed and also the old man’s reaction are enough to confirm that he was telling the truth,” Bai Xiaofei explained before there was an abrupt turn, “But I’m still maintaining my suspicion that he is the real mastermind, so I will continue to verify. I may be persuaded, but it does not mean that I have given up on proving otherwise.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Qin Lingyan calmed down, but the distrust that appeared on her face was in stark contrast to her seemingly calm demeanour. This time, Bai Xiaofei really let her down.</p> 
 <p>“I have never known Ling Tianxia personally so I don’t know his character enough to make any judgments, but I have heard about him.”</p> 
 <p>Qin Lingyan paused and her expression grew solemn.</p> 
 <p>“My father told me that he had dealings with all the presidents of the nine major merchant groups, and the most capable of them is Ling Tianxia. Others may not be able to fully control their groups, but the probability of this happening to Ling Tianxia is close to zero!”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Bai Xiaofei heard this, his eyes lit up. This was what he needed to hear most at the moment. In fact, his fear was that Ling Tianxia was really the person he appeared to be today because that would mean their revenge for Chu Yue might never happen. But if Qin Lingyan’s information was accurate, then Ling Tianxia was deliberately hiding something, and once they uncovered his secret, their opportunity to avenge Chu Yue would be around the corner!</p> 
 <p>“Your father?” Bai Xiaofei inquired in delight.</p> 
 <p>“You don’t have to doubt the validity of his words. Although he is an irritating person, he doesn’t lie to me and his identity does not allow him to lie anyway.” There was a mix of pride and disgust in her voice. She felt complicated when it came to her father.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, I will consider this carefully!” Qin Lingyan’s guarantee strengthened Bai Xiaofei’s confidence, also strengthening his idea of testing Ling Tianxia again.</p> 
 <p>“What I want is not your consideration. If you can’t solve this, just tell me straight, and I will avenge Chu Yue in my own way!” Qin Lingyan stared at Bai Xiaofei with a hint of anger. His seemingly hesitant attitude disappointed her.</p> 
 <p>“You misunderstand me. Ling Tianxia is more difficult than anyone we have dealt with before. Going against him with my current strength and influence is tantamount to throwing an egg at a boulder. Or are you only satisfied if you see me die?” Bai Xiaofei didn’t choose his words wisely in his panic and sounded like he wanted to start a quarrel.</p> 
 <p>“I can afford to wait, but can Chu Yue? I’m afraid that his bones will already be stone cold when you finally qualify to confront Ling Tianxia!” A quarrel was sparked as expected as Qin Lingyan’s voice instantly raised several pitches.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s both calm down, okay? It doesn’t make any sense for us to argue. I’d rather we used this time to make good preparations.” Bai Xiaofei tried to regain control of his emotions and suppress the urge to meet force with force. It was no good for both of them if that happened.</p> 
 <p>“You go do your so-called preparations, I will deal with this in my own way!” With a cold snort, Qin Lingyan turned to leave, but Bai Xiaofei pulled her back by the arm.</p> 
 <p>“What do you want, then?! Your father is but an official of the Violethorn Empire. Even the emperor of Violethorn has to give Ling Tianxia face. What ‘way’ do you have that can deal with him?!” shouted Bai Xiaofei as he lost control of his emotions.</p> 
 <p>Qin Lingyan suddenly seemed like she had been slapped. She turned to look at him, her eyes reddened.</p> 
 <p>“You investigated me?!”</p> 
 <p>In the face of her question, Bai Xiaofei froze.</p> 
 <p>Any person would consider being secretly investigated by others a taboo because it would imply distrust. Qin Lingyan couldn’t care less if other people didn’t trust her, but that did not include Bai Xiaofei…</p> 
 <p>“I don’t…”</p> 
 <p>“Enough!” Qin Lingyan broke free from his grasp as she cut him off. “Bai Xiaofei, from today on, I will pretend that I have never known you! Don’t you come to find me either! We will never see each other again!”</p> 
 <p>Dropping those words, Qin Lingyan ran away. Bai Xiaofei instinctively chased after her but he stopped in the end.</p> 
 <p>He couldn’t think of any reason to keep her…</p>
