 <p>Chapter 954: Opportunity!</p> 
 <p>“He died! In the most miserable way possible!!” Ye Tong fearlessly yelled back at Tan Xin.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin vanished the next second. Suddenly the whole room shook and the ground cracked. From the cracks, stone arms reached out.</p> 
 <p>“Down!” shouted Ye Tong as colorless ripples spread from her. All the energy fluctuations in the area instantly calmed and even the cracked ground was restored.</p> 
 <p>Unlike others, Ye Tong not only acquired the ability to seal energy but had also completely integrated it into her own puppet. In other words, no one could use energy around her!</p> 
 <p>“Then I shall see how much energy you have!” Tan Xin's voice echoed, followed by all sorts of elemental attacks condensing from all directions and aiming at Ye Tong.</p> 
 <p>“Petty tricks!” said Ye Tong disdainfully. Her hands waved and all the attacks turned into nothingness before they could approach her. However, this did not affect Tan Xin's persistence.</p> 
 <p>Anywhere else, Tan Xin would have been a big boss with her power, but in the Empire of Moonlight, she was almost helpless. And this was already her making the first move, or else she wouldn’t even have the chance to attack at all.</p> 
 <p>Just like this, one bombarded and one defended for nearly two minutes. When both of them were exhausted, Ye Xi finally stepped out.</p> 
 <p>“Why don’t you two keep going now?” she mocked in an indifferent tone, then looked at Ye Tong. “Speak, where is Fickle Bai? Don't try to lie to me, I know you can never bring yourself to be so cruel as to kill somebody. Besides, I remember that you’ve been detaining many men here, so why can’t I see any now?”</p> 
 <p>Thus, Ye Tong was completely exposed. Although she was an extremist, she had never been a murderer. At worst, she had only tortured the prisoners until they yielded.</p> 
 <p>Upon the reminder of what had just happened, Ye Tong exploded in rage. “I will kill that bastard!!”</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Tan Xin instantly understood. She burst out laughing. “You were played by him, weren’t you? I advise you to let it slide. Lil’ Bai must have predicted every little reaction you have now. If you look for him again, you will end up even worse.” Knowing that Bai Xiaofei was fine, her mood had taken a U-turn.</p> 
 <p>“I’m going to find him in the capital as well, so you can go back with me,” said Ye Xi as she ignored Ye Tong's exasperation.</p> 
 <p>“Humph, what makes you think you can order me around?! I will go back to the capital, but definitely not with you!” Ye Tong turned to leave, but she had only taken two steps before her legs gave out. The fight with Tan Xin had exhausted her. If it weren’t that she had stubbornly put on a strong front, she would have collapsed even earlier.</p> 
 <p>Ye Xi quickly reached out and held Ye Xi, only to discover that the latter had fainted. She shook her head helplessly.</p> 
 <p>“So you have a story behind you, huh? You hid it deep enough,” Tan Xin commented. Along the way, she couldn’t see any royal bearing from Ye Xi at all. If Ye Tong hadn't mentioned it, she probably would only know after they arrived at the capital.</p> 
 <p>“I am no different from any ordinary Moonlight person. Just pretend like you haven’t heard anything. I’m but a defeated general,” replied Ye Xi with a hint of sorrow in her eyes.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin understood the look in Ye Xi’s eyes. She said with a smile. “You can never win in wars. What's more, you haven't lost completely, have you? Otherwise, Moonlight wouldn’t be in the mood to organize a servant contest.”</p> 
 <p>Ye Xi was stunned to hear this. Then, a slight smile bloomed on her face.</p> 
 <p>“Maybe, but in any case, losing is losing, which is a fact that I can accept,” she said and carried Ye Tong on her back, then looked into the distance. “Let's go. I hope my efforts won’t go to waste this time. He won’t run, will he?”</p> 
 <p>“Don't worry, if he dares to run, I will castrate him!” declared Tan Xin savagely.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei, who was far away, suddenly sneezed loudly.</p> 
 <p>“Someone must be missing me.” He smugly wiped his nose, then looked at the hundred-odd men he had released. “Now, you have two options.”</p> 
 <p>“The first option: leave this place. However, I know that you know you have a high probability of being caught and becoming someone’s servant again. If you are unlucky enough, you will be detained in a place similar to the one we’ve just escaped from and tragically, your lives will be wasted there.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the men instantly revealed fearful expressions before looking expectantly at Bai Xiaofei, waiting for the second option.</p> 
 <p>“The second option: follow me and make a career for yourselves! So that we men can stand tall in Moonlight. And not only you, but even your children can also raise their heads instead of having to be a woman’s belonging!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s voice filled with passion immediately touched the hearts of the listeners. Soon, however, their fear took over as they thought of all kinds of problems.</p> 
 <p>“Uh, about that… How do we make a career?” someone weakly asked.</p> 
 <p>This question instantly became the main concern of the men, and it was also the last thing that Bai Xiaofei wanted to hear.</p> 
 <p>“We go to the border! That’s the only place where we can turn the tables!” Bai Xiaofei had to say it despite his extreme unwillingness. Things forcibly done would never go right, especially in a place like the battlefield. Unless clear and thorough preparations were made, they’d either die or drag down everyone else with them.</p> 
 <p>Upon Bai Xiaofei’s reply, the eager men suddenly quieted down. To most of them, the border was not an opportunity to start a career, but a place to die.</p> 
 <p><em>A place where even our women can’t handle, what can we even do?</em></p> 
 <p>This kind of idea was strange, but it was a reality for Moonlight.</p> 
 <p>“I don't insist, but I guarantee that those who go with me will never regret it!” Bai Xiaofei looked seriously at the men in front of him. “Alright, now make your choice!”</p>
