 <p><span style>After an entire 16 barrels of water was poured into the medicinal cauldron, the enormous medicinal cauldron was on the verge of being filled to the brim, whereas, Xue Ying called over the others once more and withdrew a large pile of the medicinal materials according to a certain ration, and then she mixed all of them into the medicinal cauldron.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once again, everyone was muddled.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She wants to refine medicine?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But, do people use so much water when refining medicine? Trying a new method of refining medicine?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Various guesses floated up into the minds of everyone, but not a single one of their thoughts conformed to Xue Ying’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mo Ka, it’s time for you to show off. Boil the water!” Xue Ying spoke casually yet Mo Ka’s small eyes were shocked to the point of almost jumping out of their sockets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boil?! By myself?!” Mo Ka seemed to have heard the most absurd request in this world. After all, medicinal cauldron puppets couldn’t be heated up with flames, and if one wanted to boil this cauldron full of water, the alchemist must do it with Origin Energy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, not to mention boiling such a full cauldron of water, even heating it up could squeeze Mo Ka dry!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, your Origin Energy will be sufficient.” Xue Ying withdrew the Starnet Stones she gathered from the others, and she set up a simple formation before the medicinal cauldron.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“An Origin Gathering Formation. Residing within it will allow the speed of your Origin Energy’s recovery to increase. Moreover, the Origin Energy within the Starnet Stones would gush into your body without end, so you only have to do a single thing, continue supplying Origin Energy to the medicinal cauldron.” Xue Ying’s tone was rather relaxed, yet it didn’t cause Mo Ka’s expression to turn for the better in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this way, he was equivalent to an Origin Energy transfer station. But, even if the Origin Energy within Starnet Stones was extremely gentle, there had never been anyone in history that had utilized it like a battery because the feeling of Origin Energy circulating caused by it was rather uncomfortable….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Is there a problem? If there is a problem, then be frank.” Xue Ying’s tone instantly turned cold, and the manner she spoke entirely seemed as if she would kill him if he dared to say there was a problem….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Ka who wanted to cry yet had no tears didn’t dare refuse at all, and he took heavy footsteps to walk to the center of the Origin Gathering Formation before sitting down slowly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If I die, then so be it!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>With the resolution that he was going to meet certain death, Mo Ka started the long process of boiling water….</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Due to our finances being limited, there are some things which all of you must deal with yourselves.” After she put Mo Ka aside, Xue Ying called everyone else over before starting to distribute a new assignment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First is the problem of food. Because the strength of your training will be extremely great, your requirements towards food will be very great. But, we didn’t have extra money to buy ingredients to cook with. Fortunately, this is the Infinite Mountain Range, so there are numerous ingredients here.” Xue Ying spoke as if nothing had happened, and the hearts of everyone rose to their throats.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So, she wants us to go hunting?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hunting in the Infinite Mountain Range. Such thoughts are really exciting…. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Ka’s earlier expression of wanting to cry but having no tears crawled up the faces of every single one of them, and only Lin Li who hadn’t reacted to what had happened carried a puzzled expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Next is the problem of safety. Even though I’ve scattered a large amount of medicinal powder that drives off wild beasts, there will always be a few ignorant beasts that disregard it. Coupled with the place we currently reside at is slightly special, so, there must be people on guard while all of you rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Simply speaking, it was a matter of whether they wanted to live or not….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, it was extremely obvious that Xue Ying had entirely no intention of interfering, and they could only rely on themselves….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The final and most important thing is the content of your training.” Xue Ying paused for a moment, causing the group of people to instantly concentrate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll bring all of you back to the academy to run around the square every single afternoon, and during the remaining time, all of you only have a single assignment, complete the assignments on the Starnet Rankings!” As soon as these words were spoken, everyone was stunned on the spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not to mention how crazy it was to run circles around the square every day. Under normal circumstances, the assignments of the Starnet Rankings were restricted to being taken by students of the first year and above. Moreover, assignments in the Infinite Mountain Range were normally of mid difficulty or above, and only second year students would choose these assignments. But, they were only new students….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, I’ve already notified the principal, and all of you have already been given temporary authority to take assignments. Moreover, the Starnet Stones and points from completing the assignment will be distributed as normal.” Xue Ying’s explanations didn’t cause all of them to feel at ease because they didn’t care about this at all!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Moreover, Teacher, are you sure you didn’t decide on this purely for the sake of making us earn Starnet Stones?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone muttered in their hearts yet none of them dared to speak it out. Presently, they were like a dragonfly in Xue Ying’s hand, and she could as she pleased with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But, Big Sister Xue, our bodies won’t be able to endure this….” Zhu Nuo spoke with a weak tone because there was utterly no need for her to go do assignments as merely running around the square could make her collapse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, with me here, all of your bodies will be fine!” Xue Ying looked at Mo Ka who was boiling water as she spoke, and a trace of anticipation appeared in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Sister Xue, I have a question.” Bai Xiaofei who was in the crowd raised his hand abruptly while his face was covered in bewilderment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speak. But, I won’t answer useless questions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Sister Xue, you’ve only been a teacher for a short time, right? How did you sum up this method of training that’s quite different from the entire Academy?” After he summed up all the contents of Xue Ying’s teaching from the beginning until now, Bai Xiaofei noticed that Xue Ying had always possessed a very strong purpose, and it felt as if this sort of method of training had already been inscribed into her mind since a long time ago and she wasn’t using them to carry out experiments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what Bai Xiaofei never expected was that Xue Ying suddenly seemed to have become a different person as soon as this question was asked. She didn’t reveal that playful attitude she had when they were alone, nor the formal manner she assumed when in class, and she revealed an unprecedented feeling of fear and darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to answer this question!” An icy cold and bone piercing voice sounded out as Xue Ying turned around and left all of them who carried astounded expressions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Sister Xue is….” Xu Chen who sat by Bai Xiaofei’s side asked him with a light voice because she instinctively felt that Bai Xiaofei would know something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know. But, she has surely recalled something….” Bai Xiaofei muttered yet what appeared in his mind was Xue Ying’s gaze that was filled with recollection. In the Gorge of Heroes, there were countless people who possessed such a gaze, so it was extremely familiar to Bai Xiaofei….</span></p>
 <p><span style>After this incident caused by Bai Xiaofei, their entire group started the long process of waiting, whereas, Mo Ka continued persisting without end while being tormented.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’s underestimated the pain of being a transfer station for Origin Energy after all. After the Origin Energy that originally resided in his body was completely exhausted, Mo Ka felt as if there were innumerable ants biting within his body, and the painful and numb feeling caused by this tormented his mind at every single moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gradually, Mo Ka’s consciousness started to become hazy, and for the sake of preventing his consciousness from moving towards collapse, he started to tell himself a single thing over and over again! </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’m the person at the end, and this is the only thing I can do for everyone!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>With this sort of thoughts in his mind, Mo Ka persisted all the way until he fainted from the pain. But, the second before he fainted, he heard the sound of water boiling coming from within the medicinal cauldron.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was also at this second before he fainted that Mo Ka revealed a heartfelt smile….</span></p>
