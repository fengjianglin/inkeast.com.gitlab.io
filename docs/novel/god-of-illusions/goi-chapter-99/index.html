 <p><span style>After they followed Feng Wuhen into a luxurious room that was over 80 square meters in sizes, all of them sat down in groups of two or three.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone, have something to eat and drink first. The puppets will be sent over soon, and all of you can take your time to choose one.” After he finished serving them with some refreshments, Feng Wuhen instantly walked out because the second puppet for over 10 people and including the alternative puppets were an entire few tens of puppets, so it wasn’t something that could be prepared in a short period of time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Fei, Big Brother Fei, have you thought what you’re going to choose for your second puppet!?” Mo Ka came over to Bai Xiaofei’s side and asked slyly, and the others in the surroundings perked up their ears along with this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Especially Xue Ying, she stared fixedly at Bai Xiaofei because the choice of his second puppet would basically decide Bai Xiaofei’s future direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The direction he’d discussed with Lei Shan not too long ago, balanced or extreme!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll see if there are any suitable puppets. I feel this sort of thing is decided by fate.” Bai Xiaofei grinned and was far less anxious that the others because the thing he was truly anxious about was why he was able to control a second puppet….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Fei, letting fate decide won’t do. We’re about to participate in the test right away, and your strength is an important pillar of support to all of us.” Xing Nan came over and voiced his views.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Drop it! In which fight was I not watching from the sidelines, the true main force in a battle is all of you!” Bai Xiaofei knew his own limitations. Before he truly obtained a strength at the Master Rank, the part he could play in a battle was rather limited because the formidableness of the Mimicry Stream was mostly displayed in its utility and not in head on battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But, we can’t always fight so smoothly without you. We need you to command us, so class monitor, I think you can consider improving your ability to protect yourself.” The big mouth, Qi Wei, came over and spoke her innermost thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, many people from the Savage Class thought in this way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With Bai Xiaofei’s current influence, he would absolutely become the center of attention as soon as he ascended the battlefield, so if he possessed a formidable ability to protect himself with, then Bai Xiaofei would be able to draw firepower very well for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Exactly, it was to firepower….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck! What you mean by this is you want me to be a target, right? How could you do that to your class monitor! I’ve always been nice to you, right!?” Bai Xiaofei wasn’t an idiot, and he instantly understood what Qi Wei meant. But, nobody cared about his complaints.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who the f*ck were you nice to!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>You were ruthless to everyone, alright!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone, I apologize for disturbing you. The puppets have arrived.” Feng Wuhen knocked on the door and entered before he interrupted the internal teasing of the Savage Class, and it caused the eyes of everyone to light up immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For the sake of making it easier for everyone to select their puppets, I took the liberty of sending over the puppets in batches, so that it’s easier for all of you to advise each other.” As a manager, Feng Wuhen considered everything in a rather thoughtful manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem. Bring in the first batch.” Bai Xiaofei grinned as he announced that the moment of excitement had arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Subsequently, under Feng Wuhen’s orders, young women in cheongsams carried numerous trays as they walked in from the entrance in a line, and they formed a row before everyone. There was a total of eight of them, and it was eight puppets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s the puppets for three people this time. They are respectively suitable for an Alchemist, Puppetsmith, and Support Stream puppet master.” As Feng Wuhen spoke, Mo Ka, Shi Kui, Zhu Nuo, and Duan Yi’yi were overjoyed at the same time. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Support and healing were actually both a type of Support Stream, and they studied in the Light of Protection of Starnet Academy. Many people even avoided separating them clearly and chose to cultivate both of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First up is the second puppet selection for an Alchemist. According to this Little Brother’s requirements, I’ve chose two ranged attack type puppets, and they are the Floating Blade and Crystal Arrow.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Two young women removed the red cloth on their trays to reveal two puppets, and Bai Xiaofei had seen one of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was precisely the crystalline and translucent arrow Chu Gan had utilized when Fei Gou and Zhu Gan were pursuing him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are similar puppets?!” Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but exclaim with surprise, and the nearby Feng Wuhen was slightly shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Brother, could it be that you don’t know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Should I?” Bai Xiaofei replied with a question while the bewilderment on his face didn’t reduce in the slightest, and the nearby Xue Ying covered her face in shame.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This sort of foundational knowledge ought to have been taught by her, but she felt aversion towards it. So, besides the real life combat practice during the first month of the Savage Class’s training, he was basically unrelated to the word ‘teacher’….</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, luckily, Feng Wuhen didn’t shoot his gaze at Xue Ying, and he started explaining patiently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Puppets are divided into animate and inanimate puppets. But, regardless of if it’s an animate or inanimate puppet, it’s possible for them to possess similar skills and effects. Animate puppets would randomly inherit an ability from before it became a puppet, whereas, inanimate puppets were manufactured in batches, and the only difference between them is their grade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve probably seen the Crystal Arrow because this is the second selection of many Alchemists. But, we usually have the corresponding puppets that’s lower by a grade called the Windbreaker Arrow, and this is a violet-grade puppet instead!” Feng Wuhen picked up the Crystal Arrow on the tray as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Crystal Arrow’s effect is to be shot out towards a designated target after it’s filled with Origin Energy, and it carries a tracking ability. Its advantages are swift speed and ease of use, and its flaws are that it can be stopped, obstructed, and possesses a comparatively fixed amount of destructive force.” As soon as he finished speaking, Mo Ka had already gone over. This thing was precisely the puppet he’d taken a fancy to because it was capable of allowing him to escape the fate of being useless. When this thing was exerted with all his strength, its might would absolutely be more formidable than a strike of Fang Ye’s rifle puppet!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s the effect of the other?” Bai Xiaofei was felt great aversion towards this thing as he’d been shot at by a Windbreaker Arrow, and comparatively speaking, he preferred the palm sized golden blade on the other tray.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Floating Blade is something I personally prefer. But, unfortunately, there weren’t many people that chose this puppet.” As he passed over the second puppet to Mo Ka, Feng Wuhen continued with his explanation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This thing won’t attack at the first possible moment after it’s activated, and it requires at least five seconds of recharging. The Floating Blade will be in a semi invisible state while recharging, and after it’s recharged, it can launch an attack against any target within its area of attack. The attack range and might of the attack is entirely determined by the time it was recharged for and how high in the air it floated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This thing has many advantages. Firstly, it has a theoretically infinite offensive strength. Secondly, its attack speed is very swift, and it’s very difficult to defend against it while caught off guard. But, its weaknesses are very lethal as well. Not to mention its characteristic of requiring charging caused it to be unsuitable for fast reactions, the most important flaw is that the recharging of the Floating Blade can be interrupted.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he finished introducing it, Feng Wuhen went silent and patiently waited for Mo Ka to make a choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Ka fell into a dilemma. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like most people, Mo Ka liked both of them. As far as he was concerned, all violet-grade puppets were good, and he wanted both if it was possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, he unfortunately didn’t possess the strength for that, and it was also impossible for him to select two puppets with similar effects.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Fei….” Mo Ka who couldn’t decide sent a gaze of seeking for help from Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
