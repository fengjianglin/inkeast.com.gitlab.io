 <p>Chapter 465: Bai Xiaofei’s Changes!</p> 
 <p>Facing Bai Xiaofei’s question, Lei Shan took a deep breath as a trace of anger surfaced. Of course, it was not directed at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“In the past six months while you were away, the magical beasts in the Infinite Mountain Range have been extremely active. Many of our students were attacked by the royal magical beasts while performing their tasks,” Lei Shan paused and displayed a ruthless expression. “Although I don’t know the reason, in any case, it is they who broke the agreement first. I demand blood for blood. The academy has been quiet for too long. If there is no response from us, they may even come to our door!”</p> 
 <p>Lei Shan finished with a cold snort, his fury visibly seeping out.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei secretly tensed. <em>Could it be because of what I previously did there…</em></p> 
 <p>This thought only flashed briefly in his mind before he already hurriedly self-hypnotized into denial. Even if it really was him, he must never admit to it!</p> 
 <p>“Then where is our hunting area?” Bai Xiaofei gulped and asked an important question. From how Lei Shan looked right now, it was impossible for this to be just a small-scale activity.</p> 
 <p>“The middle ring!” Firmly stressing each word, Lei Shan added, “Kill on sight!”</p> 
 <p>Murderous intent spread! With this keynote reverberating, the bicentennial celebration was bound to be bloody!</p> 
 <p>“But if it’s only the students, a heavy casualty must be paid to move around the middle area.” Bai Xiaofei frowned. As a person who had strolled through even the inner ring, he knew full well how many high-rank magical beasts there were. Relying on the students alone would likely result in them being massacred before even getting to the middle ring…</p> 
 <p>“There will be many alumni returning during this celebration, and this year I will make a speech. We will be adopting the model of alumni leading the students. We must let those in the Infinite Mountain Range know that Starnet abiding by the agreement is definitely not due to weakness!”</p> 
 <p>Having known Lei Shan for so long and seen him so many times, this was still the first time Bai Xiaofei saw the old man really get angry. Even during the Di Jiang incident, Lei Shan had still given Di Jiang a way out.</p> 
 <p>“Okay, I understand. How long do I have to prepare?” Bai Xiaofei’s eyes were firm when he asked the last question. Not to mention that this was contributing to Starnet, from another aspect, this event might also be of great help to Hu Xian’er. Weakening the royal families of the magical beasts was a good thing for the Fox clan now!</p> 
 <p>“After the new student training, you still have about three months,” replied Lei Shan.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s brow furrowed again.</p> 
 <p>“Won’t the fourth-years have graduated by then? It will have a great impact on this activity if they all leave.” The average strength basically increased according to the grade. If the fourth-year students all left, the overall strength of Starnet would be greatly reduced.</p> 
 <p>“Fourth-year graduates can choose to stay or leave, it isn’t mandatory.” Lei Shan wasn’t foolish as he left room for choices at this moment instead of limitations. After all, this celebration was going to be dangerous.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei heaved a long sigh of relief. Although it was voluntary, how could someone miss the bicentennial celebration that only happened once in a lifetime? As long as this was mentioned, at least 90% would be willing to stay!</p> 
 <p>“Is there anything else you want to ask?” Lei Shan asked when seeing Bai Xiaofei become silent.</p> 
 <p>“Nothing to ask about the celebration, but something about myself.” Bai Xiaofei’s expression suddenly became serious, startling Lei Shan and Revelation a little.</p> 
 <p><em>If nothing else, it’s not easy to see this boy serious for once.</em></p> 
 <p>“Oh? You need me for something, isn’t this rare?!” Lei Shan smiled and looked at Bai Xiaofei ponderingly. Unfortunately, Bai Xiaofei didn’t take this well.</p> 
 <p>“I just wanted to ask my principal and master how to become a better puppet master. If this is considered a favor, then I will not ask.” Bai Xiaofei got up, acting like he was leaving.</p> 
 <p>Revelation sprang up.</p> 
 <p>“Favor my butt, don’t listen to this old guy’s nonsense. Ask any question and this master will definitely tell you everything he knows!” Revelation pulled Bai Xiaofei to sit down.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was flattered by his sudden and serious act of performing his duties as a master.</p> 
 <p>“Say it. You have a new idea or something?” Revelation inquired with eyes full of expectation.</p> 
 <p>Like Lei Shan, Revelation was not optimistic about the pure Illusion Stream, and he didn’t think that a puppet master of the Illusion Stream could exert the full potential of Lunisolar Brilliance.</p> 
 <p>“I want to have the ability for head-on confrontation!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Revelation and Lei Shan smiled at one another, giving off an evil vibe.</p> 
 <p>“Cough, that… Let me ask first, what grade is your Lunisolar Brilliance right now?”</p> 
 <p>“If there is no surprise, it should be at profound grade.” Bai Xiaofei calculated that after two upgrades, his Lunisolar Brilliance should be at the profound grade.</p> 
 <p>“Only profound?” Revelation cried in his disbelief.</p> 
 <p>Seeing Revelation’s reaction, Bai Xiaofei’s face was covered in a frown.</p> 
 <p><em>What do you mean ‘only profound’?! I have only learned the technique for less than a year. You call rising twice in a year slow?! Do you want me to push through one level in a few months?!</em></p> 
 <p>The difference in values had created an insurmountable gap. Bai Xiaofei could not understand Revelation, and Revelation was even less capable of understanding Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>What a waste with such a good resource like Starnet!!</p> 
 <p>“But I heard that there are many girls with good qualities around you, why don’t you work on them?? Do you think you’re not good enough? That can’t be. I’ve checked all those people around you. They are either royals or refined noble ladies. Even the daughter of that little girl Nishang is interested in you. Could it be that your body has problems with ‘that’?!”</p> 
 <p>The more Revelation said, the closer Bai Xiaofei was to exploding. Not even Bai Xiaofei, even Lei Shan could not listen anymore…</p> 
 <p>“Hey, you’ve gone offtopic!” Lei Shan warned with a dark expression. Not only Bai Xiaofei, but he also had different values from Revelation.</p> 
 <p>“What does a dull stone like you understand? Lunisolar Brilliance is trash if it doesn’t get upgraded. How can the apprentice of I, the great Revelation, use a trashy technique?!” retorted Revelation with ‘righteousness.’ In a sense, Revelation himself was the most suitable person for Lunisolar Brilliance.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, Revelation was too scared… After all, it was all life-risking hard work!</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, Bai Xiaofei didn’t know what Revelation was thinking, otherwise, this nominal master-disciple relationship between them would basically come to an end…</p> 
 <p>“Master, let’s talk about upgrading later. I just want to know how I can achieve what I want!” Bai Xiaofei slowly spoke, the resolution in his eyes deepening.</p> 
 <p>He didn’t want to be a meager sidekick anymore!</p>
