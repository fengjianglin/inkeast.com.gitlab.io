 <p>Chapter 304: Sima Ye's Invitation to Fight!</p> 
 <p>“Senior, I don't think I have anything to do with this Zhen Qi you mentioned!” Hiding the shock in his heart, Bai Xiaofei made a final denial, but reality proved that it was futile.</p> 
 <p>Sima Ye really knew what happened!</p> 
 <p>“I watched the recording that you showed in the principal's office that day when you dealt with Di Jiang, and I was also there at the broadcast yesterday. Do you want me to tell you why there’s a subtle connection between the two?”</p> 
 <p>Sima Ye now had a smirk on his face, while Bai Xiaofei was silent. At this point, Bai Xiaofei could basically confirm that Sima Ye had caught the key point of the problem. However, he still didn’t want to give up and resign himself to fate just like that.</p> 
 <p>“It seems that you are not going to accept your fate, huh? Forget it. Anyway, since it’s only the two of us here, there’s nothing that can’t be said.” Sima Ye immediately understood Bai Xiaofei. He paused a little before continuing, “In the Di Jiang incident, you tricked Di Hang into spilling the stupid things he did, but you kept two names hidden, that is, the two female students who were sullied by Di Hang but are still currently in Starnet. At first, I thought you were only trying to protect their reputation, but then I realized I was wrong. If that was the case, you wouldn’t have asked their names. This troubled me for a while because I’ve been sending people to watch you for such a long time but never saw you have any contact with any girl in the Fist of the Beast. However, after watching the competition video yesterday, I finally know what you want to do.”</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei listened, his heart completely sank. He had always thought that no one would pay attention to this detail; after all, the main problem then was the Di father and son duo, but someone was telling him that not only did he notice, he even hinted that it was his weak point!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei's inner thoughts naturally had no effect on Sima Ye telling the story. Just like a winner counting his war spoils, he just couldn’t stop.</p> 
 <p>“You want not only to protect the reputation of the two girls, but also help the one who is facing dropping out of school at any time while neither leaving any trace nor letting her notice and feeling bad about her money problem. So, you had Hu Xian’er, who you’re very close with, form a team with that girl, because you know that Hu Xian’er’s popularity will lead her through the first round and thus she can get the reward you set. Not only that, but you can also even organize people to help her pass the second round! I have to admit that you are a good person, one with a delicate mind at that. If it were me, I would never bother to design a series of events to help a worthless person to me, let alone in a way so that everyone wouldn’t notice.”</p> 
 <p>At the end of his speech, Sima Ye made a simple evaluation from the bottom of his heart, but it made Bai Xiaofei very uncomfortable.</p> 
 <p>“F<em>ck your father! I’m not a good man, f</em>ck being a good man, your entire family is a good man! Even if what you said is true, it has no farts to do with me! Scram if you’ve finished. Don't f*cking ruin my mood on such a great night! “</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s instantaneous roaring outburst struck Sima Ye dumb. He felt that an intelligent man should be well-mannered, gentle, and cultured, but Bai Xiaofei, who was like a fierce hunting beast directly toppled his viewpoint.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei's approach was indeed effective, as erupting wildly without regard for consequences was very suitable for dealing with the kind of smart and rule-follower like Sima Ye. However, it couldn’t always scare him.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll let Zhen Qi’s story spread at the fastest speed through Starnet. At that time, her existence will become a stain on this competition. What kind of foolish things will she do then, you say?”</p> 
 <p>When Sima Ye’s voice rang out, Bai Xiaofei, who was one step away from exiting the room, instantly stopped and turned around. There was a murderous intent all over his face, his eyes were so wide that he looked like he’d spit fire at any moment.</p> 
 <p>“If you do that, karma will get you!” His clenched fists and gritted teeth fully displayed Bai Xiaofei's state of mind at that moment. If possible, he wanted to immediately kill this person who he had now defined as ‘scum.’</p> 
 <p>A rich and heartless person was hateful, but a smart one being heartless was not only hateful but also terrible!</p> 
 <p>“Compared with karma, I’m more afraid of not being able to make progress.” With a shallow smile, Sima Ye wasn’t at all displeased by Bai Xiaofei's words. He even seemed a little proud. He enjoyed Bai Xiaofei's helpless state.</p> 
 <p>Kindness was one of the weaknesses of human nature. It was just that not everyone would take advantage of it, for no reason other than most people couldn’t bring themselves to do something so immoral.</p> 
 <p>However, Sima Ye seemed to have no such burden.</p> 
 <p>“What the hell do you want?!” Finally, after racking his brain without coming up with a good idea, Bai Xiaofei asked the question he least wanted to ask.</p> 
 <p>“Very simple, I want you to take part in the Command Ranking test, make it into the top ten, and then challenge me! Whether you win or lose, as long as you stand in front of me, I guarantee you this story will rot in my stomach!” Sima Ye’s reply was well-prepared as if he had expected this scene.</p> 
 <p>“Did you spend so much time observing me just to have a duel?” His face full of disbelief, Bai Xiaofei asked aloud. Sima Ye's actions, in his opinion, were simply incomprehensible, yet he looked content going through all this trouble.</p> 
 <p>“You don't understand how lonely being invincible is. Right now no one is my match in Starnet.” Sima Ye’s words made Bai Xiaofei want to curse.</p> 
 <p><em>Your mother! Isn't it just a Command Ranking, what's there to brag about? I might be scared a little if you are the number one in the Combat Ranking!</em></p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei thought to himself, he seemed to have forgotten the fact that he had just been coerced.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, I promise you, but can you wait for a while? I'll rush to the Command Ranking as soon as the Blossom Ranking matter is over.” Bai Xiaofei said with a serious face that made people think he couldn’t be lying.</p> 
 <p>“Impossible, I won't give you a chance. The matter of Zhen Qi is actually very clear cut. Either you come with me now or I will announce it. There is no third option.” Sima Ye's attitude was very firm. Based on his analysis of Bai Xiaofei’s past actions, not a word from this fellow’s mouth could be trusted!</p> 
 <p>“Now?! It's evening!!” Bai Xiaofei felt that Sima Ye was a bit insane now. Not to mention the girls’ rehearsal in the evening, Bai Xiaofei also didn’t want to be this diligent either!</p> 
 <p>“The sun has just set, and the Illusionary Sandboard of the Command Ranking is open all day long. One night should be enough for you to rush into the top ten.” Sima Ye calmly stated that he had no intention of giving Bai Xiaofei any leeway.</p> 
 <p><em>Motherf*cker, you want this lord to stay up all night?! Besides, what gives you the confidence that I can definitely reach the top ten?!!</em></p> 
 <p>“What if, just what if, I can't reach the top ten…?” as Bai Xiaofei weakly voiced his question, he received a very firm look in return.</p> 
 <p>“I will also announce it!”</p> 
 <p><em>F<em>ck you, you #%$&amp;^$&amp;! If this lord doesn't destroy you, you motherf</em>cking bastard just won’t know your f*cking place!</em></p>
