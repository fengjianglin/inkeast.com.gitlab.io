 <p>Chapter 840: Watch Me Chase!</p> 
 <p>“He’s left.”</p> 
 <p>After watching Bai Xiaofei and Tan Xin leave the Revelation Pavilion, Revelation went to see Gu Lingyue, who could not look weaker at the moment.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei could already make Hu Xian’er beg for mercy when he was normal, let alone when drugged. It was already not easy for Gu Lingyue to wake up this soon.</p> 
 <p>“You didn’t tell him, did you?” Gu Lingyue struggled to sit up, a hint of sorrow on her face. It was truly hard for a girl to bear this kind of secret alone…</p> 
 <p>“No, I respect your opinion. However, you can’t hide it forever. You are a Paraselene. I’m afraid you have already…” Revelation said with concern.</p> 
 <p>“That is my fate. It’s already a luxury that I get to choose the person. What else can I ask for?” Gu Lingye smiled bitterly. There were times she wished she was an ordinary person. “As for keeping it from him, I’ll hide it as long as I can. That way, at least I don’t feel that I’m a machine.”</p> 
 <p>With that, she looked at Revelation.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you, Master Revelation.”</p> 
 <p>Facing her words of gratitude, Revelation felt an acute sense of guilt. To tell the truth, his arrangements were all just for Bai Xiaofei…</p> 
 <p>“There is nothing to thank me for. After you fully recover, I will teach you divination according to our agreement. What happens after, I will take full responsibility as well.” Revelation tried to make his guilt a little more bearable.</p> 
 <p>Gu Lingyue did not make any senseless refusal of courtesy. She nodded. “Lingyue thanks Master Revelation in advance.”</p> 
 <p>Facing Revelation, she was absolutely a reasonable, refined lady. If she was born into a normal family, perhaps she could have a perfect life…</p> 
 <p>Leaving Gu Lingyue’s room, Revelation looked up at the sky. What he had told Bai Xiaofei about ranking up was no exaggeration. Although Gu Lingyue was not a high-ranked puppet master, as a Paraselene, she was more helpful to Bai Xiaofei’s cultivation than one. Yet, his cultivation technique only advanced from earth grade to heaven grade.</p> 
 <p>Ranking up Lunisolar Brilliance might be much more difficult than they had imagined.</p> 
 <p>“Aiii, smelly boy, just quickly think it through, won’t you? The sooner your strength improves, the better!” Revelation sighed.</p> 
 <p>On the Windsurfing Ship, Bai Xiaofei let out a big sneeze.</p> 
 <p>“Who’s the bastard bad-mouthing me? I’ll peel off your skin!” Bai Xiaofei viciously cursed.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin snickered.</p> 
 <p>“Where shall we go next, my dear city lord?” Letting the matter slide, Bai Xiaofei asked in a good mood. Now that his strength was restored, he was not scared of Tan Xin!</p> 
 <p>“Do I hear smugness in your voice? How about a little spar?” Tan Xin was exceptionally keen, immediately seeing through Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Alright!” Bai Xiaofei laughed gleefully as he imagined how he would teach Tan Xin a lesson so that she would be as obedient as a little girl should be.</p> 
 <p>However, before he could react, he was shocked that the energy in his body suddenly fell into a static state and Tan Xin had disappeared.</p> 
 <p>“What about now, do you want to continue?” Tan Xin’s voice rang in his ear.</p> 
 <p>Feeling her cold hands around his neck, Bai Xiaofei swallowed hard. <em>Oh dear lord, what just happened??!</em></p> 
 <p>“Ehh… Let’s get back to discussing our next destination.” The desire to live took over as Bai Xiaofei once again got to know this seemingly harmless little girl. Sure enough, it was impossible to get along in a place like Windlove without strength!</p> 
 <p>“This place.” Tan Xin waved her hand, and a densely marked map appeared in front of the two. She pointed to a small clump of wildflowers on the map.</p> 
 <p>“What is that place?” Bai Xiaofei felt that his general history course had been attended for nothing. In front of Tan Xin, he was simply a newbie.</p> 
 <p>“Boundless Flower Sea, the place that all women yearn to see, the legendary holy land of love!” Tan Xin said with a twinkle in her eyes.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei’s comment nearly made her explode. “Why do you want to go to a place where women yearn for? You are at best a little girl…” </p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei, who felt a familiar sense of danger creeping up his mind as he spoke, was pressed onto the ground the next thing he knew.</p> 
 <p>“What did you just say?” Tan Xin asked.</p> 
 <p>Seeing her turn into a demoness again, Bai Xiaofei chickened out. “I said we should hurry. I’m also looking forward to this place, especially when I have a ce… celestial companion like you!”</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin snorted, but she decided to spare Bai Xiaofei. She also recalled Revelation’s words. <em>Indeed, this little body is an obstacle! In front of sexy, cute is nothing!</em></p> 
 <p>“Windsurfing, accelerate!” The pouty Tan Xin vented her anger on the cruise ship.</p> 
 <p>Per her command, the speed doubled in a second, turning into a streak…</p> 
 <p>The Boundless Flower Sea, a land that was exactly what its name suggested.</p> 
 <p>All kinds of colorful wildflowers fully occupied the endless plain. Their fragrances combined made anyone inside felt like they were floating.</p> 
 <p>No one had ever manufactured anything in this place. Everything was the uncanny workmanship of nature. No flower here was rare, but when tens of millions of them gathered together, the qualitative change they brought was more beautiful than anything.</p> 
 <p>For this reason, this place became a yearning place for all couples and every day there were people promising their whole lives to be together, writing many wonderful stories. The Boundless Flower Sea fulfilled lovers, and there were couples who fulfilled its reputation.</p> 
 <p>Jumping down from the Windsurfing Ship, Tan Xin opened her arms like a bird, greedily breathing in the air of the flower sea and overlooking its breathtaking beauty.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei immediately saw something was wrong.</p> 
 <p>“Do you want to die?!” Purple Luan wings instantly appeared behind his back and he caught her before she hit the ground, however, the inertia sent them rolling. If it wasn’t for Bai Xiaofei decisively activating Invincibility, they would have been seriously injured.</p> 
 <p>“Hehe, I don’t want to die, I just know you are here.” Riding on Bai Xiaofei’s chest, Tan Xin blinked her eyes innocently and laughed.</p> 
 <p>If it wasn’t for her body being that of a little girl, anyone would be swept off their feet by her sweet talk…</p> 
 <p>“Hey, the sky here is quite beautiful,” Bai Xiaofei changed the topic as he did not know how to respond to her flirting.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin rolled off Bai Xiaofei’s chest and lay on his arm, looking at the sky with a smile. “If you say it looks good, then it must look good!”</p> 
 <p><em>Chasing the dragon, huh? Just watch me!</em></p>
