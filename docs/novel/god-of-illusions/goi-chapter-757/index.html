 <p>Chapter 757: Half a Year; Rui Mengqi’s Change!</p> 
 <p>The sole purpose of the so-called banquet was to test Bai Xiaofei’s group. After getting a satisfactory result, Tong Fei conveniently finalized his cooperation with Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Tong Fei would be the middleman, providing a large number of Blood Diamonds to the Illusion Demon Merchant Group and even sending the goods directly to its branches.</p> 
 <p>The Illusion Demon Merchant Group would be in charge of sales, having to pay 5% of the profits in addition to the bulk price to acquire Blood Diamonds in the beginning.</p> 
 <p>In fact, the 5% was Tong Fei’s personal demand and would go into his own pocket. However, Bai Xiaofei keenly detected this and later started bargaining in secret. In the end, the two agreed to split this 5% evenly.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was currently not a rich man. Ever since Illusion Demon got on track, its fund was no longer his alone and all used on operation costs. He was also too embarrassed to ask Feng Wuhen and Lu Lingyun for money. Therefore, he naturally would not miss such an opportunity to profit.</p> 
 <p>That way, not only would his pocket be fat, but he could also cry about being poor to the girls from time to time as the deal was kept a secret between him and Tong Fei…</p> 
 <p>To everyone’s surprise, after sealing the deal with Tong Fei, Bai Xiaofei acted as if he had forgotten the mission and started to focus wholly on the Blood Diamond business.</p> 
 <p>For the next six months, a man named Bai Sicheng was active in all parts of the continent, wandering among the various merchant groups, forcefully turning a simple Blood Diamond contract into one of the few backbone businesses of Illusion Demon!</p> 
 <p>Currently, as long as ‘Blood Diamond’ was mentioned, most people would think of Illusion Demon, a new merchant group that was thriving like mushrooms after rain. Many even said that Blood Diamonds were stepping stones for Illusion Demon just like puppets to the Ethereal Merchant Group, pills to the Devpath Merchant Group, and Amethyst Cards to the Amethyst Merchant House.</p> 
 <p>It was also due to the emergence of the Blood Diamond business that Illusion Demon successfully broke through the suppression of the eight major merchant groups into vigorous growth.</p> 
 <p>Suddenly, the Illusion Demon Merchant Group became highly sought after in the northern area of the Starnet Continent. Its major branches took advantage of the situation to fortify their status and began to branch into other industries.</p> 
 <p>To this end, Feng Wuhen and Lu Lingyun even personally came to see Bai Xiaofei and asked if Blood Diamonds could be a long-term business. After they left with his answer, the Illusion Demon Merchant Group accelerated its pace of branching out to other industries.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had never forgotten his mission!</p> 
 <p>“Master, it’s time for tea!”</p> 
 <p>Rui Mengqi gently opened the door to Bai Xiaofei’s room. In the past six months, she had fully integrated into her maid identity and done such a good job that Bai Xiaofei’s daily life had been completely handed over to her.</p> 
 <p>“Place it here. Remember to inform the kitchen to prepare a banquet tomorrow. Boss Tong is coming over. He is to be welcomed with the highest ceremony.” Bai Xiaofei put down the book in his hand and stretched his body.</p> 
 <p>Seeing his actions, Rui Mengqi couldn’t help laughing.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter? Is something funny?” Bai Xiaofei smiled wryly and touched his face.</p> 
 <p>“Of course it’s funny. You are more and more like the old master of a family now!” Rui Mengqi commented.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei understood what she meant and also laughed. “Of course, I am now such an important person that every merchant is eager to see. How can I present myself without a master’s vibe?” He patted his stomach.</p> 
 <p>The appearance that Golden Feather made for him was a business boss with a big tummy. Although it had no actual effect on him, he had unknowingly developed the habit of patting his stomach.</p> 
 <p>“Master, can I ask you something?” Rui Mengqi suddenly stopped laughing. Her hands twisted together as she prevaricated.</p> 
 <p>“I’m not the kind of master that’s hard to talk to, am I? Just say it.” Bai Xiaofei put on an amiable smile and his tone was gentle. Although Rui Mengqi habitually made his life ‘difficult,’ she was just a carefree silly girl at the end of the day.</p> 
 <p>“When the mission is over, you won’t be my master, but what if I still won’t have enough of playing the role of a maid? I’m afraid that I won’t be able to adapt. Can I… can I still follow you and take care of your daily life in the future?” Her head low and her face beet-red, Rui Mengqi finally mustered the courage and said a long, shocking paragraph. Upon finishing, her heart leaped to her throat. Her ears pricked up for fear of missing a word from Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei was completely floored.</p> 
 <p><em>How do I answer this?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Say yes? But is that appropriate? If I have a maid-in-waiting, the girls’ jealousy may very well kill me.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Say no? But judging from this situation, this silly girl may just break down if I do!</em></p> 
 <p>Once again encountering a huge dilemma, Bai Xiaofei gulped as the gears in his brain turned wildly.</p> 
 <p>“Even if I’m not your master, I’m still your boss. Don’t forget that it’s I who brought you out at the beginning. Moreover, there are many kinds of help you can do for me. Taking care of my daily life is only one aspect.” After a long silence, Bai Xiaofei finally gave a rather ambiguous reply.</p> 
 <p>“That means you agree! Yay! Thank you so much, boss!”</p> 
 <p>Rui Mengqi jumped in joy. Seeing her reaction, Bai Xiaofei panicked, but she had run out of the room before he could explain.</p> 
 <p>The moment the door closed, Bai Xiaofei felt a gloomy future ahead of him.</p> 
 <p><em>My little ancestor, I didn’t say that! Oh dear! If this gets out, how long will I have to sleep on the floor?!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei leaned back in his chair in remorse. Rui Mengqi had once again educated him with practical actions to never try to be tactful with simple people!</p> 
 <p>Little did he know, Rui Mengqi’s excitement was instantly replaced by a calm expression as soon as she left the room. Then, a slight smile appeared on her face.</p> 
 <p>“Sorry, boss, Mengqi knows what you mean, but Mengqi really can’t do without you. Mengqi knows that she can’t compete with Sister Xian’er and them, so Mengqi is satisfied to just be a maid…” Rui Mengqi mumbled to herself as her smile widened.</p> 
 <p>People change with time, and time makes sure no one would become simpler…</p>
