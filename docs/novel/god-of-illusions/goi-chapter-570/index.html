 <p>Chapter 570: Yan Tri-State Transformation!</p> 
 <p>After a brief shake, Yan’s body became at least twice as slim as before. The next second, he approached Bai Xiaofei using a bizarre technique.</p> 
 <p><em>He got faster!</em> Bai Xiaofei immediately saw the change. Knowing that he couldn’t keep up with Yan’s current speed, he chose to defend.</p> 
 <p><em>No matter how strong you get, I’m as immovable as a mountain! No matter how fast you are, there’ll be a time you stop!</em></p> 
 <p>In the blink of an eye, Yan had gone around Bai Xiaofei’s back and his thorned hand stabbed at Bai Xiaofei’s heart right at the middle – Bai Xiaofei’s blind spot.</p> 
 <p>But to Yan’s surprise, Bai Xiaofei’s reaction wasn’t one beat slow despite being unable to see. How could someone trained by Xue Ying reveal such an obvious blind spot? He deliberately left an opening!</p> 
 <p>Bending forward, Bai Xiaofei dodged Yan’s attack by a hair’s breadth and pressed both hands on the ground in an arch. Then, his feet shot at Yan’s chest, kicking him into the air.</p> 
 <p><em>Motherf*cker, this lord don’t believe you can fly!</em></p> 
 <p>Springing back up on his feet, Bai Xiaofei leaped after Yan in the air and his glowing right fist pounded at the latter’s head. Right at that moment, Yan’s body trembled again. His slender body became mushy and when Bai Xiaofei’s fist landed, it felt like he had hit cotton and no force had been taken at all!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s heart tightened. It was too late to withdraw his hand as the jelly Yan had wrapped around his arm. The grip was so strong that blood rushed to his throat.</p> 
 <p>Then, Yan opened his mouth and his sharp teeth glowed with energy, gunning for Bai Xiaofei’s neck!</p> 
 <p>At that grave moment, Bai Xiaofei raised the only still movable part – his left fist – and stuffed it into Yan’s mouth.</p> 
 <p>The sharp teeth pierced his skin and muscles. Unable to withstand Yan’s biting force, the bones only withheld a little as the painful feeling of being fractured transmitted through Bai Xiaofei’s nerves.</p> 
 <p>“Devouring the Heaven and Earth!” Bai Xiaofei wouldn’t obediently let himself be crunched. <em>Bite as you like. At worst, this lord will just forsake this hand after making you into beast jerky!</em></p> 
 <p>The rapid loss of energy startled Yan. The moment he felt something was wrong, Yan decisively broke away. He slapped Bai Xiaofei’s head and separated from him. The two fell to the ground. The difference was that Bai Xiaofei hit the earth with a heavy thud while Yan landed steadily.</p> 
 <p>Upon landing, Yan once again returned to his slender form and in just a few breaths, rushed to Bai Xiaofei, who was still struggling to get up, with his fist smashing straight down at his head. However, when the strike was about to connect, Bai Xiaofei suddenly disappeared on the spot. At the same time, a chill ran down Yan’s spine.</p> 
 <p><em>Teleportation!</em> Realizing the incoming crisis, Yan rolled forward and escaped a wolf’s paw. His body shook again.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t stop after his paw failed but grabbed towards the rolling Yan. From the earlier experience, he had given up on his left fist.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei misjudged this time because Yan didn’t enter his soft form. Instead, his whole body expanded several times. His arm that had become thicker than Bai Xiaofei’s waist, swung and sent Bai Xiaofei flying!</p> 
 <p>Smashing a variety of objects in his flight, Bai Xiaofei felt as if his internal organs had all switched places.<br> When he got up, he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p> 
 <p>“Haven’t had such a good fight in a while; I already forgot how long I haven’t used my tri-state transformation.” Walking towards Bai Xiaofei, Yan shook his fists and his eyes were full of fighting spirit.</p> 
 <p>“Being so smug for bullying a Master Rank puppet master? If it wasn’t that this lord is in a bad state, you garbage would be dead on the ground right now.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s physical condition was not so good, but not so for his tongue! He could clearly feel that his Spiritualization state had reached the limit and he was no longer able to stall Yan in combat, so his only choice now was his smart mouth.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, Yan had no plans to go along.</p> 
 <p>“Is that so? Then I have to thank you!” While saying this, Yan had rushed over. Although his speed couldn’t compare to before, Bai Xiaofei was still unable to escape in his current state.</p> 
 <p>“The World in the Mirror!!!”</p> 
 <p>Just as Yan’s fist was about to land, the Leng triplets launched their ultimate skill. An illusion copy of Yan took the blow in Bai Xiaofei’s stead.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei hurriedly seized this opportunity to move aside, while Yan, hurt by his own blow, glared at the triplets.</p> 
 <p>“Pests!” With a snort, Yan dashed towards them.</p> 
 <p>“The World in the Mirror, break!!!”</p> 
 <p>Without hesitation, the three girls broke their newly formed mirror world, causing a wave of damage to Yan, and teleported away.</p> 
 <p>Being hurt twice by the same people, Yan was furious. He changed to his speed form and appeared in front of Leng Liuli in just one step. His right hand turned into a spiky thorn as it went for her chest.</p> 
 <p>However, he wasn’t faster than Bai Xiaofei’s Teleportation.</p> 
 <p>“Your opponent is me!”</p> 
 <p>Holding Yan’s arm that had pierced through his abdomen, Bai Xiaofei revealed a miserable smile as he activated Devouring the Heaven and Earth.</p> 
 <p>When that similar terrifying suction force appeared, Yan’s first reaction was to escape from it. However, he couldn’t pull his hand out from Bai Xiaofei’s grasp.</p> 
 <p>“Seeking death!!!” Yan roared. He started expanding again so that even if he was unable to move, his arm alone could make Bai Xiaofei’s burst.</p> 
 <p>Yet to his surprise, Bai Xiaofei let his arm go deeper into his body as he pressed even closer to him. Yan’s head went blank for half a second, and it was also this moment that Bai Xiaofei’s right hand suddenly grabbed his neck, and the sharp claws pierced through the skin, forcefully stopping Yan’s transformation!</p> 
 <p>“Sure enough, you are the most vulnerable when you change forms!” Bai Xiaofei’s wretched smile widened. He increased the force of his claws. Just another half a second and he would break Yan’s neck!</p> 
 <p>Right at that moment, a ghostly figure suddenly appeared beside Bai Xiaofei and kicked him flying, dragging Yan away.</p> 
 <p>“Kill them all!” Dark Wolf commanded after rescuing Yan.</p> 
 <p>A group of assassins bolted at Bai Xiaofei and the Leng triplets…</p>
