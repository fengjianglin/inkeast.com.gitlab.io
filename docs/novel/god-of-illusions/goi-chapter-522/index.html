 <p>Chapter 522: I Will Wait For You!</p> 
 <p>Looking into Luo Han’s stubborn eyes, Bai Xiaofei fell into a long silence. Again, deep down, he did like her. Moreover, they got along very well today and she gave him a kind of relaxed feeling that the other girls couldn’t.</p> 
 <p>However, he couldn’t give Luo Han any guarantees.</p> 
 <p>Unlike the other girls who had their own status, their own plans and goals to pursue, Luo Han was a completely blank sheet of paper. Leaving Starnet, she was merely a Master Rank puppet master of the Support Stream. Bai Xiaofei could not guarantee that he would always be there to protect her. Moreover, he couldn’t ensure that the presence of the other girls in his life would not hurt Luo Han, who was so simple.</p> 
 <p>In short, Bai Xiaofei was worried about her future. Unlike Luo Xi, staying in Starnet might actually be the best choice for Luo Han…</p> 
 <p>“I can take you out, but have you considered your arrangements after that? If you haven’t thought about it, I think you should seriously consider.” Bai Xiaofei neither directly refused nor promised anything. Luo Han couldn’t quite understand what he was getting at.</p> 
 <p>“What do you mean?” she slowly asked after some thought.</p> 
 <p>“First of all, you should know that my situation is very complicated. I have not only Xian’er, Liuyun, and many other girls, but also a lot of matters on my plate. After leaving Starnet, I will have to keep running around. Have you considered this?” Bai Xiaofei paused a little. “Secondly, I will investigate my father’s past right after I graduate. I may not have much time to be with those around me. Moreover, I’m in the dark about this continent and will have to explore everything myself. Do you think you can ensure your own safety in that situation?”</p> 
 <p>Having asked his questions, Bai Xiaofei quietly looked at a troubled Luo Han.</p> 
 <p>Luo Han indeed hesitated, but not about whether she could protect herself or how complicated the situation around Bai Xiaofei was. She had already considered those matters before she had said those words just now.</p> 
 <p>What made her hesitate was the fear that she would become a burden to him.</p> 
 <p>He got his point across: He himself wasn’t sure about his future. Although he wasn’t weak, it was still too early to travel the whole continent without fear.</p> 
 <p>Luo Han’s soft and thoughtful character determined that she was not a selfish person. She would even put herself in strangers’ shoes to see from their standpoints, not to mention someone she intended to entrust her life to.</p> 
 <p>“If I stay in Starnet, will you come back for me?” she asked weakly with watery eyes. This sentence was simply too meaningful.</p> 
 <p>Luo Xi had waited for decades because of this, but in the end, she never saw the person again. Luo Han could sacrifice her time, but she didn’t want to be the next Luo Xi.</p> 
 <p>“I am not my father. As long as you wait for me, I will crawl back even if I’m crippled!” Bai Xiaofei solemnly vowed. In turn, Luo Han’s expression became firm.</p> 
 <p>“Okay, I’ll wait for you to take care of everything and return!” she calmly said, then stretched out her pinky. “Pinky promise!”</p> 
 <p>Looking at the serious Luo Han before him, Bai Xiaofei really couldn’t resist laughing.</p> 
 <p>“What are you laughing at?!” There was embarrassment and rare anger in her voice as Luo Han’s red face displayed a hint of displeasure.</p> 
 <p>“I just didn’t think you are so childish.” A smile still lingering on his face, Bai Xiaofei obediently raised his hand for a pinky promise. Luo Han gently snorted.</p> 
 <p>“What’s wrong with being childish? Whoever breaks their promise is a puppy!” Luo Han declared then giggled. Different from Hu Xian’er’s smile that could sway all beings and Lin Li’s smile that could topple cities, Luo Han’s made people feel truly relaxed.</p> 
 <p>“Mhm, hook our pinkies and pull, and thereby our promise will never break! Whoever breaks their promise is a puppy!” With a hint of indulgence and a smile, Bai Xiaofei satisfied Luo Han’s wish.</p> 
 <p>After getting his promise, Luo Han was as happy as a child who got candies. Joy was written all over her face.</p> 
 <p>“Sit with me for a while. Mother said that you can see the best moonlight in the whole academy here.” With a hint of yearning in her voice, Luo Han walked slowly to the edge of the cliff and sat down. For her, this night was unforgettable. She didn’t want to go back like this. She wanted to prolong this memory as much as she could.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t think much, but he would satisfy her any request at this moment. He sat down beside her and they gazed up at the night sky together.</p> 
 <p>Under the night sky on the horizon, there were blurry sparkles. That was the Starnet Continent. It might not be the most prosperous place, but it was the place that people who had never left the academy like Luo Han yearned for.</p> 
 <p><em>Mother, if he doesn’t come back to me, I will go and find him. I will definitely firmly grasp my future!</em> Glancing at Bai Xiaofei’s side profile as he looked up at the stars, she secretly made a decision.</p> 
 <p>That night, Bai Xiaofei and Luo Han talked about many things. Just like telling stories to children, Bai Xiaofei narrated all the interesting events in the Gorge of Heroes one by one. By the time he stopped, she had already fallen asleep on his shoulder with a satisfied expression.</p> 
 <p>“Dad, oh dad, I filled this debt for you. Let’s just hope I won’t be the next you. I sure don’t want to dupe my own son like you did…” Bai Xiaofei muttered to himself with a wry smile, then gently picked Luo Han up in his arms.</p> 
 <p>He had no problem staying out at night, but if Luo Han didn’t return, he feared that Luo Xi would skin him alive…</p> 
 <p>Handing Luo Han to Luo Xi, who had a complicated expression, Bai Xiaofei bid her farewell and scurried back to the Demon of Illusions. They were clearly mother and daughter, but Bai Xiaofei found Luo Xi and Luo Han two opposite extremes.</p> 
 <p>He could play for a day and chat for a night with Luo Han while even a second with Luo Xi still felt way too long. He wanted to live long, but this way of prolonging life was never in his consideration!</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, there hadn’t been only Luo Xi who was waiting for his appearance. The moment he set foot into the Demon of Illusions, a familiar fragrance wafted over, and Hu Xian’er, who had been waiting for a day, softly landed in front of him.</p> 
 <p>“You are finally back.” Her soft tone revealed no anger, but Bai Xiaofei still tensed up.</p> 
 <p>His empress was going to start her interrogation!</p>
