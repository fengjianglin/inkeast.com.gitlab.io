 <p>Chapter 731: Graduation Time, Return to Starnet!</p> 
 <p>Although Orton was banished by design, he put forward a requirement before he left that only when Leng Hen agreed would he be willing to ‘rest’ for a period of time: the Leng triplets must not leave the Snow Kingdom!</p> 
 <p>This was due to Bai Xiaofei’s sudden appearance that gave Orton a sense of crisis. He feared that Bai Xiaofei would ‘kidnap’ the princesses.</p> 
 <p>Leng Hen agreed. He promised that he would not allow the triplets to leave the country until their graduation. With that Orton left feeling assured.</p> 
 <p>What he could not imagine was that Bai Xiaofei found a way around it. <em>The girls can’t leave the Snow Kingdom until graduation? Then I won’t leave either!</em></p> 
 <p>As a result, Bai Xiaofei started a sightseeing tour around the Snow Kingdom in the company of the three girls. It was the most relaxing time in a long time for him as he didn’t have to work his brains and spend his energy plotting against others or being bothered by trivial matters. The only thing he needed to accomplish during this limited period was making the triplets happy.</p> 
 <p>Similarly, it was also the happiest time for the Leng sisters in the past 20 years.</p> 
 <p>They passed their coming-of-age in the company of Bai Xiaofei. On that night, except for giving away their bodies, they met all of his wishes. They found their twentieth birthday the happiest birthday they had ever had…</p> 
 <p>However, the happy time came to an end with the approaching graduation and the overwhelming number of letters urging Bai Xiaofei to return. The four had to set off on the way back to Starnet.</p> 
 <p>“Pervy wolf, do you think you will be torn apart when we return?” After trying a variety of nicknames, Leng Liuying finally decided on ‘pervy wolf,’ which, in her opinion, was the most accurate for Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“‘Torn apart’ is too light. I think I might be chopped into pieces.” Bai Xiaofei gulped with sincere regret. The closer they got to Starnet, the more flustered he became.</p> 
 <p>When he left, he said the purpose was to deal with the defects of the Spiritualization Art and that he would return soon. However, the supposedly ‘quick’ trip lasted for more than half a year with his problem remaining unsolved. No matter how Bai Xiaofei saw it, he was in for a miserable time.</p> 
 <p>He could even imagine the expressions of Hu Xian’er and the girls when they saw him…</p> 
 <p>“Mhm, very well aware of your own situation, aren’t you? Seeing that you are so rational…” Leng Liuying teased as she tried to suppress a smile.</p> 
 <p>Through her pause, Bai Xiaofei saw a ray of hope.</p> 
 <p>“You guys will help me explain to them?” His eyes shone brilliantly. It was definitely better for four people to carry the blame than one!</p> 
 <p>However, he underestimated the triplets to be too simple. After being around him for such a long time, they hadn’t learned much, but it included being thick-skinned!</p> 
 <p>“No, we will burn more joss paper for you on holidays!”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Leng Liuying finished, the three sisters were unable to hold back anymore and burst out laughing regardless of Bai Xiaofei’s clouded expression.</p> 
 <p>Amidst Bai Xiaofei being ceaselessly poked fun of, the group finally saw Starnet again. Bai Xiaofei did not feel anything special, but the girls’ eyes instantly reddened. This was the place where they had passed over three years of their best times, but now they only had a handful of days left.</p> 
 <p>“Stop! Who goes there?!” shouted the first-year gatekeepers as the Downwind Boat neared the entrance.</p> 
 <p>Looking at unfamiliar and immature faces, the four people couldn’t help but exchange smiles. Once upon a time, they all regarded the students who were chosen to guard the entrance as outstanding figures, but now, they had become existences that the freshmen would look up to.</p> 
 <p>“Third-year student of the Demon of Illusions, Bai Xiaofei.” Bai Xiao stowed the Downwind Boat and stepped forward while putting a Starnet Brilliance on his chest. No amount of words would be as useful as this little item.</p> 
 <p>Sure enough, after hearing Bai Xiaofei’s reply and seeing the Starnet Brilliance on his chest, the eyes of the first-year guards went wide at the same time.</p> 
 <p>“You… you are Boss… Boss Bai?!” one stuttered. For him, Bai Xiaofei was a legend!</p> 
 <p>“The one and only.” Bai Xiaofei smiled and stood straight to let them see him clearly.</p> 
 <p>His action was kind of pointless. This batch of first-year students was all recruited later. Although Bai Xiaofei had not yet left at that time, few of them had actually seen him.</p> 
 <p>However, this did not affect their respect for him. No holder of a Starnet Brilliance would be stupid enough to pretend to be someone else. The guards hurriedly made way for Bai Xiaofei’s group before two of them ran into the academy.</p> 
 <p>Quite a while ago, Hu Xian’er had announced that whoever received Bai Xiaofei upon his return could go to her to receive 100 Starnet Stones! Seeing that this was a huge sum for any student, it showed how much Hu Xian’er wanted to see Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“We’ll go to the Demon of Illusions first and ask Sister Min about the details of the graduation. You should hurry to Sister Xian’er and them. Any slower and you might really be dead.” Leng Liuli had also learned how to tease Bai Xiaofei. Poor guy…</p> 
 <p>The triplets rushed to the Demon of Illusions with the three little foxes that had become their animated puppets. Bai Xiaofei headed towards the Fist of the Beast surrounded by the three little phoenixes. It was currently class time. Hu Xian’er was never one to skip classes as learning was one of her few hobbies.</p> 
 <p>Along the way, Bai Xiaofei saw that the training course that he had fully promoted was still being carried out, and every student in it was full of pride. The teacher didn’t see Bai Xiaofei as he deliberately hid.</p> 
 <p>Besides the training course, Bai Xiaofei used the opportunity to observe everything else that he could along the way. The ruins in his memories had become history as the renovated academy was even grander than before.</p> 
 <p>The students were in high spirits, each obviously having a clear goal and working hard towards it. Unlike before, there were very few students who muddled through their days.</p> 
 <p>For some reason, while walking in the academy, Bai Xiaofei felt that he was not like a student at all but a bit like a character of Lei Shan’s position. The thought put a wry smile on his face. He stopped.</p> 
 <p><em>Here we are, the Fist of the Beast!</em></p>
