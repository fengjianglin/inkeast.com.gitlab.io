 <p><span style>After they spent their last night in the Infinite Mountain Range, Bai Xiaofei had a rare moment of waking up early the next morning, whereas, the others had already woken much earlier because today was bound to be an extraordinary day for the Savage Class!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was terrified to death when we just arrived here, yet never had I expected I would be slightly unwilling to leave now.” Mo Ka muttered, and what he said just happened to be the common thoughts of everyone. But, everyone was unwilling to leave for a different reason….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s the problem? So long as you miss it and are unafraid of death, then you can sneak out and come here to look back upon your memories. But, I think you can forget it with your strength.” Qi Wei poured down a bucket of cold water. During this month of time, all of them had become exceedingly familiar with each other, and the nature of some people was exposed along with this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For example, Qi Wei was mean and a busybody….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let’s forget it.” Mo Ka smiled awkwardly and didn’t take Qi Wei’s words too seriously because if he did, then he would have lost…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop reminiscing. It’s time to go back. The leave I applied for only covers until the second class today. At that time, I wouldn’t be able to take it if all of you make the teacher wait for too long and he makes a complaint to the principal.” Xue Ying interrupted everyone’s sighs of emotion and urged them on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The classes of new students were usually full under normal circumstances, and special circumstances like the Savage Class was something that rarely occurred in the history of Starnet Academy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go, let’s go. There are still great things to do once we return.” Under the combined urging of Bai Xiaofei and Xue Ying, all of them finally finished their episode of ‘chicken soup for the soul’, and they dashed madly towards Starnet Academy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time was different from the last time, not a single one of them was slow this time!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Falling behind? That was something that was non-existent!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In less than 30 minutes, all of them were already able to see the entrance to Starnet Academy. Even though they returned every single day in the afternoon to train their bodies, the feeling this time was completely different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can we be considered to have returned home!?” Xing Nan spoke with extreme excitement, and the faces of everyone else was covered with excitement as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not yet. Only after we possess fame and prestige here would this place be considered as our home, a home where we would be free!” Bai Xiaofei’s heroic words were absolutely not said as a joke. Even though the natural talent of the members of the Savage Class was limited, he believed that so long as the 16 of them were together, nothing would be a problem!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop right there! What’re all of you doing here!? Don’t you know the academy prohibits leaving without permission? All of you actually dared to come so openly through the front entrance? All of you are disobeying the academy’s rules!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They’d just approached the entrance when Bai Xiaofei and the others were stopped by the senior that guarded the entrance. Because the people that guarded the entrance weren’t fixed, so Bai Xiaofei and the others were questioned practically every single time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, it was really the first time such a crime was directly placed on them the moment they arrived!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re returning from carrying out an assignment.” Bai Xiaofei withdrew a bag from his spatial ring and passed it over to the senior as he spoke. Within the bag was the nails left behind by the two Earth Dire Bears, and there was nothing more convincing than this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Earth… Earth Dire Bears?!” Luckily, the senior was capable of telling things apart, and he recognized what it was at the first possible moment. But, this was also the contribution of the assignment that was on the Starnet Rankings for an entire month.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he raised his head to look at Bai Xiaofei and the others, a strange expression appeared on the senior’s face.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s actually the Earth Dire Bears. No wonder my right eyelid was f*cking twitching today, I’ve actually caught such a lucky break today. They’re only a group of new students, just watch how I deal with them!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The senior thought like this in his heart while his expression suddenly went grim.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could a group of new students like you possibly be able to complete the assignment related to the Earth Dire Bears? Tell me, where did all of you get these nails!!!” As he spoke, the senior actually put away the bag in his own storage belt, and his stern expression completely carried the intention of questioning all of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Wu Chi and the others saw the bag being kept away, their first thoughts were to charge over and seize it back, but they were stopped by Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, we did indeed catch a lucky break. But, the assignment on the Starnet Rankings never said that we must kill the Earth Dire Bear. It only required the nails of the Earth Dire Bears, and we’ve brought it back. It’s just so simple.” Bai Xiaofei smiled first and didn’t argue about the truth related to killing the Earth Dire Bear. But, after he finished speaking, his expression instantly sank. “But, Senior, you’ve taken our things now, so how should I comprehend this action?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The change in his voice was like a signal that caused the members of the Savage Class to instantly concentrate, and only Xue Ying who wasn’t wearing the cape of a teacher was watching the show in a carefree manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How you should comprehend it!? You actually have the face to ask this question?! It’s only natural that this thing should be possessed by someone who ought to possess it. There’s utterly no need to think about it, this was surely stolen by all of you. After all, stealing the assignment related objects of another is a great taboo in Starnet Academy, and all of you better follow me to the Student Council obediently! Otherwise, don’t blame me for showing no mercy!” As he placed another crim on them, the senior revealed his puppet, whereas, all five people that were guarding the entrance along with him had entered into a vigilant state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There would always be a leader amongst the people that stood on guard at the entrance, and it would usually be the person that was the first to speak. So, his intentions were the intentions of everyone. After all, everyone would get a share of the spoils later!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, can I ask you a question? I’ll surely surrender myself obediently if you’re able to answer it.” Bai Xiaofei placed his right hand behind his back as he spoke, and he secretly made a few signals with his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph! Stinking kid, don’t you dream of playing tricks before me, Wang Mu! You’ll be able to avoid a little bit of suffering if you’re obedient!” Wang Mu spoke of his name with the hope it would be of some use. After all, he could be considered to be someone with fame and prestige amongst the first year students in the Eye of Hawks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, no. How could I dare play tricks? I just want to ask Senior if….” Bai Xiaofei revealed a smile as he moved imperceptibly towards Wang Mu, whereas, Wang Mu’s curiosity had been aroused by Bai Xiaofei as well, causing him to listen carefully to Bai Xiaofei’s voice that grew gradually softer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know how the word death is written?!” Bai Xiaofei roared abruptly as his tightly clenched fist was covered with Origin Energy as it swung heavily on Wang Mu’s chin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without the slightest suspense, Wang Mu was directly blasted up….</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Bai Xiaofei’s attack sounded the horns of attack, and the remaining 15 of them instantly pounced forward like a group of wolves….</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pitiable seniors were still in a state of shock from the scene before them when iron fists that were even more ruthless than Bai Xiaofei smashed onto their bodies. Moreover, there wasn’t just one fist….</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the beginning until the end, less than five seconds had passed when all the six seniors were unable to stand up from the ground. Such a method of battle was absolutely not present in the textbooks of Starnet Academy, and the six of them could be considered to be the first round of test subjects….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do we do next?” Xu Chen walked over to Bai Xiaofei’s side and asked. But, she didn’t seem to have any intention of being afraid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Starnet Academy’s system of freedom was quite useless at this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll naturally wait for them to wake up. A few thousand of my Starnet Stones and a pile of high grade materials have been seized away by them. How can we leave without getting it back?” Bai Xiaofei spoke as if there was really such a matter, and if Wang Mu was still awake at this moment, a mouthful of blood would absolutely spray out of his mouth….</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a f*cking case of a thief meeting the Ancestor of bandits!!!</span></p>
