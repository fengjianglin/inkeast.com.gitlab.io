 <p>Chapter 956: Meeting Old Friends!</p> 
 <p>“The emperor’s birthday is in three days. From what I’ve seen so far, these three days won’t be easy on us.”</p> 
 <p>At the outskirts of Moonlight’s capital city, several people were treating their wounds amidst the surrounding scattered corpses. Obviously, there had just been a fierce battle.</p> 
 <p>“Seriously, what evil wind blew these barbarians here? They could have been better off in their home living peacefully instead of coming here to be spies. Why the death wish?” complained the youngest of the group as he lovingly stroked the kitten on his shoulder.</p> 
 <p>“You should be glad that they do, otherwise, we would never have had the opportunity to enter the sight of the emperor,” a cold and serious voice rang out. It was a long-haired woman wearing an ice-blue dress.</p> 
 <p>“Fifth Sister, is this emperor reliable? She didn’t lie to us, right? Does she really know where the legendary Revival Grass is?” the earlier youngster voiced his worries.</p> 
 <p>“Whether she knows it or not, at least for now, our lil’ sis cannot do without the emperor’s Moon God Art when we don’t even have a way to keep her alive,” said the Fifth Sister, her voice full of sorrow. Nothing was more painful than having nothing to help someone you cared deeply about when they desperately needed it.</p> 
 <p>“Someone’s coming!” a green-clad woman alerted.</p> 
 <p>The group instantly put on their guard. They looked nervously at the woman.</p> 
 <p>“They shouldn’t be coming for us. Only two people… Wait…” the green-clad woman narrated what she ‘saw’ in her mind when her voice suddenly became strange.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter?” asked the eldest brother of the group.</p> 
 <p>“It’s an acquaintance.” Despite the word ‘acquaintance,’ the emotions in her voice were complicated.</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>“You went too far! Now that you know my identity, aren’t you afraid?!” Zhu Chunyang whined, poutily hugging his bag to his chest as he followed Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Go ahead. At that time, the whole continent will know that a mighty king was once captured to be a servant.” Bai Fei leisurely walked ahead. It seemed like this was not the first time that he was threatened by the same words.</p> 
 <p>Indeed. In the past few days, he had used this secret to make Zhu Chunyang do many things that violated his bottom line…</p> 
 <p>“Fickle Bai! I’ll remember this! You’d better pray that you’ll never have to go to Heavenly Star in the future!” Zhu Chunyang bitterly declared.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei couldn’t care less. “Hurry up, we’re nearly there. You’ll be free from me once we arrive at the capital,” he said indifferently.</p> 
 <p>Zhu Chunyang did not believe a word. He had heard similar words many times from the same mouth…</p> 
 <p>“Careful!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei suddenly stopped and pushed Zhu Chunyang aside. The latter wasn’t simple either as he landed beautifully with a backflip, not dropping a single thing he was holding.</p> 
 <p>“Hey! Why did you suddenly…”</p> 
 <p>Zhu Chunyang swallowed back the remaining half of his words when he saw the place they had just been standing at had been blasted and scorched. In mid-air floated a man, lightning streaks slithering around him as he stared intently at them.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Fang?!” Bai Xiaofei exclaimed. His surprise quickly turned into doubt.</p> 
 <p>It was Fang Lei!</p> 
 <p><em>But why did he attack me?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Don’t call me brother, I can’t stand it. You are the Starnet miracle, how can we humble people afford to climb up to you? However, there are some accounts that we must settle!” Fang Lei declared and attacked again, appearing in front of Bai Xiaofei in a flash of lightning and punching at him with his electric-clad and wind-clad hands respectively.</p> 
 <p>However, the result was quite different from his imagination…</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t dodge at all, but the attacks that Fang Lei held nothing back to unleash didn’t do the slightest damage to him!</p> 
 <p>“It’s no use, Brother Fang. I’m not the same as before,” said Bai Xiaofei with an awkward smile.</p> 
 <p>Fang Lei really found his own way in the Energy Stream, but no matter how unique he tried to become, his attacks were mainly elemental, which Bai Xiaofei didn’t even have to actively defend himself against. The Endless State alone already made him the nemesis of all Energy Stream puppet masters.</p> 
 <p>As for brute force… As of now, Bai Xiaofei only feared Yan Ran’er in that department.</p> 
 <p>“Fang Lei, get back here!” Xia He’s stern voice rang out from behind as Fang Lei started to doubt reality.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei looked over and saw all of the Thunderstorm Bandits, except for the person he wanted to see most…</p> 
 <p>“I can’t even vent my anger?!” Fang Lei gritted his teeth, but still withdrew. Putting aside the fact that venting was impossible anyway, just Xia He’s tone alone was enough to make him chicken out.</p> 
 <p>“Fourth Sister,” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly came up to greet her, but his brows soon knitted together. For some reason, he had a feeling that they really didn’t want to see him…</p> 
 <p>“Where is Qing’er? She’s not with you guys?” Bai Xiaofei put aside his doubt and asked what he cared most about. Little did he know that his question poked a hornet’s nest…</p> 
 <p>“So you still remember her, huh?! I thought you couldn’t care less about someone who saved your life!” shouted Fang Lei aggressively.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Fang, what do you mean?” asking this question, Bai Xiaofei suddenly froze in realization and his heart leaped to his throat. “What’s wrong?! Did something happen to her?!” He grabbed Fang Lei’s shoulders so hard that the latter felt like his bones were about to fracture.</p> 
 <p>“Xiaofei, calm down. I’ll tell you,” He Rushi intervened with a sigh.</p> 
 <p>The others showed no intention to stop him. At the moment, among them, only He Rushi was capable of talking to Bai Xiaofei calmly.</p>
