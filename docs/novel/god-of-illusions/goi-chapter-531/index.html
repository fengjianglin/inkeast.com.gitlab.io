 <p>Chapter 531: Revelation’s Divination!</p> 
 <p>After regaining his wits, Bai Xiaofei seesawed with Heartseer for half a day before successfully persuading the latter to call him ‘Senior Grand Master.’ This was a general title that could apply to anyone two generations above Heartseer.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei originally wanted Heartseer to just call him by his name, but the guy refused with his life, saying that was a serious sin of belittling his ancestor and he would never ever do it. Without a choice, Bai Xiaofei could only accept this title with a bitter smile. At least this sounded much better than great great great… granduncle!</p> 
 <p>After solving the problem of his address, their conversation finally started. Bai Xiaofei sat while Heartseer stood respectfully. He refused to sit no matter what!</p> 
 <p><em>What a good boy this one is…</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had completely lost the impulse to bully Heartseer that he had at the beginning as it wasn’t necessary at all. If he ordered him to jump from the tallest building in Starnet, the guy might just really do it without blinking…</p> 
 <p>“Master has a message for me?” Bai Xiaofei cut to the chase since chit-chatting with an overly proper guy like this was impossible.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, Master Revelation was seriously injured because of a divination, otherwise, he would have come in person.” Heartseer took out a thick gold token from his storage ring and presented it to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>He received the token and quickly studied it. The material felt like gold yet also felt like wood, two ancient characters ‘heavenly’ and ‘mystery’<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span> were engraved on either side, and a unique energy fluctuation could be vaguely felt from the token.</p> 
 <p>“You said Master was badly hurt?” Bai Xiaofei grasped the token, his expression anxious. Although he often dissed Revelation as unreliable, deep down he was very grateful to that lovely old man.</p> 
 <p>“The divination of drawing fortune sticks is meant to touch on Heaven's mysteries, being only injured is already the best result,” explained Heartseer with a hint of joy in his voice. Because being injured was the best result, he truly felt happy for Revelation.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei gasped, then slightly shook his head.</p> 
 <p><em>Luckily that smelly old man didn’t make me learn divination from him. This lord can’t even bear the idea of self-harm, let alone being happy about it!</em></p> 
 <p>Complaining in his heart, Bai Xiaofei glossed over this topic. After all, Revelation was fine.</p> 
 <p>“Then… the result of Master’s divination?” Getting back to business, Bai Xiaofei’s heart leaped to his throat. It was likely to be something serious considering Revelation especially sent someone.</p> 
 <p>“The content of the divination is in the token. Inject your origin energy in it and you will receive Master Revelation’s message,” Heartseer explained with a smile. “A Revelation Order consists of a main token and sub tokens. The holder of the main token can send his divination to the holders of the sub tokens anytime and anywhere. A main token can only bind up to three sub tokens.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei then observed the token in his hand with great interest.</p> 
 <p>“Does it have any other functions?”</p> 
 <p><em>Such a high-end item can’t just have only one function. Even the tokens I ordered have a life-saving ability!</em></p> 
 <p>“Of course.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei revealed a hint of expectation.</p> 
 <p>“The material of the Revelation Order is unique. Master Revelation created them using Deep-sea Silver Wood, and there are only four pieces in the world. Therefore, the token in your hand is a representative of identity. With it, you can command any disciple of our pavilion at will!”</p> 
 <p>There was pride and yearning in the voice of Heartseer, but Bai Xiaofei was only shocked to hear this answer.</p> 
 <p>“That’s it?!” Obviously, Bai Xiaofei was a little disappointed with the token.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, that’s it. What’s wrong, Senior Grand Master? Does it not please you?” No one in the Revelation Pavilion was stupid. Heartseer immediately understood Bai Xiaofei’s tone, but he didn’t point it out and only tentatively asked for his thoughts.</p> 
 <p>“No, no! Very satisfied!” Aware of his gaffe, Bai Xiaofei hurriedly waved his hands. Holding something the guy dreamed of having yet being choosy about it was simply looking for a fight… If it weren’t for his seniority, he dared say that Heartseer wouldn’t be so polite right now.</p> 
 <p>“Just inject origin energy into it, right?” Bai Xiaofei looked at Heartseer to reconfirm.</p> 
 <p>“That’s right, injecting origin energy for the first time is also a process for the token to recognize you as its owner. From then on, no one can activate this token except you, Senior Grand Master, unless Master Revelation personally cancels it. When the token flashes, it means that Master Revelation has drawn a new divination, and you can get the information on it by using origin energy,” Heartseer explained in detail.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei took a deep breath, then poured his origin energy into the token…</p> 
 <p>In an instant, a gorgeous seven-color light burst out from the token. The divination had not yet appeared, but Heartseer was already dumbstruck.</p> 
 <p><em>Seven-color light, grade-nine divination!!!</em></p> 
 <p>Divination, from low to high, was divided into three ranks and nine grades. The first three grades were mortal-rank and were red in color, the fourth to the sixth grades were earth-rank and purple in color, the last three grades were heaven-rank, the color being rainbow like the one in front of them at the moment.</p> 
 <p>The intensity of light represented the specific grade, and seeing how dazzling this light was, it was no doubt a grade-nine divination!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t know nor did he understand how formidable this was. He had seen this rainbow light way too many times. When he first met Revelation, the old man had conjured it seven times…</p> 
 <p>Moments later, the light dissipated, and sixteen characters floated quietly in mid-air.</p> 
 <p>‘Demon star makes appearance, turbulence arises among dragons, life thrives in death, the trapped dragon ascends’</p> 
 <p>Gradually, the colorful characters slowly faded, leaving a stunned Bai Xiaofei and Heartseer staring at one another.</p> 
 <p>“What does that mean?” Bai Xiaofei asked. And this was the first time Heartseer was rendered clueless by such a question.</p> 
 <p>He didn’t know either!</p> 
 <p>“The divination needs to be inferred from the actual situation to fully understand. I know almost nothing about the situation here in Starnet, so I don’t know what it refers to. However, since Master Revelation drew it especially for you, it must be related to you. Only you can read this divination!”</p> 
 <p>Throwing out a heap of professional knowledge, Heartseer successfully kicked back the ball and conveniently blocked out all possibilities of Bai Xiaofei kicking it to him again. Now that was some strong deflecting skill!</p> 
 <p>Whispering the divination again and again, Bai Xiaofei’s frown deepened and deepened. Even a fool could see that this wasn’t a good sign, with turbulence and death mentioned. However, he really couldn't connect it with his current situation in any way.</p> 
 <p>He didn’t have a clue what the demon star was. It wasn’t hard to guess the dragons to be all the big shots who had gathered in Starnet right now, but at the last two phrases, not a single clue either.</p> 
 <p><em>Life thrives in death, the trapped dragon ascends? Could it be that something life-threatening will happen?!</em></p> 
 <p>Thinking this, Bai Xiaofei gulped hard.</p> 
 <p><em>Something bad is really going to happen during the celebration!</em></p>
