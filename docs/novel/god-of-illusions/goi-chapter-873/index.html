 <p>Chapter 873: Sunder Everything!</p> 
 <p>After the three Bodies of Seven Evil appeared, the remaining assassins retreated at the same time, looking as if they were afraid of being involved.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei smiled. <em>Bodies of murderous intent? Can it compare with resentment, with demonic energy?</em></p> 
 <p>Injecting his brand-new energy into Mind Sunder, Bai Xiaofei didn’t even activate its ability to sever element memory, but the saber already emitted a bone-chilling cold. He watched as the three fiends shot toward him while condensing their murderous intent into sickles, making them look like grim reapers. </p> 
 <p>“Demonic fire of resentment, freeze!”</p> 
 <p>The demonic fire of grievances was an energy that Bai Xiaofei created from his new energy. It was based on the Demonic God of Pain’s demonic energy and the resentment of the black bead, combined with Golden Feather’s fire to create a chilling, icy flame.</p> 
 <p>As the saber hacked horizontally, a pale blue glow spread out, turning the three fearless fiends into ice sculptures, which quickly eroded under the influence of demonic energy and grievances.</p> 
 <p>After this attack, Bai Xiaofei thrust Mind Sunder into the ground.</p> 
 <p>“The only troublesome thing is the formation, but formations are useless against me now,” he declared, and Mind Sunder’s ability was finally launched.</p> 
 <p>A unique wave swept through the formation, which instantly collapsed!</p> 
 <p>“No matter how strong your formation is, it must have a foundation. When the foundation goes down, so does your formation. What are you going to do next? If you don’t think of something, you will all die here,” Bai Xiaofei commented as if he would give Bu Jing time to think of a way out, but his movement did not slow.</p> 
 <p>He suddenly leaped off the ground and disappeared from the battlefield. The next second, a crimson glow spread.</p> 
 <p>“Burn everything, Lethal Phoenix Flame!”</p> 
 <p>From within the crimson glow, threads of flames pierced through the assassins. Their bodies started to melt into pools of blood.</p> 
 <p>Night Charm’s toxicity was unblockable!</p> 
 <p>Seeing the situation spin out of his control in just a blink of an eye and Mind Sunder in Bai Xiaofei’s hand, Bu Jing knew it was over for him.</p> 
 <p>“You guys really let me down. I thought you could offer more than this pathetically short fight. Your restraint of my puppets and the Endless State is timing out as well. I’m too lazy to play with you. Remember, don’t be a Shadow Death member in your next life,” said Bai Xiaofei as he put away Mind Sunder, which was no longer necessary.</p> 
 <p>Blackie launched Virtual Reality and Bai Xiaofei’s energy flowed from the ground into Bu Jing’s body through his feet. Having no chance to resist, Bu Jing evaporated.</p> 
 <p>From the moment Bai Xiaofei made his move, it took less than 30 seconds to bring the fight to an end.</p> 
 <p>“Oh dear, I’m really a little too strong. I wish someone could tell me where the Shadow Death headquarters is!” Bai Xiaofei sighed as he spread his wings and flew in the direction of the imperial city.</p> 
 <p><em>Oh, how lonely being invincible is!</em></p> 
 <p>“He is getting stronger again, more and more difficult to deal with.” Two figures tore open space and stepped out not long after Bai Xiaofei left.</p> 
 <p>“Compared with you, Master, he is still far away,” the other person said matter-of-factly, with no flattery in their tone.</p> 
 <p>“Now you can be at ease. Bu Jing couldn’t kill him, and I reckon that the headquarters won’t casually target him after this. As far as his current situation is concerned, unless a Blood Song assassin is sent, whoever comes for him will just die,” said the first person.</p> 
 <p>The second person bowed their head.</p> 
 <p>“The Lord is about to come out of closed-door cultivation. This is the last time I accompany you to see him. If you can’t break away from your current state, even I won’t be able to protect your life when the Lord finds out. Take care of yourself.” The first person patted the other on the shoulder before fading into thin air along with his last words, “A month, but you must not reveal your identity. After a month, you must turn back into Blood Shadow!”</p> 
 <p>The second person kept her head bowed respectfully. “I remember Master’s teachings!”</p> 
 <p>…</p> 
 <p>Approaching the main entrance of the imperial city, Bai Xiaofei sorted out his current situation, which was giving him a headache.</p> 
 <p>First of all, Shadow Death was able to get the news of him coming out so quickly, which suggested that someone within the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain was colluding with Shadow Death, or that person was a member of Shadow Death. This could be a lead to the human puppet matter. As long as that person was found, the investigation would have a breakthrough.</p> 
 <p>Secondly, Hai Jun was certainly still waiting to retaliate.</p> 
 <p>Although Hai Jun was nothing to worry about, the Hai clan was still the second most powerful in Ethereal. Bai Xiaofei dared not jump to conclusions and underestimate the influence it held. He had grown much stronger, indeed, but the previous masters of Mind Sunder all died to their overconfidence. He did not want to follow in their footsteps.</p> 
 <p>Finally, Lan Qiushuang. He needed to ask her to know more about his father and where he had been during his five-year disappearance.</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei got lost in thought, he began to regret that he didn’t bring more people with him to spare himself the trouble of having to deal with so many things at once…</p> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei arrived at the city gate, he was greeted with a familiar face.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai! I knew you would be fine! Hahaha!”</p> 
 <p>Taken into a big bear hug by an excited Yun Tianhe, Bai Xiaofei felt a little awkward.</p> 
 <p>“Big Bro, so many people are watching, you will give them wild ideas about our relationship.”</p> 
 <p>Saying anything else would have been useless, but not this. Yun Tianhe instantly loosened his hold and coughed in embarrassment.</p> 
 <p>“Ahem, erm, hey… put the Moon Beck Pavilion on hold and come with me to my house. It’s been turned upside down because of your matter!” saying this, he grabbed Bai Xiaofei and ran as if his butt was on fire.</p> 
 <p>“Big Bro, Big Bro! Explain please, I can’t possibly be that influential yet,” cried Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe did not feel that he could explain this clearly in words. He replied, “When you arrive, you will understand. I don’t know why, but my mother went crazy and started a fight with my old man. If you hadn’t come out alive, my home would probably be destroyed.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei immediately widened his eyes. He was going to meet Lan Qiushuang!</p>
