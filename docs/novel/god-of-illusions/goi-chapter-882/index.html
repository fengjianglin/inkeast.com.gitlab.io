 <p>Chapter 882: Yun Lan!</p> 
 <p>“Please wait!”</p> 
 <p>Just as Bai Xiaofei and Tan Xin were about to leave the Yun residence, a well-dressed elder suddenly hurried out and stopped them.</p> 
 <p>“You are…?” Bai Xiaofei looked at the panting old man in confusion.</p> 
 <p>“Nice to meet you, Mister Bai. I am the master’s butler, you can call me A’Fu. My master would like to see you, I wonder if you find it convenient.”</p> 
 <p>The tone of the old man was polite, but Bai Xiaofei instantly tensed.</p> 
 <p>To be called ‘the master’ in the Yun clan, it could be no one else besides Yun Lan, Yun Tianhe’s father. Being Yun Lan’s butler meant this old man was the housekeeper of the entire Yun residence. Very few in this imperial city dared to not give him face.</p> 
 <p>“You are too polite, Uncle Fu. Since General Yun wants to see me, this one is naturally obliged,” Bai Xiaofei agreed with a smile.</p> 
 <p>Uncle Fu immediately gestured for him to enter.</p> 
 <p>Following Uncle Fu, Bai Xiaofei sorted out all the information he had on Yun Lan and formed a rough judgment of this legendary senior.</p> 
 <p>Yun Lan, one of the five meritorious generals of the Ethereal Empire, gained his reputation in a counterattack battle many years ago and became one of the right-hand men of the Great Emperor.</p> 
 <p>Very few could rival him, an Exquisite Rank Onslaught Stream puppet master and the owner of the Bright Moon Spear. Although Ethereal hadn’t had wars in recent years and Yun Lan rarely had a chance to display his power again, his position in the empire only rose day by day as the Yun clan gradually became the top of the four great clans.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei really could not guess why such a character would want to see him.</p> 
 <p>Before long, Bai Xiaofei and Tan Xin were taken to their destination.</p> 
 <p>“Miss, our madam has organized a banquet in the side hall. She would like to thank you for saving our young master last night,” Uncle Fu said to Tan Xin.</p> 
 <p>Despite being obviously dismissed, Tan Xin could not find any fault with Uncle Fu’s respectful attitude.</p> 
 <p>“Xin’er, go,” said Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin, whose temper had long deflated, obediently followed a servant to the side hall, while Bai Xiaofei followed Uncle Fu into Yun Lan’s study.</p> 
 <p>“Master, Mister Bai is here.”</p> 
 <p>Uncle Fu introduced Bai Xiaofei into the inner room where a spirited-looking middle-aged man came out to greet them. If it weren’t for his slightly gray sideburns, one would not be able to tell that this man was a veteran in his fifties.</p> 
 <p>“Seeing is believing, indeed! As expected of the leader of Starnet’s miracle generation, your aura is already on another level!”</p> 
 <p>Yun Lan’s opening remark was straightforward and generous, making Bai Xiaofei feel very comfortable.</p> 
 <p>As Yun Lan exchanged courtesies with Bai Xiaofei, Uncle Fu had unknowingly withdrawn from the room.</p> 
 <p>“You flatter me, Senior. I am just an ordinary person, while your name is really like thunder to my ears.” Bai Xiaofei lost to no one in flattery. He could keep up with this kind of talk for a whole day.</p> 
 <p>“You have a bright future, young man. Your mouth alone is formidable.” Yun Lan patted Bai Xiaofei on the shoulder. Then, his expression became serious. “I heard from Tianhe that you are very interested in the human puppet matter?”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei also grew serious. Compared with idle nonsense, he preferred to get down to business.</p> 
 <p>“Not just interested, I’m determined to solve it. I will definitely make it the stepping stone for Brother Tianhe!” Bai Xiaofei’s tone was firm.</p> 
 <p>Yun Lan was puzzled. “If I’m not wrong, you didn’t know Tianhe before. Aren’t you a little too nice to him?” Yun Lan was not the hot-headed Yun Tianhe. He didn’t dare to have any negligence toward his son’s matter.</p> 
 <p>“It’s true that we’ve only just met. However, whether you believe it or not, Senior, I find Brother Tianhe very likable. I’m the kind of person who only acts according to my mood, and reputation in Ethereal doesn’t mean anything to me.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei mixed in the truth with some lies, but Yun Lan could not tell which was which.</p> 
 <p>“Little friend, do you think I’d believe that?” Yun Lan was even more extreme than Bai Xiaofei. Since he could not tell the difference between true and false, he simply decided not to believe a word!</p> 
 <p>“Senior, it won’t be long before you do.” Bai Xiaofei chortled, exposing his rascally nature.</p> 
 <p>As long as his heart was good, belief was only a matter of time. After all, Bai Xiaofei would not do anything to harm Yun Tianhe, and he also felt sorry for Yun Lan, who had been concealed from the truth for so long and would continue to be in the future…</p> 
 <p>“I now know why my father-in-law thinks so highly of you. You are very good at persuading others.” With a smile, Yun Lan ended his test.</p> 
 <p>“I’m honored by your praise, Senior, but convincing people is only one of the many things I’m good at.” Entering his zone, Bai Xiaofei forgot what modesty was.</p> 
 <p>However, this kind of arrogance was what Yun Lan wanted to see. He would despise those without real strength, let alone believe that they would be of any help to his son.</p> 
 <p>“Onto the human puppet matter, if you need help with your investigation, use this.” Yun Lan took out a token with an ancient form ‘Yun’ character engraved on it. “This is my order token. With it, you can mobilize the Yun army in the capital as well as enter and leave the city at will. The garrison won’t dare to trouble you. However, this thing should be used with caution in the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain so as not to provoke unnecessary disputes.”</p> 
 <p>Accepting the token, Bai Xiaofei looked at Yun Lan with puzzled eyes. “Senior, with all due respect, aren’t you believing in me a little too easily?”</p> 
 <p>Yun Lan laughed. “Hahaha, like what you said, I just find you likable. Moreover, this token is not so easy to hold.” After a brief pause, Yun Lan’s expression grew serious. “Accepting this token means that you completely side with our clan. The Hai and He clansmen will, therefore, stand on the opposite side of you. You may want to consider this and return the token to me if you so decide.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei immediately put away the token.</p> 
 <p>“You are joking, Senior. The things I get my hands on have never been easily returned. As for the Hai and He clan, I have never regarded them as a problem at all.”</p> 
 <p><em>Anyone who stands on the opposite side of my brother will be handled, problem or not!</em></p>
