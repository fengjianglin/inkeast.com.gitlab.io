 <p>Chapter 604: Discussing the Road Ahead!</p> 
 <p>“In any case, we must be careful of this Unify Business. That’s all we can do actually. It is not enough to take them down with such meager evidence,” Lu Lingyun helplessly stated.</p> 
 <p>The big forces were so good at wiping their asses that there were barely any openings to attack them at all, and you might even get yourself hurt while trying to do so.</p> 
 <p>“If they are really related to Shadow Death, we will have a war sooner or later. I will not let this tumor develop!” Gritting his teeth, Bai Xiaofei furiously slapped the table.</p> 
 <p>At the slightest mention of Shadow Death, his mind would be thrown into chaos, not only because of enmity but also because of someone…</p> 
 <p>“Those are all later on. We currently don’t have that strength yet. Quietly developing is the right way.” As the steadiest of the three, Feng Wuhen’s focus was completely different from that of Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Fei, Brother Feng, Brother Lu, can I come in?”</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye’s voice rang out from outside as they were talking. The trio smiled at one another before Bai Xiaofei told him to come in.</p> 
 <p>If Feng Wuhen was an important founder of Illusion Demon, then Fang Ye was potential stock and its future. As Bai Xiaofei had once said to Feng Wuhen, abilities could be tempered, but loyalty must be ranked first in employing people. With Fang Ye, they didn’t have to worry about his loyalty at all.</p> 
 <p>“I’m not late, am I?” A panting Fang Ye smiled awkwardly.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei made space for him on the sofa.</p> 
 <p>“I think you are. We have finished discussing several major matters already!” Bai Xiaofei said with a serious face. Feng Wuhen and Lu Lingyun straightened their faces and played along and while trying hard not to laugh.</p> 
 <p>“I can’t believe what you said. Sister Mengqi, Big Brother Fei lied, didn’t he?”</p> 
 <p>Who was Fang Ye? None of any people around Bai Xiaofei were unfamiliar to him. While he couldn’t read Feng Wuhen and Lu Lingyun, he knew they would play along with Bai Xiaofei’s tricks. However, Rui Mengqi would never!</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know! Just now they were talking about the Globe Merchant Group and cake something… That’s right! Unify Business was also mentioned,” a clueless Rui Mengqi listed the fragmented information with a serious thinking expression. “Err… I only remember so much.”</p> 
 <p>At her finishing remark, Fang Ye, who was full of confidence one second ago, despaired. He expected her honesty but forgot her torturous way of communication. The information he got left him even more stupefied.</p> 
 <p>“Hahahahaha! I can’t, I just can’t!” Lu Lingyun was the first to lose control at seeing Fang Ye’s bitter face and burst out laughing. When Rui Mengqi spoke, it was already really hard not to laugh.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei patted Fang Ye’s shoulder and shook his head with a sympathetic look. <em>Now you know why I’m scared of this silly girl!</em></p> 
 <p>“We discussed the external situation and briefly talked about the current situation of Illusion Demon, nothing too important.” Feng Wuhen neatly cleared it out in a sentence. Fang Ye’s uneasy heart was put at ease.</p> 
 <p>“That’s good. That’s good. I thought I’d have to take a catch-up lesson again.” Heaving a long sigh of relief, Fang Ye’s understanding of Bai Xiaofei was once again deepened. Sure enough, it did no harm to keep one’s guard up against Bai Xiaofei at all times!</p> 
 <p>“Alright, alright, no more nonsense. Since we are all here, let’s get to business.” Bai Xiaofei laughed and brought the meeting back on track. “Talking about development, Big Brother Feng, what happened to the gun puppet I gave you before?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei paid considerable attention to this matter. After witnessing the power of Fang Ye’s gun puppet, he had been preoccupied with the idea of forming a defensive force composed of gun puppets, and this idea was strengthened after the establishment of Illusion Demon. Therefore, he had made such a request to Shang Youdao back in Ancient Yue.</p> 
 <p>Although there was not a single useful gun puppet army in every empire, Bai Xiaofei just knew he was not the only one who realized that piling up the number of gun puppet masters would make a qualitative change.</p> 
 <p>In other words, he firmly believed that this kind of army had definitely been formed before in this continent, at least the Ethereal Empire must have had one. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have imposed restrictions on the mass purchase of gun puppets.</p> 
 <p>“After I returned to the merchant group, I started to pay attention to taking in homeless orphans and picked out those who met our standards of mindset and character, then had them trained in the direction of an armed force. However, the outside world can’t compare to Starnet. There are not many people qualified to teach about puppets. So far, I’ve only found three after all the screenings,” Feng Wuhen lamented with a sigh. This progress was really too slow.</p> 
 <p>“It’s already good there’s a harvest. After our merchant group expands, the speed of recruitment will naturally rise. With a large enough foundation, we will have enough manpower sooner or later, so you should focus on purchasing gun puppets.” Bai Xiaofei was actually optimistic. After all, he had no need for this power yet.</p> 
 <p>“We’ve never stopped gathering gun puppets. Since Ethereal doesn’t release many while imposing so many restrictions, it’s always a good idea to be prepared.” Feng Wuhen’s cool head was once again displayed. Excellent people were excellent in any situation.</p> 
 <p>“In any case, the children can be trained in the direction of a core armed force. Even if they can’t use puppets, becoming a martial artist would still be a great help. As for the rest of the security force, I won’t interfere, you guys definitely know better than me.” Bai Xiaofei was not the kind of leader who meddled in everything. He only cared about important parts because he knew that meddling too much was harmful to the collective.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, it’s an easy matter.” Feng Wuhen smiled, very pleased with Bai Xiaofei’s decentralization of power.</p> 
 <p>“In fact, I called you back this time to discuss with you about opening a shop in Starnet. I don’t know what kind of business we are doing now, so I think it’s better that I leave it to you,” saying this, Bai Xiaofei took out the store deeds he got from Chu Qingtian.</p> 
 <p>The two stores that Chu Qingtian gave him weren’t large as all the big ones were taken by the major merchant groups, but his two stores were in good areas, which made up for their sizes.</p> 
 <p>“Fang Ye and I will take care of this,” Lu Lingyun volunteered and accepted the deeds with a meaningful smile. “I’ve actually long thought about opening a store in Starnet.”</p> 
 <p>“Why, Big Brother Lu, you have other ideas?”</p>
