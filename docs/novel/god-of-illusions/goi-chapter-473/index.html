 <p>Chapter 473: Discussion; Hunting Bai Xiaofei!</p> 
 <p>Absence makes the heart grow fonder. Bai Xiaofei now had the deepest experience of this sentence.</p> 
 <p>He took the initiative, but it was only the beginning. Hu Xian’er showed him with actions how powerful the body of a magical beast was!</p> 
 <p>From twilight to late in the evening when they finally stopped, Bai Xiaofei felt hollow as if all his strength had been drained. Without the help of the origin core in his body, he found himself really no match for Hu Xian’er…</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei ‘lost’ very willingly!</p> 
 <p>Nestled up in Bai Xiaofei’s arms like a kitten, Hu Xian’er savored the aftertaste of the crazy match as her fingers circled on his chest.</p> 
 <p>“I’m feeling a bit surreal.” In this tender atmosphere, Hu Xian’er suddenly said something that confused Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“What do you mean?” he foolishly asked, then looked sideways at Hu Xian’er rosy face under the faint moonlight. She looked particularly attractive.</p> 
 <p>“Before, I thought I could wait a long time for you, but half a year and I already couldn’t bear it. I dreamed of you every night. I’m scared that I won’t be able to control myself from following you once we graduate and have to separate,” said Hu Xian’er with sadness in her voice.</p> 
 <p>It was impossible for them to be with each other all the time. Once Hu Xian’er was strong enough, she would definitely go back to the Endless Mountain Range to manage her Fox clan. Bai Xiaofei also had his own things to do.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, separation was inevitable.</p> 
 <p>In fact, if it weren’t for the fact that Bai Xiaofei was here in Starnet, she would have already killed her way back to the Endless Mountain Range. Although her current strength wasn’t enough to compete with Emperor Rank magical beasts, she had no problem protecting herself.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t be silly, I can help you solve your problems and then do other stuff, then we don’t have to be separated.” Bai Xiaofei pinched her nose, his voice pampering.</p> 
 <p>“No, I don’t need it!”</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er’s decisive answer stunned Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Why? Are you afraid that I’d be in danger?” asked Bai Xiaofei in confusion.</p> 
 <p>“No, the situation of the Endless Mountain Range is far more complicated than you think. What we saw last time was only the tip of the iceberg. Also, you have your own things to do. Sister Liuyun will graduate soon, and Liu Li and the others will leave the academy before us. They have to wait much longer than me. You can’t make them wait indefinitely.”</p> 
 <p>When Hu Xian’er finished, Bai Xiaofei’s face was complicated.</p> 
 <p>There was nothing he could say to deny her words as she couldn’t be more right. Chu Liuyun and the girls were willing to entrust their everything to him. He could not let them down.</p> 
 <p>Sometimes, the more benefits one enjoyed, the more responsibilities they had to shoulder.</p> 
 <p>“I will find you as soon as possible…” Bai Xiaofei’s voice instantly weakened. He just couldn’t use lies to comfort his woman.</p> 
 <p>“Look at you, do you really have to make that face? We still have three years! Why do you make it look like we are going to separate soon?” Hu Xian’er burst out laughing. Bai Xiaofei’s seriousness amused her immensely.</p> 
 <p>“Eh… wasn’t it you who mentioned it first?” Bai Xiaofei was a little embarrassed. Looking at Hu Xian’er, who couldn’t stop laughing, an evil smile flashed on his face.</p> 
 <p>“Laughing at me, huh? Prepare for the punishment from your husband!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei once again flung himself upon her as she exclaimed in surprise. This time, he mobilized the energy in his origin core…</p> 
 <p>The night slowly passed with Hu Xian’er’s ceaseless moaning of ecstasy, which made Bai Xiaofei happy and the others in the Demon of Illusions suffer. No one could sleep that night, except Yun Sheng who had already moved out…</p> 
 <p>Now that they thought about it, it was really for Yun Sheng’s own well-being that he moved out. After all, this was no living environment for single dogs.</p> 
 <p>Early the next morning, a refreshed Bai Xiaofei woke up early while Hu Xian’er was stuck in bed. Reality once again proved that there was a price for provoking him!</p> 
 <p>Because of last night’s madness, Bai Xiaofei wasn’t so shameless as to face Chu Liuyun and the others right away. Therefore, he ran to the Hundred Flavor House and bought breakfast for himself and Hu Xian’er.</p> 
 <p>It was fortunate for him that he did, so he didn’t have to know that Leng Liushuang didn’t get up at all in the morning, and with thick dark eye circles, the Leng sisters started a heated discussion in their room.</p> 
 <p>“You guys all heard it last night, right?” Leng Liuying’s eyes swirled. Her embarrassed tone was laced with a hint of mischief as she even gulped when she spoke.</p> 
 <p>At her question, Leng Liushuang flushed red while Leng Liuli grew alarmed.</p> 
 <p>“What are you planning to do?” The one who asked was Leng Liuli, as Leng Liushuang just couldn’t raise this kind of question. Although the triplets looked exactly alike, their personalities were completely different.</p> 
 <p>When they were together, they formed a beautiful picture even if they did nothing.</p> 
 <p>“You tell me. We’ve even given away all our tokens, but have we made any progress with that guy for so long? Aren’t you scared that he’d forget us once we graduate?” asked Leng Liuying seriously, looking as if they all had suffered a big loss.</p> 
 <p>“No, Xiaofei won’t forget us,” Leng Liushuang defended, but what she got in return was an exaggerated eye-roll from Leng Liuying.</p> 
 <p>“Second Sister, you always look on the bright side of things. Did you forget that time you were cheated of two thousand gold coins by a beggar when you were a child? If we hadn’t made up for it with our own pocket money, Imperial Father would have beaten you good.” Leng Liuying brought up a dark past that immediately silenced Leng Liushuang.</p> 
 <p>“What are we going to do then?” Leng Liuli asked again.</p> 
 <p>Leng Liuying’s eyes flashed with a hint of craftiness.</p> 
 <p>“Take the initiative and strike! Make him unable to forget us for the rest of his life!”</p> 
 <p>Leng Liuli and Leng Liushuang swallowed.</p> 
 <p>“How… how are we gonna do that?” asked Leng Liushuang with a mix of anxiety and expectation.</p> 
 <p>“What else? Dealing with a perverted wolf, of course we’ll scratch his itch. You guys have confidence in yourself, right?” Leng Liuying looked like she wasn’t afraid to make a big fuss.</p> 
 <p>“But, we can’t lose, lose our virginity…” Leng Liushuang stuttered, her face was as red as an apple.</p> 
 <p>“Are you silly, Second Sister? Don’t you know that for men, it’s already enough that we just stand there? We only need to move a little bit and he’d definitely behave as told.” Leng Liuying was full of confidence as if she already predicted everything.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, let’s do as you say!” agreed Leng Liuli resolutely after some silence.</p> 
 <p>A hunt for Bai Xiaofei had begun!</p>
