 <p>Chapter 846: Tan Xin’s Ability; Bai Xiaofei’s Plan!</p> 
 <p>Gawking as Tan Xin blocked both attackers at the same time, the three helpless puppet masters, for the first time in their lives, felt good to be called a dog!</p> 
 <p>“And here I thought you were an Exquisite puppet master, but this is all you got!” One of the two attackers sneered despite his blow being blocked and vanished on the spot.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the other one activated his puppet and it turned into a monster three meters tall!</p> 
 <p>These two were an Assassin Stream and a Transformation Stream puppet masters. Bai Xiaofei frowned and there was a hint of worry on his face. He did not know exactly how strong Tan Xin was.</p> 
 <p>However, recalling how she was able to restrain Yu Linfeng, a nine-aperture Exquisite Rank, his worry quickly eased.</p> 
 <p>“Talk about ignorance.” With a smile, Tan Xin snapped her fingers.</p> 
 <p>The next second, the Transformation Stream puppet master flew backward with a loud bang, while the Assassin Stream was forced out of his stealth and fell heavily right in front of Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The man was foul enough to target Bai Xiaofei during his stealth state.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin’s move shocked not only the attackers and the spectators. Even Bai Xiaofei froze a little.</p> 
 <p><em>Ling Tianxia’s sonic boom?! How did she do it?!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei still had not escaped his shock when Tan Xin made another move. In a flash, Tan Xin emerged from the shadow of the Assassin Stream puppet master and kicked him in his abdomen, directly destroying his foundation as a puppet master. Even a Grandmaster Rank was vulnerable to such an attack as the gap in their power was too huge.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei swallowed with difficulty. What Tan Xin had just used was Wang Hang’s ability, the one that he got after getting the Ghosting!</p> 
 <p>“F*cking die!!!”</p> 
 <p>Seeing his teammate wrecked, the other puppet master erupted. His body glowed red as he shot toward Tan Xin.</p> 
 <p>Reacting to this, Tan Xin knelt on one knee and stretched forward her right arm. Then, with a mechanical sound, the arm turned into a long gun that Bai Xiaofei couldn’t be more familiar with – Into Oblivion!</p> 
 <p>A black beam shot out from the muzzle. The moment it hit, the Transformation Stream puppet master fell dead silent, and half a second later was blown into nothingness.</p> 
 <p>By that time, Bai Xiaofei had a rough understanding of Tan Xin’s ability. It was replication. Not the simple kind either. The abilities adjusted according to her power. That was to say, her Into Oblivion attack was even stronger than the original!</p> 
 <p>Thinking to this point, Bai Xiaofei gulped again. He always knew Tan Xin was not simple, but he did not expect her ability to be such a BUG!</p> 
 <p>At the same time, another doubt arose. When he saw Tan Xin fight before, her style was not like this. Were her previous abilities also replicated?</p> 
 <p><em>Can it be… the replication can be retained?!!</em></p> 
 <p>Hit by one shocking question after another, Bai Xiaofei still chose to set them aside. In any case, he had plenty of time to get to know her in the future.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Tan Xin had returned to her normal appearance. She walked back to Bai Xiaofei and said to the three stunned puppet masters, “You three can continue.”</p> 
 <p>Returning to their senses, the three looked mercilessly at the shocked First young master. <em>Who wanted us dead just now again?</em></p> 
 <p>Seizing the opportunity to take revenge, two of them grabbed the First young master’s arms and jerked. Two crunches echoed along with the guy’s piercing cry.</p> 
 <p>The two puppet masters were not done yet. Raising their feet, they kicked the First young masters at the knees. Another two crunches rang out as the poor guy had all four limbs crippled.</p> 
 <p>“Take all the valuable things from him and throw him out. As for where he plans to beg for a living in the future, it will be his own business.” When it comes to being merciless, Bai Xiaofei was an expert. His nonchalant sentence made the crowd in the hall break out into a cold sweat.</p> 
 <p>They had begun to rejoice that they had returned within the ten minutes.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, someone was trembling in fury. It was the fat branch president as he listened to his son’s screams. However, there was nothing he could do.</p> 
 <p>The First young master was only the beginning. After him, the direct family of the branch president also received their ‘rewards’ for being late. Although not everyone was crippled, the three puppet masters were not stingy with their cruelty toward those who dared to resist.</p> 
 <p>After the matter was completely handled, a whole hour had passed. For the majority of the people in the lobby, it had been the longest hour of their existence.</p> 
 <p>Especially the branch president.</p> 
 <p>He had thoroughly experienced the threat Bai Xiaofei had said before. His anger currently only accounted for a small part of his emotional fluctuations. Most of it was despair, so much so that the pain in his body could not even reach his brain.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei, however, had no intention of stopping yet. He was using Yun Ni’s appearance. If he did not pull the grass from the roots, Yun Ni’s family would be in trouble in the future, which was not what Bai Xiaofei wanted to see.</p> 
 <p>Therefore…</p> 
 <p>“You lot. Are you sure you’ve done as I said? Are you sure no one among you is hiding something for themselves?” Bai Xiaofei asked slowly and casually.</p> 
 <p>The already shaking crowd started oozing sweat.</p> 
 <p>“Great Young Miss, I admit I hid some money. Please give me a chance to redeem myself, I’ll go and get it!!!”</p> 
 <p>“Yes, yes, and me!!”</p> 
 <p>“Me too!!”</p> 
 <p>“Great Young Miss, please give this little one a chance!”</p> 
 <p>It didn’t take long for the whole room to kneel down, banging their foreheads on the floor. However, Bai Xiaofei’s response was a sneer.</p> 
 <p>“See? Do you know what people do when they are desperate now? Do you know what your previous happiness was based on now?” He looked at the branch president. However, these words were not to seek repentance from the latter; it was to trigger him.</p> 
 <p>“Since you lot admit your wrongs sincerely, I will give you a chance. However, you won’t escape lightly!” Bai Xiaofei’s icy voice made everyone tighten. Then, he announced their sentence. “Tan Xin, one finger from each!”</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin immediately moved, a series of crisp sounds rang as everyone’s left little finger exploded into a cloud of blood.</p> 
 <p>They rolled around in pain, but one person endured the pain and crawled toward Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you, Great Young Miss, for sparing my life!”</p> 
 <p>Looking at the person, Bai Xiaofei’s lips curled up. “What’s your name?”</p>
