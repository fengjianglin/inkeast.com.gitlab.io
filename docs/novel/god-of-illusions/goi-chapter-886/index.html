 <p>Chapter 886: Shocking!</p> 
 <p>The huge movements of the Yun army were immediately known by the whole imperial city, sparking all sorts of opinions.</p> 
 <p>More than one minister openly denounced the Yun clan in court, but Yun Lan only replied to them with two words, ‘Daily training.’</p> 
 <p>Domineering, but Yun Lan was qualified to be so. Whether the others believed his reason or not had nothing to do with him. Either way, he’d still benefit!</p> 
 <p>As the emperor turned a blind eye to Yun Lan’s actions, the city was thrown into confusion leading to a chain reaction – any person with a little influence suddenly became active.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the one who started it was doing something completely unrelated: Investigating the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain!</p> 
 <p>In order to do this, Bai Xiaofei had prepared for nearly a month. First, he sought out Ling Ge, with the help of whom he got an imperial edict to investigate. However, due to the particularity of the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain, he still could not act recklessly.</p> 
 <p>In fact, his so-called investigation was only a cover to lure an enemy out, and the bait was Yun Tianhe…</p> 
 <p>“Absolutely not! I will not agree! Who do you think I am? How can I ruin Ling Ge’s life for personal gain?!” Yun Tianhe was on the verge of erupting in his room.</p> 
 <p>“You think this is for your sake? Also, what makes you think this will ruin Ling Ge’s life? Do you know how happy she was when I told her about it?” Bai Xiaofei was not frightened at all, his tone was so indifferent that it drove Yun Tianhe crazy.</p> 
 <p>“You’re telling me that I understand it wrong? You’re using this opportunity to investigate the human puppet problem and then let me have all the credit as the stepping stone to marry Ling Ge, am I right? What is this if not a joke?!” Yun Tianhe still could not calm down at all.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had already anticipated his reaction. He said, “I talked to Mu Yun, and she met with Ling Ge after. I don’t know what they talked about, but after Ling Ge left, Mu Yun asked me to tell you something.”</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe froze, asking with complex emotions, “What did she say?”</p> 
 <p>To tell the truth, he could only be sure that he was in love with Mu Yun. As for Ling Ge, he didn’t even know what the feeling he had for her was.</p> 
 <p>“She said that if you refuse to marry Ling Ge, you won’t see her for the rest of your life,” replied Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe was stuck for nearly ten minutes after this. Then, he said dejectedly, “Lil’ Bro, I know you are smart and you have your ways, but if it were you in my shoes, would you be able to accept such a thing? Don’t you think it’s cruel to Ling Ge? I’m not even sure if I like her! I don’t want to hurt her!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei walked to him and patted his shoulder.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know if I would, but I’m sure you already like Ling Ge, you just think that it would wrong Mu Yun. However, we all know that’s not the case anymore. As for Ling Ge, she just wants to be with you, as the simplest wish of a girl and not a princess. She cares not about other people’s opinions nor if this is sorry for her, she just wants to be with you. The process does not matter, she only cares about the result. In her words, to be able to become yours and also help you realize something big, she doesn’t mind doing such ‘killing two birds with one stone’ thing several times over.”</p> 
 <p>After a brief pause, Bai Xiaofei gazed at Yun Tianhe.</p> 
 <p>“For such a girl like that, it only wrongs her if you keep hesitating like this.”</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe sank into deep silence.</p> 
 <p>“Take your time and consider this well. She said she is willing to wait for you forever.”</p> 
 <p>With that, Bai Xiaofei walked out, leaving Yun Tianhe alone in the room. Outside, Tan Xin had been waiting while listening to their conversation. As soon as she saw Bai Xiaofei come out, she shot him a disdainful look.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go, let’s talk about it later and leave my dear brother to his thoughts.” Bai Xiaofei’s implication was obvious: What Tan Xin wanted to say would definitely affect Yun Tianhe’s judgment. Therefore, whatever she wanted to argue about, only do it after they walked far away enough.</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, Tan Xin was quick to understand him and swallowed back her speech for half a day after they left.</p> 
 <p>“You are really good at brainwashing people, and a large part of what you said was made up! I still remember what Ling Ge said very clearly.”</p> 
 <p>Facing Tan Xin’s complaints, Bai Xiaofei smiled calmly.</p> 
 <p>“I admit that it was indeed brainwashing, but I don’t quite acknowledge the second half. It was not made up but summed up from reasonable inference. I believe that was exactly what Ling Ge wanted to say.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was confident with his conclusion. Tan Xin was about to continue, but he suddenly turned around and said, “Besides, no one would want to hurt a woman who loves a man with all her heart, right? Do you want to see Ling Ge marry someone she doesn’t like at all?”</p> 
 <p>With that, Bai Xiaofei strode ahead. Behind him, Tan Xin took a while to come to her senses and looked at his back with a cold snort.</p> 
 <p>“So formidable when talking about other people’s affairs, aren’t you? Don’t I count as one of those women who loves a man with all her heart?!’”</p> 
 <p>However, Tan Xin fell silent after saying this. After all, she was after him with a purpose…</p> 
 <p><em>But…</em></p> 
 <p>“Argh! Tan Xin! What’s wrong with you?! You are invincible!! How can you struggle over something so trivial?!” Beating her own head, Tan Xin’s distressed appearance perfectly interpreted what was called having a mental problem…</p> 
 <p>However, this was the first time she realized one thing – Maybe she was wrong…</p> 
 <p>Only three days after the conversation between Bai Xiaofei and Yun Tianhe, the seriously ill emperor announced that Princess Ling Ge would be married to Yun Tianhe, the First young master of the Yun clan, in a week.</p> 
 <p>The already turbulent imperial city was thrown into even more chaos. The more patient people who had been watching from the sideline were gradually unable to sit still…</p>
