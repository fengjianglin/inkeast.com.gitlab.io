 <p>Chapter 723: Arrogant or Powerful?!</p> 
 <p>“Who are you? What is this place?”</p> 
 <p>In a colorful glass space, Bai Xiaofei looked at the stunning woman in front of him in confusion. Behind her, nine colorful tails swayed softly. Her beauty gave him trouble finding words, which he had only experienced when he first met Lin Li.</p> 
 <p>“This is your sea of consciousness. As for who I am, don’t bother. You’ll know sooner or later,” replied the woman without any emotion.</p> 
 <p>“My sea of consciousness?!” Bai Xiaofei exclaimed in shock as he quickly scanned the space. It was not the first time he had entered his own sea of consciousness, but it was the first time he saw this appearance.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t be surprised, it only became like this because of me. Without some reinforcement, it wouldn’t be able to withstand my power.”</p> 
 <p>Her words dealt a painful blow to Bai Xiaofei’s dignity.</p> 
 <p>“So you are here to…?” Bai Xiaofei gulped. He tried to probe the woman’s strength, only to find that his spirit was unable to leave his body despite this being his territory.</p> 
 <p>“For that pest outside. I accidentally let it escape a long time ago, so I came to dispose of it.” The woman’s tone was bland. She didn’t take the demon king, who rendered Bai Xiaofei’s group completely helpless, seriously at all.</p> 
 <p>“Pest?! You mean the Heavenly Demon King?!” Bai Xiaofei was in disbelief. <em>If the demon king is a pest, then what am I, a useless insect?!</em></p> 
 <p>For the first time in his life, Bai Xiaofei was uncertain about his own strength.</p> 
 <p>“Of course. If it hadn’t been cunning enough to hide, I would have destroyed it hundreds of years ago.”</p> 
 <p>One sentence successfully struck Bai Xiaofei dizzy as his worldview was completely overturned. <em>Hundreds of years ago?! People can live so long? And you don’t look it at all!</em></p> 
 <p>“Then why don’t you just kill him directly? Why come into my sea of consciousness?” As Bai Xiaofei asked this question, he suddenly realized a problem. There was always weird stuff entering his sea of consciousness, making him wonder whether it was his own private space or a public toilet. If he remembered correctly, he had never once entered his sea of consciousness on his own initiative.</p> 
 <p>“Because I can’t. If my true body comes here, your world will be thrown into chaos. I need to borrow your body.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was once again dumbstruck. <em>So this one who looks down on the demon king is only a clone, huh?</em></p> 
 <p>“Why me? In terms of gender and strength, there are more suitable candidates here.” Bai Xiaofei thought of his future mother-in-law, and Leng Liuli was a good choice as well.</p> 
 <p>“In terms of strength, there is no existence in your world that can be my host. You are only possible because you have a medium.”</p> 
 <p>The woman snapped her fingers and what happened next shocked Bai Xiaofei. Blackie, who was resting in his sea of consciousness, happily ran out, her huge body growing smaller and smaller until she became a cute little kitten in the woman’s arms.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei swore that this was the first time he saw Blackie so well-behaved!</p> 
 <p>However, he felt a little better that Huskie didn’t run to the woman together with Blackie, but hid behind Bai Xiaofei’s legs while peeping at the woman with a hint of doubt and fear.</p> 
 <p>“So that’s what happened?” the woman murmured as she stroked Blackie’s head, seeming to have received some information from the cat. Then, her eyes fell upon Huskie and Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Be good to your puppets. They are not your ordinary magical beasts.” The woman put down Blackie.</p> 
 <p>The cat ran back and leaped onto Bai Xiaofei’s shoulder. Bai Xiaofei turned to look at her, only to be greeted with a familiar pair of disdainful eyes.</p> 
 <p><em>Damn it! Changing your attitude so fast?! Where’s that cute little cat just now?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry about it. But, you know Blackie and Huskie?” Bai Xiaofei was not blind to realize something so obvious.</p> 
 <p>“More than just ‘know.’ You will understand our relationship in the future,” the woman said.</p> 
 <p>Then, she shot two beams of light into Bai Xiaofei and Blackie. Bai Xiaofei felt an unprecedented sense of agility erupting in his whole body and then right after, the woman pointed at him and a seven-colored fog flew into his head.</p> 
 <p>The successive actions frightened Bai Xiaofei. Although he could feel that woman meant no harm, the feeling of being forced things into was really bizarre.</p> 
 <p>“I have temporarily changed your physique. There is a droplet of the holy power of faith in your consciousness that you can use now. With Blackie’s help, it won’t be difficult for you to kill that pest, but remember, you only have one chance!” said the woman solemnly, before her expression became indifferent again. “Last advice, the demon king’s energy is useful to you. On another note, when you see that little fox again, tell her I said sorry. If it weren’t for me, her clan would not have fallen to this state.”</p> 
 <p>The woman’s tone was apologetic at the end. Her words reminded Bai Xiaofei of Hu Xian’er and what she had told him about her clan.</p> 
 <p><em>What is the relationship between the two?</em></p> 
 <p>The woman’s appearance brought many questions to Bai Xiaofei and he didn’t know which to ask first.</p> 
 <p>“As a reward for helping me, you can ask me a question, but whether I will answer will depend on my mood,” the woman suddenly said when Bai Xiaofei was still sorting out his thoughts.</p> 
 <p><em>Now that’s capricious!</em></p> 
 <p>After a long while, Bai Xiaofei looked the woman in the eyes and asked stubbornly, “Who are you?!”</p> 
 <p>He must know the answer to this question!</p> 
 <p>The woman was stunned, then she suddenly laughed. “No wonder! No wonder he took a fancy to you! You two are really one of a kind.”</p> 
 <p>Her words made Bai Xiaofei scratch his head in confusion. After she was done laughing, her emotionless expression once again returned. Under Bai Xiaofei’s gaze, her figure gradually faded and an ethereal voice echoed in his sea of consciousness.</p> 
 <p>“Thousands of worlds, thousands of deities,<br> One flower, one wood, one pagoda. <br> Why try to discern what is going on in the world,<br> When time will tell eventually.”</p>
