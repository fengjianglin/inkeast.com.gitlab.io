 <p>Chapter 1017: Start!</p> 
 <p>“I never noticed that Mamba actually looks quite pleasing to the eye.” Looking at Bai Xiaofei, who had turned into a ‘brute,’ Qiu Muxue chuckled.</p> 
 <p>“That’s because I’m the one who controls this body. No matter what I become, I can still move the hearts of countless girls.” Bai Xiaofei proudly raised his head, successfully earning an eye-roll from Qiu Muxue.</p> 
 <p>“Do we still go as planned?” Her expression grew serious. Going to see the five elders was different from seeing Mamba. No one knew what the relationship between these people was like. Moreover, the five elders were old monsters who had crawled out from a river of blood and a mountain of corpses. The extent of how cautious they were was nothing that a fledgling like Mamba could compare.</p> 
 <p>“Or else? Just pack up and go home after all this trouble?” Bai Xiaofei smiled wryly. Although he understood where Qiu Muxue was coming from, he could not agree. “Don’t worry, even if there are ten elders instead of five, I will still handle them all. Let’s go, it won’t be easy to explain if we take too long.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei then turned to leave, but Qiu Muxue stopped him.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t tell me you’re just going back like that?” She glared at the confused Bai Xiaofei. “Don’t forget what Mamba came here for.” She walked to his side and laced her arm with his. “Let’s go, I hope that Mister Captain of the Guard Team will keep me safe this time.”</p> 
 <p>In the face of her smirk, Bai Xiaofei coughed awkwardly.</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>“Captain, you are back!” The members of the Guard Team immediately came up as soon as Bai Xiaofei and Qiu Muxue returned. After the previous matter, they now looked at Qiu Muxue with respect in their eyes. “Greetings, Saintess.”</p> 
 <p>“From today on, the Saintess’s words are my words. If any of you are dissatisfied with that, feel free to come at me!” Bai Xiaofei domineeringly declared, to which none of the Guard Team members dared to challenge.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Bai Xiaofei inwardly heaved a sigh of relief. <em>Lucky me, this brute is harsh enough and taught his group to be so obedient.</em></p> 
 <p>“We obey!” The group of guards knelt down on one knee in unison.</p> 
 <p>During this, Bai Xiaofei quickly shot Lan Shuang a look, and her equally quick response eased his worries.</p> 
 <p>“Depart!” Bai Xiaofei commanded, and the army hit the road.</p> 
 <p>Because of his declaration, no one in the army dared to complain about Qiu Muxue for losing the war. Barbaric Godism was recognized as the overlord of the Sacks and given Mamba’s status, there were very few people who dared to openly go against him.</p> 
 <p>The two-day journey was fleeting. There had been some minor problems along the way, but no irreparable impact had been caused. Under Bai Xiaofei’s deliberate fault-finding, many members of the Guard Team had been replaced by Qiu Muxue’s confidants. Those who were replaced were people who Bai Xiaofei could tell to be secretly dissatisfied with Mamba.</p> 
 <p>Due to Bai Xiaofei’s domineering actions, the rest of the Guard Team began to worry about their positions and therefore didn’t have the heart to resent him.</p> 
 <p>“We will arrive tomorrow. You have to be very careful. From what I know, all the other elders outside Mamba’s father all have other ideas about Mamba’s position as the Guard Team captain,” Qiu Muxue warned with a serious face. This had been her most discussed topic in the past two days.</p> 
 <p>“It would be strange if they didn’t. Since Mamba occupies this position, the Third Elder is the one with the most authority among the five elders,” Bai Xiaofei said, but there was more expectation on his face than worry.</p> 
 <p>“You mean we can take advantage of their discord?” Qiu Muxue immediately caught on.</p> 
 <p>“There is no unending cooperation in this world. As long as there is a suitable opportunity, every party would want to be the dominant side,” Bai Xiaofei whispered.</p> 
 <p>At that moment, the entrance flap of the tent was lifted.</p> 
 <p>“Captain, Saintess,” Lan Shuang respectfully greeted.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei understood what she meant. He shouted to the guards outside, “Stand down, we have something to discuss in private.”</p> 
 <p>Upon his order, the two soldiers standing outside quickly retreated. </p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter?” Qiu Muxue hurriedly asked upon seeing Lan Shuang’s serious expression.</p> 
 <p>“I just received news that the other elders intend to use our defeat to impeach the Third Elder,” Lan Shuang worriedly replied.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei and Qiu Muxue exchanged a look and laughed. <em>Here we go!</em></p> 
 <p>“How can you two still laugh? Don’t you know why this is happening?” Lan Shuang frowned.</p> 
 <p>“You guys were able to deploy thanks to Mamba’s help. Now, since you’ve lost the war, they would naturally pin the blame on Mamba and his father, the Third Elder. Moreover, Mamba intended to protect Senior Sister Muxue, making it even better leverage for the other elders,” said Bai Xiaofei, having speculated everything that had been going on. “Don’t worry, this is not a bad thing for us. Once they fight, they will have no energy to pay attention to us and we can fish in troubled waters.”</p> 
 <p>Looking at Bai Xiaofei’s sleazy smile, the two women actually felt quite… comforted. Sure enough, different points of view resulted in different opinions!</p> 
 <p>“In short, what we have to do next is act according to the situation!” Bai Xiaofei concluded and fell back on the mattress. “It’s getting late. Rest up and save energy to see those elders tomorrow.”</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>The army of only 20,000 left set out early the next morning and arrived at the base of Barbaric Godism in less than half a day.</p> 
 <p>Unlike a land full of tents as one would imagine, the base had been impressively built into a palace and seemed to be still under expansion. Laborers dressed in rags could be seen everywhere, supervised by low-ranked members of Barbaric Godism.</p> 
 <p>“Stop!”</p> 
 <p>The army had just approached the outer wall when a group of around five hundred patrol warriors poured out from the base and stopped them.</p> 
 <p>“Are you blind?! Can’t you see me?!” Bai Xiaofei said coldly.</p> 
 <p>Upon hearing this, the army quickly moved to surround the warriors, ready to attack on Bai Xiaofei’s command.</p> 
 <p>“Lord Mamba, we are only acting under the First Elder’s order. The defeated troops are to join the labor force as their punishment. If you have any objections, please go to the First Elder instead of making it hard on us,” said the leader of the patrol group. Although he spoke politely, it was obvious from his words that he had no scruples about offending Mamba.</p> 
 <p>“Then you can have them, but the Saintess and her attendant are going with me,” said Bai Xiaofei coldly.</p> 
 <p>The patrol leader immediately smiled. “Naturally.”</p> 
 <p>With that, the patrol team had the army disarmed and then hauled them toward the labor area.</p> 
 <p>Seeing them leave, Bai Xiaofei turned to his own Guard Team. “After going in, immediately surround the First Elder, and allow no entry or exit without my command!”</p> 
 <p>This order shocked the Guard Team.</p> 
 <p>“My lord, this…”</p> 
 <p>“Why? My orders don’t matter now? Don’t forget whose people you are!” Bai Xiaofei cut off the speaker, his icy voice making everyone shudder as he exuded a faint murderous intent. “Don’t worry, I, your captain, will shoulder all the consequences. But if the First Elder doesn’t care about the lives of his fellow people and attacks, you know what to do.”</p> 
 <p>The Guard Team members collectively gulped. <em>Is this clan… gonna go through an earthshaking change?</em></p> 
 <p>“Lead the way, I want to see my father,” Bai Xiaofei ordered his personal guards. Taking a deep breath, he inwardly sneered. He had thought the Barbaric Godism had some brains, but now it seemed they lived up to the word ‘barbaric.’ Even the court ministers of a small kingdom were better at scheming than them!</p> 
 <p>Following the guards, Bai Xiaofei and Qiu Muxue headed toward the residence of the Third Elder. While no one was paying attention, Bai Xiaofei secretly released Blackie.</p> 
 <p>Upon arriving, Bai Xiaofei knocked on the door. “Father! I’m back!”</p> 
 <p>There were slow footsteps in the room and a deep voice rang out, “Come in.”</p> 
 <p>Pushing open the door, Bai Xiaofei entered and couldn’t help but stop slightly at what he saw. In front of him was a burly middle-aged man, whose image had nothing to do with the word ‘elder’ at all.</p> 
 <p>“Did you see that woman?” asked the Third Elder. From his tone, he didn’t regard Qiu Muxue very highly.</p> 
 <p>“Yes. She is my woman now!” replied Bai Xiaofei happily, but this answer did not receive the expected result.</p> 
 <p>“As if you ever lack women, don’t you try to use this to threaten your father! Do you know how much trouble this woman has brought upon us?!” The voice of the Third Elder instantly became cold.</p> 
 <p>“So what? Together, no one here can be our opponent! I’m not afraid to tell you that before I came here, I already had my people surround the First Elder’s place!” Bai Xiaofei pouted.</p> 
 <p>The Third Elder was dumbstruck. “What do you want to do?!”</p>
