 <p>Chapter 820: Situation!</p> 
 <p>“From your expression, we should know each other, and it’s very likely that someone close to you died at my hands. But I’m sorry, too many people died at my hands. I’d be exhausted if I have to remember them all.” Sikong Ming looked at the furious Yu Linfeng with a relaxed expression, despite the fact that Yu Linfeng had reached the very peak of the Exquisite Rank.</p> 
 <p>“Letting you know why is enough, I don’t want the likes of you to remember her name!” Yu Linfeng stepped forward, his body emitted a golden light.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s group, who could not be more familiar with this light, widened their eyes. <em>What the hell is going on?! Burning his vitality right off the bat?!</em></p> 
 <p>They weren’t the only ones surprised. Even the relaxed Sikong Ming looked cautious upon this scene.</p> 
 <p>A nine-aperture Exquisite Rank, while having surpassed seven apertures, was never the choice of most people. Once one opened the eighth aperture, it meant that one had given up the opportunity to try to break through to the Legend Rank and chose to strengthen their power as an Exquisite Rank puppet master to the very limit.</p> 
 <p>This was why Sikong Ming looked down on Yu Lingfeng at first.</p> 
 <p>What he did not know was that Yu Linfeng gave up advancing to the Legend Rank not because he didn’t have that talent. On the contrary, Yu Linfeng had already stepped into the seven-aperture realm two years ago, which, at such an age, made him a genius. It would not have been a far-fetched dream for him to try breaking through to the Legend Rank in another decade or two.</p> 
 <p>However, in order to become powerful quickly, he gave up that longer path, just for the opportunity today. To use rank advantage to make up for the talent gap between them, and kill the man in front of him!</p> 
 <p>The man who once appeared beside him as a friend and killed his beloved woman, who, even until the moment she died, still did not want to believe that Sikong Ming was a member of Shadow Death!</p> 
 <p>“City Lord, do you remember what we’ve agreed upon? After so many years, what I’ve done should be enough to fulfill my promise.” Yu Linfeng’s mind was especially clear despite burning his vitality. In order to kill Sikong Ming, he had been fully prepared!</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, no one will disturb you,” Tan Xin said lightly, but her face flashed with a hint of sorrow.</p> 
 <p>Although she had long known that there would be such a day, when it really came, it was impossible to watch someone who had been around her for so many years putting their life at risk without feeling uncomfortable.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin knew, however, that she could not stop Yu Linfeng. It was his obsession.</p> 
 <p>“Insolent!!” Feeling that something was wrong, Sikong Ming finally began to fidget. His seven shuttles shot out at the same time, and the targets were obviously everyone!</p> 
 <p>However, in their flight, the shuttles suddenly collectively steered toward Yu Linfeng!</p> 
 <p>Yu Linfeng’s sword light flashed and his speed peaked in a second. A series of collisions rang out as he parried the shuttles. No matter which way they flew, they could not touch him at all!</p> 
 <p>“Quickly save her!” shouted Tan Xin as her body exuded a dark light, allowing Yu Linfeng to fight without worry. As long as she was present, Sikong Ming could only fight Yu Linfeng, but similarly, no one could attack Sikong Ming except Yu Linfeng.</p> 
 <p>Upon Tan Xin’s reminder, Bai Xiaofei came to his senses and rushed to Hu Xian’er. He hurriedly took out a Rebirth Pill, crushed it, and fed it to her.</p> 
 <p>“You must live! You said we’d dominate the Infinite Mountain Range together!”</p> 
 <p>His eyes were bloodshot and tears uncontrollably flowed, but the pill could not stop the bleeding as the remnant energy of the shuttle remained on the wound and prevented it from healing.</p> 
 <p>“Wang Chuan!” shouted Bai Xiaofei after figuring out what was happening. “Absorb this energy!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s tone was rarely emotional. Although Wang Chuan was not very intelligent, his sixth sense was particularly keen and he could feel that Bai Xiaofei was panicking.</p> 
 <p>With the help of the Endless State, Wang Chuan absorbed the opponent’s energy remaining in Hu Xian’er’s body. The Rebirth Pill then took effect and started to heal her wound slowly. However, she showed no sign of waking up.</p> 
 <p>“She has stabilized, but her heart arteries are damaged. Even the Rebirth Pill can’t help with this. It will take time for her to regain consciousness.” Wang Hang was relatively calm.</p> 
 <p>However, in this kind of situation, calm alone was not enough.</p> 
 <p>“You and Wang Chuan take her back. Ensure her safety no matter what!” Bai Xiaofei gritted his teeth. His tone was so solemn that it stunned Wang Hang.</p> 
 <p>“Both of us?! What about here…”</p> 
 <p>“Leave it to me!” Bai Xiaofei passed Hu Xian’er to Wang Hang. “Remember, protect Xian’er!”</p> 
 <p>With that, Bai Xiaofei took one last glance at Yu Linfeng and Sikong Ming, then went deeper in and never looked back.</p> 
 <p>It was impossible to not feel hatred. Bai Xiaofei desperately wanted to kill Sikong Ming, but he knew that this was not his battlefield!</p> 
 <p>Watching Bai Xiaofei’s determined figure as he left, Wang Hang gave a long sigh. He took Hu Xian’er and left.</p> 
 <p>“Third Master, do we just leave Master like that?” Wang Chuan was tense and full of doubt. The communication between Wang Hang and Bai Xiaofei was difficult for him to understand. Yet in his cognition, Bai Xiaofei was currently weak and helpless.</p> 
 <p>“When he said to leave it to him, our task was completed. The current him, even a thousand troops cannot stop,” Wang Hang gently explained with a smile. However, there was a seriousness behind it. <em>The way back will not be so easy…</em></p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, an even more bitter battle was in full swing on the surface.</p> 
 <p>There were Devil Forest, the loners of Windlove, the Windlove Army, the Savage Class, and a revived Shadow Death force!</p> 
 <p>The death of Mister Mirror did not mark the end of the Shadow Death force as everyone thought. It was the beginning of a nightmare!</p> 
 <p>On the battlefield appeared the terror in the hearts of all Starnet members – Ling Tianxia!</p> 
 <p>“It seems you plan to fulfill your promise!” Creepy laughter suddenly rang out in Bai Xiaofei’s mind as he moved forward.</p> 
 <p>“Or else? Do I have any other choice? Now I just hope you won’t let me down!”</p>
