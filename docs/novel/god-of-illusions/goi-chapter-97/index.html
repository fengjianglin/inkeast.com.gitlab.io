 <p><span style>After Lin Li came out, roughly a little over ten minutes passed when the remaining five girls walked out successively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The outcome was extremely delightful. Xu Chen and Duan Yi’yi had attained the standard to control three puppets, whereas, the other three girls had attained the standard to control two puppets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m unhappy. It was clearly the same training. Forget Xu Chen, why am I even inferior to Yi’yi?” Qi Wei frowned, and her tone carried a trace of a disgruntled feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t the answer to this simple? All your thoughts are placed on gossip and being mean, so it’s very normal that you’re slightly inferior to others.” As she patted Qi Wei’s shoulder, Xu Chen couldn’t help but snicker. At the same time, her explanation obtained the unanimous approval of everyone from the Savage Class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Wang Hang didn’t speak….</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t dare!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Chen’chen, you recently seem to have seized the opportunity when everyone wasn’t present to show ‘concern’ to a fellow student. Should I commend you?” Her dejected expression vanished instantly and was replaced with Qi Wei’s usual expression of ridicule, and the word ‘concern’ that she’d specially changed her tone to say had successfully moved the attention of everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the expressions of Xu Chen and Fang Ye froze at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s over, we forgot to take precautions against this big mouth!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I remember that you took fancy to a set of clothes two days ago. How about we go take a look at it again when we’re free later? I feel those clothes really suit your perfect figure!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Society was getting worse day by day. Under Bai Xiaofei’s influence, the ability to act according to circumstances had already become the common characteristic of every single member of the Savage Class….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, I can consider that. But, I’ve been slightly low on funds lately. Moreover, I remember that you aren’t well-off, right? Where would we find money to pay the bill?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>You said I like to gossip right? Then I’ll let you see how good I am at it!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, don’t worry. Isn’t there a fellow student that was shown ‘concern’ to. He’ll surely be very happy to pay this hush money. Who asked him to be tycoon?” Bai Xiaofei who’d instantly understood the situation entered the conversation, and Fang Ye wished for nothing more than to find a hole to hide in as Bai Xiaofei finished speaking.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Motherf*cker! Why did I have to be divided to this class!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll be going to get tested because there are people waiting behind us!” When he saw the situation was far from good, Fang Ye hurriedly executed the great ‘topic change technique’, and he didn’t give the others the chance to continue teasing him before charging into a room with a vigorous stride.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would absolutely be completely exposed if he stayed at this place where trouble was waiting for him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Roaring laughter resounded out, causing Xu Chen who had nowhere to escape to flush red, and her bearing as a tough girl had vanished completely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, alright. Our proper business should come first, and we’ll have all the time for this in the future.” Bai Xiaofei revealed a sly smile as he urged the remaining people to start testing themselves. After all, there were people waiting in line behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Along with the boys walking one by one into the room, the waiting and those being waited for had exchanged identities. But, their moods didn’t change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, exactly, they’d changed from awaiting delivery to waiting for emergency treatment….</span></p>
 <p><span style>The boys went in and out, and some were happy while others were sad once more. The happy were Wang Hang and Xing Nan, and the sad were the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like how Qi Wei complained earlier, the boys howled with cries of injustice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, Wang Hang and Xing Nan were already formidable, and now that they were able to control an additional puppet when compared to the others, wouldn’t the gap between them grow bigger and bigger!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, a single sentence from Fang Ye caused everyone to quiet down – </span><i><span style>Our money is only enough to buy a third puppet for four people, and we’ll have to draw lots if there are more than that….</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Drawing lots was the conventional method the Savage Class used to deal with difficult problems. Since this method was put forward by Qi Wei, basically all their problems had become difficult problems….</span></p>
 <p><span style>It couldn’t be helped, all of them were lazy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You go get tested as well.” Xue Ying spoke slowly as she gazed at Bai Xiaofei who had no intention of moving since the beginning, and the others sent over gazes of anticipation along with this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m telling the truth, Big Sister Xue. My cultivation technique is comparatively special….” Bai Xiaofei hesitated to speak any further. At the end, he was unable to speak of it because there weren’t just the members of the Savage Class present here, and there were almost 100 people spectating in the surroundings. So long as such a thing were to be spoken, then it would absolutely spread throughout the new student district within half a day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Fei, just take the test. Perhaps your cultivation technique might not be accurate. Look, even Mo Ka was able to pass, so how could you possibly be inferior to him?” With Xue Ying’s start, Xing Nan hurriedly added, and in the end, the pitiable Mo Ka had become the example of the last ranked person to make a comparison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just take the test. Didn’t you say that the outcome is always uncertain without trying?” As she pulled the corners of Bai Xiaofei’s clothes, Lin Li blinked her large eyes that were filled with anticipation, and she firmly believed that Bai Xiaofei wouldn’t be the slightest bit weaker than anyone!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Bai, take the test!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right, Boss Bai!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some unknown reason, the spectating new students gave rise to a wave of shouting, and then the entire crowd seemed as if it was seething with excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright! Alright! Alright! I’ll take the test! I’ll take it!” In the end, Bai Xiaofei was unable to dissuade the crowd and choose to accept his fate, but he let out a long sigh right after that.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’m finished, I’m going to lose face for sure….</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>While thinking like this, Bai Xiaofei shot a pitiable gaze at Xue Ying. But unfortunately, Xue Ying was still unable to understand the deep meaning behind this gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huskie who was held in Xue Ying’s embrace barked twice instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, exactly, he was taking pleasure in Bai Xiaofei’s misfortune....</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei had said that he would only lend Huskie to Han Qianyue for a few days, but when Bai Xiaofei recalled that he had to go take Huskie, an entire half a month had already passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This incident had already been completely recorded by Huskie in his notebook….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go on.” Xue Ying who’d mistaken what Bai Xiaofei meant sent him an encouraging gaze, and her playful appearance was even slightly more alluring than a student’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, Bai Xiaofei who was about to enter the ‘execution grounds’ didn’t have the slightest mood to appreciate it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, because Bai Xiaofei had started his test, not a single person entered the five remaining rooms. Everyone wanted to know the outcome of Bai Xiaofei’s test.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei carried a perturbed feeling in his heart as he placed his hand onto the ball that tested one’s Origin Energy, and along with his Origin Energy surging into the ball, the ball lit up gradually. In the end, it displayed the level of Bai Xiaofei’s Origin Energy.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>1</span></i><i><span style>st</span></i><i><span style> level of the Master Rank!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but be slightly stunned as he looked at the words on the ball.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ve f*cking attained the Master Rank?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>But, when he thought about it carefully, Bai Xiaofei came to a sudden understanding. </span><i><span style>It’s very possible that I’d already attained the Master Rank after returning from the Infinite Mountain Range.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But, I’d possessed the ability of internal sight since a long time ago, so I’d always overlooked this.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>While his mood improved slightly, Bai Xiaofei walked towards the second test. It was similarly a ball, but he had to make them fly up this time….</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he carried a heart that had accepted its fate of misfortune, Bai Xiaofei poured his Origin Energy into the first ball.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Mmm, it flew up.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The second.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Eh? Why do I seem to still have strength to spare?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The third.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the f*ck! What’s going on!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei gulped and was dazed because the third ball flew very stably, and he felt that he still had strength to spare!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth….</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Bai Xiaofei made a total of eight balls fly up!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The level of flawlessly controlling a second puppet!!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the instant he put down the balls, Bai Xiaofei went silent. Presently, his mind was already in a complete mess….</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the f*ck is going on?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is there a bug?!</span></i></p>
