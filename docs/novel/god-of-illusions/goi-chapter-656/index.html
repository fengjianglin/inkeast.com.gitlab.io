 <p>Chapter 656: You Arse!</p> 
 <p>A heart-piercing pain!</p> 
 <p>This was the sensation shooting right to Bai Xiaofei’s head as he crawled up.</p> 
 <p>He didn’t know how long he had been in this state as he fainted after the Endless State and the origin core started a race in his body, and therefore he had no impression of what happened later.</p> 
 <p>However, one thing for certain that there was absolutely no more of that pure energy left in this space. Whether it was the Endless State or his origin core, their appetites were nothing to joke about.</p> 
 <p>With an uneasy heart, Bai Xiaofei used eternal sight to carefully check on his body. Finally, he breathed a sigh of relief. Although he had absorbed it all without making any progress in strength, he was already satisfied to emerge without injury…</p> 
 <p>That was how low Bai Xiaofei’s requirement for himself was now. His life was too difficult…</p> 
 <p>However, it would be wrong to say that there was no change at all, especially when the change was quite shocking. In his origin core… no, it should no longer be called origin core now.</p> 
 <p>How to put it? Originally, where the core had resided in the abdomen was a position similar to that of an acupuncture point, but now, it had turned from a gun to a cannon!</p> 
 <p>In appearance, it was still just a spot, but once Bai Xiaofei’s consciousness sank in, he discovered that this point had been enlarged into a small space, in which his origin core that was many times larger than before was spinning alone. He didn’t know if it was just his imagination, but it seemed that every time a rotation finished, the surrounding space would increase a little…</p> 
 <p>Withdrawing his consciousness from his abdomen, Bai Xiaofei gulped. He slowly raised his hands and looked at them. For the first time, he felt like his own hands were unfamiliar.</p> 
 <p><em>Damn it, am I still me? Why do I feel like I’ll become a monster sooner or later?!</em></p> 
 <p>Complaining in his heart, Bai Xiaofei smiled weakly and sighed. Forget it, he still had a life to live even if he became a monster. After all, a large family of beautiful women was waiting!</p> 
 <p>With that idea, Bai Xiaofei successfully adjusted his mentality. He then looked up and looked around, and the next second, his heart leaped to his throat!</p> 
 <p><em>There’s someone else here?!</em></p> 
 <p>This was his first reaction. This space wasn’t large, or to be exact, it was rather small. Except for an exaggeratedly luxuriant peach blossom tree in the center, there was only a small open space left.</p> 
 <p>To his shock, there was a thin figure sitting under the tree.</p> 
 <p>“He is dead,” said Huskie after emerging from Bai Xiaofei’s helm and sniffing a little.</p> 
 <p>Heaving a sigh of relief, Bai Xiaofei walked slowly towards the figure sitting cross-legged under the tree, but before he could approach, the figure collapsed with a crunching sound.</p> 
 <p>His nerves stretched to the extreme, Bai Xiaofei activated the Starnet Brilliance’s invincible shield. However, the ‘fatal attack’ in his expectations didn’t happen. The only thing that moved were the petals drifting around the figure after it hit the ground.</p> 
 <p>Carefully inching over, Bai Xiaofei finally saw the figure’s real ‘face.’</p> 
 <p>This wasn’t just dead, alright? Even the bones had thoroughly decayed, or else it wouldn’t have collapsed by just the airflow caused by Bai Xiaofei moving.</p> 
 <p>“Oh hell no! Don’t tell me there’s no way out of here!” Bai Xiaofei’s brains rose back to life after confirming that there was no danger, and the pile of bones in front of him warned him of his possible future, one that was pitch-dark…</p> 
 <p>Swallowing with difficulty, Bai Xiaofei looked at the scattered bones on the ground again, especially the skull that looked like it was staring at him…</p> 
 <p>“Oh Heaven, I know I was wrong, alright? But I’m still young, I don’t want to become the second skeleton here!!!” Bai Xiaofei bowed repeatedly toward the sky, his voice full of grievances.</p> 
 <p>However, his eyes were suddenly attracted by the blooming peach blossom tree. He turned around 180 degrees and took two steps back, then three steps to the side, before a bright smile bloomed on his face.</p> 
 <p>Someone had trimmed the peach blossoms with origin energy and even injected their origin energy into the tree, preventing it from aging with time. The gap between the trimmed flowers spelled two words – Look down!</p> 
 <p>Without any delay, Bai Xiaofei looked down. There was only one corpse in this place, so it was evident who wrote it. And since this person’s energy still remained even though their bones had decayed, they must have been at least Timeless Rank!</p> 
 <p><em>Oh, the legacy of a Timeless expert! I’m rich!</em></p> 
 <p>Or at least Bai Xiaofei was sure he could get out of here now. Giggling, he swept the ground with his feet and before long, a small board with letters written on it was revealed.</p> 
 <p>‘Kneel down and kowtow here, use strength!’</p> 
 <p>The words on the board stunned Bai Xiaofei slightly. He looked up at the skull and felt like this fellow was laughing sleazily at him…</p> 
 <p><em>Fine, the deceased above all. If it’s my knees you want, then I’ll kneel!</em></p> 
 <p>Considering this person’s seniority, Bai Xiaofei flopped on his knees and banged his head on the board in a strong kowtow. The board that seemed to have also decayed with the passage of time instantly broke into pieces. Then, the content inside was revealed – a cloth bag.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s breathing grew heavy in anticipation as he impatiently unwrapped the cloth. <em>Damn it, you could just be straightforward and skip the wrapping!</em></p> 
 <p>When he finally unwrapped the cloth bag, it turned out to be a book, but Bai Xiaofei could not recognize any of the letters written on it. Who would know something that could be from hundreds of years ago?</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was hit with the urge to kill himself. He thought he’d seen the hope of survival, but it was now dashed by cultural barriers!</p> 
 <p><em>Are you mocking me for not studying hard enough?! Are you trying to teach me that knowledge could actually change my destiny in real practice?! Alright, I know my wrongs now, okay? You can give me a chance to learn, right?!!! You asshole!</em></p> 
 <p>In a fit of rage, Bai Xiaofei threw the tattered book in his hand on the ground and crumpled to the ground in frustration. Sitting there, he looked up at the sky.</p> 
 <p>It seemed that he had no choice but to wait for the cooldown of Spiritualization on Blackie and Purple Luan to be over before trying again. Since he basically broke the formation, there shouldn’t be anything else supporting this space!</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei thought this, Huskie suddenly spoke, “Huh? Why do I seem to know these words?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei sprang up on the spot. Looking over, Huskie was pressing his paws on the book, looking super cute.</p> 
 <p>That’s right, cute! At that moment, Bai Xiaofei truly found Huskie to be the cutest dog in the world!</p>
