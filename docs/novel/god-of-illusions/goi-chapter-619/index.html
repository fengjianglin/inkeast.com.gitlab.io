 <p>Chapter 619: Teacher and Students…</p> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei’s group returned to the inn, a newly issued imperial decree from An Bang Ting had been announced – Tomorrow noon, the emperor would have a meeting with the people in the city.</p> 
 <p>Although the announcement did not say what this meeting was about, it was already great news for the people who had been striving to see him. Everyone was excited, which Bai Xiaofei got to feel very clearly as the matter was talked about all around his entire way back to the inn.</p> 
 <p>“Master, is the emperor going to talk about what happened with my sister?” A’Tao was a clever boy. He was able to make a close guess from just a hint.</p> 
 <p>“A’Tao, if your sister is gone, what are you going to do?” Bai Xiaofei didn’t answer his question and threw out a hurtful one instead.</p> 
 <p>The boy went silent for a long time, then lowered his head. “A’Tao doesn’t know…”</p> 
 <p>“Silly child, no matter what happens, you are my disciple. As long as I’m still here to be your shelter, no one can bully you. After you go out into the world, you are a person with backing!”</p> 
 <p>Gazing at A’Tao, Bai Xiaofei gently stroked his head.</p> 
 <p>“This world is large and amazing. You are still young, and your future has unlimited possibilities. Don’t be blinded by the pain in front of you. No matter whether your sister is here or not, she will be proud that you’ll become an outstanding person. You’ll only upset her if you do stupid things.”</p> 
 <p>Having said that, Bai Xiaofei smiled faintly.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go. Master will take you to buy some clothes. My three ladies will get you all dressed up.” Bai Xiaofei grinned, earning three embarrassed eye-rolls from the triplets.</p> 
 <p>After being brought out, A’Tao gradually let go of his initial timidity. Bai Xiaofei and the triplets completely revolved around him as they took him to experience all the fun places in Tranquil City. When they finally returned to the inn, the bright moon had climbed high in the sky.</p> 
 <p>“Master, will you hold A’Tao like this forever?” A’Tao suddenly asked an odd question as he curled up in Bai Xiaofei’s arms.</p> 
 <p>“That’s impossible. The ultimate goal of your master is having a woman in my embrace every day, and this should also be your goal. How would it look if we two men hold each other every day?” Bai Xiaofei ‘seriously’ scolded. He didn’t want A’Tao’s worldview to be led astray by him. Otherwise, if this got out, his reputation…</p> 
 <p>“Master will definitely succeed!” With a foolish smile, A’Tao slowly closed his eyes.</p> 
 <p>Early the next morning when Bai Xiaofei’s group got up, the inn was deserted. Even the boss had gone out, leaving only a waiter watching the store.</p> 
 <p>“What is this, you guys aren’t doing business anymore?” A hungry Bai Xiaofei frowned. The waiter hurriedly attended to him.</p> 
 <p>“Please don’t be angry. Now only our inn, I’m afraid you won’t find an open shop in the city at the moment. Everyone has gone to the grand square to get a good position.” The waiter sighed. If it wasn’t that the boss asked him to stay behind, he would be at the square now as well.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, we’re not that hungry. And aren’t we going there too? From what he said, it’s already crowded there. We should get going.” Leng Liuli tugged on Bai Xiaofei’s sleeve before he could say anything and rescued the waiter.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, we will definitely have the best position.” After flashing Leng Liuli a smile, Bai Xiaofei turned to the waiter. “I know you’re not the one in charge, so I won’t make it hard on you. When your boss comes back, tell him that he owes me a hearty breakfast.”</p> 
 <p>Having said that ‘righteously,’ Bai Xiaofei strode out of the inn with his group, but he didn’t head for the square and instead went to the palace. Since An Bang Ting wouldn’t show up at the square until noon, it was meaningless to wait until then and they might not be able to squeeze themselves in.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, Bai Xiaofei chose the backdoor that was An Yue…</p> 
 <p>Regardless of his crude character, An Yue’s princely identity was particularly useful. On top of that, him being one of the four prospective heirs also made this identity one level higher than before.</p> 
 <p>“Teacher! You are here!” Although Bai Xiaofei arrived quite late, An Yue had been waiting at the entrance even more seriously than the soldiers guarding the gate.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei flushed red in embarrassment for himself…</p> 
 <p>“You don’t have to wait for me in the future. It’s not like I can’t find you. And even when you’re not in the palace, just send someone to tell me. I am not the kind of person to be bothered by such a thing,” Bai Xiaofei cleared his throat and said solemnly. However, An Yue seemed to have none of it.</p> 
 <p>“It’s my duty as your student to wait for Teacher.” An Yue grinned then proceeded to make himself a guide. </p> 
 <p>“Teacher, Imperial Father said that several of us all have to be at the square at noon. He also specifically told me to bring you there, so our lesson needs to be paused then.” This was An Yue’s bad news after arriving at his residence and pouring a cup of tea for Bai Xiaofei. In his view, training was the top priority, and everything that wasted his training time was a bad thing.</p> 
 <p>“Of course, you can’t be absent, because what will happen there is very important to you.” Keeping An Yue in suspense, Bai Xiaofei sipped his tea. “Are the ingredients I told you to prepare yesterday ready?”</p> 
 <p>The sudden change of topics startled An Yue. Then, he recovered to a proud expression.</p> 
 <p>“Everything is ready, but I don’t know why Teacher needs so many ingredients?”</p> 
 <p>“You will soon.” Bai Xiaofei stood up and walked outside. “Have all the ingredients delivered here and build a big grill in the yard. We will start this morning’s training then.”</p> 
 <p>After the arrangements were made according to Bai Xiaofei’s requirements, An Yue eagerly ran to him.</p> 
 <p>“Put this on.” Bai Xiaofei’s storage ring flashed and two sets of full-body sandbags dropped heavily onto the ground. “The training today only has one content: running around this yard. But not simply just running, you have to integrate the mediation state into it. I know this is difficult, but it’s not impossible.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei paused and scanned An Yue and A’Tao.</p> 
 <p>“Any objections?”</p> 
 <p>Facing this question, A’Tao and An Yue exchanged glances and then shook their heads in unison.</p> 
 <p>“If so, the training starts… now!”</p>
