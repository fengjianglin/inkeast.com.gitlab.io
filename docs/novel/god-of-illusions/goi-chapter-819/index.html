 <p>Chapter 819: Horrifying Sikong Ming!</p> 
 <p>Under the control of Ruthless Dragon, the gas liquefied at a quick speed and completely blocked everyone’s retreat. Within the gas, their energy circulation even had a tendency to stop! Wang Chuan in the Endless State was especially making heartbreaking cries.</p> 
 <p>The toxic gas was an energy attack, so the Endless State actively absorbed it. However, Wang Chuan’s rank was too low to be able to absorb it completely, and the remainder entered his body and wrecked it. Wang Chuan was constantly going through the pain of his body breaking down and recovering!</p> 
 <p>“I really don’t know how to describe you. Do you really think you are invincible at such a young age? This world is much crueler than you think!” Ruthless Dragon commented coldly. Watching his opponents fall into a difficult situation one by one, disdain climbed onto his face.</p> 
 <p>“Cruel? It is indeed. But do you really think that I have done nothing for so long?” Under the comprehensive protection of Tan Xin, Bai Xiaofei was the only one who had not been affected. Of course, once he had the slightest contact with the gas in his current condition, he’d basically be dead.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t think that I didn’t notice. Although you beat Dragon King, the price seems to be crippling yourself, am I right? If it wasn’t for this little girl protecting you, you would have become a corpse. So what can you do?” Ruthless Dragon’s eyes were quite sharp as he accurately judged Bai Xiaofei’s state.</p> 
 <p>Little did he know that the really horrifying thing about Bai Xiaofei was not his strength, but his intelligence.</p> 
 <p>“The gas here is released from you. In other words, they are the manifestation of your origin energy. Its effect can be altered based on your energy, which enhances its ability to transform and makes it lethal,” Bai Xiaofei said lightly.</p> 
 <p>Ruthless Dragon’s expression froze for a brief moment.</p> 
 <p>“Humph! Even if you know, what can you do? I am invincible in this state!!” Although he was full of bravado, Ruthless Dragon had a bad premonition. He accelerated his manipulation of the gas, wanting to annihilate Bai Xiaofei’s group in one fell swoop.</p> 
 <p>This was also the drawback of Ruthless Dragon’s attack method. It was lethal, but it took time. In Bai Xiaofei’s view, this drawback was a fatal weakness!</p> 
 <p>“Invincible? I don’t think so,” Bai Xiaofei said as a flowerpot appeared in his hand. In the flowerpot, a strange-looking flower swayed, seemingly excited by its surrounding environment. “Thank you very much for regarding me so highly and speeding up the circulation of your poison. Otherwise, it would have to take some time.”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Bai Xiaofei’s voice fell, the gas stopped churning and rapidly shrank while retracting into Ruthless Dragon’s body. At the same time, Ruthless Dragon’s skin turned into a scary-looking purple-black color!</p> 
 <p>“How… can… this…” Ruthless Dragon stared at Bai Xiaofei in disbelief.</p> 
 <p>“Nothing is impossible. You’re just not poisonous enough,” Bai Xiaofei said as he stowed away Nightcharm. From the day he got this flower, it had never let him down.</p> 
 <p>After figuring out Ruthless Dragon’s attack, Bai Xiaofei had snuck out Nightcharm and mixed its poison into the gas, which then circulated through Ruthless Dragon’s body. This coupled with Bai Xiaofei’s stimulation that scared him into retracting the poison resulted in the scene just now. As Bai Xiaofei said, he lost by not being as poisonous as Nightcharm!</p> 
 <p>Ruthless Dragon never thought he would die to poison one day, but he never had a chance to regret it. After all, what could a pool of blood say?</p> 
 <p>“Seize this time to recover! We have to move on!” Bai Xiaofei did not relax at all even after handling their opponent. If it weren’t for Nightcharm or the particularity of Ruthless Dragon’s attack, they might have lost their lives.</p> 
 <p>And their enemies would only get more difficult…</p> 
 <p>At this thought, Bai Xiaofei could hear Ruthless Dragon’s words replaying in his mind. <em>Am I really too reckless…?</em></p> 
 <p>“Don’t tell me you’re wavering. Think about those people on the sixth floor, think about why you are here. For fame? If it’s really for fame, you were already famous enough before coming here.” Bai Xiaofei’s distress was immediately noticed by Hu Xian’er.</p> 
 <p>Stunned by her words, Bai Xiaofei then ruthlessly slapped himself before turning to look at her. “Thank…”</p> 
 <p>Before he could finish, Hu Xian’er launched Permanence and pushed him aside.</p> 
 <p>In her supposedly absolute zone appeared a golden light at a speed comparable to her. The moment Bai Xiaofei was jerked aside, the light pierced her chest!</p> 
 <p>Blood instantly dyed her shirt and Permanence was deactivated. Bai Xiaofei had been thrown toward Tan Xin. In his backward flight, the only thing Bai Xiaofei saw was the spreading blood on Hu Xian’er’s chest and her figure that slowly collapsed…</p> 
 <p>“Tch, how very touching! And here I thought I was about to solve our toughest problem. Seems like I’ll have to leave it to the next shot,” a voice echoed as Sikong Ming slowly appeared. The golden light just now had flown to his side.</p> 
 <p>Gold puppet, Violet Electric Shuttle!</p> 
 <p>“Transient Shadow!” Wang Hang launched the Ghosting’s skill the moment Sikong Ming appeared. He vanished and then emerged from Sikong Ming’s shadow.</p> 
 <p>However, his determined blow was stopped by another shuttle! Right after, two shuttles flew out, aiming at his fatal points. The Ghosting’s skill was quickly used and turned Wang Hang into a shadow, letting him dodge the attack before he returned to Bai Xiaofei’s side.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, seven shuttles appeared around Sikong Ming one after another, as flexible as fish in water. Unfortunately, from these shuttles, everyone saw not beauty, but overflowing murderous intent!</p> 
 <p>They could not stop the shuttles. No one could react to such speed!</p> 
 <p>“Leave it to me!”</p> 
 <p>Just when everyone didn’t know what to do, Yu Linfeng stepped out with his whip sword and looked at Sikong Ming with complex emotions.</p> 
 <p>“Do you remember me, Sikong Ming?!”</p>
