 <p>Chapter 951: Extremists!</p> 
 <p>Gawking as the girl disappeared from sight, Bai Xiaofei endured the anger of being ‘insulted’ and took a deep breath.</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, he never told anyone after arriving at Moonlight that he was a puppet master.</p> 
 <p>His lips curled up as a flame burned the rope binding him to ashes. Then, Huskie was summoned from the puppet space.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll leave this place to you. Don’t slip up,” Bai Xiaofei said to Huskie who had transformed into him and sat down on the chair.</p> 
 <p>“Two Crystal’s Longings and I’ll make sure my act is perfect.” Huskie flashed Bai Xiaofei a sleazy smile, and the feeling of looking in the mirror made Bai Xiaofei smile wryly.</p> 
 <p><em>So I look this annoying when I smile?</em></p> 
 <p>“I’ll give you three, as long as you complete your task beautifully.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei actually took the initiative to raise the reward, which gave Husky a bad feeling. However, the poor dog could never figure all the twists and turns in Bai Xiaofei’s mind.</p> 
 <p>“Sit quietly,” Bai Xiaofei said to Huskie.</p> 
 <p>Then, he transformed into the girl and swaggered out.</p> 
 <p>Seeing him, the two guards at the door were shocked.</p> 
 <p>“Chief, you…”</p> 
 <p>“I told you all to be extremely watchful, yet you couldn’t even tell that the one just now was only a fake?!” Bai Xiaofei imitated the girl’s tone.</p> 
 <p>The two guards immediately trembled in fear and plopped down on their knees. “We know our mistakes, please forgive us!”</p> 
 <p>Seeing their reaction, Bai Xiaofei inwardly sighed. <em>Looks like that girl is a cruel character, even her people are this scared of her!</em></p> 
 <p>“Go and keep your eyes on that man. If he dares to run his mouth, pull out his tongue!”</p> 
 <p>At the moment, Huskie, who was fantasizing about his Crystal’s Longings, had no idea that he had been schemed against.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei changed his appearance again after leaving the building, dressing in the exact same outfit as the guards just now, but his face was that of a completely different woman as he figured how hard it was for men to even live in Moonlight, let alone walk around…</p> 
 <p>After strolling around for a while, Bai Xiaofei realized that he was no longer in Elegy City, and the people around were all in a hurry, seemingly looking for something. Moreover, he would come across soldiers shoving men into small dark houses, from inside of which miserable cries could be heard.</p> 
 <p>After eavesdropping next to those houses for a while, Bai Xiaofei had a rough idea of what was going on: The women here were extremists, and all free men were considered targets of their hunt! And those who were on Bai Xiaofei’s level, meaning being highly regarded by Ye Xi, were the focus!</p> 
 <p>Coming to his conclusion, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but sigh in relief. Fortunately, he had diverted the girl away, or else he might be dead by now.</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t think we’d actually catch him!”</p> 
 <p>Just as Bai Xiaofei contemplated what to do next, the conversation of two women who were hauling a man, reached his ears.</p> 
 <p>“Men are all the same after all, catching them just can’t get easier than this. Moreover, he actually dares to covet our leader and even wants her to follow him like those women in other countries! His brain might have been eaten by a dog!” said the other woman contemptuously.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately perked up his ears. <em>Someone covets that girl?! Interesting!</em></p> 
 <p>At this thought, he made himself look hurried as he walked quickly to the two women and said, “Sisters, our leader is summoning everyone to discuss actions against the servant contest. Just leave this man to me, I’ll send him in.”</p> 
 <p>The two women didn’t doubt Bai Xiaofei at all. They directly handed the man to him.</p> 
 <p>With a slight smile, he watched as they hurriedly left. Then, he revealed his original appearance as well as his voice. “My brother, you’re quite daring to covet that little demoness.”</p> 
 <p>The man’s eyes widened. He yelped, “Who the hell are you?! You want to hurt Tong’er?!”</p> 
 <p><em>Pitiful thing, you’re in this situation because of her, and yet this is the first thing you care about?</em></p> 
 <p>“Tong’er? Is that her name?” Bai Xiaofei put on a pondering expression.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the man’s anger soared to a new level. “You are not allowed to call her that!” he roared and the next second broke the rope binding him, his hands abruptly thrusting toward Bai Xiaofei!</p> 
 <p>“What in the!! So you were just pretending to be caught!” Despite his shock, Bai Xiaofei quickly grabbed the man by his wrist, followed by a heavy shoulder throw, and pressed him onto the ground. He tried to calm the man, “Don’t get emotional. I was arrested just like you. And I have no intention to hurt your Tong’er. Moreover, if you wish, I can even help you be with her!”</p> 
 <p>The man’s eyes instantly lit up. He couldn’t care less about anything else except the last sentence. “You mean it?!”</p> 
 <p>Besides ‘infatuated,’ Bai Xiaofei gave the handsome man another label: ‘a simpleton.’</p> 
 <p><em>Aii, no wonder he got caught. It’s already some good luck that he hasn’t gotten sold with this kind of IQ…</em></p> 
 <p>“Of course, I’m actually famous for helping people realize their wishes,” Bai Xiaofei boasted.</p> 
 <p>And so, the man completely regarded him as his savior.</p> 
 <p>“This brother, how do I call you? My name is Zhu Chunyang!” the man introduced himself right after he got up, looking as if they had already hit it off.</p> 
 <p>“Fickle Bai. You can just call me Fickle.”</p> 
 <p>No real name, as usual. Bai Xiaofei had no intention to let his name appear in Moonlight at all…</p> 
 <p>“Brother Fickle, about what you just said… What should I do?” Zhu Chunyang nervously gulped.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei revealed an eerie smile. “Actually, it’s nothing difficult, but it may take a long time. It really depends on if you have the patience,” he said nonchalantly and confidently.</p> 
 <p>Zhu Chunyang immediately looked serious.</p> 
 <p>“I’ve been chasing Tong’er for over two years. Of course I have the patience!”</p> 
 <p>Saying this, he grew increasingly excited as if he had seen the greatest hope of his life, and completely missed the strange light that flashed across Bai Xiaofei’s eyes…</p>
