 <p>Chapter 966: If I Can’t Handle You!</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness, they are not here.”</p> 
 <p>Ye Tong took her troops to the arsenal, only to find that there was not a single person inside except for a mess. For the sake of fairness, she didn’t see the monitoring, otherwise, she wouldn’t have come for nothing.</p> 
 <p>“They plan to stall, it seems. What a sad idea that is.” Ye Tong coldly snorted in disdain and commanded, “Those with scouting abilities, find them!”</p> 
 <p>A dozen soldiers immediately launched their puppets. Moments later, the deputy commander reported,<br> “Your Highness, they are in the Northern District, but they are scattered. What you said should be correct, they look like they are trying to stall.”</p> 
 <p>Why the deputy commander reached the same conclusion was that in their perception, men had no courage to resist them at all, and it was already not easy for the other party to come up with a plan to stall for time.</p> 
 <p>“Split up and clean them up one by one. I want to see what tricks they can play!” Ye Tong ordered.</p> 
 <p>The troops were quickly divided into smaller groups and rushed toward the Northern District. According to the results of the scouting, Bai Xiaofei had assigned 300 people to 30 warehouses in the Northern District, but the specific number of each group couldn’t be seen, so Ye Tong could only split up the soldiers equally into teams of ten, the number that she deemed enough to handle any situation.</p> 
 <p>When the troops arrived at the Northern District, it was unexpectedly silent.</p> 
 <p>“Go!” a small team leader ordered and kicked open a warehouse door.</p> 
 <p>Immediately, a rain of arrows came flying at them!</p> 
 <p>“Shield!” The team leader quickly responded and lifted her shield, followed by the soldiers, quickly forming a wall of shields in front of them.</p> 
 <p>But it was also at that moment that over thirty people jumped down from the beams!</p> 
 <p>Surprise attacks of three against one quickly had the majority of the soldiers unconscious on the ground before they could respond, and the team leader was especially ‘cared’ for. The rest struggled against the siege of muscular men and were quickly captured, while the men only ended up with minor injuries.</p> 
 <p>During his time in Starnet Academy, Bai Xiaofei had been taught by Xue Ying that puppet masters who could not summon their puppets in time wouldn’t necessarily be able to beat ordinary people!</p> 
 <p>“All handled! Clean up the area!” commanded the man leading the group.</p> 
 <p>The men proceeded to tie up all the soldiers. After that, they got into an underground tunnel, which Bai Xiaofei had just dug!</p> 
 <p>While the soldiers of Moonlight could seal his puppet master ability, it was only when they used their weapons, so advanced arrangements weren’t a problem. Using Blackie’s Virtual Reality coupled with Mind Sunder’s element control, he slightly changed the terrain of the Northern District and then arranged some traps!</p> 
 <p>However, no matter how he changed the terrain, the fact that he only had 300 people remained. Since he arranged over thirty people to face Ye Tong’s first wave of attacks, some other places were bound to lack people.</p> 
 <p>At another site, a team of soldiers was lucky enough to pick a warehouse defended by only one man. When they felt that they had been tricked and rushed toward the target, the warehouse collapsed! Aside from the place where the man stood, everything turned into ruins.</p> 
 <p>However, this was not enough to render the soldiers powerless. Before long, they stumbled out of the ruins… only to be welcomed by the man with a smile on his face and a torch in his hand.</p> 
 <p>“Look carefully, all around are flammable materials as well as everywhere is drenched in oil. Make one move, and I don’t mind dying with you.” The man then revealed a ferocious grin. Ever since he was born, this was the first time he had talked to women like this, and soldiers who had returned from the border at that! The feeling of being able to intimidate them made him extremely excited.</p> 
 <p>For just a brief moment, the man even wanted to drop the torch in his hand and go down in history!</p> 
 <p>Similar scenes were happening in many other places. Bai Xiaofei’s arrangements made it possible for the unequally distributed personnel to succeed in making the soldiers eat a loss. However, this still could not change the huge gap in their combat power. Many teams of soldiers completed their mission as they overcame the traps and captured the men inside.</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, some men were smart enough to escape into the tunnels, saving some fighting power.</p> 
 <p>After the first fifteen minutes passed and the troops gathered, Ye Tong realized that her goal of capturing everyone had become quite far away. She lost half of her soldiers but only caught less than a hundred men. Her expression couldn’t be uglier.</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness, it seems that the rest have gathered together,” said the only deputy commander left as the other one had been unfortunate to pick the warehouse guarded by Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Since they want to die, fulfill their wish!” Ye Tong was on the verge of exploding. Hearing that Bai Xiaofei’s group had gathered together, she couldn’t wait to charge over.</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness, I’m afraid…” The deputy commander hesitated. Then, she decided to swallow the rest of her words.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll be at the front! After making sure that there is no problem, you guys follow!” Ye Tong’s mind was still quite clear, and she was confident in her own strength.</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness, in fact, our purpose has been achieved. He has proved enough to pass this level. We should…” said the deputy commander. Unlike Ye Tong, she still remembered her true task.</p> 
 <p>“No! I must clip his wings! Otherwise, what face will I have left?!” Ye Tong was stubborn.</p> 
 <p>Seeing her like this, the deputy commander could only sigh. No wonder that among the four royal sisters, Ye Tong was the only one not sent to the border…</p> 
 <p>Leading the remaining 100-odd soldiers, Ye Tong headed straight to the place where Bai Xiaofei’s group had gathered. When she saw his face again, her eyes were spurting fire.</p> 
 <p>“Long time no see, Your Royal Highness Ye Tong. How are you? Do you like the gift I prepared for you?” Bai Xiaofei’s lips curled up.</p> 
 <p><em>Humph, little kid! If I can’t handle you, I might as well bury myself in a hole!</em></p>
