 <p>Chapter 810: Mirror’s Division, Bai Xiaofei's Despair?</p> 
 <p>“It seems our opponent’s alliance isn’t very harmonious within.” Bai Xiaofei instantly caught the key point from Tan Xin’s information, but this apparently good news did not make him happy.</p> 
 <p>Change was the most annoying thing, because it never developed in a good direction. In other words, an unpredictable variable had appeared in their plan!</p> 
 <p>“In any case, we only have one goal,” Hu Xian’er understood what Bai Xiaofei was worried about and gently reminded him.</p> 
 <p>This put a smile on Bai Xiaofei’s face. “Don't worry, I will not forget.” Since they were now completely certain that this was the production base of the All-Around Merchant Group, there was only one thing to do –</p> 
 <p><em>Destroy this place and slay its executives! Completely crush the possibility of Blood Diamonds ever developing again!</em></p> 
 <p>“Keep moving!” Eyes filled with determination, Bai Xiaofei and the team continued to advance towards their goal: to get to the bottom of this base!</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, under the guidance of the Unify Business people, Devil Forest and the loners all had found channels leading into the All-Around base. Although they did not know who did it, everyone made the same choice: to enter. The stronghold of the All-Around Merchant Group, which had never been visited by outsiders, suddenly became very lively.</p> 
 <p>Gradually, those who moved fastest began to clash with the people of the base, upon which everyone was shocked by the strength that the All-Around group had. Almost all of their puppet masters had special physiques and each was unusually powerful, and on top of that, the number of puppet masters far exceeded what anyone could imagine.</p> 
 <p>Long story short, the All-Around Merchant Group was not like a merchant group, but a camp of puppet masters with special physiques!</p> 
 <p>After the majority of people engaged in battles, Sikong Ming, who had been watching everything that was happening from the sidelines, turned to Mister Mirror. “We’re good?”</p> 
 <p>“That’s about it, but are we really not going to wait for headquarters? Moreover, that boy obviously hasn’t shown everything he’s got. Until all his people come in, there will be variables,” Mister Mirror expressed his concern.</p> 
 <p>However, Sikong Ming did not change his decision. “Outside is just a group of insignificant people. We can ignore them. As long as we get to the center first, we don't have to consider anything else and just leave it to the headquarters people!” he explained.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Mister Mirror understood and moved accordingly. “Get ready, I’m about to start. Since the scope is too large, I can’t control the positions, but you guys won’t have any problem passing through the barrier.”</p> 
 <p>With his announcement, the energy in Mister Mirror's whole body surged. A fluctuation spread and enveloped the whole underground structure in conjunction with the group of people around him.</p> 
 <p>“Go!” As soon as Mister Mirror's voice rang out, a dazzling light rose, and the next second, Sikong Ming’s group disappeared.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, everyone underground was enveloped by the same energy fluctuation, including Bai Xiaofei’s group. The only difference was that only Sikong Ming’s group knew what would happen. Within the distorted light, everyone was teleported to a new space, and each space only had two people.</p> 
 <p>This was Mister Mirror's ability, Fight to Death. This skill forcibly divided the opponents into different areas, the matchup uncontrollable by the caster. However, once assigned to a space, the targets only had four ways to leave it.</p> 
 <p>First, kill the other person in that space and the space barrier would disappear by itself.</p> 
 <p>Second, kill Mister Mirror, the caster. However, Mister Mirror himself was not affected by the skill. In other words, as long as he did not take the initiative to enter a space, he could only be handled by someone outside.</p> 
 <p>Third, forcibly break the barrier, but to be able to do this, one must far exceed Mister Mirror in strength. Given the rank of Mister Mirror, it was impossible unless one was a nine-aperture Exquisite Rank puppet master and above.</p> 
 <p>Fourth, Mister Mirror himself had to manipulate and close the barriers, but this would consume a large amount of energy from him.</p> 
 <p>With the opening of the spaces, the first way to leave was announced directly in everyone’s mind. Although Mister Mirror didn’t want to do this, it was not within his control.</p> 
 <p><em>Troublesome!</em> This was the first thought that everyone had, especially Bai Xiaofei who had nearly no fighting ability!</p> 
 <p>Quickly recovering from the horror, the first thing Hu Xian’er and others did was scan the area for their ‘opponents,’ hoping that Bai Xiaofei would be assigned to the same place with them. However, the reality was cruel. He was not assigned to anyone in his group!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei smiled bitterly. This space thing was definitely not directed at him, but his situation made it perfectly so!</p> 
 <p>“Huskie, it depends on you whether we can make it out alive this time.” Bai Xiaofei looked at Huskie, who was sitting beside him. The fact that animated puppets were capable of using their energy might be the only possibility for Bai Xiaofei to survive. After all, Bai Xiaofei did not think his opponent would be interested in establishing peace…</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, something so trivial can’t beat me, but your friends better move fast. I will definitely run if there’s any danger!” Huskie ruthlessly declared and at the same time started to assume Bai Xiaofei’s appearance.</p> 
 <p>As their spirits were linked, Bai Xiaofei did not need to say anything. As soon as he had an idea, Huskie knew what to do. While Huskie transformed, Blackie launched her ability to hide Bai Xiaofei and Golden Feather. For everyone it was one-on-one, while for Bai Xiaofei it could be regarded as a siege…</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, Bai Xiaofei's actions were fast. Right after his party finished a series of preparations, the opponent came to the door.</p> 
 <p>The world was indeed a small place. It was a member of Devil Forest…</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, though, he was not a big shot.</p> 
 <p>“How is it you?!” The guy panicked as soon as he saw that his opponent was Bai Xiaofei. He who had seen how Bai Xiaofei beat Dragon King felt that he had no chance of winning at all!</p> 
 <p>However, the scope of the space was only so big, it was impossible to run.</p> 
 <p>Little did this brother know, standing in front of him was not a killer beast, but a Huskie who was ready to flee at any time…</p>
