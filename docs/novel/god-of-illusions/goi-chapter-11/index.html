 <p>As he swaggered through the academy entrance, Bai Xiaofei felt relieved once again in his heart.</p>
 <p>“Senior Sister Lingyan, go ahead with your business. It’s fine with Senior Bai Ye taking me to the principal’s office.” After following along the main road for some time, Bai Xiaofei suddenly spoke out when he saw a fork in the road, and he called out to Qin Lingyan who walked ahead of him.</p>
 <p>Qin Lingyan turned around and looked at Bai Ye while giving him a questioning gaze.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry! Leave it to me!” As he struck his chest and guaranteed, Bai Ye’s expression instantly changed to one of infatuation when he saw Qin Lingyan reveal a smile.</p>
 <p>Qin Lingyan walked with graceful steps and quickly vanished before their fields of vision.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei stretched out his hand and shook it before Bai Ye’s face, and he pulled Bai Ye who was drooling back from his daze.</p>
 <p>“Senior, I’ve already noticed that you’re secretly in love with Senior Sister Lingyan, right?” As he revealed an expression of sudden enlightenment, Bai Xiaofei looked at Bai Ye with a ridiculing expression.</p>
 <p>“You’re the one that’s secretly in love with her! Do I look like such a coward?! I’ve already confessed more than 20 times!” Bai Ye tried hard to argue with a voice filled with dissent.</p>
 <p>“Senior, could it be that you feel this is better than being secretly in love with her?” Bai Xiaofei who was sweating profusely with cold sweat felt his view on life had been overturned, and he even suspected that everything he learned from his foster parents was a lie.</p>
 <p>“Is it not?” Bai Ye was stunned for a moment before replying with a question.</p>
 <p><i>Alright, so you really think like this….</i></p>
 <p>While he felt speechless in his heart, Bai Xiaofei thought that he ought to do something for this pitiable senior.</p>
 <p>“Senior, there’s no problem with your appearance. Your skin is fair and clear, and you’re just a little bit thin. But, you’re absolutely worthy of the word ‘handsome’. So how could you have failed after confessing over 20 times?” Bai Xiaofei stretched out his hand with the intention of massaging Bai Ye’s shoulders as he spoke, yet Bai Ye had moved to the side and avoided him.</p>
 <p>“Don’t forget that I’m still your senior, so it isn’t good to get too close.” As his voice went cold, Bai Ye glared right at Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“Alas…. So it turns out that we aren’t friends. I was even intending on helping you pursue Senior Sister Lingyan, but it looks like there’s no need anymore.” Bai Xiaofei shook his head with ‘pain’, and he revealed a sense of loss on his face.</p>
 <p>“Who said that we aren’t friends? Wasn’t I just joking with you earlier!?” Bai Ye moved closer with a long stride before pulling Bai Xiaofei’s hands over and placing them on his shoulder.</p>
 <p>“Come, touch…. Wait, massage!” Even though he painfully decided to take this action, Bai Ye’s face was still extremely still from being unaccustomed to this, and he seemed as if he was being tortured.</p>
 <p>But, Bai Xiaofei didn’t care about all this, and with an exertion of force, he held Bai Ye tightly in his arms.</p>
 <p>“I told you, both of us look just like brothers, and we’re even from the same clan. Why’re you treating me like such a stranger?” Bai Xiaofei’s brows gradually knit together as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Big Brother, why are you so soft…?” Bai Xiaofei hadn’t finished speaking when Bai Ye had already kicked him aside.</p>
 <p>“You’re still intending to f*cking take advantage of me?! What? Is it wrong to be slightly soft!? I’m rich so I took good care of myself!” It might have been because Bai Xiaofei had hit a sore spot of Bai Ye’s, but Bai Ye had instantly entered into an irritable state and left Bai Xiaofei behind as he walked ahead.</p>
 <p>“Do you still plan to enter the academy or not?” Bai Ye turned around and glared fiercely at Bai Xiaofei when he saw Bai Xiaofei didn’t follow him, and it was precisely this glare that caused Bai Xiaofei to be dazed.</p>
 <p><i>A woman?!</i></p>
 <p><i>No! No! No! Impossible! How could he possibly be a woman! It’s so flat….</i></p>
 <p><i>F*ck! Who cares?! I should get through the test first!</i></p>
 <p>“Yes! Of course!”</p>
 <p><i>How could I possibly not enter the academy? I don’t even have money to eat, I’ll absolutely starve to death if I don’t enter the academy….</i></p>
 <p>As he thought like this in his heart, Bai Xiaofei hurriedly followed up to Bai Ye.</p>
 <p>Bai Ye introduced everything in the surroundings while bringing Bai Xiaofei along, and coupled with Bai Xiaofei’s abnormal receptive ability, he quickly figured out the structure of Starnet Academy.</p>
 <p>Even though it was the outer area, Starnet Academy was still situated within the Infinite Mountain Range in the end, so there was a formation that encompassed an enormous area around the academy, and it separated the academy from the outside world and protected it from the assaults of magical beasts.</p>
 <p>Besides that, the one and only path out of the academy was the entrance, and if one entered through the entrance, one would encounter an absurdly long path.</p>
 <p>The left side of the path could be considered to be a shopping district, and one could basically buy anything one wanted to buy here. Moreover, besides a few large shops that were possessed by the academy, the rest were operated by the students of the academy.</p>
 <p>The large expanse of building complexes behind the shopping district was the male dormitory, and it was divided into five areas from prep school to year four.</p>
 <p>The right side of the path was two canteens and countless snack stands, and practically all the specialty snacks on the entire continent could be found here.</p>
 <p>As Bai Ye put it, never ever look down upon the power of gluttons!</p>
 <p>Besides that, the area behind the canteens was the corresponding female dormitory, a place that all male students were extremely attracted towards….</p>
 <p>After walking along the path until its end, a monstrously large square lay before them, and there were over 10 forks in the road at the top corner of the square. These forks led towards the various streams of the academy, the places where students attended classes.</p>
 <p>At the opposite side of the path, towards the direction that was near to the Dead Sea was the place that was exclusively for the leaders of the academy. The north was the office block, and the south was the resting area.</p>
 <p>If one looked down from high above in the sky, Starnet Academy’s entire shape was like a quarter circle arc, and its two corners pointed respectively towards the depths of the Infinite Mountain Range and the Dead Sea.</p>
 <p>Both of them spoke while walking, and they finally arrived at the office block where the leaders of the academy were at.</p>
 <p>“Amongst the four principals of our academy, only Vice Principal Luo Xi isn’t male, and you can choose any one of them but her.” After they stopped, Bai Ye gave Bai Xiaofei a kind suggestion.</p>
 <p>“Why can I go to anyone but Vice Principal Luo? It is because she’s a woman?” Bai Xiaofei loved to do what he couldn’t do, and this had already become his nature.</p>
 <p>“No, it has nothing to do with her being a woman. It’s mainly because she hates all men that are surnamed Bai, especially students.” Bai Ye revealed an expression of possessing strong feelings when he said this, and he’d obviously suffered a great loss at her hands.</p>
 <p>“What’s the reason?” Bai Xiaofei’s eyes lit up, and he seemed to be itching to have a try.</p>
 <p>“No one knows. But, according to rumors, it seems to be related to her being abandoned once.” Bai Ye’s expression suddenly jerked as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Why’re you curious about this? Kid, you aren’t intending to take an extreme challenge, right?! Let me tell you, it has never ended well for anyone surnamed Bai that provoked Vice Principal Luo!”</p>
 <p>However, to Bai Xiaofei, Bai Ye’s dissuasion wasn’t the slightest bit different to encouraging him and cheering him on….</p>
 <p>“Don’t you think it’s extremely exciting!?” As he stared at Bai Ye, Bai Xiaofei’s expression obviously showed he’d already made a decision.</p>
 <p>“Walk straight and turn right. Brother, I really admire you. But, I won’t accompany you in the remaining part of your journey. I’m allergic to that area!” As he gave Bai Xiaofei a gaze that was a mix of pity and admiration, Bai Ye stood right on the spot, and he didn’t have any intention of moving an inch.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, Senior. I’ll surely call you over when Senior Sister Lingyan treats me to a meal!” Bai Xiaofei grinned before he took his final stride towards entering Starnet Academy.</p>
