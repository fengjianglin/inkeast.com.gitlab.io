 <p>Chapter 434: It’s Not The Time To Die Yet!</p> 
 <p>Passing through the barbican, Bai Xiaofei transformed into Manager Fan, who respectfully followed a furious Shen Qiandong. There was fortunately no other obstacle on the way. However, when they arrived at the empress’ chamber, the scene rendered their hearts turn cold.</p> 
 <p>The eunuch and maid-in-waiting were lying in a pool of blood at the doors that were wide open. An uneasy feeling spread in their hearts.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei frowned, but he quickly adjusted his emotions and strode into the room. As if Heaven didn’t want to take all hope from him, the empress’ body wasn’t seen. With a bit of joy on his face, Bai Xiaofei ran out and squatted beside the corpses.</p> 
 <p>“The blood hasn’t dried, the bodies are still warm, and the empress isn’t inside. It seems to be a miss for the assassin. Prime Minister Shen, where can the empress be at this time if she is not in her chamber?”</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei rattled off his observations, Shen Qiandong’s face changed again and again before searching desperately for possible locations in his head.</p> 
 <p>“The study!” shouted Shen Qiandong excitedly.</p> 
 <p>“Show me the direction!” Bai Xiaofei picked up Shen Qiandong and flung the old man on his shoulder. There was no room to consider propriety at a time like this. One second slower and they might miss a precious opportunity!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei crazily sped through the palace. The guards patrolling along the way immediately gave chase on sight while throwing endless attacks from behind. However, it was all in vain, they simply couldn’t catch up with Bai Xiaofei who had already mastered ‘running’… Not to mention that there was no need to say more about the physical qualities of this peak-grade Master Rank.</p> 
 <p>During the constantly speedy ride, Blackie on Bai Xiaofei’s shoulder suddenly stood up, then leaped out at a speed far exceeding that of its master.</p> 
 <p>In the night sky, three assassins who were carefully avoiding detection suddenly had a bad premonition. Right after, one of them screamed tragically before he fell down while covering his face, blood seeping out between his fingers. Blackie had clawed his eyes!</p> 
 <p>“Be careful!” one of the other two assassins shouted and called out his puppet.</p> 
 <p>A Master Rank puppet master!</p> 
 <p>The next second, the air-treading Blackie was fixed on the spot, and the other assassin sprinted over. His dagger glinted coldly as it stabbed towards Blackie’s head.</p> 
 <p>However, Blackie suddenly disappeared. Instead, Bai Xiaofei descended onto its previous spot from the sky.</p> 
 <p>“Die!”</p> 
 <p>A simple fist heavily struck the assassin’s shoulder. The sound of bone breaking could be heard, but when Bai Xiaofei was going to deal the next blow, the assassin disappeared from his attack range in a flash of light.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, the other assassin summoned a round tray, which shot out seven or eight light beams at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Sliding sideways, Bai Xiaofei barely managed to dodge the beams. He looked over and saw the two healthy assassins standing together. The one with ruined eyes was completely abandoned.</p> 
 <p>Assassins must always be aware of their job. When one became a burden to others, their life was as good as over…</p> 
 <p>“So the Globe Merchant Group is full of sneaky cowards like this? I really thought too highly of you!” Bai Xiaofei suddenly commented coldly.</p> 
 <p>The two assassins obviously froze a little. <em>How does he know?!</em></p> 
 <p>However, they didn’t say anything out of professionalism and simply prepared to handle Bai Xiaofei as quickly as possible. But at this moment, a commotion was heard behind Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Heh, my underlings are here. I wonder if two Master Rank puppet masters plus a half-useless one will be a match for the entire Royal Guards?” said Bai Xiaofei with a big smile.</p> 
 <p>The two assassins exchanged glances, then decisively gave up on killing Bai Xiaofei and disappeared into the night. However, the blinded assassin could not run away…</p> 
 <p>A while later, the so-called ‘underlings’ came running while heavily panting. They were about to shout at Bai Xiaofei when they spotted the assassin, who had died from suicide, on the ground.</p> 
 <p>“You are late to my rescue and yet hindered me along the way earlier. How competent of you Royal Guards, huh?” criticized Bai Xiaofei icily.</p> 
 <p>The guards immediately panicked.</p> 
 <p>“Check this assassin. Some of you, accompany me to check on Her Majesty!” Bai Xiaofei said in a commanding tone. Seeing the guards hesitate for such a long time, he asked, “What about it? Isn’t Prime Minister Shen enough here?”</p> 
 <p>Shen Qiandong went along and creased his brows.</p> 
 <p>It worked this time. Officialdom was like a fish tank where big fish ate small fish. Shen Qiandong’s status of prime minister was the most useful thing he owned.</p> 
 <p>Taking a few guards, Bai Xiao arrived at the study which still had the lights on.</p> 
 <p>At that moment, the empress was staring blankly at the late emperor’s items while occasionally mumbling something. A cup of tea sat in front of her, next to which was a porcelain bottle full of white powder.</p> 
 <p>In fact, even if there was no assassination, the empress herself had no intention to live past tonight… The people she loved were gone, living on alone only added to her sorrow.</p> 
 <p>She could risk everything to fight for the throne for the second prince, but now, she was completely exhausted. The successive blows of bereavement from the loss of her husband and son had completely defeated her.</p> 
 <p>After all, she was just a woman. Not everyone was <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Zetian" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wu Zetian</a>. Even though she was the empress, she was still just an ordinary woman…</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, Bai Xiaofei arrived in time. The empress was startled when he broke into the study. Seeing the bloodstains on Bai Xiaofei, she was slightly terrified. Although she was ready to die, she had never been taken into consideration being assassinated by others.</p> 
 <p>However, the empress soon realized that this was not the case as some guards rushed in right after him.</p> 
 <p>“You aren’t here to assassinate me?”</p> 
 <p>“Would an assassin make such a big commotion?”</p> 
 <p>The reply confused the empress.</p> 
 <p>“Why are you here then?”</p> 
 <p>“Do you want to avenge your son and husband?” Bai Xiaofei asked straightforwardly, but it made a deep impact on the empress’ heart.</p> 
 <p><em>Of course! More than just ‘want to’!!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Can you help me?” The empress’ face lit up as she asked in surprise.</p> 
 <p>“Besides me, you probably won’t find anyone else who can help you in this imperial city.” Bai Xiaofei smiled. A light flashed in his eyes, a light of confidence!</p> 
 <p>“Alright! I believe you. What do you want me to do?” The empress clenched her jaw. She had no choice but to believe in him now.</p> 
 <p>Perhaps it wasn’t the time to die yet!</p>
