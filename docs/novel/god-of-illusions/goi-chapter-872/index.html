 <p>Chapter 872: Thoroughly Prepared!</p> 
 <p>The news that Bai Xiaofei came out of the core alive quickly spread all over the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain. In order not to be treated like a monster exhibit, he slipped out. More importantly, he felt a need to hurry back to the imperial city and seize control over how this news spread before it was too late.</p> 
 <p>Due to the remodeling of his body, Bai Xiaofei’s puppets had changed a little, and the most obvious change about the Purple Luan was its color, which had turned into a deep blue. Even when Bai Xiaofei did not pour energy into the wings, they still glowed faintly. Bai Xiaofei didn’t need to test to know that the puppet had grown stronger.</p> 
 <p>Setting aside everything else, the speed alone already made him extremely excited.</p> 
 <p>Just a simple wave of the wings was already comparable to the effect of pouring in energy in the past. With Bai Xiaofei’s current physical quality, it was not a problem to simply fly for a whole month.</p> 
 <p>“The news traveled so fast? Are they all looking for me?” In mid-air, Bai Xiaofei frowned as he looked at the huge crowd of people heading up the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain.</p> 
 <p>The reason why Bai Xiaofei thought so was the fact that these people were waving the banner of the Yun clan. Recalling Yun Tianhe’s message that he would come find him, Bai Xiaofei deduced that they had come upon getting the news that he was not dead.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Yun!” In order not to miss them, Bai Xiaofei descended. Indeed, the leader of the group was none other than Yun Tianhe.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai! You are really all right!!” Yun Tianhe’s face was instantly filled with delight as he pounced toward Bai Xiaofei with a bear hug.</p> 
 <p>“I was lucky. Almost died there actually… Brother Yun, you guys…” Bai Xiaofei smiled and peered at the crowd behind Yun Tianhe. The commotion was just a little too big!</p> 
 <p>“You don’t know, Brother Bai. Our family really had a big headache during your disappearance. As soon as I heard that you are all right, I brought people to meet you. Can’t neglect my brother, right? I just didn’t expect that I was still a step slow. If you didn’t see us, I’m afraid we would have missed each other,” Yun Tianhe’s perfect explanation caused Bai Xiaofei to laugh loudly.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Yun, this is not necessary at all. Anyway, let us head back to the imperial capital first. I fear that many people won’t feel at ease until they see me with their own eyes,” said Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe immediately welcomed him into his carriage. Along the way, the two absent-mindedly chatted until the carriage came to a stop.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Yun, this is not the imperial capital.” Putting down his teacup, Bai Xiaofei looked at ‘Yun Tianhe’ with a smile.</p> 
 <p>The latter revealed a strange expression. “I am quite curious. If you already noticed, why did you still cooperate with us?” He did not panic at being exposed at all and was even smiling.</p> 
 <p>“Some people never know to stop until you beat them up good. Moreover, I’m dying to explore my own depth at the moment. Since you kindly volunteered to be the touchstone, I of course have to play along.” Bai Xiaofei chuckled, the confidence on his face definitely not a front.</p> 
 <p>“Formidable! You are formidable! I have long heard that Bai Xiaofei has outstanding acting skills. Now I really can’t tell whether you’re faking your confidence or not!” ‘Yun Tianhe’ laughed, then his expression grew serious.</p> 
 <p>“I rarely use my own life to crack a joke, so you people should be careful!” warned Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, ‘Yun Tianhe’ had disappeared into thin air. Facing this, Bai Xiaofei only sneered. The next second, a blinding light burst out from the carriage. Accompanied by a loud explosion, the carriage turned into a ball of fire.</p> 
 <p>When the fire died down, Bai Xiaofei was revealed to be standing there without any injury.</p> 
 <p>“Since you dare to ambush me, I thought you should know that elemental attacks are useless against me.” Looking at the formation of Shadow Death killers, Bai Xiaofei shook his head with a disappointed expression.</p> 
 <p>“The Endless State is truly formidable, but do you really think that it was only a simple explosion?” The leader of the assassins had taken off his Yun Tianhe disguise, revealing a handsome face.</p> 
 <p>“Ghost Scholar Bu Jing, ranked Deep Night, excellent at planning, failure rate so far is zero, became famous ten years ago after the successful assassination of Violethorn’s garrison commander,” recounting Bu Jing’s information, Bai Xiaofei laughed. “I did my homework well, didn’t I? So, what was your explosion just now for?”</p> 
 <p>Ghost Scholar waved his hand. “Your Endless State is too troublesome, so I sealed it!”</p> 
 <p>Almost immediately, a strange fluctuation spread across Bai Xiaofei’s body and stopped the operation of the Endless State, leaving him slightly startled.</p> 
 <p>“Not bad! Although Fourth Father has been famous for a long time, his fame only came from that one battle. I didn’t expect you guys to notice such a short-lived ability and find a way to restrain it. Shadow Death truly deserves its reputation.” Bai Xiaofei was not stingy with his praise. Bu Jing really executed a beautiful move. “However, you should know my abilities!”</p> 
 <p>With that declaration, Bai Xiaofei summoned Huskie and Blackie. Right at that moment, two assassins launched their puppets.</p> 
 <p>“Virtual Reality and Mimicry. Two godly skills of the Illusion Stream they are when being used by you, indeed. However, you shouldn’t have exposed your abilities at the city gate,” Bu Jing scoffed.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei then found that both Huskie and Blackie had been rendered useless.</p> 
 <p>“Combining the Eye of Truth with a restrain-type puppet to seal my two main abilities. Now it’s a bit tricky.” Bai Xiaofei shook his head, but the smile on his face did not wane one bit.</p> 
 <p>“Bai Xiaofei, I have to say that I admire your optimism and stability. However, you absolutely stand no chance. We have analyzed all your abilities, whether it is your physical abilities or your puppets, and created ways to counter them all, even your latest abilities included.” Bu Jing’s voice grew icy, “This time, you are dead meat! In a while, I will give you some time to leave your last words!”</p> 
 <p>With that, Bu Jing shouted a command, and the surrounding assassins shot long-ranged attacks in unison to test the waters!</p> 
 <p>Caution had always been the foundation for Bu Jing’s 100% success rate!</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei’s next move shocked everyone. Without using any energy or puppets, he rushed out!</p> 
 <p>But at a speed so terrifying that he dodged all of the attacks and even used them as a cover to arrive at the nearest assassin. Before the latter realized what was going on, a punch sent him flying.</p> 
 <p>Simple and crude, but exceptionally effective. The punch sent the poor assassin directly to hell!</p> 
 <p>“You said you found a way to deal with my physical cultivation? Where is it? Why don’t you show me?” Bai Xiaofei taunted as his body flashed in the execution of the same movement just now.</p> 
 <p>Yet, his repetitive pattern messed up the assassin’s formation! In less than two minutes, they all died under his fist, leaving Bu Jing as the only one standing.</p> 
 <p>“Sure enough, you gained quite many things in the core of the formation. However, this is also within my consideration!” The horror in Bu Jing’s heart was within his tolerance. The next second, a formation rose from the ground, and along with it were the dead Shadow Death assassins.</p> 
 <p>“You should be familiar with this formation. However, unlike the defective version in Windlove, this one has no fixed core. You shall be ground to death!” Bu Jing announced as the resurrected assassins launched attacks at Bai Xiaofei again. Backed by the formation, they attacked without care and even used self-explosion.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, even that failed to hurt Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>As the fight went on, Bu Jing tensed up. At this rate, they would be put in an unfavorable situation. They got the news that Bai Xiaofei came out alive almost immediately, but it would not be long before the imperial capital got this news as well. When the real Yun family traced to this place, they wouldn’t have it as easy as now.</p> 
 <p>“Seven Evil Formation!” Bu Jing roared.</p> 
 <p>The assassins were stunned for a brief moment before seven of them separated themselves from the rest.</p> 
 <p>“Three at the same time!!” Bu Jing added.</p> 
 <p>The assassins were stunned again, but despite their unwillingness, Bu Jing was the commander in chief of this operation and they had no choice but to obey – even if the price of this formation was their lives!</p> 
 <p>Sometimes, death was not the most terrible thing. In Shadow Death, there were countless things worse than death…</p> 
 <p>The twenty-one separated began to form formations while the remaining twenty-eight covered for them. Bai Xiaofei acted as if he did not see what was going on at all and let them complete the formations.</p> 
 <p>“Bai Xiaofei, you shall pay for your arrogance! This will be the stupidest move of your life!”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Bu Jing’s voice fell, three blood-red figures came out from the three formations. At the expense of every seven top assassins, their blood sacrifice summoned a Body of Seven Evil!</p> 
 <p>“I have never underestimated Shadow Death. You just can’t represent it!” Bai Xiaofei sneered and extended his right arm horizontally. The next second, Mind Sunder appeared in his hand!</p> 
 <p>Cursed Saber – first battle!</p>
