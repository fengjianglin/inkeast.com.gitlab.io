 <p>Chapter 903: Schemed!</p> 
 <p>“You said you know about what I’ve been through, then you should know that Teacher Xue died during that event.” Bai Xiaofei stuck to the reason he made up.</p> 
 <p>Ni Xue smiled, obviously not believing it.</p> 
 <p>“First of all, you never held a burial for her, which means that you didn’t have her body. For you to say that someone you care dearly about has died without even seeing her body, it can only mean that you want to hide something. Secondly, if she really died, then you wouldn’t be so calm while mentioning her. Last but not least, if she is really dead, you wouldn’t have mistaken me for her, or may I say, you wouldn’t have come here to see me at all.”</p> 
 <p>She listed three deductions in a row, rendering Bai Xiaofei speechless.</p> 
 <p>“Why are you so interested in Teacher Xue Ying?” he returned with a question while carefully observing her expression. The more Ni Xue knew, the more suspicious he was. After all, disguise was Shadow Death’s strong suit.</p> 
 <p>“Because I think your relationship is not just as simple as teacher and student. I’m a curious woman,” replied Ni Xue almost instantly. It seemed she had anticipated that he’d ask.</p> 
 <p>“I see, then what do you want to see me for?” asked Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Because I want you to redeem me,” said Ni Xue.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was caught off guard. Then, he smiled wryly. “I’m afraid that’s not possible. I don’t want to mess with any strange women now. And as you said, I only came here because of Sister Xue. Since you are not her, there’s no need for me to stay any longer.”</p> 
 <p>With that, Bai Xiaofei turned toward the door. However, Ni Xue suddenly asked, “Don’t you think I’m very similar to Xue Ying?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei stopped and said solemnly, “So what? You are not her after all. Do you want to be a substitute? That’s impossible. Some people can never be replaced.”</p> 
 <p>However, Ni Xue had no intention to be serious at all.</p> 
 <p>“Then can you bear to see someone so similar to your Sister Xue thrown into the arms of another? Or is your longing for her only limited to just talk?” She provoked Bai Xiaofei and tried to retain him.</p> 
 <p>“I said, you are not her, so no matter what happens to you, it has nothing to do with me. Moreover, I don’t think anyone with your intelligence will encounter any misfortune,” Bai Xiaofei retorted, not giving her a chance.</p> 
 <p>“Because I wanted to see you, I rejected my VIP. I’ve been alone and bored for so long. If you don’t take responsibility, I’ll run out of here and yell that you forced yourself on me and ran away!” Ni Xue declared while tearing up her own clothes. While she wore something inside, she indeed looked like she had been sullied.</p> 
 <p>“Can women be so despicable?!” Bai Xiaofei had a feeling of being set up, but since the person who took him to Ni Xue was Ling Fan, he didn’t dare to do anything harsh. “Fine then, tell me what you want!”</p> 
 <p>An irate Bai Xiaofei sat back down. Facing the table full of dishes and wine, his stomach began to growl.</p> 
 <p>“You must be hungry. It’s all yours. I heard that you can really eat, so the dishes are all in large portions, and you can rest assured that they are not poisoned.” Ni Xue smiled and sat opposite Bai Xiaofei before proving her words by eating a mouthful of food.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei snorted. “Even if it is, I have nothing to be afraid of,” he said and started wolfing down. After merging Nightcharm’s poison into his energy, he had become immune to all poisons.</p> 
 <p>While he ate, Ni Xue never stopped asking questions and thoroughly dug out everything that he had been through during the recent years. She would laugh here and teared up there, and her face would become frosty when there was a woman involved.</p> 
 <p>In such a way, a meal several hours long passed. When Ni Xue no longer asked questions, the sky was completely dark.</p> 
 <p>“To be honest, it’s a pity that you aren’t a spy. You got so many things out of me during just a short time.” Despite still retaining some vigilance toward Ni Xue, he still felt a little closer to her after talking for hours.</p> 
 <p>“How do you know I’m not? I may be a spy from another country who came here to steal Ethereal’s secrets,” said Ni Xue with a straight face.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t care and even laughed. “Then you looked for the wrong person. I may not have been in Ethereal longer than you. Moreover, these questions you asked aren’t anything important. That would be a failure for a spy.”</p> 
 <p>Ni Xue snorted. “You’re doubting my ability? In fact, I am waiting for the fish to grow. Although you don’t have any Ethereal secrets now, I believe that you soon will, and after we get familiar with each other, you won’t be able to keep any secrets.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei shook his head. “Wait as you please then. I may leave Ethereal in half a month and I don’t know when I will come here again.” He smacked his belly and stood up. “Well, since I’m full and also fulfilled my obligation to accompany you, I should go…”</p> 
 <p>Suddenly, a wave of dizziness hit him and his vision grew fuzzy. When he looked at Ni Xue, a raw desire took over his body.</p> 
 <p><em>Poison?! Impossible, she ate it too! And I can’t be poisoned with Night Charm…</em></p> 
 <p>Indeed, the food was not poisoned. However, anything that wasn’t poison would work, such as drugs.<br> Night Charm only gave Bai Xiaofei immunity to poisons, not medicinal effects.</p> 
 <p>As for Ni Xue, she did eat as well, but it wasn’t like she had any intention to stay sober…</p> 
 <p>When the effect of the drug hit, the two began to lose their mind to sexual desire. Since there were only two people in the room, they became each other’s only choice.</p> 
 <p>The night was destined to be stormy.</p>
