 <p>Chapter 405: Abducting the Emperor’s Consort!</p> 
 <p>“I will marry you! But I have my things to do and I can’t join the Thunderstorms Bandit like you want!” Bai Xiaofei practically screamed, frightening Nie Qing so much that her tears stopped.</p> 
 <p>“If you don’t want to join then don’t join, what are you yelling at me for…” The grievance on her face rose to another level. Looking at her like this, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but feel ashamed.</p> 
 <p><em>F*ck, the lethality…</em></p> 
 <p>“This is for you.” Bai Xiaofei took out a Feature Looking Pill. As someone who knew good stuff, Nie Qing’s eyes instantly lit up.</p> 
 <p>When she had participated in the banquet party, she actually wanted more to get her hands on this pill than to know about Bai Xiaofei. Therefore, when it was about to become her possession, she instantly smiled.</p> 
 <p>“That’s more like it…”</p> 
 <p>Upon Nie Qing’s abrupt change of expression, Bai Xiaofei secretly sweated.</p> 
 <p><em>What the…? This is someone who’s been in the outside world with a gang of bandits for twenty years? Why does she seem even simpler than the students…?</em></p> 
 <p>“What are you going to do next?” When getting down to business, Nie Qing turned back into the calm her.</p> 
 <p>Her swift switch of manner rendered Bai Xiaofei speechless. Gulping, he looked at the emperor who was still unconscious in bed. Blackie had really been ruthless with its paw.</p> 
 <p>“Leave the palace. I don’t want you to remain by his side even if it’s only your illusion. The illusion isn’t exactly like you but I still feel uncomfortable.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei could be an onlooker if he had nothing to do with Nie Qing, but now? He quit just being a bystander.</p> 
 <p>“I can’t. If I leave the palace, we’d have no one on this side. I have to complete my mission,” refused Nie Qing directly with a stubborn expression.</p> 
 <p>“The information you guys want is just the dynamics of the royal family. I can tell you for sure that the royal family will not do anything. They are just pretending at most. Even without your last ruckus, they’d still not dare to do anything to your group. After being here for so long, have you seen any experts above the Master Rank?”</p> 
 <p>At Bai Xiaofei’s rhetorical question, Nie Qing fell silent.</p> 
 <p>“Why are you guys afraid of a country without power to top it? They are the ones who are afraid. If I’m not mistaken, the royal family will have to sacrifice at least half of the people in this huge city if they want to hunt and kill you guys! Do you think they would be so stupid?”</p> 
 <p>These words lengthened Nie Qing’s silence.</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei had said, she in fact hadn’t delivered much useful information from the imperial quarters, because the emperor never planned to make any big moves. Or to be exact, his country just didn’t have the ability to.</p> 
 <p>“But, if I want to leave, I must at least inform my group. It took so much effort to send me in after all.” When Nie Qing started to budge, Bai Xiaofei wouldn’t miss that chance!</p> 
 <p>“Haven’t you heard of ‘act first, report later’? Moreover, I have a plan to create a suitable opportunity for you to leave when I am here, one that is hard to find in the future. At that time, it is very likely that you can’t leave if you want to.” After a little pause, Bai Xiaofei added, “In fact, maybe your people already have the idea of letting you withdraw but haven’t found a way yet. They may even thank me after I get you out.”</p> 
 <p>With a smile and ‘sincerity’ written on his face, Bai Xiaofei led Nie Qing into the trap he had prepared. Of course, Nie Qing knew he was deliberately guiding her, but she herself didn’t want to remain there any longer. The prolonged high-strung state she had been enduring all this time made her exhausted.</p> 
 <p>“What if I am scolded for it?” asked Nie Qing seriously, showing that she had already compromised.</p> 
 <p>“Blame it all on me. Tell them that I forced you, that your identity was seen through by me and you can’t continue to be undercover.” Bai Xiaofei patted his chest as he proposed a perfect retreat.</p> 
 <p>Indeed, it was a great reason!</p> 
 <p>“Okay, I’m leaving with you!” Nie Qing straightforwardly agreed with resolute eyes, but the next second, she revealed a hint of hesitation as her face turned beet red.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei looked at her in confusion, but soon, he understood. This wasn’t the first encounter he had with this kind of situation.</p> 
 <p>What kind of situation, you ask? To put it simply, when it came to moving, Nie Qing was powerless…</p> 
 <p>Even Hu Xian’er couldn’t stand straight after her first time with Bai Xiaofei, let alone Nie Qing. If it wasn’t for having slept after they were done, she wouldn’t even have the strength to talk. As for walking? It was completely delusional. For her, lifting a hand was already her limit at the moment, let alone moving the lower half of her body that she felt no connection with right now.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll take care of it.” Bai Xiaofei smiled. He had come up with countermeasures. For his strength, running alone was no different from running while carrying another person.</p> 
 <p>Settling on the plan, he dragged the emperor to the hot spring, then doused all the combustibles in the room with fire oil. Always having fire oil on him was a habit Bai Xiaofei developed since the Illusionary Sandboard. After giving Shi Kui the materials harvested from the Ground Dragons to practice, he kept the oil and even bought more fire oil and put it in his storage ring. They indeed came in handy at this moment.</p> 
 <p>Once everything was ready, the thoughtful and nice Bai Xiaofei helped Nie Qing get dressed. During this process with some inevitable contact, his little brother naturally saluted.</p> 
 <p>“Are you still human? It’s been a day and it’s still like this.” Nie Qing swallowed nervously, her voice carrying a trace of fear.</p> 
 <p>“How can you blame me? Who told you to be so attractive?” Taking the opportunity to flatter, Bai Xiaofei lifted Nie Qing in a princess carry. “Hold tight. In a while, I may be running a bit fast.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s words earned an eye-roll from Nie Qing. “Do you think I have the strength to hold tight right now?”</p> 
 <p>Hearing the grievance in her tone, Bai Xiaofei was embarrassed. “Er… No problem, I will hold you tight.”</p> 
 <p>His response put a happy smile on her face.</p> 
 <p><em>That’s more like it!</em></p> 
 <p>“Oops, I forgot something.” Reaching the window, Bai Xiaofei’s brow wrinkled, and his hand that was about to throw the burning tinder stopped.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter?” asked Nie Qing dubiously.</p> 
 <p>“I came in from the main entrance, but we can’t leave through there. If they notice this and investigate, I won’t be able to clear myself of what would happen next.”</p> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei finished, Nie Qing burst out laughing.</p> 
 <p>“You don’t have to worry about that. Few knew about our meeting, and I planned everything through with my connections, or else why do you think this old goat didn’t do anything to you? And after we leave, those people won’t have the guts to let a word out unless they are tired of living.”</p> 
 <p>Nie Qing’s explanation dispelled Bai Xiaofei’s last concern. Throwing down the fire in his hand, he jumped out of the window…</p> 
 <p><em>Mhm, this trip wasn’t for nothing, and I’m even talking one more with me!</em></p>
