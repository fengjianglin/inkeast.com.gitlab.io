 <p><span style>“But, we don’t have a way to earn money!” Wu Chi was frank and found the crux of the problem as soon as he spoke, and he didn’t try to avoid it in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Methods are thought of by men. If you rely on the help of others as soon as you encounter a problem, then what difference is there between you and trash? Our Savage Class doesn’t produce trash!” Bai Xiaofei’s attitude was exceptionally resolute, even though the method really hadn’t been thought of yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then are we still continuing with our previous plan?” Duan Yi’yi that practically always sat at the corner spoke out weakly. Even though she wasn’t as shy as she was before, her voice still hadn’t changed at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, she’d successfully pulled back the attention of everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The plan she mentioned was everything that Bai Xiaofei had done this morning, and the nine classes from this morning were merely the first step, whereas, Bai Xiaofei’s true goal was the entire ‘commoners district’!</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the recent conflicts he encountered, Bai Xiaofei had almost always noticed that those people who looked for trouble with him possessed a certain level of popularity as their foundation. In other words, they were able to find group after group of people to deal with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, as far as Bai Xiaofei was concerned, the occurrence of such situations would only increase in frequency. So, for the sake of avoiding being the person that was bashed by a group of people, Bai Xiaofei decided to bash others as a group!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first step to this was to find lackeys!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, Bai Xiaofei was only capable of getting new students to be his lackeys, so Bai Xiaofei cooked up an audacious plan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A plan to subdue all the new students in the ‘commoners district’! It was even to the extent that he wouldn’t let the internally recruited students off if he had the chance!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course it has to continue because this might be able to provide us with some funds!” As Bai Xiaofei spoke, he suddenly recalled something that Mo Ka and the others had complained to him about when they’d just met.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The oppression of the older students!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Bai Xiaofei was capable of dealing with this, then the protection fee of 8,000 people would form a bucket of gold even if Bai Xiaofei only took half the usual!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was instantly full of energy when they money was mentioned, and they stood up from their seats.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what are we waiting for? Let’s start now!!!” Xu Chen was worthy of being an Onslaught Stream puppet master because her fervor when dealing with things was something that none of the others in the Savage Class could compare to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no rush. Not to mention we must prove we have sufficient qualifications before that! It’s impossible to achieve this by merely dealing with those from the same intake as us!” Bai Xiaofei’s eyes flashed with a bright light as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the first time, he even started to slightly anticipate the arrival of those ignorant seniors!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if the heavens had heard Bai Xiaofei’s prayers because right when Bai Xiaofei and the others had just passed through the entrance of the Thousand Flavor house, an old acquaintance instantly charged over with excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Ye!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Fei!!!” For some unknown reason, he’d clearly suffered a loss at Bai Xiaofei’s hands just recently, yet Bai Ye seemed as if he’d seen a family member when he saw Bai Xiaofei, causing Bai Xiaofei to be dazed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, all of you are here as well? Have you eaten? It’s my treat if you haven’t!” Bai ye patted his chest as he spoke while a sly expression flashed past his face, whereas, the members of the Savage Class gave him disdainful gazes in unison.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>We just came out from a restaurant, so do you think we haven’t eaten?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“If it’s your treat, then I can consider having another meal.” Bai Xiaofei’s face and heartbeat remained as normal while he spoke, whereas, the nearby Huskie barked twice with excitement as well, causing Bai Ye who stood right before them to instantly start sweating.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>My god! Who can possibly bear to treat the two of you!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t, don’t, just don’t! Eating too much is bad for your body, it’s bad for your body….” Bai Ye wiped the cold sweat on his forehead as he hurriedly dispelled Bai Xiaofei’s thoughts to turn back. Otherwise, his living expenses for the next few months would be gone….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You wouldn’t come to me if you didn’t have something to ask. Speak, what’s the problem. Mo Ka, record the time.” Bai Xiaofei spoke casually, causing Bai Ye to be slightly stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Count the time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, every minute of my time you delay costs 10 Starnet Stones, and it’s considered as a minute even if a minute isn’t up.” Bai Xiaofei revealed the smile of an unscrupulous merchant as he grinned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“10 Starnet Stones for a minute?! Why don’t you just go rob someone!?” Bai Ye was instantly furious and pointed at Bai Xiaofei while seeming to be on the verge of flaring up. But, his rage instantly declined at the instant he noticed Lin Li, and he could only look at Bai Xiaofei with an expression of indignation and hatred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can take it as robbery. 20 seconds have passed already.” Bai Xiaofei cracked his neck while speaking in an unhurried manner, and his expression said. </span><i><span style>I’ll make a move if you don’t pay up’….</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“After she returned from the battle, Lingyan told all the male students that were pestering her that they must pass through you to pursue her, and there was no need to go look for her without your approval because she wouldn’t consider them no matter how outstanding they were.” Bai Ye instantly transformed into a machine gun that spoke a ton of things in a single breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, the members of the Savage Class couldn’t help but frown.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Didn’t she say she wouldn’t look for trouble with us?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the f*ck is this?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Has she gone back on her word so quickly?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was bewildered in their hearts, and only Bai Xiaofei instantly revealed a smile half a second later….</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he carefully analyzed what Qin Lingyan said, then they had to obtain his approval and not teach him a lesson. So in this way, the attitude of the people who came was completely decided by him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he instantly understood Qin Lingyan’s plans, not only was Bai Xiaofei not angry, wild joy gushed out from the bottom of his heart instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A pillow is there when one is drowsy just like a path to make money appears when one thinks of money!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey? Bai Xiaofei? The time you take to think can’t be counted within the time I use, right?” Bai Ye was anxious to the point of stamping his feet. After all, time was Starnet Stones to him now!!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t take a single Starnet Stone from you if you leave right now.” Bai Xiaofei who’d figured everything out looked at the anxious Bai Ye, and his speed of speaking slowed down slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright! Tell me! What do I need to do for you to give your approval!?” Bai Ye gritted his teeth and revealed his determination because 10 Starnet Stones for a minute was much better than treating Bai Xiaofei to a meal!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s rare that Senior Sister Lingyan trusts me so much. So, I have to think about it carefully. Come look for me again tonight, and I’ll give you an exact answer at that time.” Bai Xiaofei spoke unhurriedly and caused Bai Ye to be on the verge of exploding with rage, but he restrained himself in the end.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Motherf*cker! What can I do since I can’t defeat them!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright! Wait for my arrival!” Bai Ye turned and left as soon as he finished speaking yet Bai Xiaofei’s voice sounded out in a timely manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Two minutes and 20 seconds. 30 Starnet Stones.” As soon as Bai Xiaofei finished speaking, Fang Ye instantly took a step forward and took out his jade token.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You better not disappoint me!” As he squeezed out some fierce words with great difficulty, Bai Ye handed over the Starnet Stones obediently before leaving this vampire, Bai Xiaofei, as if he was running for his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Fei, you’re amazing! You earned 30 Starnet Stones so quickly!” Fang Ye who’d just received the payment smiled happily, and his money crazy attribute was gradually being developed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is only 30, there’ll be even more in the future!” Bai Xiaofei grinned as an enormous plan to earn money had already taken form within his mind!</span></p>
