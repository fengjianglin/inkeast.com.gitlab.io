 <p>“You… know me?” Bai Xiaofei asked weakly. Even though his attitude was very good, it wasn’t difficult to discern from the young woman’s unsightly expression that she really wanted to swing down a slap at him.</p>
 <p><i>Know you, I don’t just f*cking know you!</i></p>
 <p>“We met earlier.” As she forcefully suppressed the flames of rage in her heart and withdrew her slender palm, the young woman tried her best to make herself seem more normal. She couldn’t say ‘you did me’, right?</p>
 <p>“Fellow students, we’re both fellow students. I came here purely by accident. It’s all because of this damned dog, it was he who dragged me over here!” Huskie instantly let out aggrieved barks as Bai Xiaofei spoke, and his tiny appearance instantly destroyed Bai Xiaofei’s excuse.</p>
 <p>“What the f*ck are you acting aggrieved for now, do you have to f*cking sell me out?!” Bai Xiaofei’s face was covered in rage as he slapped Huskie heavily on the head.</p>
 <p>“Enough! Is this how you bully your puppet?” The young woman frowned and stopped Bai Xiaofei’s ‘violent acts’, whereas, Huskie seemed as if he’d found his master, and he flashed to the side of the young woman’s leg before rubbing it affectionately.</p>
 <p>Needlessly to say, Huskie’s appearance was extremely lethal to young women, and at the very least, at this moment, he was enjoying treatment that countless people were unable to enjoy even in their dreams.</p>
 <p>He was embraced up by the young woman….</p>
 <p>The young woman couldn’t help but smile lightly as she looked at Huskie’s silly appearance, and this smile caused Bai Xiaofei who laid partially on the ground to be completely dumbstruck.</p>
 <p>Because she originally had the intention of silencing Bai Xiaofei with death, the young woman hadn’t worn her clothes completely and neatly, causing her exquisite body to merely be covered by a loose coat that seemed to be at the length of a short skirt. Under the moonlight, her skin that could be faintly scene caused Bai Xiaofei to be unable to refrain from being lost in wild and fanciful thoughts.</p>
 <p>Gradually, a strand of warmth flowed out from Bai Xiaofei’s nose….</p>
 <p>“Shameless!” As she glared coldly at Bai Xiaofei, it was a mystery if the young woman was happy or angry as she cursed.</p>
 <p>“How can this be shameless?” Bai Xiaofei casually pulled off the corner of his clothes and blocked his nose.</p>
 <p>“This is the normal reaction of a man, alright? If I don’t have a nosebleed to display my respect after seeing a beauty of your caliber, then that would be strange.” If everyone could be tagged, then Bai Xiaofei’s tag would absolutely be that he would die if he didn’t talk garrulously.</p>
 <p>But, the interesting thing was that this young woman just happened to like it….</p>
 <p>Pu!</p>
 <p>Laughter resounded out and the young woman caused Bai Xiaofei to be stunned once more, whereas, the young woman seemed to really enjoy this sort of reaction from Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“No matter what, it’s a fact that you peeked on me while I was bathing. If I notify the academy about this, then they’ll probably deal with you, right?” The young woman smiled lightly and seemed to suddenly be interested in teasing Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“Kill more or dismember me, do as you please, beautiful fellow student. If you want it, then from today onwards, the 50 plus kilograms of flesh that I represent are all yours, and if you ask me to go east, then I’ll absolutely not go west.”</p>
 <p><i>Didn’t you say I’m shameless, then I’ll show you how shameless I am!</i></p>
 <p>“Who want’s your 50 plus kilograms of rotten flesh. You only have to remember that you owe me a favor, and if you dare run away when I need your help in the future, then I absolutely won’t forgive you!” A trace of a fierce expression flickered in her foxy eyes as she spoke, and her serious appearance was completely different from when she was smiling lightly earlier.</p>
 <p>“What’s so difficult about this? I, Bai Xiaofei, take delight in helping people the most, especially helping beautiful women.” Bai Xiaofei grinned and agreed directly.</p>
 <p>“Oh? So there’re many beautiful women that seek help from you?” The corners of her mouth twitched as her voice carried a trace of sour anger. Of course, Bai Xiaofei was currently incapable of sensing that trace of sourness.</p>
 <p>But, he was able to discern that she was angry.</p>
 <p><i>“Second Mother really wasn’t wrong, women are baffling creatures….” </i>Even though he muttered like this in his heart, Bai Xiaofei wasn’t stupid to the point of voicing it out loud. Even if he didn’t know why the young woman was angry, he knew what he should do at this moment….</p>
 <p>“There might have been in the past, but there won’t be any in the future. After I’ve seen you, Beautiful Big Sister, I feel my eyes have no place for anyone else.” Bai Xiaofei spoke as sincerely as sincerely could be, and it was sincere to the point that even Bai Xiaofei almost believed himself.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, the young woman didn’t have the slightest intention of believing him….</p>
 <p>“Sweet talk.” She grunted coldly before putting Huskie down.</p>
 <p>“Remember to be nicer to your puppet in the future. Animate puppets aren’t just tools, and you have to take him as your companion.” For some unknown reason, the young woman seemed to have strong feelings as she spoke these words.</p>
 <p>“Have you not seen enough!?” A trace of a blush appeared on the young woman’s face from being stared at constantly by Bai Xiaofei, but her tone was rather strong.</p>
 <p>“If I can, I would look for eternity. How could there be a time that I’ve seen enough?” Bai Xiaofei suddenly chuckled as he spoke yet never had he expected what would happen in the next moment.</p>
 <p>“If it’s like that, then I’ll make your memory slightly deeper!” As she smiled lightly, the young woman seemed to have grasped something interesting, and her tone had a trace of excitement.</p>
 <p>Subsequently, Bai Xiaofei saw a slender and jade white leg instantly arrive before him, and then….</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei flew high into the air….</p>
 <p>Very higher up….</p>
 <p>“Remember, my name is Hu Xian’er. If you dare forget it, then I’ll castrate you when we meet next!” Her pleasant voice still reverberated by his ears, and in the next moment, Bai Xiaofei had already returned to the embrace of mother earth while carrying the enormous force of gravity from his free fall….</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Fei!”</p>
 <p>“Save us!”</p>
 <p>In his daze, Bai Xiaofei who’d tumbled a distance on the ground heard a string of voices calling out for him, and these voices even carried a trace of being on the verge of tears.</p>
 <p>“Woof! Woof!” A wet feeling came from his face and Bai Xiaofei finally crawled up from the ground, and the first thing he saw after he got up was Huskie who was nervous to the point of jumping about.</p>
 <p>“Woof! Woof!” Huskie barked once more, and Bai Xiaofei’s brows instantly knit together.</p>
 <p>“The usual way!” As he spat three words out, Bai Xiaofei swiftly withdrew a ball that looked almost similar to the previous stinkweed bomb from within his pocket.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the body of Huskie who sat at the side was suffused with a blue colored glow once again, and under the glow, Huskie’s body was growing ceaselessly as his appeared underwent a tremendous change.</p>
 <p>Right at the instant that Huskie had just finished his transformation, Mo Ka and the others had finally ran over, and behind them was two Spiritual Rank magical beasts that were hunting, Wind Wolves!</p>
 <p>“What the f*ck, we’re dead!” The expressions of Mo Ka and the others instantly turned pale when they saw ‘Huskie’ who stood by Bai Xiaofei’s side.</p>
 <p><i>Isn’t this a f*cking Thunder Devouring Tiger?!</i></p>
 <p><i>A King Rank magical beast?!</i></p>
 <p>“Come over!” Right when the three of them already intended to turn around and forcefully resist the Wind Wolves, Bai Xiaofei called out to the three of them, and they were stunned for a moment and hesitated for a second before running towards Bai Xiaofei once again.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, the Wind Wolves that had chased them over her had stopped instead. But, they didn’t retreat at the first possible moment, and they stared carefully at the Thunder Devouring Tiger that Huskie had transformed into.</p>
 <p>“Huskie, eat them!” Huskie instantly roared along with Bai Xiaofei’s order, and at the same time, Bai Xiaofei crushed the ball in his hand, causing a deafening sound of muffled thunder to resound out.</p>
 <p>In the next second, Huskie had charged over directly, whereas, the two Wind Wolves that had been terrified to the point their legs had gone soft fled. It was even to the extent that they even utilized the wind attribute energy they possessed and weren’t so skilled in utilizing.</p>
 <p>“F*ck! Thank god it was Wind Wolves.” At the instant that the Wind Wolves vanished completely, Bai Xiaofei fell directly to the ground as he gasped heavily for breath, whereas, Mo Ka’s group of three were already dumbstruck by the scene from before.</p>
 <p><i>He ordered a Thunder Devouring Tiger about?!</i></p>
 <p><i>Is this something a human can f*cking do?!</i></p>
