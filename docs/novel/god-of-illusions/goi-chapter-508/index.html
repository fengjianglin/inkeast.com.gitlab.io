 <p>Chapter 508: Xue Ying’s Doubt!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei wandered with his chatty group of beauties until the next noon. Despite having little rest the previous night, they showed no sign of fatigue. Even when he suggested that it was time to go back, the girls were still unsatisfied and wanted more time.</p> 
 <p>But there was no way; if they didn’t leave now, they would have to spend another night in the Infinite Mountain Range. Even the most daring ones with the power to back their guts wouldn’t be so bold. Once Hu Xian’er was noticed by any magical beast, they’d be hard-pressed to leave this place.</p> 
 <p>Getting back on the road at their full capability, the group finally stepped out of the inner circumference. Leaving this danger zone, their speed was slowed.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei thought they could just run straight back, but now it seemed that he had underestimated the Infinite Mountain Range. In order not to stir up unnecessary trouble, they had to make multiple detours. Although Hu Xian’er could handle any obstacle in one blow, Bai Xiaofei didn’t let her.</p> 
 <p>It wasn’t that he was distrustful of the other girls, but there was nothing that could be kept under wraps forever. No one could guarantee that information wouldn’t get out once there were too many people who knew about it.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, the constant detours dragged their speed down.</p> 
 <p>“Why were there so many magical beasts?!” exclaimed Leng Liuying in a long breath of relief after they were finally freed, voicing the thoughts of everyone.</p> 
 <p>“And this is still the time when the Infinite Mountain Range isn’t active. Any later and we may not be able to move an inch. We were able to wander freely last night because the Gold Devouring Ants were out,” Hu Xian’er explained seriously.</p> 
 <p>“You seem to know the Infinite Mountain Range very well.” There was a hint of questioning in Xue Ying’s tone.</p> 
 <p>Indeed, at her age, Hu Xian’er shouldn’t know so much about a place like this.</p> 
 <p>“I know why Xian’er knows the Infinite Mountain Range!” Rui Mengqi suddenly cut in with a proud and excited expression just as Hu Xian’er hesitated about how to answer.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei and Hu Xian’er inwardly grew nervous.</p> 
 <p><em>What does she know?! How does she know?!</em></p> 
 <p>In a split second, countless ideas ran through Bai Xiaofei’s mind, but he still couldn’t come up with a reasonable explanation. However, just when he was ready for a showdown, Rui Mengqi said something that nearly made him stagger to his knees.</p> 
 <p>“Xian’er likes elective courses so much that she takes too many. She must have learned this from the courses!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei stared blankly. Even Hu Xian’er was mind-blown for a little.</p> 
 <p>This explanation…</p> 
 <p>Really made perfect sense!</p> 
 <p>“Yes, it was taught in class,” said Hu Xian’er.</p> 
 <p>Xue Ying made an odd expression, but in the end she could only let it slide. She’d seem petty and unreasonable if she held onto this.</p> 
 <p>However, Hu Xian’er secretly took notes of Xue Ying’s reaction. The latter’s suspicion of her had started during the battle with the Gold Devouring Ants. At that time, Xue Ying’s ability wasn’t useful in such a fight, so she could only go around and assist those in need here and there. That was to say, she had been paying attention to everyone in a cycle.</p> 
 <p>Then, she speculated that Hu Xian’er might not be a Transformation Stream puppet master!</p> 
 <p>There were two reasons. One was that Xue Ying searched her memory and couldn’t think of any magical beast that matched Hu Xian’er’s transformation form, and the second was that she had never seen any Transformation Stream waste a quota just to link an Energy Stream puppet. Therefore, she felt that there was something off about Hu Xian’er, but she just didn’t know where the problem lay, and she couldn’t guess what Hu Xian’er’s intention was for such a lie.</p> 
 <p>This increased Xue Ying’s worries. She worried that Hu Xian’er approached Bai Xiaofei with ulterior motives and would be detrimental to him. Anyone who had something to hide must have a scheme of their own.</p> 
 <p>It was a pity that Xue Ying didn’t know that Hu Xian’er wasn’t hiding anything from Bai Xiaofei. However, her thought was understandable.</p> 
 <p>Because she was also someone who had something to hide…</p> 
 <p>“It seems that we will spend tonight in the Infinite Mountain Range. Get ready.” Seeing the storm pass, Bai Xiaofei inwardly sighed in relief and hurriedly changed the subject.</p> 
 <p>“Camping here?” Chu Liuyun looked around, her brow slightly creased.</p> 
 <p>This spot was surrounded by towering trees so the visibility was extremely poor, and it looked like an area frequented by magical beasts.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t want to either, but there is no better choice. At least we have explored this neighborhood. It’s much safer than other places.”</p> 
 <p>At Bai Xiaofei’s words, Chu Liuyun sighed.</p> 
 <p>“It seems that this is the only choice. Liuli, let’s get something set up.” Calling Leng Liuli, Chu Liuyun took her into the forest. This area wasn’t like the mountainside yesterday, so some defensive measures had to be arranged. Moreover, Blackie was still in a weakened cooldown period, currently nestling in Rui Mengqi’s arms without moving.</p> 
 <p>The rest also got to work under Bai Xiaofei’s lead, and a simple camp appeared in the middle ring of the Infinite Mountain Range. This kind of behavior was tantamount to seeking death in the view of ordinary people, but who told Bai Xiaofei to be so bold and confident? What’s more, they had props to alert them.</p> 
 <p>In the middle of the night, after everyone fell asleep, Hu Xian’er quietly got up. After making sure no one had woken up and noticed her, Hu Xian’er disappeared into the forest with several flickers of her body.</p> 
 <p>Originally, she wanted to call Bai Xiaofei along, but his tent was next to Xue Ying’s. Thinking about what had happened during the day, she decided to go out by herself.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, she didn’t expect that Xue Ying had been waiting for this moment for half a night… The corners of her mouth curved up in a cold smile, Xue Ying slowly disappeared into the night. Lin Li sleeping next to her was completely unaware.</p> 
 <p>“My king, you have finally come!”</p> 
 <p>Seeing Hu Xian’er, Xing lowered his big head. Seemingly knowing that his bad breath was a bit fatal, he stayed further away this time.</p> 
 <p>“How many times have I said not to call me king. You can call me Xian’er just like Uncle Feng, after all, your sentient spirit<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>is older than me,” said Hu Xian’er with a slight smile. She didn’t seem to value her title too much.</p> 
 <p>If one stayed in the human world for a long time, they’d inevitably learn some things, especially Hu Xian’er, a freak for elective courses. Although unintentional, she had involuntarily started to manipulate people’s hearts… no, animals’ hearts!</p> 
 <p>“Then I won’t be polite…”</p> 
 <p>But before Xing could finish his words, Hong tail-whipped him on the back of his head.</p> 
 <p>“Propriety is still needed. We’ll go with Master Xian’er in the future.” Hong’s intelligence surpassed Xing by far. If it weren’t for Hong, Xing might have been tricked into becoming someone's dinner…</p> 
 <p>“Has anything special happened lately?…” Hu Xian’er began to discuss with Hong and Xing about the situation in the Infinite Mountain Range, and then told them of the plan, since her people definitely would ‘participate’ in the grand celebration…</p> 
 <p>This whole process was observed by Xue Ying!</p>
