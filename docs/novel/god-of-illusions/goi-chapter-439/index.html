 <p>Chapter 439: Reaching a Consensus!</p> 
 <p>Staring at the unwavering Fang Lei, Bai Xiaofei lapsed into a long silence. His face repeatedly changed as all kinds of ideas were taken into consideration in his mind.</p> 
 <p>Were the Thunderstorm Bandits bad?</p> 
 <p>For the people who had been handled by them, yes, they couldn’t be any worse. Massacre was a frequent choice, and they brought nothing but bad news for others. They were loathed by many all over the continent. Otherwise, the Globe Merchant Group wouldn’t have put in so much effort, even using the Skypatch Pill as bait to destroy them.</p> 
 <p>However, for those who have been helped by them, they were not. Those people might even regard the Thunderstorm Bandits as their saviors and the kindest people on earth.</p> 
 <p>As for the Thunderstorm Bandits’ own point of view, Fang Lei’s attitude already spoke for itself.</p> 
 <p>They didn’t consider what they were doing was wrong, and they would continue to do so, protecting those they deemed in need of protection and punishing those they deemed in need of punishment. Everything they did was just following their hearts!</p> 
 <p><em>Follow your heart, isn’t that what my parents told me?</em></p> 
 <p>In this continent, there was no clear distinction between good and evil. Everyone had their merits, except for people who were heinous to the core. Everyone had two sides, and it was already commendable to have a clear conscience.</p> 
 <p>Yet the Thunderstorm Bandits managed to do it. They retained an absolutely clear conscience. The only pity was that they sacrificed lives for it. From this aspect, they were even respectable!</p> 
 <p>And the road they took was exactly what Bai Xiaofei was also looking for. Bai Xiaofei was not a saint, he could not help the entire world. He could only take care of a limited number of people, for which he had to squeeze out benefits from others. From this perspective, was there any difference between him and the Thunderstorm Bandits?</p> 
 <p>In fact, Bai Xiaofei wasn’t even worthy to be compared to them. At least the Thunderstorm Bandits were willing to fight for a bunch of strangers, while he only cared on a small scale…</p> 
 <p>Reaching this conclusion, Bai Xiaofei slowly revealed a smile.</p> 
 <p>Different moral standards meant little common ground. Then what about having the same moral standard?</p> 
 <p>“You must have come to me for help. I am willing to cooperate with you!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s first sentence to break the silence stunned Fang Lei on the spot. The change of pace was really a bit fast… After all, Fang Lei didn’t know what was going on in Bai Xiaofei’s head.</p> 
 <p>“Are you sure?” asked Fang Lei with a hint of suspicion. He felt that the situation was a little surreal.</p> 
 <p>“Is it so hard to believe? Since Qing’er certainly won’t leave you, what other choices do I have? I cannot bear to do something like dine and dash, so I will do what I need to do. As for the misunderstanding between us, I believe that time will resolve it.” Bai Xiaofei was extremely earnest, and it showed on his face.</p> 
 <p>“Humph, I warn you, do not set your sights on our little sister again!” Fang Lei stubbornly uttered words that weren’t quite appropriate for the situation.</p> 
 <p>Qin Lingyan and the others who were listening in at the side immediately revealed clueless looks.</p> 
 <p><em>Who is Qing’er?</em></p> 
 <p><em>When did Bai Xiaofei get involved with such a person?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Didn’t he say he didn’t know anyone outside? And it’s a member of the Thunderstorm Bandits at that?!</em></p> 
 <p>A myriad of question marks flew above their heads, everyone began to recall Bai Xiaofei’s past actions to see if they had missed anything. All four of them came up with the same answer: Nothing…</p> 
 <p>The only one with doubts was Qin Lingyan as she remembered Bai Xiaofei telling her about hiding a beauty in his room. However, she herself quickly denied this idea. That was less than two days, alright? How was it possible to win over a girl with a complicated background who he had never met before?</p> 
 <p>Well, Bai Xiaofei got a girl, and he even ate her clean…</p> 
 <p>“Sorry, I can’t promise this. There are some things that you and I just can’t stop,” Bai Xiaofei straight up retorted with a smile. Fang Lei wanted to say something back but was interrupted by his next words. “Since the ceremony is tomorrow, tonight is our last chance to prepare. Whether you get the Skypatch Pill depends on this, so…”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei paused and looked sharply at Fang Lei, making a chill run down the latter’s spine.</p> 
 <p>“So what…” Fang Lei gulped and asked weakly as an eerie feeling spread through him. His previous domineering air had completely vanished.</p> 
 <p>“So, I need to fully get to know each and every one of you! Only in this way can I make the best arrangements. Tang Bing’s preparations far exceed what we can imagine. If I guess correctly, there will definitely be a Grandmaster Rank opponent present tomorrow!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the rest frowned in unison.</p> 
 <p>For Qin Lingyan’s group, it was simply because of the word ‘grandmaster,’ while Fang Lei was more hesitant about the first half.</p> 
 <p>The Thunderstorm Bandits had killed Grandmaster Rank puppet masters before, but they had never once completely exposed the abilities of their members to others.</p> 
 <p>“Agree to his request.” As Fang Lei hesitated, a voice transmitted into his head. His creased brows relaxed.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, I’ll tell you!” Fang Lei heavily uttered. A smile instantly spread on Bai Xiaofei’s face.</p> 
 <p>“Since we all are going to be open and honest, how about calling our onlookers over and spare my Blackie from having to keep a constant watch.” Bai Xiaofei gently waved his hand. Blackie appeared from thin air and lay on his shoulder.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Fang Lei was a little embarrassed. <em>Turns out he already saw everything…</em></p> 
 <p>Before long, a group arrived. It was every core member of the Thunderstorm Bandits except Nie Qing.</p> 
 <p>Nie Qing’s absence drew a helpless sigh from Bai Xiaofei. <em>It seems that this ordeal will not be easily passed…</em></p> 
 <p>“Let me formally introduce to you, this one is Bai Xiaofei, a first-year student of Starnet. These four are my seniors, Qin Lingyan, Bai Ye, Chu Yue, and Zhao Tiantian.” Looking around at all the newcomers, Bai Xiaofei lowered his attitude and actively introduced his group.</p> 
 <p>However, while this made him seem generous, he was carrying out a little trick.</p> 
 <p><em>Since we are honest about ourselves, you guys have to as well, no? In any case, we are going to cooperate, aren’t we?</em></p> 
 <p>Sure enough, after his introduction, Fang Lei turned to look at his comrades. “Give a simple introduction of yourselves, in order.”</p> 
 <p>At this, the other party responded accordingly.</p> 
 <p>“Yun Mo, puppet master of a special Energy Stream branch.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s group couldn’t be more familiar with Yun Mo. The previous battle was still fresh in their memory.</p> 
 <p>“He Rushi, alchemist, and part-time brawler.” He Rushi took one step forward with a silly smile. This person always had a relaxed expression on his face.</p> 
 <p>“Xia He, restraint-type Support Stream puppet master.” Xia He was a beautiful woman that gave off a well-cultured, elder sister feeling. Aside from her role as the brains and the fourth sister of the Thunderstorm Bandits, she was also Fang Lei’s other half.</p> 
 <p>“Our fifth sister was attacked by Tang Bing and is still in a coma. Her name is Qing Shuang, also a Support Stream puppet master. She is Yun Mo’s wife,” said Fang Lei.</p> 
 <p>The faces of the others immediately revealed a hint of grief. For the Thunderstorm Bandits, nothing else in this world could make them feel worse than the life of one of their own at stake…</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, we will definitely get that Skypatch Pill!” Bai Xiaofei seriously declared, bringing a light of hope to their eyes.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, their gazes on him also softened…</p>
