<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Chapter 783: Strange Boy!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s counter-snipe threw the whole auction into a daze.</p> 
 <p><em>Where’s your super money bag?! Where’s your crushing bid?! Brother, how can we play when you’re like that?!!</em></p> 
 <p>Seeing the reactions of the people below, Bai Xiaofei only smiled. After all, the auction still needed to go on. <em>Don’t you want to play the raise-the-price game? Come, I’ll play with you!</em></p> 
 <p>“Our next item is a bit special. This position was originally not for him, but this guy escaped once not long ago and in order to capture him back, we paid the price of two Grandmaster Ranks and an Exquisite Rank puppet masters,” Han Qing’s voice sank at the end.</p> 
 <p>The introduction drew deep gasps from the guests. Grandmaster Rank puppet masters were nothing, but it was different for the Exquisite Rank as it was beyond the reach of most people.</p> 
 <p>Although it was only the difference of one rank, the gap in strength between the two was much more than that. Being an Exquisite Rank puppet master meant that one had thoroughly grasped the abilities of the five great realms of Grandmaster Rank and could even kill someone from thousands of miles away.</p> 
 <p><em>And yet, such a character was killed by a slave?! Just how strong is this slave?!</em></p> 
 <p>Doubt filled everyone’s heart, but when the slave was pushed up on the stage, they were dumbfounded.</p> 
 <p>It was a skinny little boy who growled at the audience like crazy. The chains on his limbs and neck were thicker than his thighs. His messy long hair covered his face, and the mud on his body made him look like not a human being, but a wild beast!</p> 
 <p>However, when the people in the audience used their spirit to probe him, their doubts deepened. They did not detect any origin energy!</p> 
 <p><em>This boy is nothing but an ordinary person! How can he kill an Exquisite Rank puppet master? Are you kidding me?!</em></p> 
 <p>“When did Unify Business start scamming people? This little guy is a bit wild, but let alone an Exquisite Rank, even a Master Rank puppet master can blow him into pieces!”</p> 
 <p>There was no shortage of people who dared to speak out in the auction, and Qing Han seemed to have anticipated this. Without a word, he beckoned his people to go up with a long blade.</p> 
 <p>Without further ado and with a painful roar of the little boy, the long blade pierced his chest and the attacker even twisted it. Blood and meat bits gushed out. However, right after the blade was pulled out, the wound recovered at a speed visible to the naked eye. In just three seconds, the little boy roared angrily at everyone with an even louder voice!</p> 
 <p>“I believe you all can see that the chains binding him are made of Deepfrost Silver, which has a strong reduction effect on self-healing. Without this, it’ll only take him a split second to recover from a fatal injury. Moreover, every time he is injured, his physical quality will skyrocket for a period of time. The heavier the injury, the greater the enhancement.”</p> 
 <p>“This is a special physique that has never been seen before. We named it Immortal!”</p> 
 <p>When Qing Han finished, no one had any more questions. On the contrary, everyone looked at the boy with a hungry glint in their eyes. As a bodyguard, the boy was obviously unqualified, because no one could control him at all.</p> 
 <p>However, as a research object, he was priceless.</p> 
 <p><em>Once the secret of his physique is unlocked and then I transfer this ability to myself… If this special constitution combines with my puppet master’s ability, let alone Exquisite Rank opponents, even Legend Rank experts will have apprehension!</em></p> 
 <p>“I believe that this is enough of an introduction. The starting price is fifty million Amethyst Coins.”</p> 
 <p>Qing Han did not expect that as soon as he announced the starting price, Bai Xiaofei’s voice rang out.</p> 
 <p>“One hundred billion!”</p> 
 <p>The whole hall fell silent, there was not even a loud breath.</p> 
 <p><em>Shill bidding? Or does he really want this little guy?</em></p> 
 <p>100 billion Amethyst Coins was not expensive at all for the Immortal Physique, but what they feared was that Bai Xiaofei was replaying his trick just now which had ruined several bosses. What if they became the next victim? Moreover, the Slave stage was not over and the quality of the item was already at this level. Just how terrifying would the next ones be?</p> 
 <p>“Hammer,” Bai Xiaofei reminded Qing Han.</p> 
 <p>Returning to his senses, Qing Han hurriedly reprised his role.</p> 
 <p>“One hundred billion from Young Master Bai, going once… Going twice… Sold!”</p> 
 <p>Although Qing Han deliberately prolonged his announcement, not a single person stepped out against Bai Xiaofei. Many regretted it, but even more people heaved a sigh of relief.</p> 
 <p><em>A hundred billion should not be a small strike to his pocket!</em></p> 
 <p>They were right, it was indeed not small. However, Bai Xiaofei just got insider information from Qing Ya that the little boy was already the second last slave, while he still had more than 300 billion Amethyst Coins left in reserve!</p> 
 <p>By this point, Bai Xiaofei had basically figured out the finances of the others. 300 billion should be enough to win the final slave. At the thought of the finale, he was excited.</p> 
 <p>Would it be what he wanted to see?</p> 
 <p>As the last cart was wheeled up, Bai Xiaofei’s heart jumped into his throat, and the expectation on his face turned into ecstasy. It was a scent that he could not be more familiar with!</p> 
 <p><em>Absolutely, no matter what, I must win this!</em></p> 
 <p>At the same time, Qing Han cleared his throat and grabbed everyone’s attention.</p> 
 <p><em>The last two were already earth-shaking enough. This one has to be heaven-shattering!</em></p> 
 <p>“I forgot to tell you, in fact, the previous one is already the penultimate item of our auction, so what you will be seeing next is today’s finale!” Qing Han took a deep breath. “Please believe that this race has not been seen on the continent for hundreds or even thousands of years, and I know many of you won’t be able to help it, so I hope you brought enough money today!”</p> 
 <p>Qing Han grasped the red cloth on the cage and slowly uncovered it. Then, the sounds of gasps rang out one after another.</p> 
 <p>“Fifty billion!”</p> 
 <p>“One hundred billion!”</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>There was no need for Qing Han to help raise the price as the audience had gone crazy. </p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei’s heart completely fell back into place when he saw the one in the cage.</p> 
 <p><em>Finally!!!</em></p>
