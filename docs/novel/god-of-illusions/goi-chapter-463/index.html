 <p>Chapter 463: Seeing the Two Old Men again!</p> 
 <p>After Fang Ye finished, there was only one person left to deal with, and this was also Bai Xiaofei’s biggest headache.</p> 
 <p>Because he could not push it away…</p> 
 <p>“It’s time for you to take over the Blossom Pavilion.” Yun Jingshuang cut to the chase, his insipid tone leaving no room for refusal.</p> 
 <p>“So quick?” Bai Xiaofei made a difficult face. He who was used to washing his hands off things was already squealing in his heart.</p> 
 <p>“If I could, I wouldn’t want to leave the Blossom Pavilion, but I will graduate soon and Qianye is leaving with me. No matter how difficult you are having it, you must take over,” Yun Jingshuang repeated.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei went blank in his seat.</p> 
 <p><em>Graduate?! Then…</em></p> 
 <p>With a horrified expression, Bai Xiaofei looked over to Chu Liuyun. She was a fourth-year student. If Yun Jingshuang was graduating, wouldn’t she also have to go as well?</p> 
 <p>The bright Chu Liuyun immediately understood Bai Xiaofei’s look and slowly revealed a smile to answer his silent question.</p> 
 <p>“You’re not changing your mind now, are you?” Yun Jingshuang frowned after Bai Xiaofei had not responded for a long time. Telling him to find another successor now was a bit unrealistic.</p> 
 <p>“Ah! No, no! I just thought of something else,” returning to his senses, Bai Xiaofei hurriedly clarified. “Don’t worry, Big Brother Yun, I will come over as soon as possible.”</p> 
 <p>With something else weighing in his mind, Bai Xiaofei agreed much more straightforwardly than before. The only thing in his head now was that Chu Liuyun had to go…</p> 
 <p>“There is one more thing you should pay attention to.” Yun Jingshuang struck while Bai Xiaofei’s brain was still in chaos.</p> 
 <p>“There’s more?!” Shocked, Bai Xiaofei truly felt that he had derailed from Starnet. It seemed as if any matter that they casually mentioned could scare him now.</p> 
 <p>“This is not business-related, but it will make you very uncomfortable,” Yun Jingshuang paused and flashed an evil smile. “Remember your own proposal about giving out the opportunity to meet with the Blossom rankers? The previous Blossom competition released a large number of Blossom Tickets. This, coupled with the accumulation over the last half a year, has now resulted in countless people who meet the conditions. The rest of the guardians have losses and wins, but I repelled all of those who chose Senior Sister Hu Xian’er and the others.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately understood. To put it simply, he would have to fight with others every day starting now… And he could not lose any, or he would have to watch Hu Xian’er or Chu Liuyun meet the rest of the challengers for meals and all that, which would be unbearable!</p> 
 <p>Thinking this, an idea that Bai Xiaofei had developed in Ancient Yue was firmly established. He must put it into practice as soon as possible!</p> 
 <p>“I won’t say thanks to you, but when you and Senior Sister Qianye get married, I will definitely bring a big red envelope.” Bai Xiaofei set aside the matter in his heart and expressed his gratitude to Yun Jingshuang.</p> 
 <p>At this point, everyone had been met and Bai Xiaofei’s brain was stuffed with nothing but urgent matters. Even though it seemed like he had pushed almost everything away, he knew that it was impossible for certain things as long as he was still in Starnet.</p> 
 <p>The tree wanted calm but the wind would not cease. Bai Xiaofei’s current status in Starnet was completely out of touch with his strength, which brought him countless possibilities of being found fault with. Therefore, precautions had to be taken.</p> 
 <p>However, in any case, these things were too simple compared to what had happened in Ancient Yue. No matter how hard the students fought amongst themselves, they were still students. Simple was a label that 99% of the students could not get rid of.</p> 
 <p>Even someone as strong as Su Yu and as smart as Sima Ye, all they had was just a simple competitive heart; while the outside world required one to put their life on the line every moment!</p> 
 <p>“Then you better get ready,” said Yun Jingshuang as he took Han Qianye’s hand in his. For once, the ever-lively Han Qianye blushed and lowered her head.</p> 
 <p>“What do you mean…” Bai Xiaofei’s expression was a mix of confusion and disbelief. Although he was the one who encouraged their relationship, he didn’t expect them to progress so fast. Had their relationship already reached this extent?!</p> 
 <p>“I plan to visit the Han family to propose as soon as I can. I don’t want to be bested by my brothers and regret for the rest of my life.” Yun Jingshuang smiled slightly and his face was firm.</p> 
 <p>“Then we have to toast this in advance!” Bai Xiaofei exclaimed. The rest of the people present followed and delivered their blessings. Yun Jingshuang’s identity was already a known secret in this small group, so everyone knew what his decision meant.</p> 
 <p>After congratulating Yun Jingshuang, the welcome-back banquet was over. Initially, Bai Xiaofei was planning to spend time and ‘chat about life’ with his beauties after sending the others away, but Chu Qingtian unexpectedly brought more news.</p> 
 <p>“Your master and the principal are waiting for you. Now that you have finished here, come with me.” In front of Bai Xiaofei, Chu Qingtian seemed to have forgotten that he was the vice principal. He had put Bai Xiaofei in a position equal to himself after the Di Jiang incident.</p> 
 <p>Strength was only a matter of time. What really made people value another was personality and charisma!</p> 
 <p>“The old geez… eh- my master is here?!” A shocked Bai Xiaofei nearly had a slip of the tongue. Chu Qingtian simply chose to ignore the first three words.</p> 
 <p>“He’s arrived quite a while now, but they told me not to tell you until you were done here.”</p> 
 <p>Chu Qingtian’s words made Bai Xiaofei feel warm in his heart. It was not easy for people of Lei Shan and Revelation’s status to take care of him with the little things.</p> 
 <p>They knew that if they informed him before, he would definitely have gone to see them first. But instead of doing so, they gave him enough time to deal with his affairs and settle his connections.</p> 
 <p>Thinking this, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but feel grateful towards those two lovely old geezers…</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go, it’s not good to keep them waiting,” said Bai Xiaofei. He briefly explained to the others before following Chu Qingtian to the principal’s office.</p> 
 <p>“Now that’s a beauty!”</p> 
 <p>“My good brother!”</p> 
 <p>“……”</p> 
 <p>Approaching the principal’s office, two familiar voices reached their ears, and the gratitude that Bai Xiaofei just felt before vanished instantly as he creased his forehead in speechlessness.</p> 
 <p>Chu Qingtian awkwardly cleared his throat. “Well, that… Go in by yourself, I still have work to do. See you later!” Then he hurriedly ran off without giving Bai Xiaofei a chance to stop him. Seeing your boss acting like a fool was the fastest road to death, and Chu Qingtian wasn’t so stupid…</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei was not afraid!</p> 
 <p>Fiercely pushing open the door, he was overwhelmed by the strong smell of alcohol. Inside, two white-bearded old men were topless as they flailed their arms about. Lying around were seven or eight empty flagons, and their faces were beet red.</p> 
 <p>The scene was fixed at this moment…</p>
