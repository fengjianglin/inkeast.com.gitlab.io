 <p>Heh! That title caught your attention, didn’t it? :P Well, I’m not kidding! We present to you <a href="https://www.volarenovels.com/novel/rebirth-of-a-fashionista" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">Rebirth of a Fashionista</span></strong></a>!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>After Bai Xiaofei’s question, everyone in the Savage Class looked at Fang Ye expectantly, waiting for him to make his choice. However, the Savage Class members differed in what they anticipated. The girls were more inclined towards selecting the first option. They felt that the other two options were no different from cutting Fang Ye off from everyone. That would just be too sad.</p>
 <p>As for the guys, they preferred the second option. As far as they were concerned, a real man needed to always avenge himself. If someone provoked him even once, he should let that person wallow in regret even in the afterlife.</p>
 <p>Of course, none of them said anything out of respect for Fang Ye. For something like this, he was the only one who could make a decision he would not regret in the future. As everyone waited, Fang Ye seemed to have finally decided upon something. The hesitation on his face eased up, replaced by sadness.</p>
 <p>“No matter what, my father is still the one who raised me. Although growing up was very difficult and miserable for me, I was still better off than those who couldn’t even afford a meal. Therefore, I am selecting the third option. I will be drawing a clear line between myself and them.”</p>
 <p>“Are you sure?” Bai Xiaofei’s calm voice sounded. All along his gaze had never left Fang Ye. Even when Fang Ye looked at him, his gaze did not shift away.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fang Ye blanked out slightly when he saw that Bai Xiaofei’s gaze appeared like that of a teacher questioning his student. Nevertheless, it did not take long for a resolute expression to form on Fang Ye’s face.</p>
 <p>“I am sure.” The hesitation that was previously present in his voice was now gone.</p>
 <p>“There is no cure for regret. If you regret this in the future, I won’t help you.” Bai Xiaofei pushed further while still fixing his gaze on Fang Ye.</p>
 <p>“I have already made up my mind. Even if I really regret this in the future, I will deal with it myself. I won’t trouble all of you!” This time both the sadness and hesitation in his voice was gone, and taking their place was resolution.</p>
 <p>“Good. Let us move on to the next topic.” Bai Xiaofei paused, the solemn expression vanishing from his face. His trademark rascally smirk crept onto his face. “So how many assets does your family have?”</p>
 <p>The moment he said this, the other Savage Class members who were still maintaining solemn expressions were dumbstruck. Indeed, Bai Xiaofei could never stay serious for long.</p>
 <p>“I’m afraid I don’t know. But I’m sure the total amount will not surpass fifty billion. After all, my family’s merchant house isn’t really that big…”</p>
 <p>While Fang Ye said this weakly, the others were gulping.</p>
 <p><em>Fifty billion…not very huge…indeed! People with different backgrounds will have different worldviews.</em></p>
 <p>“Only fifty billion? I thought there would be a couple quadrillion or something,” Bai Xiaofei said nonchalantly. Once again, everyone was stunned.</p>
 <p><em>Boss, you’re supposed to originate from an extremely poor place. What do you mean by only fifty billion?</em></p>
 <p>Their astonishment was completely visible on their faces. It was good that Bai Xiaofei was still keeping the bet a secret from them. Or else…</p>
 <p>“Bring me to your father. He’s probably still waiting for your answer.”</p>
 <p>Then, Bai Xiaofei stopped and patted Fang Ye’s shoulder with a smile on his face. For some reason this gesture, which seemed incredibly normal, warmed Fang Ye’s heart. It was fortunate that Fang Ye wasn’t a woman…</p>
 <p>“There are so many people…” Fang Ye hesitated when he looked at the eager expressions of everyone around him. The moment he spoke, Xu Chen walked towards Bai Xiaofei and held out her hand.</p>
 <p>She said, “We are going shopping. I heard the Tailor Pavilion has restocked with a lot of new products. Class monitor, give us some money.”</p>
 <p>With a bitter smile, Bai Xiaofei took out his Amethyst Card and transferred some money to Xu Chen. While doing so, he inwardly placed this debt on Fang Ye’s shoulder. He had even added interest on top of the debt.</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Fei, we want to have a feast. Can we…” Right after Xu Chen left, Mo Ka and Xing Nan stretched out their hands as well.</p>
 <p>“Scram. Do you want my fist instead?”</p>
 <p>After Bai Xiaofei slapped them away like some flies, they both looked resentful.</p>
 <p><em>We are all classmates. Do you need to treat us so differently?</em></p>
 <p>Unfortunately for them, the answer for this was a “yes”.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Fang Ye felt apologetic. Therefore, he took out two one-use Amethyst Cards from his storage ring and gave the cards to them. One-use Amethyst Cards were cards that anyone could use as long as they had the card with them.</p>
 <p>“Heh heh, Boss Fang is still the generous one!”</p>
 <p>After berating Bai Xiaofei in an indirect manner, the guys rushed away. They had to rush away, as Bai Xiaofei would truly lay his fists on them if he said so. After everyone scattered away, only Bai Xiaofei, Fang Ye, Wang Hang, and Xue Ying were left.</p>
 <p>“I don’t have to excuse myself, right? Wouldn’t it be better to meet your father with your teacher by your side?” Xue Ying was obviously not planning to leave, and Bai Xiaofei was naturally without the courage to defy her.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei stopped smiling and said with a solemn expression, “Yes, anything Big Sister Xue says is right!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xue Ying rolled her eyes in response. Thus, with Fang Ye in the lead, all four of them headed towards the district the academy had temporarily allocated to accommodate guests.</p>
 <p>At this time each year, the academy would rake in a huge sum of money. This simple and crude temporary guest accommodation district was actually charging the guests twenty gold coins per night. Even so, the district was still packed full with people. A lot of people were forced to set up their own tents or to straight up live at their children’s dormitories instead. Of course, Fang Ye’s father could afford twenty gold coins per night.</p>
 <p>Soon, they arrived in front of a small independent building. Fang Ye lightly knocked on the door, and a voice filled with impatience sounded from within the room.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, yeah, I’m coming. Stop knocking. Why are there so many issues for me to attend to at this stupid place? It’s not like I enjoy staying here.”</p>
 <p>The complaint towards the end was spoken softly, but the room’s sound insulation was quite poor. Therefore, they had still heard it clearly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Soon, the door opened, and a woman wearing thick makeup appeared before them. One wouldn’t say she was beautiful, but she was still probably a woman with above-average looks. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have been able to have Fang Ye’s father listening to her every whim.</p>
 <p>“Ohh, it’s Fang Ye? Come in. They must be your classmates. Are you guys hungry? I’ll get your brother to buy some food.”</p>
 <p>Her warmth was surprising for Bai Xiaofei and Xue Ying. However, they came to a certain realization when they saw the shift in Wang Hang’s expression. Some people would be smiling while they stabbed you in the back!</p>
 <p>“No thanks. I am here to look for father, Aunt Fang. I have something to tell him.” Fang Ye politely rejected, but it was clear he did not like this Aunt Fang. He was no idiot. After so many years, he already knew what kind of person this woman was.</p>
 <p>“Ok, I’ll get him for you. He’s somewhat tired and was taking a rest.”</p>
 <p>“I’m awake.”</p>
 <p>Before Aunt Fang could finish speaking, a deep voice sounded. Bai Xiaofei looked at where the voice came from and saw a middle-aged man with a square face. This was Fang Ye’s father, Fang Guozheng.</p>
