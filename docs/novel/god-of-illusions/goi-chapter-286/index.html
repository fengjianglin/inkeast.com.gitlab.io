 <p>Chapter 286: Meeting Qian Chonglou Again!</p> 
 <p>His nostrils stuffed with paper, Bai Xiaofei awkwardly walked ahead while Rui Mengqi followed closely behind him, afraid of losing her new little teacher.</p> 
 <p>When the people waiting saw Bai Xiaofei, reactions emerged endlessly, and the most infuriating belonged to Feng Wuhen and Lu Lingyun.</p> 
 <p>“See, I told you he’d definitely have a nosebleed!” Lu Lingyun smugly extended his hand to Feng Wuhen. The latter reluctantly took out a grade five pill and gave it to him.</p> 
 <p>Watching as this ‘dirty’ deal happened in front of him, Bai Xiaofei was irked so bad that his teeth itched.</p> 
 <p><em>Damn it, they used me for a bet! Like that’s not enough, the content turned out to be this!</em></p> 
 <p>If it weren’t for the fact that Bai Xiaofei didn’t know these two’s real strength, he would have wanted a duel!</p> 
 <p>“Lil’ Fei, you…” Yun Sheng came up to Bai Xiaofei. Looking at the guy trying to hold back his laughter, Bai Xiaofei was furious.</p> 
 <p><em>You can never have enough of chaos, huh?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Can’t I have hit my nose when I woke up or something? Start the meal already!” With a cold snort, Bai Xiaofei sat down as if nothing had happened. Grabbing a steamed bun, he glared at Feng Wuhen and Lu Lingyun while taking a vicious bite, as if biting into them.</p> 
 <p>“Ahh, Sister Liuyun, it seems that you’re not attractive enough. I haven't seen Bai Xiaofei hit his nose even once for you before, yet our Mengqi succeeded right off the bat!” Grinning, Yun Sheng started provoking.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, he chose the wrong person.</p> 
 <p>“I think you’ve eaten too full. Want me to clear your stomach so you can eat a little more?” said Chu Liuyun icily.</p> 
 <p>Yun Sheng instantly went silent. <em>This one can’t be provoked, really can’t be provoked…</em></p> 
 <p>However, his words still had an effect. Chu Liuyun, who hadn’t taken it seriously, now had a trace of grudge in her eyes when she looked at Bai Xiaofei. What Yun Sheng had just said kept echoing in her mind.</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, Bai Xiaofei didn't catch her extremely complicated look, or else he might just have another headache.</p> 
 <p>The meal could be said to be quite uncomfortable for Bai Xiaofei. While Leng Liushuang’s culinary skills were impeccable, the atmosphere was too weird. After the meal, Bai Xiaofei felt like there was something wrong with the way everyone looked at him.</p> 
 <p>Except for Rui Mengqi, of course. She didn’t seem to be able to understand the eyes of others. On this point alone, it was hard to believe that she was trained by the Babel Merchant House. How was such a failure produced from such a harsh place? Life was amazing indeed.</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, heaven wasn’t blind. Just when Bai Xiaofei didn’t know what to do, Lei Min suddenly stood up with a serious expression.</p> 
 <p>“Someone is coming!” said Lei Min coldly. Everyone instantly grew serious as well.</p> 
 <p>“Why so serious? It’s not like they’re coming for revenge. Think about it, we are in Starnet,” commented Bai Xiaofei lazily. He didn’t look like he cared at all. “Brother Lu, don’t you like gambling? How about we make a bet?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei laughed evilly as he looked at Lu Lingyun, his intention of revenge was quite obvious.</p> 
 <p>“Bet on what?”</p> 
 <p>“Bet on who's coming. Whoever loses has to wash the winners’ socks for a month!” Bai Xiaofei's appetite was as voracious as ever.</p> 
 <p>“How on earth can I guess this?” Lu Lingyun panicked, his first thought was that he couldn’t agree to this. However, he felt bad for refusing after he had played Bai Xiaofei once.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll make the guess. If I guess wrong then it counts as your win. Are you betting or not?” Bai Xiaofei dangled the bait. He didn’t intend to let Lu Lingyun off anyway.</p> 
 <p>“What if you made an appointment with that person?” Lu Lingyun put up a token resistance.</p> 
 <p>“I swear I didn’t!” Bai Xiaofei raised his hand in a vow, breaking Lu Lingyun’s last line of defense.</p> 
 <p>“Fine!” Lu Lingyun gritted his teeth and spat out his agreement, making a difficult and wrong decision.</p> 
 <p>“Qian Chonglou, the one outside is Qian Chonglou, your former boss,” Bai Xiaofei immediately said the moment Lu Lingyun agreed lest he went back on his word.</p> 
 <p>While Lu Lingyun heard ‘Qian Chonglou,’ he was stunned for a moment before understanding, and regret appeared on his face.</p> 
 <p><em>Dang it! How could I forget about this?!</em></p> 
 <p>After the bet was officialized, Bai Xiaofei walked out happily, followed by Lu Lingyun, Feng Wuhen, and the rest. They were curious if Bai Xiaofei’s guess was right and, at the same time, were a little too idle.</p> 
 <p>Fact proved that Bai Xiaofei never fought unprepared battles. In the next month to come, Lu Lingyun had new work to do.</p> 
 <p>“I didn't expect to see you again so soon, Chief Qian.” Bai Xiaofei’s smiling face showed neither astonishment nor surprise, which slightly startled Qian Chonglou.</p> 
 <p>“Am I not welcome?” Surprised as he was, Qian Chonglou didn’t hesitate one bit in his reply.</p> 
 <p>“How is that possible? The God of Fortune coming to our door is something that only happens when the stars align. If you don't mind, Chief Qian, let’s talk inside?”</p> 
 <p>Qian Chonglou’s mouth twitched when he heard ‘God of Fortune,’ but this emotion was quickly contained. “Now that I get to see Starnet’s Demon of Illusions, I can go back and brag about it.”</p> 
 <p><em>This flattery… uhh…</em></p> 
 <p><em>There are only a few people in the Demon of Illusions. You have seen all of it.</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei naturally wouldn’t expose him. After all, this was the God of Fortune!</p> 
 <p>Bringing Qian Chonglou and his attendant to a living room, everyone left except for Bai Xiaofei, Feng Wuhen, and Lu Lingyun. The three Leng sisters acted as hosts, delivering tea and fruit before they withdrew as well.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s not beat around the bush, Mr. Bai. I'm here about the Thousand Aroma Restaurant,” Qian Chonglou cut to the chase.</p> 
 <p>“If you are referring to my renovation of the restaurant and the plan to bring it back to life, we can talk about it. But I hope that you won’t get too emotional, Chief Qian. I’m a little sensitive recently.” Bai Xiaofei was unequivocal with the carrots and sticks all in together, drawing a clear line for the conversation.</p> 
 <p><em>Cooperation we can proceed, but if it’s criticism then let’s call it quits! I don't accept criticism!</em></p> 
 <p>“Lu Lingyun signed a contract with you, didn’t he?” Qian Chonglou’s tone was indeed much better. One had to bow their head when they were under someone’s else eaves.</p> 
 <p>“It was torn. The contract was signed with me in the name of Brother Lu personally, so it has nothing to do with the Thousand Aroma Restaurant now.” Bai Xiaofei acted like a complete scoundrel.</p> 
 <p>“But he used the liquidity of the restaurant!” Qian Chonglou still got emotional in the end, but Bai Xiaofei was quick to snort coldly at it.</p> 
 <p>“It's only 10 billion. Brother Lu, give it back to him, then see our guests out!” Bai Xiaofei said and immediately stood up without hesitance.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, the emotional Qian Chonglou instantly panicked. During his panic, Bai Xiaofei already reached the door.</p> 
 <p>“Mr. Bai! You seem to be interested in the Concentration Pill?”</p>
