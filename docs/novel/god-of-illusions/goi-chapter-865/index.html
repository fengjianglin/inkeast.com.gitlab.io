 <p>Chapter 865: I Need Some Quiet Time!</p> 
 <p>“I’m just kidding…“ Shi Kui chickened out under Bai Xiaofei’s violence. After all, he did not have Yan Ran’er’s strength.</p> 
 <p>“It’s a long story.” Inhaling a deep breath, Shi Kui sank into his memories and started a half-day-long narration.</p> 
 <p>From the nonsense-ridden story, Bai Xiaofei summarized:</p> 
 <p>After graduation, Shi Kui went straight to Ethereal as planned. On the way, he came across a ghost village and was able to save a group of people. One of those people was Pinocchio, who was out looking for inspiration and collecting materials.</p> 
 <p>Then, after they got to know each other, Pinocchio expressed his gratitude by revealing his identity and accepting Shi Kui as his third apprentice. Reality had proved that Pinocchio made a great decision – because they came across another ghost village. </p> 
 <p>However, this time it was at a much larger scale that even Shi Kui could not handle. At that dangerous moment, Yan Ran’er appeared, exploded with power, and killed all the human puppets, saving the duo. However, Yan Ran’er had the mind of a three-year-old child at that time and she fainted right after saving them.</p> 
 <p>For some reason even Shi Kui did not know, he managed to wake her up, after which Yan Ran’er’s intelligence developed at a terrifying speed and did not take long to become compatible with her appearance.</p> 
 <p>To express his gratitude for being saved again, Pinocchio accepted Yan Ran’er as his youngest apprentice. Judging from the situation, he might have been looking for bodyguards…</p> 
 <p>It was after Pinocchio returned and reported the matter that the imperial city was notified about the appearance of human puppets and sent Yun Tianhe to the border.</p> 
 <p>After that, Shi Kui officially settled in the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain with an identity envied by everyone. He proved with his talent and efforts that he could live up to it. In just a short period of time, he became widely sought after.</p> 
 <p>“Who could have thought that you would reach the peak of your life as soon as you left school, huh?” Bai Xiaofei patted Shi Kui on the shoulder, sincerely happy for him.</p> 
 <p>“It’s nothing compared to you, Big Brother Fei. Besides, if I don’t get to the peak, how can I be qualified to stand by your side in the future? Don’t worry, give me another ten or eight years, and I will definitely tailor a violetgold puppet for you!” Shi Kui thumped his chest as he promised.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had no doubt about this at all. Everyone knew how hard-working Shi Kui was when he was in Starnet.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, alright. Since you are doing so well here now, I won’t hold back. Take us around, and if you can, help our senior sister ask for a puppet. She just ranked up not long ago.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s words made Bai Xing overjoyed. She didn’t expect that the favor she wanted to give out was turned into a grand gift and returned immediately. After all, Shi Kui was the apprentice of a divine smith!</p> 
 <p>“It’s on me. Even if my master doesn’t find it convenient, I can ask my two senior brothers. They are now the leading smiths in the mountain, and we have a great relationship,” Shi Kui immediately agreed with a big smile. Then, he started leading the way, “Let’s go, let’s get you familiar with the mountain.”</p> 
 <p>Along the way, Shi Kui introduced everything about the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain, giving the group a real in-depth understanding of the place.</p> 
 <p>Outsiders only knew that the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain was governed by the five great divine smiths, but did not know how it was distributed.</p> 
 <p>Although the mountain was an active volcano, it was divided into seven areas according to the seven branches of the grand formation. Five of the seven areas were under the five divine smiths. As for the remaining two, one was for external lease and the other was the central area for the common use of all members.</p> 
 <p>It was not that no one wanted to monopolize the superior resources of the central area, but that no one was capable of such a feat. Even an Exquisite Rank puppet master could not stay in the central area for an extended time as the terrifyingly high temperature there would melt everything. Only when trying to refine very high-ranked puppets or extremely precious materials would someone go there.</p> 
 <p>“Do the smiths here really make puppets day and night without sleeping?” asked Bai Xing curiously. Along the way, she had asked many questions like this.</p> 
 <p>“It’s a bit exaggerated to say that they don’t sleep, but it’s true that they never stop making puppets every day. No one wants to waste the resources here, and everyone wants to become the next divine smith. They all say the place raises the person, right? The Puppetsmith Holy Mountain raises the very top-class puppetsmiths,” replied Shi Kui, his face full of longing.</p> 
 <p>“Here we are!!” Yan Ran’er, who was running at the front, suddenly cried out in joy.</p> 
 <p>“Look at me, forgetting the road. This is my master’s residence,” Shi Kui said.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s trio looked up at the mighty, domineering, luxurious palace in front of them and collectively gasped.</p> 
 <p><em>Did someone say smithy?! Are you sure it’s not the imperial palace?!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Don’t look at me, I was surprised when I first came here as well.” Shi Kui shrugged. What could he do? As a blacksmith, he felt under a lot of pressure to live here.</p> 
 <p>“Say, if you go to the imperial capital now, what kind of identity do you have?” Bai Xiaofei suddenly thought of a very important matter. The Puppetsmith Holy Mountain was the foundation of Ethereal, and Shi Kui was currently Pinocchio’s apprentice…</p> 
 <p>“Well… this…” Shi Kui paused, sinking into thought. “I really don’t know for sure. But the last time I went to the imperial city, several princes came out to receive me…”</p> 
 <p>The innocent expression on Shi Kui’s face made Bai Xiaofei want to rub it into the ground. <em>Talk about one step to the sky!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Alright, don’t talk, I want some quiet time…” Bai Xiaofei, who had received a heavy blow, suddenly felt ashamed. It was not the prince part that struck. It was the contrast between the current Shi Kui and the past him not very long ago.</p> 
 <p><em>Is this the legendary main character’s luck?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Smelly boy, you’re back.”</p> 
 <p>A bright and clear voice suddenly rang out, interrupting Bai Xiaofei’s complicated mood. Looking in the voice’s direction, he was dumbfounded.</p> 
 <p>To call Shi Kui ‘smelly boy,’ it should be his master, Pinocchio.</p> 
 <p>But…</p> 
 <p><em>What is the matter with this dwarf?!!!</em></p>
