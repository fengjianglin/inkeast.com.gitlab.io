 <p>Chapter 280: ‘Wall Digging’ Starts!</p> 
 <p>The three who won the opportunity soon fulfilled what was required of them by Bai Xiaofei. They were only minor things, moreover, Bai Xiaofei already had a general idea about what to do. All they needed to do was to introduce their businesses and then listen, very simple.</p> 
 <p>Only that when it was time to hand in the money, Qian Chonglou was dumbfounded. He didn't have 20 trillion, but he had signed a 20 trillion contract! Looking at Bai Xiaofei, Qian Chonglou felt like it was a lifetime ago when he got Bai Xiaofei's ‘hint’ before he started bidding at exorbitant numbers.</p> 
 <p><em>Could it have been a trick?!</em></p> 
 <p>With this thought in mind, Qian Chonglou even began to consider how he should denounce Bai Xiaofei and take revenge on Lu Lingyun.</p> 
 <p>However, reality proved that he had been thinking too much. All those difficulties were just the means to achieve an end. And now, Bai Xiaofei had reached the end.</p> 
 <p>After their payments, Yin Jing and Master Zhang left. Chu Qingtian's office was left with only Bai Xiaofei and Qian Chonglou.</p> 
 <p>“Have the feeling that you’ve been tricked, Chief Qian?” asked Bai Xiaofei with a sleazy smile.</p> 
 <p><em>Your mother, does this even need to be asked?! You’re already asking for the money!</em></p> 
 <p>“Lu Lingyun assured me, Mr. Bai. You should not be the kind of person who doesn’t keep promises?!” said Qian Chonglou coldly, his face covered in frost.</p> 
 <p>“Are you sure Brother Lu told you that I’d give you a discount? He should have only guaranteed that you could get a place, and you have now.” Bai Xiaofei smiled. When he finished speaking, Qian Chonglou instantly revealed a stunned expression, looking lifeless as if he had discovered something extraordinary.</p> 
 <p><em>To think about it carefully, he didn’t…</em></p> 
 <p><em>But, what did you help me with, you brat?! I clearly won it with a high bid!</em></p> 
 <p><em>I really was played…</em></p> 
 <p>Qian Chonglou was on the verge of erupting, but just one second before he did, Bai Xiaofei stuffed him with a sentence that immediately turned his anger into joy.</p> 
 <p>“I'm joking. In fact, I can help you deduct 5 trillion.”</p> 
 <p><em>Generous!</em></p> 
 <p>To be able to say ‘5 trillion,’ Bai Xiaofei was definitely an unprecedented student in Starnet. Even the No.1 of the Wealth Ranking might not have this determination.</p> 
 <p>Moreover, Bai Xiaofei earned this determination entirely by himself.</p> 
 <p>“Mr. Bai, don't make such a joke next time, my heart is not very good!” Laughing, Qian Chonglou seemed to turn into a different person. 15 trillion was completely acceptable for him.</p> 
 <p>“But not for nothing.” Qian Chonglou’s smile still hadn’t faded when Bai Xiaofei’s words froze his face.</p> 
 <p>Whether it was true or not that Qian Chonglou’s heart wasn’t good, he felt he could really be infuriated into sudden death when talking to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Then what do I need to do?” Gulping, Qian Chonglou asked somewhat nervously.</p> 
 <p>“I want someone from you!” Bai Xiaofei said seriously, staring at Qian Chonglou very solemnly.</p> 
 <p>“Lu Lingyun?!”</p> 
 <p>Qian Chonglou wasn’t stupid. Of those that Bai Xiaofei was acquainted with in the Thousand Aroma Restaurant, the only one worthy of this price was Lu Lingyun. However, Qian Chonglou didn’t think Lu Lingyun was worth this amount.</p> 
 <p>If it weren’t for Bai Xiaofei, Lu Lingyun would already have gone back to report to the headquarters after managing the Starnet branch so poorly.</p> 
 <p>“That’s right. He is useless to you now, isn't he? Why not exchange 5 trillion Amethyst Coins for a failure of an employee?” Bai Xiaofei’s words directly hit the mark, as if he knew what Qian Chonglou was thinking.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the poor Lu Lingyun was still praying that Bai Xiaofei could help him, unaware that he might lose his job because of him…</p> 
 <p>“If you can…”</p> 
 <p>“There’s no ‘if.’ Either you accept it, or pay the money according to the contract.” Bai Xiaofei instantly snuffed Qian Chonglou’s counter-offer as soon as he wanted to increase the price.</p> 
 <p><em>You want to scheme against me? It has always been this lord who schemes against people. And don't forget, your weakness is in my hand, not the other way around!</em></p> 
 <p>What Bai Xiaofei excelled at wasn’t only turning the tables in the face of adversity, it was even easier for him to maintain domination from a higher position.</p> 
 <p>“Very well, deal!” Qian Chonglou quickly agreed as he knew any more words were useless. Just like that, Lu Lingyun was sold without his knowledge.</p> 
 <p>Ahh, one had to compromise in this world. When you worked for others, you’d never know what decisions the top brass had made that were vital to your fate. The only thing you could do was to wait and accept.</p> 
 <p>Exiting Chu Qingtian's office, Bai Xiaofei and Qian Zhonglou were both very happy. There weren’t many win-win situations like this in business.</p> 
 <p>Bidding goodbye to Bai Xiaofei, Qian Chonglou already began to consider how he should break the news to Lu Lingyun. As for Bai Xiaofei, he ran straight to the Ethereal Pavilion. At times like these, Bai Xiaofei was very busy and always ran back and forth alone, not because he didn’t want company, but because nobody could keep up with his pace…</p> 
 <p>Instead of wasting time explaining, he felt it was better to do it all by himself. What's more, sometimes it was easier to be accepted when one was alone!</p> 
 <p>Standing at the gate of the Ethereal Pavilion, Bai Xiaofei heaved a sigh of relief. He thanked Xueying for her training, otherwise, he might have collapsed after such a long period of high-intensity activity.</p> 
 <p>Fixing his expression, Bai Xiaofei stepped into the building, and the situation here was just as he had expected: exactly the same as in the past.</p> 
 <p>Feng Wuxin basically wouldn’t come to Feng Wuhen’s place, so the employees here didn’t know that one of the big bosses they had never seen was always right by their side.</p> 
 <p>“Hello, do you want to test or buy a puppet?” An employee quickly walked over. Business here gradually became quiet after the peak period of welcoming new students, so it was a delightful thing to have guests to receive.</p> 
 <p>“I'm sorry, I’m not buying or testing anything. I'm here to see Manager Feng.”</p> 
 <p>‘Manager Feng.’ When Bai Xiaofei said that, he felt bitter for Feng Wuhen. They were brothers, but the difference was like heaven and earth!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t believe what Zhuang Ming told him about Feng Wuhen having no intention to compete for positions. The Feng Wuhen he got the chance to see was not someone without desire and ambition. Therefore, there must be more to the story, maybe even injustice.</p> 
 <p>As a result, Bai Xiaofei came here. He didn’t hope for something so far-fetched as untying the knot In Feng Wuhen’s heart, he only wanted to give Feng Wuhen a chance to untie the knot himself.</p> 
 <p>Of course, this wasn’t the main purpose. Bai Xiaofei wasn’t altruistic to this extent. What he really took a fancy to was Feng Wuhen’s ability and insight. Just as he wanted Lu Lingyun from Qian Chonglou, he wanted to take Feng Wuhen away.</p>
