 <p>Chapter 447: You Think This Is Over?</p> 
 <p>Quiet, everything was quiet. The silence was depressingly heavy.</p> 
 <p>Looking around, the plaza had become a death site, littered with the corpses of Ancient Yue soldiers and the experts from the Globe Merchant Group.</p> 
 <p>None of those who still stood was without injuries, staring at each other in alarm. The ten-something remaining people of the Globe Merchant Group were now completely at a loss.</p> 
 <p>In the middle of the square, Bai Xiaofei embraced He Tian’s cold body in a trance.</p> 
 <p><em>Why didn’t I use all my strength sooner? Uncle wouldn’t have to die if I did! Why must other people pay for my mistake? Am I still worthy of the trust of so many?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Why, why?!!!</em></p> 
 <p>Questioning himself from the bottom of his heart, Bai Xiaofei eventually didn’t even know what he was doing. However, a deep regret constantly scoured his inexperienced heart.</p> 
 <p>Qin Lingyan slowly walked over and squatted down at his side. Seeing him like this, she suddenly had a feeling of heartache.</p> 
 <p>Bai Ye also followed her. Unknown whether he was infected by Qin Lingyan’s mood, he felt the softest part of his heart being touched.</p> 
 <p><em>Perhaps, I was really too one-sided before?</em></p> 
 <p>Looking at Bai Xiaofei, Bai Ye was suddenly taken over by a fluster, and a high wall in his heart collapsed.</p> 
 <p>The Thunderstorm members tried to endure the drug’s side effects and supported each other over. They looked at He Tian’s body in Bai Xiaofei’s arms and fell silent. In a sense, He Tian hadn’t yet become an official member of the Thunderstorm Bandits. He was supposed to join after this event and had passed all of the trials by now.</p> 
 <p>But… there were just too many unexpected things in this world.</p> 
 <p>“Before coming here, Uncle once told me that if someone was going to die this time, that person should be him. He said that he was old and had done too many wrong things in the first half of his life and that this might be his chance to redeem himself,” Fang Lei recounted slowly in a sorrowful voice. He thought it was just a light-hearted joke, but it actually was a prophecy…</p> 
 <p>“Did Uncle still have any wishes?” Bai Xiaofei tearfully looked up and asked softly, with expectation in his eyes.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, Fang Lei could not lie.</p> 
 <p>“This is the investigation we did on him. It has everything about him. The information may help you.” Fang Lei handed Bai Xiaofei a Recording Eyeball.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei used his spirit to read it. In addition to the information obtained from investigations, there was a video of He Tian with a simple self-introduction and stating the reason why he wanted to join the Thunderstorm Bandits.</p> 
 <p>In fact, under normal circumstances, it was very difficult for He Tian to die. His second puppet could have allowed him a near-resurrection treatment. His ability of defense and ceaseless recovery together could beat that of Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>However, he had put his everything into that last move. First, he used the second puppet’s healing ability and forcefully took on a full Grandmaster Rank attack, then used his Godly Healer Needles made from thousand-year-old ice to break the opponent’s defensive barrier. All of that to create an opening for Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Because he knew that it was the only chance for them to kill the Grandmaster. He had also realized early that Bai Xiaofei had been tricked… However, no one else would ever know this. The only one who could explain how this had all been done was He Tian himself, and he was gone…</p> 
 <p>Still, what Bai Xiaofei had left were He Tian’s words in the recording, and he engraved them in his heart ––</p> 
 <p>‘There are too many injustices in the world. I want to use my limited ability to help those who I have hurt, and those who may be hurt.’</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>‘I have made many mistakes. I don’t hope that I can pay off all of my debts in my remaining lifetime, but I hope I will be given their forgiveness one day.’</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>‘I believe that one day, this continent will have a little less disputes, a little less undercurrents. Even if it cannot be completely peaceful, I hope it at least will not be as difficult as it is now…’<br> __</p> 
 <p>Putting away the Recording Eyeball, Bai Xiaofei inhaled a deep breath. When he opened his eyes again, they held a new resolution.</p> 
 <p><em>Uncle, you can rest assured that such a day will come! I, Bai Xiaofei, swear this!</em></p> 
 <p>“Let’s go. Now is not the time to be sad, we still have a lot of things to do,” said Bai Xiaofei calmly. He gently laid down He Tian, then walked to Gu Heng. “From today on, be a good emperor and don’t let similar things happen again. You may not meet people like us next time.”</p> 
 <p>Patting Gu Heng’s shoulder, Bai Xiaofei felt like a completely different person, with one part unrestrained and one part more steadfast.</p> 
 <p>“I will!” Gu Heng swallowed and solemnly promised.</p> 
 <p>On one side, Commander Kang stood silently, looking at Bai Xiaofei respectfully. If he had only been grateful to Bai Xiaofei before, it was now far more than that. This teenage boy had strongly impressed him, a several-decades-old commander.</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness, watch out!” A terrified shout suddenly rang out. Then, Shen Qiandong leaped over and blocked in front of Gu Heng and Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The next second, time seemed to freeze. Shen Qiandong, with open arms, collapsed limply. Opposite them, a staggering Tang Bing slowly stood up with an eerie smile on his face.</p> 
 <p>“You think this is over?” As the smile turned into a sneer, a strange fluctuation of energy spread through the square.</p> 
 <p>It was not the energy of the Spirit Stream!</p> 
 <p>“I really need to thank you lot. If it weren’t for you working so hard, how could I get my hands on so many high-quality materials?! Next, let me show my gratitude with my actions!” said Tang Bing as if venting his madness. At the same time, thick energy fluctuations poured from the bodies all over the square, especially the Grandmaster and Master Rank ones. Under his guidance, all this energy gathered towards him.</p> 
 <p>The nearest Chu Yue was the first to respond. He launched Fair Replacement in order to stop Tang Bing. However, no later than half a second after he activated the skill, Chu Yue let out a scream and fell straight down.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Qin Lingyan and Bai Ye rushed out in unison. Bai Ye ran to save Chu Yue, while Qin Lingyan charged at Tang Bing.</p> 
 <p>Then, a scene that shocked everyone again happened.</p> 
 <p>The Master Rank peak-grade Qin Lingyan was sent flying with just a wave of Tang Bing’s hand, completely without any ability to resist!</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, you all have to die!”</p>
