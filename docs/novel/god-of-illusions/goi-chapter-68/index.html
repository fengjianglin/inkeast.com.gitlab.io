 <p><span style>As she sensed the atmosphere becoming odder, Xue Ying whose face was growing warmer by the minute restrained her thoughts and casually made an excuse about wanting to go see the principal before leaving the classroom as if she was fleeing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Xue Ying left, Lin Li whose face was covered in an aggrieved expression walked over slowly to Bai Xiaofei’s side. She wasn’t quite bright, but she still had the instinct of a woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You and Big Sister Xue….” Lin Li hadn’t finished speaking when Bai Xiaofei had already stretched out his hand and started rubbing Lin Li’s head lightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Silly girl, no matter what happens between me and Big Sister Xue, you’ll always be my Little Li’li, and I’ll protect you no matter who bullies you.” Bai Xiaofei raised his brows as he consoled with a light voice. Bai Xiaofei didn’t know if other girls were easy to appease, but Lin Li had absolutely no ability to resist him….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm….” Lin Li groaned lightly as the aggrieved expression on her face instantly transformed into joy. That was the best part about being simple, it was easy to achieve satisfaction!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry for disturbing your lover’s talk. But, shouldn’t you come out now?” Qin Lingyan’s voice that didn’t carry the slightest shred of good intentions sounded out from outside the door, and Bai Xiaofei saw some familiar and unfamiliar faces when he looked over towards the source of the voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lingyan, Bai Ye, He Meng, and two second year seniors from the Sword of Assault that he hadn’t met before. Added together, there were an entire four seniors from the Sword of Assault that specialized in close ranged combat, whereas, He Meng was an Assassin Stream student from the Blade of Concealment. In other words, the five people Qin Lingyan had brought along didn’t possess the slightest possibility of cooperating because they were mostly of the same stream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, just like the second generation of puppet masters, being mostly of the same stream had given up upon various possibilities and obtained extreme ability in exchange, and Qin Lingyan’s group of five was absolutely terrifying in terms of destructive force!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s fine, it’s fine. Both of us have all the time. But, we have to accompany Senior Sister Lingyan.” Bai Xiaofei didn’t reveal the slightest discomfort as he spoke, and he was utterly not deterred by the five Master Rank puppet masters. As for Lin Li, if she were allowed to make a move now, then she didn’t dare say she could take five, but two would absolutely be easy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, no one had expected He Meng who stood at the back couldn’t maintain his composure upon seeing Bai Xiaofei, and a violet light flashed before he’d already arrived in front of Bai Xiaofei and had clenched Bai Xiaofei’s throat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, is your Devourer Worm still well?!” Lin Li instantly had the intention to make a move at the instant He Meng came over, but she was restrained by Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, He Meng’s reaction had explained everything, and he’d figures out what had happened with the Devourer Worm that day….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Sister… Lingyan. Is this your… guarantee?” Bai Xiaofei completely disregarded He Meng, and he stared fixedly at Qin Lingyan with a flushed face while spitting out a few words with great difficulty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, we’ll have plenty of chances later.” Qin Lingyan’s voice was neither arrogant nor humble because even though He Meng was a third year student; a Master Rank puppet master wasn’t worthy for her to flatter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Meng grunted coldly as he put Bai Xiaofei down extremely unwillingly, and a trace of gloominess flashed within his eyes at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s the venue? You better not waste time.” Her icy cold voice sounded out once more. Qin Lingyan was slightly impatient because she felt more uncomfortable the longer she was with Bai Xiaofei, and it was like the side effect of being schemed against….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Infinite Mountain Range!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as these words were spoken, Qin Lingyan and the others were stunned on the spot simultaneously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Sister Lingyan, you wouldn’t be intending to go back on your word, right? It was you who allowed me to choose the venue at noon. Moreover, my classmates are already waiting there, so do you want to change your mind now? Or do all of you not dare to go there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an extremely obvious method of goading them into action, but Qin Lingyan and the others couldn’t refuse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How dangerous could the place all of you are able to stop at be? Don’t dream that you’ll have a chance if you make all of us fall into a dangerous situation because ants will always be ants!” This person that spoke this time was a second year senior behind Qin Lingyan. The rage on his face wasn’t the slightest bit inferior to He Meng, and it seemed as if Bai Xiaofei had destroyed the ancestral grave of his clan….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m relieved that senior spoke like this, then let’s set out.” As he spoke, Bai Xiaofei held Lin Li’s hand before walking towards the entrance where Qin Lingyan and the others stood. It was at this moment that the five of them finally noticed Lin Li who’d always been hiding behind Bai Xiaofei’s back, and all of them were stunned at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, you don’t mind moving aside, right?” As Bai Xiaofei spoke, Bai Ye and another senior mumbled in reply before moving aside mechanically. But, during the entire process, their gazes hadn’t left Lin Li for a moment, and it was even to the extent their eyes didn’t even blink!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alas, such pitiable people. How many lifetimes have they not seen a beauty for?” Bai Xiaofei muttered yet had forgotten what sort of state he was in on that day he met Lin Li for the first time, and that saliva….</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Qin Lingyan and the others recovered from their shock, Bai Xiaofei and Lin Li had already walked off far away, and the five of them hurriedly chased up to Bai Xiaofei. At the same time, all of them chose to keep silent and not mention their loss of composure from before. But, Lin Li’s experienced had been imprinted deeply within their minds, and even Qin Lingyan was no exception!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they approached the academy entrance, Bai Xiaofei took out the exit permit that would expire in another day and was giving to Xue Ying by Lei Shan, and then he led all of them to officially step foot into the Infinite Mountain Range!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they left the academy, Bai Xiaofei and Lin Li seemed as if they’d returned home, and they dashed madly all along the way, and their uniform speed caused them to seem as if they’d installed odometers on themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was also at this instant that the five of them frowned at the same time, and they realized that Bai Xiaofei seemed to have come prepared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, they stopped only at frowning because as far as they were concerned, no matter how Bai Xiaofei prepared, it was impossible to fill up the chasm between their strengths.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, such thoughts gradually dispersed along with Bai Xiaofei ceaselessly moving deeper into the Infinite Mountain Range, and it was replaced with a trace of instinctive panic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one was abnormal like the Savage Class to stay an entire month in the Infinite Mountain Range, and even students of Starnet Academy had similar knowledge of the Infinite Mountain Range as others in the continent — This place was a restricted area, and entering it meant one was in a dangerous environment!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But fortunately, Bai Xiaofei didn’t continuously move deeper, and he stopped when the five of them were on the verge of being unable to restrain themselves from asking him to stop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The place they’d stopped was a rare empty ground in the forest that had a gurgling small river by its side, whereas, the slightly elevated hills in the surroundings completely obstructed one’s field of vision towards the outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Ka and the others were all standing by the river and waiting, whereas, Huskie ran over excitedly when he saw Bai Xiaofei and barked twice while the intention to seek credit was written all over his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, it was impossible for Qin Lingyan and the others to understand what Huskie was telling Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, there’ll be no lack of benefit for you once we return.” Bai Xiaofei grinned as he put Huskie down before turning around to look at Qin Lingyan’s group of five. At this moment, these seniors had completely lost the arrogant confidence they had at the beginning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because they didn’t see any nervousness on the faces of all the members of the Savage Class, and it was as if the Infinite Mountain Range was their territory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are a total of 16 of us. Senior Sister Lingyan, we can begin now if you have no objections!” As soon as Bai Xiaofei finished speaking, everyone behind him took a step forward at the same time while heroic spirit rose abruptly from them!</span></p>
