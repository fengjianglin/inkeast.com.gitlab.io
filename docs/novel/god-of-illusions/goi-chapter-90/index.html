<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>At the critical moment, everyone was stunned on the spot, whereas, Lin Li who stood on the medicinal cauldron even let out an exclaim of shock before she charged over while summoning her puppet. But, it was utterly impossible for her to be on time with the distance she was at!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s dead!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bai Xiaofei is dead!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone had similar views, and even Bai Xiaofei himself was no exception!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, the outcome exceeded the expectations of everyone. A violet colored figure instantly appeared before Bai Xiaofei, and accompanied by a muffled bang, the senior that charged over was blasted flying at a swifter speed than which he charged over at, and he knocked over a few rows of people in the process.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone looked over towards Bai Xiaofei, and then they saw a scene that took their breaths away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hu Xian’er who’d become much taller stood before Bai Xiaofei with fury on her face, and her veil had fallen down a long time ago due to her swift movements, causing a peerless face that astounded everyone to be revealed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t just that, a swaying light violet colored fox tail and a similarly fluffy pair of eyes were exceptionally striking, causing everyone to be stunned for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fox form Transformation Stream puppet master!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This method of address surged into the minds of everyone at the same time, causing a tempestuous storm to arise in the hearts of everyone and especially the males!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Transformation Stream puppet masters had to hunt, obtain, and absorb the soul of a puppet, whereas, because of the uniqueness of the fox form’s nature, the probability for it to become a Puppet Soul wasn’t much higher than the probability that a Transformation Stream puppet master emerged into the world. So, this caused fox form Transformation Stream puppet masters to be rare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, the fox form didn’t possess any aspect that was especially formidable, and the true reason importance was attached to it was the change in outward appearance brought about after the transformation….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Exactly, it was just so filthy!</span><span style>Starnet Continent wasn’t a pure place, and shadows lay all over the continent, whereas, fox form Transformation Stream puppet masters were capable of drawing out these shadows!</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the continent, there were countless people willing to pay a great price to possess a Transformation Stream puppet master capable of taking the form of a fox, and there was no lack of big bosses of great organizations amongst them!</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, being able to see a beauty that had undergone a fox transformation was sufficient for them to brag for their entire lives.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this was only a portion of the shock that everyone had to experience today, and the other portion came from Lin Li who arrived just after!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was similarly a face that could shock the world, a perfect figure, and most importantly, the golden luxurious clothes worn by the young woman!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Divine Phoenix Feather Dress!!!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s her relationship with Lin Nishang?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The same question arose in the minds of everyone, but no one was capable of answering this question….</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, at this moment, Tan Qiusheng was completely stunned. So long as one wasn’t an idiot, one would be able to discern that Bai Xiaofei’s status in the hearts of both Hu Xian’er and Lin Li was absolutely not low, otherwise, how could they possibly take the risk of their secrets becoming public and make a move without the slightest hesitation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then there was a problem….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who exactly was Bai Xiaofei?</span></p>
 <p><span style>A fox form Transformation Stream puppet master and an Energy Stream puppet master that absolutely didn’t possess an ordinary relationship with Lin Nishang!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Exactly what sort of identity would be able to make two beauties that were so extraordinary to converge by his side?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Coupled with the display Bai Xiaofei had made from the beginning until now. For a time, guesses related to Bai Xiaofei had caused over 90% of the people their minds weren’t sufficiently powerful to process all this….</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Bai Xiaofei had a muddled expression as well….</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was able to understand why Lin Li was agitated, but why would Hu Xian’er be agitated? </span><i><span style>I seem to have only met her twice, right? Could it be that it’s because I’ve seen her bathing?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei whose mind was in slight disorder looked at Hu Xian’er’s figure while gulping down a mouthful of saliva.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No matter what the reason, but this background of hers is really….</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is this what Third Father meant when he spoke of women who were a type of temptation while they just stood there? Sure enough, I’m slightly unable to restrain myself….</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Luckily, everyone present couldn’t read minds, otherwise, what Bai Xiaofei was thinking of at this moment would absolutely be able to make all of them collapse….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amitabha!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei quickly cleared his mind of these inappropriate thoughts as he lightly pulled them back behind him, and then he took two steps towards Tan Qiusheng once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Hu Xian’er and Lin Li didn’t resist Bai Xiaofei, but unlike the naturalness Lin Li revealed, Hu Xian’er was slightly….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slightly fearful instead…?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, no one noticed this trace of expression because Bai Xiaofei who’d walked forward once more had drawn the attention of everyone onto himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Bai Xiaofei was even more attention drawing that any beauty because every single move he made was related to the future situation in the academy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, can I understand your actions from before as the choice you’ve made?” Bai Xiaofei didn’t even mention the surprise attack he’d just suffered, and he had a relaxed expression as if nothing had happened earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Being questioned by Bai Xiaofei once more caused Tan Qiusheng to be silent for a long time before he finally spoke. “I’ll take my people and leave. But, I’m not the only one in this organization of ours, so their choice is up to them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tan Qiusheng finally straightened out his thinking. Instead of being bashed up before leaving, it was better to leave now. At the very least, he could be considered to be leaving with dignity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, Tan Qiusheng was that sort of people that acted resolutely, so as soon as he finished speaking, he immediately instructed his people to leave the scene as if they were fleeing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what about all of you? Who else is in charge?” After Tan Qiusheng left, Bai Xiaofei shot his gaze towards the remaining third year students, and the grin on his face seemed like the smile of a devil in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My people won’t step foot in the new student district again as well!” With Tan Qiusheng as the first, basically all of the remaining people lost their intention to resist, and along with the first person standing out and making his stand clear, the remaining few successively announced that they wouldn’t step foot in the new student district again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, Bai Xiaofei didn’t have the intention to let them go just like he let Tan Qiusheng go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know some of you are disgruntled. If you aren’t convinced, then the new student district welcomes you at all times. Since we’re able to go against all of you once, we can do it again. No matter how many pieces of trash like you come, our New Student Mutual Aid Community wouldn’t be afraid in the slightest. Of course, all of you can do as you please to those that aren’t part of our community.” After speaking so much, the final line he spoke was the main point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Simply speaking, Bai Xiaofei wanted to use everyone present to carry out the last wave of propaganda because not all the new students had joined the community.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Bai Xiaofei required everyone to join because in that way, the first barrel of gold he received would be able to satisfy some of his requirements.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, you’re truly too arrogant. There’ll come a day that you’ll pay for you character!” Another senior couldn’t refrain himself from speaking, whereas, Lin Li almost charged out immediately. Fortunately, she was restrained in time by Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I look forward to the arrival of that day. But, I’ll crush it just like I did today!” Bai Xiaofei grinned and didn’t have the slightest intention of being afraid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is my f*cking character!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bite me if you’re disgruntled!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The seniors dispersed like a receding tide, but Bai Xiaofei didn’t intend to end it here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That senior over there. I said all of you can go, but that didn’t include you!” As soon as Bai Xiaofei finished speaking, the arrogant senior who launched a surprise attack at Bai Xiaofei earlier couldn’t help but feel a chill run down his spine….</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’m doomed….</span></i></p>
