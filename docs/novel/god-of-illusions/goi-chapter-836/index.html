 <p>Chapter 836: Get Out!</p> 
 <p>Heartseer hurriedly poked Bai Xiaofei’s back and whispered, “Don’t ask.”</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Revelation swept the hair away and turned to Rui Mengqi. “Little girl, take this shell and draw whatever you want on it.” A turtle shell and a brush appeared and floated to Rui Mengqi.</p> 
 <p>Rui Mengqi pondered slightly before casting Bai Xiaofei a profound smile. Then, she started drawing on the shell.</p> 
 <p>From his angle, Bai Xiaofei could see that she was writing, but he could not tell the exact content.</p> 
 <p>After Rui Mengqi was done, Revelation took the items back and injected his energy into the shell. The handwriting slowly melted into the tortoise shell and finally replaced its original pattern. Looking at the new pattern, Revelation gently nodded and his lips curled up into a slight smile.</p> 
 <p>Finally, he looked at Tan Xin. Staring at her for half a day, Revelation sighed and waved his hand. The next second, something familiar to Bai Xiaofei appeared in the room – Violetgold puppet, Heavenly Secret Disk.</p> 
 <p>From the moment it appeared, Heartseer could not take his eyes off it. According to the legend of the Revelation Pavilion, just staring at the disk for a while allowed the ability of a diviner to advance, not to mention seeing it at work!</p> 
 <p>“Smelly old man, don’t force yourself if it’s above you. I don’t want to see you vomit blood! What’s so bad about living a little longer?!” The only thing Bai Xiaofei thought of upon seeing the disk was the scene of Revelation repeatedly vomiting blood.</p> 
 <p>“Just shut up, smelly boy. Do you think everyone is as perverse as you?” saying this, Revelation injected his energy into the Heavenly Secret Disk. The disk slowly rotated before starting to emit a colorful light after a few moments. The moment it shone, it stopped rotating.</p> 
 <p><em>Heaven-rank grade-eight divination!</em> Heartseer swallowed with difficulty. He felt a need for closed-door cultivation after he returned to his place.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Revelation stared at the disk for half a day before putting it away and said, “Alright.” He looked at everyone and saw expectation in their expressions. <em>That’s right, that’s the look people should have after seeing me doing divination!</em></p> 
 <p>At this thought, Revelation shot Bai Xiaofei a glare. “You smelly boy, I didn’t even see you this nervous when I did seven divinations in a row. Heh, your luck in love is really something else!” he coldly commented.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei hurriedly donned a flattering smile.</p> 
 <p>“I knew nothing at that time! Now, this boy admires you very much!!” After making Revelation feel better with his flattery, Bai Xiaofei rubbed his hands. “Please tell me, my good master, what does the divination say?”</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei’s expectations were dashed.</p> 
 <p>“Heartseer, take your granduncle on a tour around our Revelation Pavilion. As the second generation, it would be an embarrassment if he knows nothing about what our base looks like.” Revelation waved his hand in dismissal.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was dumbstruck.</p> 
 <p><em>What do you mean by that?! You’re not letting me listen?! Are you plotting against me?! Oh come on, I already can’t handle these three ancestors!!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Let’s go, Granduncle. Have trust in Master Revelation,” said Heartseer. Revelation’s words were like an imperial edict to him. Moreover, he did not need to stay any longer.</p> 
 <p>“Fine,” Bai Xiaofei accepted his fate with a long sigh. Since it could not be avoided, he could only pray that Revelation still had some self-consciousness as his master.</p> 
 <p><em>Tricking your disciple is a big no, alright!!?</em></p> 
 <p>After Bai Xiaofei followed Heartseer and left with that thought, Revelation took a deep breath.</p> 
 <p>“Close your eyes, relax, and don’t resist my spirit,” he said and closed his eyes first. Right after, his soul left his body and floated, suspended above his head.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, Gu Lingyue found herself in a special space surrounded by white mist.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t be nervous, This is your sea of consciousness. It’s in this state because it has not been developed.” Revelation appeared in Gu Lingyue’s sea of consciousness. He dispersed the mist and turned it into a shiny space.</p> 
 <p>At that moment, Gu Lingyue felt a cool and refreshing feeling wash over her mind. Her consciousness became much clearer.</p> 
 <p>“Consider this a small gift to help you stabilize your sea of consciousness. However, all I can do is start you off. What it will become in the future depends entirely on you,” Revelation explained, then gazed at Gu Lingyue. “Are you interested in learning divination with me?”</p> 
 <p>“Me?!” Gu Lingyue’s tone was full of disbelief. She did not dare to believe that she had the qualification.</p> 
 <p>“There is no one else here. However, don’t get me wrong. I won’t take you as a disciple, only teach you. Should you agree, you will need to stay here, but I know you really want to follow the smelly boy.”</p> 
 <p>After Revelation stated the downside, Gu Lingyue immediately hesitated.</p> 
 <p>“Actually, in my opinion, there is nothing for you to hesitate about. From my divination, you will have a good life, but it’s still a little lacking. If you want to stay with the smelly boy, you must be strong enough. You should have noticed that no one around him is just pretty decoration,” Revelation added.</p> 
 <p>Who was Revelation? Almost all diviners were masters at fooling people, and Revelation was their ancestor!</p> 
 <p>“But…” Gu Lingyue frowned. However, she had nothing to refute.</p> 
 <p>“I can even satisfy your wish, how about that?” Revelation flashed her an uncanny smile.</p> 
 <p>Gu Lingyue was stunned. Then, she blushed. “Really…?” Her voice was as small as a mosquito buzz as she buried her face.</p> 
 <p>“This old man always keeps his word. Can you stay without worry now?” Revelation assured as he stroked his beard.</p> 
 <p>A while later, Gu Lingyue raised her head, her eyes firm. “Yes! I am willing to stay!”</p> 
 <p>After getting the answer he expected, Revelation slowly faded away from Gu Lingye’s sea of consciousness, only his final words echoed ––</p> 
 <p>“Envy and jealousy, entangled and lost. Steal Heaven's luck, lay the root as foundation, define the meaning of life. Such is the way!”</p>
