 <p>Chapter 581: Thunder Emperor; Chu Liuyun’s Whereabouts!</p> 
 <p>Thunder resounded as Lei Shan instantly appeared beside Ling Tianxia. His right foot covered in lightning heavily kicked at Ling Tianxia’s chest, which also pushed him out of the range of the Silk of Ending War.</p> 
 <p>Few people knew about the Silk of Ending War, but Lei Shan knew it and its weakness. As long as everyone on one side was out of its range, it would expire ahead of time.</p> 
 <p>Watching Ling Tianxia heavily fall onto the ground and Lei Shan’s rising murderous intent, Bai Xiaofei swore that this was definitely the first time he had seen Lei Shan like this after having known the old man for so long!</p> 
 <p>“Execution Bolt!!!!”</p> 
 <p>Amidst pitch-black thunderclouds, one blue bolt after another smashed down at Ling Tianxia. Just like how powerless the students had been in front of him, Ling Tianxia didn’t even have a chance to fight back in front of Lei Shan. The only thing he could do was curl up and defend.</p> 
 <p>Ling Tianxia had thought of escaping and tried to do so, but how many people in this continent could escape from Lei Shan? He was already the fastest puppet master when he was still a Legend Rank, let alone now when he was the one and only Timeless!</p> 
 <p>While Lei Shan crazily abused Ling Tianxia, the dean of the Furnace of Agarwood, Ran Qiu, led a group of teachers to treat the wounded.</p> 
 <p>“Dean Ran, is Lin Li okay?!” Bai Xiaofei’s voice was filled with worry and his heart was at his throat. If Ran Qiu gave him a negative answer, he was likely to become the second Lei Shan.</p> 
 <p>“Burning vitality to forcibly upgrade her puppet consumes a great deal, luckily it wasn’t for long. She will be okay, and it won’t affect her future cultivation,” Ran Qiu assured.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei heaved a sigh of relief.</p> 
 <p>“What about Senior Lan?” Having confirmed that Lin Li was all right, Bai Xiaofei thought of Lan He, who had also burned his vitality.</p> 
 <p>However, it was not Ran Qiu who answered him this time.</p> 
 <p>“Lad, you don’t have to worry about this old man. I have been a puppet master and fought my entire life. It is now time for me to have a rest.” Lan He sounded at ease, but Bai Xiaofei could hear the sadness in his heart.</p> 
 <p>How could anyone not care about this? But Bai Xiaofei didn’t say anything. This was Lan He’s last bit of pride.</p> 
 <p>“In any case, thank you, Senior Lan. If it weren’t for…”</p> 
 <p>“Enough, enough. Stop talking and hurry to see your little girlfriend group. They are all badly hurt, what are you doing wasting your time here with this old man?” Lan He waved his hand and cut Bai Xiaofei off.</p> 
 <p>An embarrassed Bai Xiaofei was abruptly pushed out. Glancing at Lin Li in a coma, he decided to listen to Lan He and ran out. At a time like this, the person that the girls wanted to see most was definitely Bai Xiaofei, whose safety was more effective than any treatment to them.</p> 
 <p>After walking around and saying countless words of comfort, Bai Xiaofei was given a rare time to rest, but he didn’t have the heart to rest at all.</p> 
 <p>There was no news on Chu Liuyun from the people Su Yu had brought back. In other words, she was still missing.</p> 
 <p>“Watch out!”</p> 
 <p>Just as Bai Xiaofei was feeling lost, a sharp arrow blasted in. Su Yu, who was close to him, shouted and leaped over to knock it aside.</p> 
 <p>However, it seemed that even if Su Yu hadn’t done it, the arrow still wouldn’t hit Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The students ran in the direction the arrow had been fired from, and soon returned disappointed.</p> 
 <p>“They fled too fast.”</p> 
 <p>“Wait, there seems to be something on the arrowhead!”</p> 
 <p>Heartseer’s eyes were exceptionally sharp. He went over and carefully detached a piece of yellow paper from the arrowhead. Three words ‘To Bai Xiaofei’ were clear on the front.</p> 
 <p>“It seems to be for you.” Passing the paper to Bai Xiaofei, Heartseer tactfully stepped aside. There were certain things that not everyone should see.</p> 
 <p>Frowning, Bai Xiaofei slowly unfolded the paper. Moments later, his expression froze.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Yun, I’ll leave all matters here to you for the time being. I need to go out,” Bai Xiaofei said to Yun Jingshuang and wanted to leave, but he quickly reacted and pulled him back.</p> 
 <p>“Where are you going? You can’t even beat an ordinary person at the moment!”</p> 
 <p>Yun Jingshuang’s voice instantly attracted the attention of everyone around. They all looked at Bai Xiaofei in unison.</p> 
 <p>“Let me go!” Bai Xiaofei stared solemnly at Yun Jingshuang, his icy expression murderous.</p> 
 <p>“If you don’t say where you are going, I won’t let you go even if you really want to kill me!” Although frightened, Yun Jingshuang had no intention to let go.</p> 
 <p>“Big Sister Liuyun, they took Big Sister Liuyun. They’ll only ensure her safety if I come alone. I beg you, please let me go…” Bai Xiaofei’s tone instantly weakened, and his eyes red and pleading.</p> 
 <p>“You going in this condition is no different from seeking death!” Yun Jingshuang retorted. The rest of the people present instantly agreed.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, Boss, you have to be rational!”</p> 
 <p>“We know that you are in a hurry, so are we.”</p> 
 <p>“Please calm down, there must be another way!”</p> 
 <p>“……”</p> 
 <p>They pitched in one after another for fear that Bai Xiaofei would rush to his death. However, his mind was clear, and it had never been clearer.</p> 
 <p>There was no other option. Even Lei Shan could not guarantee 100% that he could rescue a hostage. Moreover, Lei Shan was still after Ling Tianxia and could not be distracted.</p> 
 <p>And Bai Xiaofei feared that Chu Liuyun’s safety could not wait!</p> 
 <p>“I know what you guys are worried about, but do you want me to watch Liuyun die?” Bai Xiaofei said quietly, but everyone fell silent.</p> 
 <p>Those who could stand up and persuade him were all the people who knew him to some extent, and their understanding of him also told them that he could not be persuaded.</p> 
 <p>“If you die, I will rush into the Shadow Death base camp!” Hu Xian’er stared at Bai Xiaofei and said extremely seriously. The meaning behind her words was obvious – she would never live alone!</p> 
 <p>“We will too!” The Leng triplets went up and stood behind Hu Xian’er.</p> 
 <p>The rest of the girls quickly followed. Although the shy Luo Han did not say anything, she also stood up. Lin Li was still in a coma, or else she would never be absent at a time like this.</p> 
 <p>As for Bai Xiaofei’s friends like Mo Ka and Wu Chi, no one was stupid enough to join this team despite having the same thoughts. These people were busy ‘abusing’ single dogs, who would want to actively go ahead and be ‘abused’ even more?</p> 
 <p>“Silly girls, what’s with this talk about dying and whatnot? You look down on your man too much. Take good care of yourselves. If you lose even a strand of hair, brace for my spanking when I get back!”</p> 
 <p>With a laugh, Bai Xiaofei headed straight towards the depths of the forest, leaving the girls with complicated expressions and everyone else silently watching his departing figure.</p>
