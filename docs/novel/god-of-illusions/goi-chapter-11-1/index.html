<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>The female senior in charge of registration didn’t answer Bai Xiaofei’s question, and she intentionally put on a mysterious act and said, “Good luck.”</p>
 <p>It was precisely these words that caused Bai Xiaofei to be perturbed all along the way.</p>
 <p><i>I wouldn’t have finished all my luck during the test, right? Why are more and more strange things happening?</i></p>
 <p>Finally, Bai Xiaofei arrived at the area the prep school classes were situated according to the instruction of the female senior from before, and after he stepped through the entrance to the area, two entirely different states entered into his eyes.</p>
 <p>On one side were buildings that were beautiful and majestic, with students and teachers bustling about up and down.</p>
 <p>On the other side were buildings of antique design, and not to mention teachers and students, he couldn’t even see a single bird.</p>
 <p>The place Bai Xiaofei had to report to was the ‘quiet’ side.</p>
 <p><i>“The rarer a thing is, the more precious it is. It’s surely because they’re too outstanding that they’re small in number. Right, it’s surely like this.” </i>Bai Xiaofei entered into the quiet cluster of buildings as he consoled himself over and over again, and he started searching for class number 456.</p>
 <p>Finally, after going through untold hardships, Bai Xiaofei saw his objective, class 456 at the extreme corner.</p>
 <p>If the quiet area of buildings could be said to be the commoner's district when compared with the other side, then class 456 was the slums, and it was to the point that even the location of the classroom was squeezed out from the remaining space.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei gulped down a mouthful of saliva and took a deep breath as he looked at the classroom before him….</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had accepted his fate!</p>
 <p><i>You f*cking old hag! How ruthless of you! I’ll f*cking remember this!</i></p>
 <p>As he gave Luo Xi a strike on his blacklist in his heart, Bai Xiaofei lightly pushed the door open…. No, he pushed down the classroom door.</p>
 <p>“Who is it!!!” A high pitched voice pierced directly into the cloud, and it shook Bai Xiaofei’s eardrums to the point that he felt a sharp pain.</p>
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei returned to his senses and focused his gaze over, he saw a short haired woman in black colored tight clothes staring furiously at him. Her sleeveless and fitted top and similarly fitting black pants fully revealed her flawless figure, it was protruding at the places that should be, raised at the….</p>
 <p>Cough… cough…. This is a decent novel….</p>
 <p>“Who’re you!? Do you know how precious my door is!? Can you afford to pay for it?!” The woman squatted down to inspect her ‘treasure’ as she spoke, but based on its shattered appearance, there was probably no hope.</p>
 <p>“Err, I’m a student that has come to report here. I’m called Bai Xiaofei….” Bai Xiaofei who was worried he would be extorted couldn’t help but speak in a slightly apprehensive tone.</p>
 <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the woman had instantly moved up to stand right before him, and her fury was immediately wiped away to be replaced by pleasant surprise in the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>“You’re a student?!”</p>
 <p>“What did you just say your name was?</p>
 <p>“How old are you?</p>
 <p>“Where’re you from?</p>
 <p>“What’re you skilled in?</p>
 <p>“Do you have any hobbies?”</p>
 <p>She drew nearer to him with every sentence she spoke, and after she finished asking the pile of questions, the distance between the two of them was already less than two inches, and Bai Xiaofei was even able to clearly smell the faint refreshing fragrance on her.</p>
 <p>“I’m called…. Bai Xiaofei….” Bai Xiaofei’s mind that had crashed instantly could only recall the woman’s first question, and he replied with a trembling voice.</p>
 <p>“Hey, look at how excited you are. Have you not been so close to a woman before?”</p>
 <p>“You wouldn’t still be a virgin, right?” The woman drew closer to him once more as she spoke, and Bai Xiaofei instinctively intended to back away yet was grabbed ahold of by the woman and restrained on the spot.</p>
 <p>“Do you want to try the taste of a woman? I can satisfy you!” The woman licked her lips as she spoke, and she lightly raised Bai Xiaofei’s chin up with her index finger.</p>
 <p>After that, the ‘virgin’ Bai Xiaofei reacted extremely obediently yet when Bai Xiaofei was almost unable to refrain himself and was about to stretch out his hand, the woman jumped to the side as if she’d been shocked by electricity.</p>
 <p>“HAHAHAHA!! You actually had a reaction!!!” It was as if she’d found the most amusing thing in this world, and she roared endlessly with laughter as if her acupuncture point for laughter had been struck and without any regard to Bai Xiaofei’s embarrassment.</p>
 <p>This time, Bai Xiaofei had really lost, but he really enjoyed it….</p>
 <p>“What’s there to laugh about the normal reaction of a man? If I didn’t have any reaction when such a beautiful woman came close to me, then that would be worthy of laughter.” Never admitting it even when one has lost, one of the excellent traditions of the Gorge of Heroes!</p>
 <p>“What a sweet and stubborn mouth! Let me introduce myself officially, from today onward and in the next three months, I’m your Head Teacher. But, I don’t like being addressed as Head Teacher, my name is Xue Ying, and you can call me Big Sister Xue.” Xue Ying placed her hand on her waist as she assumed a posture that said she held the highest authority here as she looked at Bai Xiaofei with her head held high.</p>
 <p>“Alright, Aunty Xue.” Along with Bai Xiaofei lightly spitting out these words, the complacent expression on Xue Ying’s face instantly froze.</p>
 <p>In the next second, her terrifying speed erupted as Xue Ying instantly arrived before Bai Xiaofei once again, and her surging killing intent gushed towards Bai Xiaofei like a wave while a short dagger lay across Bai Xiaofei’s neck.</p>
 <p>“What did you just say? I didn’t hear it clearly as my ears aren’t working too well lately.” Xue Ying had a gloomy expression, and her attitude was already extremely obvious.</p>
 <p>“Oh, is that so.” Bai Xiaofei’s eyes narrowed into two slits as he took a deep breath, and then he let out the loudest voice he could muster up while pressing his mouth close to Xue Ying’s ear and roaring.</p>
 <p>“I understand! Aunty Xue!!!”</p>
 <p>Her mind droned as the roar caught Xue Ying off guard and completely dazed her.</p>
 <p>When Xue Ying returned to her senses, Bai Xiaofei had already sat down, and his gaze was filled with obedience as he looked right at Xue Ying as if what happened just now wasn’t his doing.</p>
 <p>“Teacher, are you cleaning up? Do you need my help? I’m very capable!”</p>
 <p>The sudden change caused Xue Ying to be slightly bewildered.</p>
 <p><i>Could it be that what happened earlier was a hallucination?</i></p>
 <p><i>But if it is, then why does my ear hurt so much?</i></p>
 <p>When he saw Xue Ying hadn’t made a reaction after a long time, Bai Xiaofei had already picked up the broom that was tossed away by Xue Ying earlier, and he relieved her of the ‘heavy responsibility’ of cleaning up with extreme seriousness.</p>
 <p>“Stop!” Xue Ying glared angrily at Bai Xiaofei and seemed to have finally sorted out what was real.</p>
 <p>“What is it, teacher?” As he raised his head, Bai Xiaofei looked at Xue Ying with an innocent expression, and he caused Xue Ying to be at a loss for what to say.</p>
 <p>“You…. Didn’t you hear that I said you’re not allowed to call me teacher!?” After holding back her rage for a long time, the conversation had returned to square one, and the matter of ‘Aunty Xue’ was left unsettled just like that.</p>
 <p>“Oh, that. That won’t do, my foster parents taught me that I must respect my seniors, and I can’t speak or act out of line.” Bai Xiaofei intentionally emphasized the word ‘senior’ and he revealed an expression that seemed as if he didn’t know where the problem was.</p>
 <p>“You’re the senior! Your entire family is full of seniors! This lady is only 24 years old! I’m a young lady! Not a senior!” Xue Ying’s entire face flushed red with anger, and she practically leaped as she roared.</p>
 <p>“I’m only 16. You’re eight years older than me, so doesn’t a gap of eight years make you a senior…?” He still maintained his innocent expression and spoke as a matter of course. Moreover, there seemed to be no problem with what he said no matter how one thought about it.</p>
 <p>Even Xue Ying herself was persuaded by Bai Xiaofei’s words.</p>
 <p>She was stunned for a moment before shaking her head, and then Xue Ying drove out the acknowledgment she had towards Bai Xiaofei from her mind.</p>
 <p>“Then let me ask you this. Do you still want to stay in this class in the future!?” With a gloomy voice and a sharp gaze, Xue Ying had utilized her trump card.</p>
