<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was indeed quite nimble, but he was still a human. And as a human, he would eventually be hit with exhaustion. Upon becoming exhausted, his speed started dropping, which resulted in the stone monster catching up and beating him. Again and again, Bai Xiaofei was sent flying by the stone monster’s fists. The amount of wounds on his body grew to the point where even his unique physique could no longer hold on.</p>
 <p>Once again, the stone monster caught up to Bai Xiaofei. He spoke with a prideful tone, “Kid, why are you not running anymore?”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei wiped the blood off the corner of his mouth and sneered. He said, “Do you think I’m already screwed?”</p>
 <p>His words planted a trace of anxiousness in the heart of the stone monster.</p>
 <p>“I wonder if you have heard of the name Lei Shan before,” Bai Xiaofei asked. Immediately, a sudden clap of thunder rumbled in the air. From the source of the thunderclap, Lei Shan could be seen standing there with a terrifying look of fury on his face.</p>
 <p>In the Infinite Mountain Range, not many King Rank magical beasts were unaware of who Lei Shan was. His name was first on the list of existences that should not be provoked. Thus, the instant the stone monster saw Lei Shan, he started thinking of fleeing.</p>
 <p>But soon after, the stone monster realized that something was off. If that was truly Lei Shan, a mere King Rank magical beast like him wouldn’t even be given the chance to think before he was killed. Unfortunately, his realization came too late. The short pause was exactly what Bai Xiaofei required.</p>
 <p>“Die, bastard!”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei focused all his strength into his right arm. With his origin energy and the amplification provided by the Devouring the Heaven and Earth technique, green veins surfaced on his arm. Accompanied by a loud rumble, he landed a heavy punch on the stone monster’s right leg. There was a reason he had decided to hit the leg out of so many parts on the stone monster. That was because the right leg was where the radish monster was hidden.</p>
 <p>Stones might be hard, but stones were still stones. Bai Xiaofei’s fist was able to smash through the stone, sending the radish hiding inside flying high up into the air. Then, he stamped the ground and dashed forward before grabbing the radish with his hand. By the time he landed on the ground again, fear had been plastered all over the radish’s face.</p>
 <p>“Damn it! Do you think I have acted as your punching bag for so long for nothing? If it wasn’t for the sake of looking for your actual position, I wouldn’t have taken all your beating,” said Bai Xiaofei fiercely with the radish grabbed in his fist. He was about to kill the radish when a large hand formed of stone shot out of the ground, grabbed Bai Xiaofei’s leg, and lifted him into the air. Next, a brand new stone monster slowly crawled up from the ground. When the new stone monster was back on his feet, he stared at the hanging Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“Let go of him or die,” a deep voice rang out from the stone monster’s mouth. Bai Xiaofei was deeply frightened, but when he heard those words, he calmed down. He had been wondering why the radish hadn’t demonstrated more control over stones even after so long. He even suspected that the radish was hiding his strength. But it turned out the radish actually had a companion. Moreover, this companion seemed to be extremely close to the radish. If that were the case, things would be much simpler.</p>
 <p>“Do you think I’m stupid? Will I live if I let him go? Put me down right this moment. Otherwise, I don’t mind squeezing him to death. We can both die together,” Bai Xiaofei said while tightening his grip on the radish. That placed the radish in intense pain, causing him to cry out miserably.</p>
 <p>“Ok, ok, I’ll put you down,” the stone monster replied frantically before placing Bai Xiaofei down on the ground.</p>
 <p>“You can free him now, right? I promise we will stop bothering you if you free him,” the stone monster promised, but Bai Xiaofei completely ignored him. After expanding so much effort being a punching bag for so long, Bai Xiaofei wouldn’t quit without getting something for his troubles.. Otherwise, Bai Xiaofei wouldn’t have been known as the crafty bastard that he was.</p>
 <p>“Sure, I can spare the radish, but not now.” Bai Xiaofei had barely spoken those words when the stone monster became agitated.</p>
 <p>“You liar!”</p>
 <p>“How am I a liar? Have I promised to free the radish if you free me? It is a matter of your comprehension. If you don’t want the radish to be snapped into two, listen to me obediently,” Bai Xiaofei howled with an even louder voice. He was totally not behaving like he was facing two King Rank magical beasts. But then again, this wasn’t surprising in any way. At the academy, he was someone who dared to trick even Exquisite Rank big shots. What were two mere King Rank magical beasts?</p>
 <p>The stone monster behaved exactly as Bai Xiaofei had expected. After listening to his words, a look of compromise surfaced on the stone monster’s face.</p>
 <p>“Human, do not lie to me. Otherwise, you will die a miserable death!” declared the stone monster. Bai Xiaofei merely laughed as a response.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. I have always been very trustworthy when dealing with magical beasts. I love my life dearly as well. We will definitely have a fruitful cooperation!” Bai Xiaofei said.</p>
 <p>Doubt surfaced on the stone monster’s face, and the stone monster asked, “Human, what do you want me to do?”</p>
 <p>“Become my hit man!” Bai Xiaofei immediately replied.</p>
 <p>“Hit man? Who’s my hit?” asked the stone monster. But Bai Xiaofei did not need to reply. A loud sound rang out as three different auras appeared near the ruin. When they looked at the source of the auras, they saw three King Rank magical beasts silently staring at Bai Xiaofei and the stone monster.</p>
 <p>One of them was a gorgeously colored, large butterfly. The butterfly’s wings were flapping, building a cloud of dust around the pair of wings. No matter how one looked at the cloud of dust, it did not look like something one wanted to get near to.</p>
 <p>There was also an extremely bulky rhinoceros covered with scales. This rhinoceros had the strongest presence among the three. Just by standing there, Bai Xiaofei had a sense of helplessness.</p>
 <p>And the final magical beast was an extremely unique humanoid beast. The only things separating this magical beast from a normal human were its two tentacles, green skin, and long tail.</p>
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei saw the newly arrived magical beasts, he started feeling regretful. He regretted that he had not studied hard in the past. Otherwise, the current situation where he knew nothing about all three of the magical beasts would not have arisen.</p>
 <p>“Can you beat them?” Bai Xiaofei gulped and asked his only hope, the stone monster beside him.</p>
 <p>“I can beat the Toxic Overlord Butterfly, but I can do nothing about the Steel Rhinoceros and the Draconic Man,” the stone monster replied honestly. At those words, Bai Xiaofei stealthily stole a glance at Hu Xian’er. The clump of liquid was still slowly fusing into Hu Xian’er’s magic core. There was no sign that this process was going to end anytime soon.</p>
 <p>“Just try your best. If you can last ten minutes, I will free the radish. You can decide if you want to stay or leave then,” Bai Xiaofei spoke in a low voice, giving the stone monster a ray of hope. The stone monster had enough confidence to survive ten minutes.</p>
