 <p>Chapter 976: Shocking Debut!</p> 
 <p>“Not good!”</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingtong was first to react upon seeing the two fall. Dashing over in a flash, she caught both of them before they hit the ground.</p> 
 <p>Only then did the three royal sisters see the positions the two were in. In order to ensure that his Devouring the Heaven and Earth would work, Bai Xiaofei’s hands were firmly locked around Ye Qingcheng’s slender waist. Meanwhile, Ye Qingcheng’s hand had pierced into his chest, and the blood flowing out from the wound had dyed their clothes crimson.</p> 
 <p>“Save him!” Ye Qingtong said as she tried to separate the two, but found that it was impossible. In desperation, she could only use the Moon God Technique to pump energy into his body.</p> 
 <p>Ye Xi joined her right after she rushed over. The two sisters, both using the Moon God Technique, were then able to preserve his life.</p> 
 <p>“This is not the way. We must wake up at least one of them.” Ye Xi frowned upon feeling the energy in her body being sapped away rapidly.</p> 
 <p>“Certainly impossible for him in this state. Tong’er, use your Wake on Big Sister,” said Ye Qingtong.</p> 
 <p>Ye Tong immediately poured a soft flow of energy into Ye Qingcheng’s body. Before long, the emperor slowly opened her eyes.</p> 
 <p>Having no recollection of what happened after she went berserk, she was shocked to see Bai Xiaofei’s big face at point-blank.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t get emotional, Big Sister. Just now, the other you came out,” Ye Xi informed.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Ye Qingcheng instantly calmed down as she knew enough about her second personality. However, this was her first time being this close to a man…</p> 
 <p>“I’ll pull out my hand. When I do, you three quickly manage his injury,” she said before mobilizing the little energy left in her body. Her right hand then became transparent and she slowly pulled it out of Bai Xiaofei’s body.</p> 
 <p>Blood instantly flowed like a river. Luckily, it was near-impossible for him to die in the presence of the three royal sisters who were proficient in the Moon God Technique. After the injury stopped bleeding, Ye Qingcheng checked on Bai Xiaofei before heaving a sigh of relief.</p> 
 <p>“He stopped the other me?” Ye Qingcheng still found it hard to believe despite the reality in front of her. In her cognition, her second personality was no different from being invincible.</p> 
 <p>“Had the fight dragged any longer, maybe he wouldn’t be able to, or else he wouldn’t have used such a desperate method. But we have to admit that he is very strong,” Ye Xi remarked solemnly as a hint of expectation rose in her heart. <em>Perhaps he can really resolve Moonlight’s current situation!</em></p> 
 <p>Ye Qingcheng’s expressions changed again and again. Then, she looked seriously at Ye Tong. “Tong’er, take good care of him. No matter what, he needs to be able to stand up tomorrow.”</p> 
 <p>“Okay, Big Sister. You go handle your business.” Ye Tong, who could read the situation, obediently agreed and excused herself.</p> 
 <p>Ye Xi suddenly recalled something. “By the way, he has a master who has been traveling with him. What should we do about her?”</p> 
 <p>When it came to Tan Xin, Ye Xi felt conflicted. Anyone could see Bai Xiaofei and Tan Xin weren’t Moonlight people. Therefore, it was impossible to use Moonlight’s regulations to restrict them.</p> 
 <p>“Since they are peers, their goals are one and the same. When he wakes up, this problem will naturally be solved and we’ll gain one more helper.” Having regained her composure, Ye Qingcheng was once again the same wise emperor who had everything under control.</p> 
 <p>“I understand. I’ll go and prepare for tomorrow,” Ye Xi said and retreated.</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingcheng then looked at Ye Qingtong, the only one left.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s talk?”</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingtong smiled. “Everything that should be said was already said, and my decision will not change. He is not here to help Moonlight, he is here to change Moonlight, a change that I want. Do you think I will miss this opportunity?”</p> 
 <p>With that, she also left without looking back.</p> 
 <p>Her eyes following her sister’s back, Ye Qingcheng took a deep breath and revealed a lonely expression.</p> 
 <p>Have I been wrong?</p> 
 <p>At this thought, she recalled Bai Xiaofei, her heart filled with complicated emotions, before she finally revealed a wry smile. “I hope you won’t disappoint me.”</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>“You actually hid so deeply, huh?! When you wake up, this lord shall teach you a lesson!”</p> 
 <p>The rest of the day slowly passed as Ye Tong cured Bai Xiaofei. That night, most people in Moonlight couldn’t get a good night’s sleep.</p> 
 <p>At dawn the next day, the whole capital had gone through a complete change in appearance, covered with bright red decorations. All shops were closed and nearly every citizen had gathered in the biggest square of the city.</p> 
 <p>It was the birthday of the Moonlight emperor!</p> 
 <p>Every year, only on this day, the emperor would take off her veil and meet the people. Everyone was looking forward to witnessing her demeanor with their own eyes.</p> 
 <p>Of course, there were exceptions.</p> 
 <p>“Where’s that rascal? I haven’t heard from him all day. Don’t tell me he’s been fascinated by that stupid emperor!” In the crowd, Tan Xin was gnawing at an apple with an annoyed expression as she kept complaining.</p> 
 <p>When the quiet crowd suddenly stirred, Tan Xin looked over and saw a brilliantly dressed Ye Qingcheng. Walking next to her, Ye Xi and Ye Tong also appeared radiant.</p> 
 <p>To everyone’s astonishment, however, behind the emperor were not her royal maids like in the past, but three hundred heavily armed men!</p> 
 <p><em>Men?! How can men make an appearance on such an occasion?!</em></p> 
 <p>As discussions filled the square, Ye Qingcheng ascended the high stage.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei, who had mostly recovered and was leading the group of three hundred men, ordered them to surround the platform in three tight rows. The group was clad in pure-black armor and blood-red cloaks floated behind them, each face exuding unprecedented confidence.</p> 
 <p>Leading them, Bai Xiaofei wore bright silver armor, which represented the identity of a deputy commander who could lead up to five hundred people!</p> 
 <p>At that moment, everyone forgot the purpose of the celebration as their eyes could not help but focus on Bai Xiaofei’s group.</p> 
 <p><em>What on earth is going on?!!</em></p>
