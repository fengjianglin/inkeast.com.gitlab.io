 <p>Chapter 653: Despair?!</p> 
 <p>“In fact, this old man has always planned to pass you guys the God Control Technique, but you were too young and your ranks weren’t high enough, so it would only do you harm to forcibly learn it.” Cang Lan grinned. The surprise that the triplets showed was completely as he had expected and even beyond.</p> 
 <p>“Grandpa is the best!” Leng Liuying happily swayed Cang Lan’s arms while Leng Liushuang and Leng Liuli started massaging his left and right shoulder.</p> 
 <p>“Erm, Grandpa, after you teach it to us, can we teach others?” asked Leng Liuli tentatively.</p> 
 <p>Cang Lan instantly shook his head.</p> 
 <p>“That would be quite far-fetched. Only I can teach the God Control Technique. You can’t even if you learn it, because you don’t have a medium.” Cang Lan then raised his tightly bandaged right arm.</p> 
 <p>The triplets immediately frowned. After they exchanged glances, Leng Liuying squatted down.</p> 
 <p>“Grandpa, if your three precious granddaughters ask you to teach one more person, you won’t disagree, will you?”</p> 
 <p>If Bai Xiaofei were present, his chin would definitely be on the ground right now. Who would believe that Leng Liuying had such a behaved side to her?</p> 
 <p>“Don’t push your luck! It’s already my bottom line to be willing to teach you three. There is a limited number of media. If you use one, there’s eternally one less.” Realizing that the three girls had ulterior motives, Cang Lan was on the alert. He had been tricked by three ‘lovely’ granddaughters enough times to know that he must not give in.</p> 
 <p>“Then if I don’t learn and give up my spot, can you teach that person instead?” Leng Liuying revealed their real trap.</p> 
 <p>“Nonsense! The three of you are linked as one. If you don’t learn what they learn, it will be difficult for you three to achieve the same unity and you’ll encounter plenty of problems when controlling your puppet. You’ll fail to combine at best, and at worst, your strength will take irreversible damage!” Cang Lan’s expression became extremely solemn.</p> 
 <p>Frightened, Leng Liuying instantly quieted down. Just as she seldomly acted cute, Cang Lan was rarely this angry.</p> 
 <p>“Then we won’t learn either.”</p> 
 <p>Cang Lan hadn’t gotten to enjoy the fruits of his victory when Leng Liuli and Leng Liushuang stunned him on the spot.</p> 
 <p><em>What the hell is going on?!</em></p> 
 <p>But after some thought, he gradually realized something.</p> 
 <p>“How muddle-headed of me. If I still remember correctly, you three little fellows should not have graduated from Starnet yet.” He looked at the three sisters with extreme seriousness.</p> 
 <p>The triplets bowed their heads. None of them dare to step out in this kind of atmosphere.</p> 
 <p>“And yet, you three hurried back to see me. It’s obviously for my God Control Technique, only to say that you want to give it up. You actually came back for that person whom you want me to teach it to, didn’t you?“ Cang Lan quickly deduced the situation.</p> 
 <p>The triplets’ faces flushed beet red.</p> 
 <p>“Unbelievable, huh? Someone in Starnet has successfully captured my three baby granddaughters. It seems I underestimated those brats!” Cang Lan laughed out loud, but it was impossible to tell from his tone whether this was out of joy or anger. “Where is he?! You have all spoken and still won’t let me see him?!” This last sentence was a resounding roar as Cang Lan swept his eyes around the area.</p> 
 <p>However, he didn’t see anyone.</p> 
 <p>At Cang Lan’s reminder, the Leng triplets suddenly remembered Bai Xiaofei. Three more pairs of eyes carefully scanned around before flashing in unison with doubt.</p> 
 <p><em>Where is he?!</em></p> 
 <p>After a brief shock, eight eyes converged at almost the same time as they suddenly had an expression of realization. <em>The peach blossom forest!</em></p> 
 <p>The four immediately ran to the peach blossom forest, and then sighed in unison as they stood in front of it.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, let’s wait for a while. He’ll be out after three hours anyway.” Cang Lan pouted as he formed a bad impression on his granddaughters’ future husband.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the ‘three hours’ he mentioned was everyone’s cognition of this peach blossom forest. So far, he had never heard of anyone coming out of this peach blossom forest on their own, and this peach blossom forest seemed to have a consciousness as it released anyone who had been trapped inside after three full hours. Even Cang Lan belonged to this category, and so did the triplets who had tried it when they were younger.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, they weren’t worried. They even thought that he should have entered the forest for at least one hour and so would appear soon.</p> 
 <p>However, no one knew what Bai Xiaofei was going through at the moment!</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>“Dieeee!!!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei tore apart a rotting body and swung it in fury.</p> 
 <p>The stone road had been filled with similar rotting bodies. From entering peach blossom forest up to now, he had definitely been inside this formation for over three hours. Fortunately for him, he did not know about its three-hour feature.</p> 
 <p>When these corpses had first appeared, Bai Xiaofei didn’t take them seriously, but he realized something was wrong the moment he was touched by one.</p> 
 <p>The pain itself was fatal!</p> 
 <p>Ever since then, he had entered Spiritualization and had been fighting nonstop, destroying many such rotting corpses. However, the distance he had advanced was absolutely no more than 50 meters. He’d die from exhaustion at this rate!</p> 
 <p>Coming to this conclusion, Bai Xiaofei utilized his spirit, and Blackie on his shoulder looked at him.</p> 
 <p>“Come. I really can’t think of any other way. It’ll be fine if we end this battle quickly!” said Bai Xiaofei as he activated the invincible shield of Purple Luan while exiting the fusion state with it. The next second, Blackie turned into a black light and melted into his body…</p> 
 <p>Spiritualization, Blackie!</p> 
 <p>After exiting Spiritualization, Purple Luan went into hibernation and the invincible shield disappeared. The surrounding rotting corpses instantly flocked over.</p> 
 <p>“Since this lord is in a good mood, I’ll do you a favor and cremate you!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei raised one hand, and a fire sphere spread out with him as the center. The terrifying heat instantly incinerated every corpse in its wake. When he finally stopped, the stone road was completely cleaned!</p> 
 <p>“Lowly human! How dare you kill all my slaves!” Before Bai Xiaofei could celebrate, a heavy voice resounded from the black viscous liquid.</p> 
 <p>It seemed that this ordeal was not so easy to pass.</p>
