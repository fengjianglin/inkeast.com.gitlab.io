 <p>Chapter 933: Pathetic? Respectable!</p> 
 <p>“So, are we not gonna say goodbye to the Yun family? I always feel like they care a little too much about you,” Tan Xin wondered after they boarded the Windsurfing Ship.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but sigh upon hearing this, his face full of sadness. “Because I care too much, I don’t know what to say to bid farewell to them.”</p> 
 <p>Both Lan Qiushuang and Yun Tianhe were the only real relatives he had met since he grew up.</p> 
 <p>It wasn’t that his family in the Gorge of Heroes weren’t good to him, but that the bond of blood was something too special.</p> 
 <p>“Even so, you can’t just up and leave like that!” a voice suddenly rang out of nowhere.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei sprang in fright. Looking over, he saw three people standing there looking at him with smiles on their faces. He rubbed his eyes in disbelief before turning to Tan Xin, who immediately twisted her head with a look of ‘it has nothing to do with me’ that couldn’t be more fake.</p> 
 <p>“Uncle Yun, Aunt Lan, Brother Tianhe,” Bai Xiaofei greeted with a guilty expression. And although he was surprised, his heart was filled with happiness to see them again.</p> 
 <p>“This direction… You’re going to Brightmoon?” Lan Qiushuang got right to business, her face full of maternal worry.</p> 
 <p>“Well, I hesitated between Violethorn and Brightmoon for a long time, but the experience in Ethereal has made me understand one thing: I don’t have the power to find Violethorn for trouble yet. So, I have decided to investigate little by little,” Bai Xiaofei briefly explained.</p> 
 <p>Lan Qiushuang was satisfied with his answer. She said in relief, “It seems that I was too worried for nothing. I thought you would be hot-headed and run to Violethorn right away.” Then, she took out a storage ring. “This is for you. There will be many inconveniences if you go out into the world without some money.”</p> 
 <p>Lan Qiushuang obviously wouldn’t allow him to refuse, so he could only accept it with gratitude.</p> 
 <p>“You should learn about the local situations and customs of Brightmoon. It won’t be the same as Ethereal. You must keep a low profile. In Brightmoon, men have no status,” Lan Qiushuang stressed.</p> 
 <p>Her expression was so extremely serious that it scared Bai Xiaofei into gulping hard.</p> 
 <p>He had long heard that in Brightmoon, women were superior to men, and all those in power were women. However, when he met Ling Ming’s wife, she seemed quite a relaxed person.</p> 
 <p>“Well, that’s all I have to say. Remember to return to Ethereal and see us in the future.”</p> 
 <p>With that, Lan Qiushuang stepped aside, making way for an eager Yun Tianhe.</p> 
 <p>“Lil’ Bro, I have nothing to give you, but I will definitely take good care of that little brother of yours. If you run into trouble in Brightmoon, send news to me and I’ll make sure to get there as soon as possible!” Yun Tianhe rattled off like a machine gun, excited as if he wasn’t sending Bai Xiaofei off, but welcoming him.</p> 
 <p>“Of course I believe you, Big Bro. Also, make sure you teach Tianhai well. Don’t let him become a spoiled silkpants,” Bai Xiaofei said and hugged Yun Tianhe.</p> 
 <p>At that moment, no words needed to be said.</p> 
 <p>“Alright. But I still have to say this: Remember to come back!” Yun Tianhe patted Bai Xiaofei heavily on the shoulder, then whispered into his ear. “My father has been so secretive, I don’t know what he wants to say to you. You need to be careful!”</p> 
 <p>With that, Yun Tianhe ran after Lan Qiushuang, who was walking away. Seeing this, Tan Xin also left the scene, leaving privacy for Bai Xiaofei and Yun Lan.</p> 
 <p>“You are Bai Longfei’s son, aren’t you?”</p> 
 <p>Yun Lan’s opening sentence threw Bai Xiaofei into a panic because he knew that Lan Qiushuang would never mention this to Yun Lan.</p> 
 <p>“Although you two look quite different, your personalities are too similar. Love standing out, reckless, coming and going without a trace. To put it nicely, you are free souls, and to put it bluntly, you just don’t consider the consequences.”</p> 
 <p>Yun Lan continued harshly, but before Bai Xiaofei could say anything, his tone suddenly took a turn.</p> 
 <p>“However, this time, thank you.”</p> 
 <p>This made Bai Xiaofei swallow back his words. He smiled awkwardly, not knowing what to say.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I will take good care of Qiushuang and Tianhe,” Yun Lan said out of the blue.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei froze for a good two seconds. <em>What do you mean by that?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Ehh, Uncle Yun, you don’t have to tell me that.” Bai Xiaofei gulped as a bad feeling rose in his heart.</p> 
 <p>“I’m not saying this to you, but to your father. After all, he is gone. If there is such a thing as a soul in heaven looking down upon their family, then he is definitely watching you.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei finally understood what he meant. <em>But…</em></p> 
 <p>And then, what he feared the most came.</p> 
 <p>“Do you really think I don’t know about Tianhe? In fact, I knew from the day he was born, but I really liked Qiushuang then, to the point that I was willing to sacrifice for her. However, after so many years, I gradually realized that I can’t do without Tianhe. Do you understand what I mean?” There was a hint of pleading in Yun Lan’s voice.</p> 
 <p>“Uncle Yun, Brother Tianhe will always be the First young master of the Yun family. What you are worried about will never happen. He and I will only be sworn brothers forever,” Bai Xiaofei solemnly promised as he finally understood the purpose of Yun Lan’s appearance here.</p> 
 <p>The man didn’t care about becoming the father of someone else’s kid. He was scared that Bai Xiaofei, an abrupt variable, would make his decades of acting go down the drain. No matter who knew about this matter, as long as Yun Tianhe didn’t know, then everything would be fine and the Yuns would still be a happy family!</p> 
 <p>“Do you think I’m pathetic?” asked Yun Lan with a sad smile.</p> 
 <p>A long silence ensued. Then, Bai Xiaofei’s face grew solemn.</p> 
 <p>“It’s all because of love, so what’s pathetic about it? On the contrary, I think you are respectable. There are not many men who have such deep feelings like you.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Yun Lan burst out laughing, thus ending their conversation on a delightful note.</p> 
 <p>A while later, the Yun family left the ship and returned to their home. Watching as they left, Bai Xiaofei sighed.</p> 
 <p><em>Oh, my old dad, look what you’ve done!</em></p>
