 <p>Chapter 744: Savage Class Deployed!</p> 
 <p>An excited Bai Xiaofei ran all the way back to the Demon of Illusions, where the entrance was full of people.</p> 
 <p>“He’s back! Brother Fei is back!” shouted Mo Ka, the one with the best eyesight.</p> 
 <p>Everyone instantly perked up.</p> 
 <p>“How did it go, Brother Fei?! Did the principal agree to let us out?!” Wu Chi eagerly pulled Bai Xiaofei, who was surrounded the moment he stopped.</p> 
 <p>All of the Savage Class members plus Hu Xian’er had been waiting, and everyone’s face was full of expectation.</p> 
 <p>“When have I ever failed?” Bai Xiaofei chuckled. His answer put everyone at ease.</p> 
 <p>“When do we start? The idleness is killing me,” asked Wu Chi with a silly smile.</p> 
 <p>“Go back and pack your stuff. We will set off immediately!” Bai Xiaofei didn’t want to delay for a moment. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to stay in Starnet. He just had a feeling that the Blood Diamond matter really couldn’t wait.</p> 
 <p>“Can I join?” a weak voice rang outside the crowd.</p> 
 <p>Startled, everyone looked back to see a familiar face – Luo Han. It was at that moment that Bai Xiaofei felt a chill down his back.</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er was glaring at him from behind. <em>It’s all because of your ‘good deed.’ She’s coming to our door now!</em></p> 
 <p>“Of course, you are very welcome. With you, we will get twice the result with half the effort.” Despite the biting glare on his back, Bai Xiaofei could not say no.</p> 
 <p>This was partly why he wanted to leave as soon as possible. The longer it dragged on, who knew how many more people would come demanding to join. This team was already big enough!</p> 
 <p>“I thought there would be only one empress, but here comes another!” As if afraid that her presence was not outstanding enough, Rui Mengqi made a comment that made Bai Xiaofei just want to kick her out.</p> 
 <p><em>You really know the worst thing to say every time!</em></p> 
 <p>“Ahem, hurry and go pack up. We need to leave before dark!” Bai Xiaofei swiftly changed the topic, this was his only way to survive.</p> 
 <p>“Yeah! Go! We’ll gather at the academy entrance in 30 minutes!” As Bai Xiaofei’s old buddy, Fang Ye was the only one who could come forward to save him at this critical moment.</p> 
 <p>The group dispersed in a hubbub. Only Hu Xian’er stayed.</p> 
 <p>“Well… don’t you need to get ready?” Bai Xiaofei donned a weak smile.</p> 
 <p>“I have nothing to deal with, except you!” Hu Xian’er’s reply was merciless.</p> 
 <p>“What’s there to deal with? I’m so obedient, I’ll go wherever you point to.” Bai Xiaofei inched closer with an ingratiating expression. “Look at you, you’ve gotten so thin recently. I will definitely provide you with good compensation during this trip!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei especially emphasized ‘compensation,’ but it only earned a disdainful eye-roll from Hu Xian’er. She then changed the topic.</p> 
 <p>“I searched almost all of the Infinite Mountain Range, but there’s still no sign of my people.” From Bai Xiaofei’s departure until now, Hu Xian’er never stopped looking for her clansmen but no good news ever turned up.</p> 
 <p>“Sometimes no bad news is good news. If they are not in the Infinite Mountain Range, it means they have found a hiding place. You should be happy. Once you are strong enough, they will come back to you sooner or later,” Bai Xiaofei softly comforted.</p> 
 <p>“I hope you’re right.” Hu Xian’er sighed.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry. Who knows? Maybe we’ll even come across your people during this trip. To travel to the Windless Zone, we basically have to cross the whole continent.” This piece of information that was essentially bad news actually became the only consolation for Hu Xian’er.</p> 
 <p>“There’s something I can’t understand. Although the Savage Class members aren’t what they used to be – I mean, they may have touched the threshold of the Master Rank, but even Grandmaster Rank puppet masters may not be able to retreat safely from this matter,” Hu Xian’er changed the topic again.</p> 
 <p>She didn’t say it out loud, but in her opinion, many of the Savage Class were actually dead weight. It was not that she didn’t believe in her strength, but the situation was too special. Even Hu Xian’er could not guarantee her own safety.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry. I came out of the Savage Class, no one knows them better than me. As you said, they have reached their limit in Starnet. If they want to advance, this is their last chance before graduation. Moreover, I’m here.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei took a deep breath and smiled.</p> 
 <p>“Since you are ready, let us go to wait for them at the entrance. It will not be easy for the Savage Class to get together like this in the future.” Bai Xiaofei sighed and headed to the front entrance of the academy.</p> 
 <p>To Bai Xiaofei’s complete shock, both sides of the main entrance were filled with students from all grades, who were holding long banners of farewell words to him.</p> 
 <p>“This is what you mean by flawless confidentiality?” Hu Xian’er turned to look at Bai Xiaofei, her eyes full of helplessness.</p> 
 <p>“It must be Mo Ka and them!” Bai Xiaofei directly pushed the blame to someone else.</p> 
 <p>However, the rest of the group soon arrived and proved that it had nothing to do with them.</p> 
 <p>“What the?! What is this?! Brother Fei, didn’t you say we’d leave quietly?!”</p> 
 <p>The boys arrived first as they packed up quickly. Upon seeing the scene at the entrance, they were also dumbstruck.</p> 
 <p>“I said I don’t know either, would you believe it?” Bai Xiaofei swallowed with difficulty.</p> 
 <p>After the girls arrived, Bai Xiaofei took the lead and set foot on the avenue full of people on both sides.</p> 
 <p>“Respectfully seeing our senior brothers and sisters off! We wish you victory and a triumphant return!” shouted the students in harmony, obviously rehearsed.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s group was stunned again. <em>Did they know we were leaving before Xiaofei even decided to leave?!</em></p> 
 <p>“I will do well what I must, and so should you. In the future, you will be the pillars of Starnet. I believe that the academy will rise to another level in your hands!” Bai Xiaofei stopped to make a short speech. His voice boosted by origin energy got to everyone clearly.</p> 
 <p>The next second, the students’ reply echoed neatly.</p> 
 <p>“Please rest assured!”</p> 
 <p>Then, the area fell silent as their eyes quietly followed Bai Xiaofei’s group.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go!” Bai Xiaofei proceeded with a smile.</p>
