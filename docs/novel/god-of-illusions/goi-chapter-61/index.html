<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>Wu Chi was still the deserving number one. Not only was this fellow good at fighting, he could take a beating. Most importantly, as the possessor of the Heavenly Origin Physique, his Origin Energy was so tremendous it far exceeded their imagination. No matter if it was utilized in defense or attack, it was rather sharp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Wu Chi, the person ranked at the second was Xu Chen from amongst the females. As an Onslaught Stream puppet master, her natural talent in close quarter combat was fairly formidable, and she belonged to the type that possessed a formidable comprehensive ability.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the two of them was a few groups with equivalent strengths. Amongst them was Wang Hang and Zhu Si’si who represented swiftness as they were often able to rely on their speed to take actions that were of strategic importance. Besides them, Ming One, Ming Two, and Shi Kui steadiness caused them to be very suitable to draw fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Transformation Stream puppet master Qi Wei was also a candidate for swiftness, but her endurance was inferior to Wang Hang and Zhu Si’si, so she could only settle for a lower position. Duan Yi’yi, Xing Nan, and Bai Xiaofei revealed comparatively formidable natural talent instead. Even though they were always getting bashed during the battle, their improvement every single time was exceedingly obvious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for the remaining people, they’d fallen to an inferior position. Even though they were bashed heavily every single time, when compared to the others, their improvement was truly slow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, according to what Xue Ying said, they would be fine after they get beaten for a period of time….</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 15 of them dragged their bodies that were covered in injuries as they relied on themselves to make and eat a full meal, and then they returned to their tents to sleep for a while before they were woken by Xue Ying who seemed to never get tired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The destination this time was the square in the academy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike the first two times, all of them were entirely experienced this time, whereas, the other people on the square were already slightly accustomed to this scene. Even though there were still people that would stop and look at them who were sweating profusely on the square, this sort of people had already become few when compared to the first day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mo Ka! Stop f*cking falling behind, how many more times do you want to get beaten?” After they completed the group assignment, Bai Xiaofei’s group of seven started their extra assignment, and Mo Ka who couldn’t endure it any longer once again was cursed at by Bai Xiaofei, and then he started dashing madly with all his might.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duan Yi’yi, Fang Ye, and Zhu Nuo who similarly didn’t have much better endurances gritted their teeth as they forcefully endured it because Xue Ying’s requirement this time wasn’t just in terms of the number of rounds but speed as well!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s the final round. Duan Yi’yi, Fang Ye, Mo Ka, and Zhu Nuo, if all four of you are still unable to keep up, then there’ll be two more rounds for all of you after this!!” Xue Ying’s voice was like a voice that urged them on, but the four of them were really out of strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai Xiaofei, you three are not allowed to help!” Bai Xiaofei had just put up his hand and hadn’t even brought them forward by two steps when Xue Ying had directly interrupted him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t forget what all of you told me yesterday. If you want to follow me, then catch up to me!” Bai Xiaofei who was gasping for breath sped up once more, whereas, Fang Ye and Mo Ka tried their best to mobilize the last remaining Origin Energy within their body to be the power that moved their legs for the final sprint.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, reality was brutal. When Bai Xiaofei’s group of three passed through the finish line, Fang Ye and the others still had half a round to complete.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re not allowed to stop, continue for another two more rounds!” Xue Ying’s voice resounded out. Even though they were already exhausted, not a single one of them spoke out with a complaint, and they gritted their teeth tightly while continuing the assignment they ought to finish….</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the four of them stopped, the sun had already set completely, and during the process, for the sake of cheering the four of them all, everyone else that had completed the assignment had practically shouted to the point they tore open their throats.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I swear that from today onward, I won’t f*cking fall behind ever again!!!” As he lay on the ground, Mo Ka whose entire body was limp roared loudly, and under his lead, Fang Ye roared madly as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m the f*cking same!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me too!!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>No one had expected that Duan Yi’yi who’d always been shy and didn’t dare speak loudly would actually shout as well, and her fine voice was even more penetrative than Mo Ka and Fang ye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me too!!” Zhu Nuo refused to be outdone, and after they finished shouting, an unprecedented relaxed feeling gushed into their hearts at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, are all of you mad? What the f*ck are all of you shouting here at night for?” A pair of seniors that wore first year uniforms just happened to pass by, and the male student cursed bluntly because he seemed to want to display his power and prestige.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, that ignorant fool over there, who’re you talking about?” Bai Xiaofei stood up at the first possible moment, and he directly walked over to greet the senior that was half a head taller than him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Junior, are you talking to me?” His icy cold voice was instantly raised up as the senior walked over because he refused to be outdone. At the same time, he’d already decided to teach this new student a lesson.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The senior sister by the senior’s side didn’t stop him, and she grinned as she watched this show that was about to be performed by her boyfriend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, both of them were going to be disappointed this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Exactly. I’m talking about you, you piece of trash whose head is full of shit and can only talk shit!” Bai Xiaofei walked over to face the senior before letting loose a string of curses, and he directly cursed the senior to the point the senior was slightly stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re f*cking courting….” He hadn’t spoken the word death when Bai Xiaofei’s right leg that was coiled with Origin Energy had already kicked heavily onto the area between the senior’s legs. Without any suspense, the senior directly knelt on the ground in pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you teacher teach you to beat the person down before expressing your thoughts?” As he held onto the senior’s chin and raised it up so the senior could look at him, bai Xiaofei’s ferocious expression caused him to seem as if he would eat someone up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let go of my husband!” The woman that intended to watch the show shouted loudly as she held a sword shaped puppet in her hand and stabbed it directly at Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, before she could even approach Bai Xiaofei, a figure had already appeared before her a step earlier and directly held onto the Origin Energy convergence point on her right hand that held the puppet. Lin Li exerted strength slightly, causing the senior sister’s puppet to instantly fall out of her hand, and in the next second, a clear and resounding slap directly swung her down to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get… away from him!” For the first time, everyone saw an expression of rage appear on Lin Li’s face, and that slap from before was the most resounding slap they’d ever heard, causing half of the senior sister’s face to swell up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Remember, we’re the new students from the Savage Class. If you’re unhappy, then you can bring people over at any time. No matter how many you bring, we refuse nobody!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like this, a Proficient Rank Illusion Stream puppet master forcefully beat a Master Rank senior from the Sword of Assault to the point of not daring to talk back!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, all of them couldn’t help but recall the words Xue Ying told them on the first day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how strong you are, if you don’t have the chance to utilize that strength, then you’re just an ordinary person!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now, Bai Xiaofei had used facts to prove this once again!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After this small incident, the members of the Savage Class stepped on the road to return to their outdoor campsite once more, and this time, all of them were in high spirits!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Fei, I think we ought to think of a resounding slogan that’s worth of our class, and we can shout it every time we do something. What do you think?” Mo Ka who was like a dead dog just a minute ago was suddenly filled with spirit once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, this isn’t bad!” As the representative of the girls, Xu Chen was the first to second this idea, and the eyes of the boys glowed as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t ask me about this, we have to ask our Big Sister Xue!” Bai Xiaofei didn’t dare neglect Xue Ying because the slightest carelessness might cause him to be played to death by her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t have any objections, just don’t make it sound too unpleasant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A long time after Xue Ying went silent, Bai Xiaofei revealed an expression of being in deep contemplation as well, and Bai Xiaofei stopped the second before they strode through the academy’s entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve got it.” Bai Xiaofei paused for a moment, and when the gazes of every had converged over, he took a glance at all of them before he spoke once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Conquer, not conquered!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The slogan that resounded throughout Starnet Academy started from this moment! </span></p>
