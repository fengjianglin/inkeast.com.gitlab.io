 <p>Chapter 904: Bai Xiaofei Has Changed?</p> 
 <p>Despite the decent sound insulation of the Moon Beck Pavilion, the noise from the room where Bai Xiaofei was could be faintly heard. The princes, who had no intention of eavesdropping, were forced to listen to it.</p> 
 <p>“Lil’ Brother Bai really couldn’t resist! Our intel was spot on!” exclaimed Ling Ming.</p> 
 <p>However, the rest thought otherwise.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t think it’s his problem, it’s that woman. She’s not simple at all. Neither the most beautiful nor the most attractive performer tonight, but she attracted Brother Bai’s attention as soon as she appeared,” Ling Hai commented and gazed at Ling Zong. “Sixth Brother, where did you find her?”</p> 
 <p>Facing this sudden question, Ling Zong looked embarrassed. “In fact, I didn’t find her, she came to me…”</p> 
 <p>The faces of his four brothers abruptly changed.</p> 
 <p>“What?! She came to you?! Did you investigate her?!” Ling Yue urgently asked.</p> 
 <p>Ling Zong nervously replied, “Big Brother, don’t worry, I investigated her. She has always been an Ethereal person, a daughter of a small merchant group’s president. She has always admired Brother Bai so she followed her father’s group when they came to the imperial city to import goods. I came across her when I was investigating Brother Bai and happened to talk about it. She said that she can help us keep him.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Ling Yue relaxed and said with a sigh, “As long as that’s the case. We want to keep Brother Bai, not harm him. Otherwise, we will be sinners.”</p> 
 <p>At that time, the madam group returned.</p> 
 <p>“Where is Bai Xiaofei?!” Tan Xin instantly jittered when she scanned the group without seeing Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“My father summoned him. He may not come back tonight,” replied Ling Yue with a straight face.</p> 
 <p>Ling Fan nearly couldn’t hold back. <em>‘May?’ He’s certainly not coming back! From the noise they’re making, they won’t be done until dawn!</em></p> 
 <p>“Didn’t you all say the Moon Beck Pavilion is a proper place, what is that noise I’m hearing?” Tan Xin snorted.</p> 
 <p>“A VVIP, can’t say,” said Ling Zong in a hushed voice.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin inwardly mocked, <em>VVIP? There’s actually someone who’s bigger than you in this kind of place?</em></p> 
 <p>“Let’s all go back and rest. Don’t forget our agreement. Father hopes that before he leaves, one of us will inherit his position with the rest still here,” Ling Yue concluded the night.</p> 
 <p>Everyone grew serious. In the following days, they would be rivals the next time they met!</p> 
 <p>After the last peaceful night before the throne competition passed, Bai Xiaofei slowly opened his eyes at noon, startled to feel the soft sensation beside him.</p> 
 <p>“You are finally awake.” Ni Xue smirked. Seeing him about to move, she frowned slightly. “Don’t move, I’m not feeling well now.”</p> 
 <p>“Didn’t you wake up long ago? Why are you still naked?” Bai Xiaofei suddenly blurted out a question that obviously asked for a beating.</p> 
 <p>However, Ni Xue didn’t seem to care. She stubbornly gazed at him. “I want to feel your existence, can’t I?”</p> 
 <p>“You don’t regret it?”</p> 
 <p>“I’ll never regret it,” replied Ni Xue very seriously, but the next second, she regretted it…</p> 
 <p>Forty minutes later, Bai Xiaofei got up and dressed.</p> 
 <p>“Hey! Don’t even think of leaving me behind after putting on your pants! I am your woman now!” Ni Xue endured the soreness and supported herself up, glaring daggers at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“You have two choices: Either wait here for me to come to see you every day, or come with me. But the latter will be very dangerous during this period,” Bai Xiaofei cut to the chase.</p> 
 <p>“I choose the second! I won’t be in danger with you around!” The dark cloud on her face was immediately replaced by a smile of sincere happiness.</p> 
 <p>“Then eat this.” Bai Xiaofei took out a brocade box, in which lay a fragrant pill.</p> 
 <p>After getting financial support from Lan Qiushuang, Bai Xiaofei refilled his supply of necessary pills that he seldom used but the people around him did.</p> 
 <p>“A grade six pill? You are really generous!” Ni Xue exclaimed, but tossed it into her mouth like it was cheap candy.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t buy any medicine of low efficiency. I think you’re the same, going to such lengths just to set me up,” Bai Xiaofei said as he shot her a deep look.</p> 
 <p>For some reason, Ni Xue felt that he had become a different person. In her expectations, this should not be his reaction after waking up.</p> 
 <p>“So what?! You have a problem?!” Ni Xue stubbornly raised her head, obviously forgetting to keep up her gentle image.</p> 
 <p>“Now that’s better. You’re not that kind of gentle and soft girl, why hide it, right? Wearing a disguise is too tiring.” Bai Xiaofei smiled.</p> 
 <p>Ni Xue didn’t know if he said this with any implications, but her heart quivered upon hearing it.</p> 
 <p><em>Dammit… I was too excited and forgot…</em></p> 
 <p>“This young lady is a natural and she can master any personality. Do you want me to do a sexy one?” Ni Xue bit her lips and her eyes flashed with an enchanting glint.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, or I’m afraid you’d have to take more medicine later.” Bai Xiaofei chortled.</p> 
 <p>This effectively scared Ni Xue into dropping her act. Glaring at him, she yelped, “Sure enough, you are a pervert just like the rumors say!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei wasn’t fazed. “I’ve never said that I am a gentleman and anyone who would say that doesn’t know me at all. I prefer to be a lowly person. That’s much more comfortable and I can do whatever I want,” he said and extended his hand toward Ni Xue. “Let’s go, whatever happens next will go down in history. You are blessed to be a witness.”</p> 
 <p>“I have to keep my eyes peeled then!” Ni Xue put her hand on his and a happy smile bloomed on her face.</p> 
 <p>“You better. It’s going to be magnificent!”</p>
