 <p>Chapter 848: Little Surprise!</p> 
 <p>“So, what do you mean by a weakened state?” After understanding Tan Xin’s ability, Bai Xiaofei could not understand how she could be weakened at all.</p> 
 <p>“I’ve only gotten my own ability back, so my divided soul has just begun to fuse. I can only beat those who aren’t very strong at the moment. When the fusion reaches a certain extent, the energy I can use will start decreasing until the process completes.” Tan Xin did not hide anything from Bai Xiaofei. After all, she made this choice partly for him…</p> 
 <p>“Alright, then just leave it to me. I’m very powerful now!” Bai Xiaofei chuckled and stroked her head… <em>Damn, why am I starting to feel addicted to this?</em></p> 
 <p>“Now, what are you going to do here?” Getting back to the topic at hand, Tan Xin’s eyes twinkled curiously. She could see through his little tricks, but it was different when it came to the bigger picture. After all, in her previous team, what she had always lacked was a brain like Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“It’s hard to explain in words, just watch.” Bai Xiaofei smiled and continued to stroke her hair. Facts proved that not only cats could make people addicted to stroking. Sometimes, people could be fluffy…</p> 
 <p>When one waited with company, three hours did not feel too long. When Chu Liang stood in front of them again, Tan Xin clearly felt that he was different.</p> 
 <p>“Young Miss, it’s all handled,” Chu Liang was ready to make a long report, but he had overthought it.</p> 
 <p>“From now on, you’ll take over the business here. You should have figured my style to some extent. What you have to do is replace all the people who don’t conform to this style and choose new candidates from those people in the hall. I believe they won’t let you down,” said Bai Xiaofei indifferently.</p> 
 <p>Chu Liang was stunned. “Miss, don’t you want to know how they are?” he voiced his doubts and looked up at Bai Xiaofei with trepidation, only to see an expression that he would never forget in his life.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t think you’re the type who will leave potential future trouble for yourself. Are you?”</p> 
 <p>With that, the topic ended. Chu Liang withdrew from the room with his mentality climbing another level. Sometimes, it was just that simple for a person to transform. Chu Liang had ambition and talent, he only lacked a boss that could bring them out!</p> 
 <p>“You’re letting the business branch return to normal operation?” Tan Xin understood what Bai Xiaofei was doing but did not understand the intent. She originally thought he would destroy everything here.</p> 
 <p>“Vivid Wing is still Vivid Wing after all. Not to mention the Yun family, even I am not qualified to confront this behemoth. However, they definitely don’t care about who runs this small branch. As long as it operates normally, I don’t think they will look for me for trouble,” Bai Xiaofei said and took out his Starnet Brilliance.</p> 
 <p>“What are you…” Tan Xin was dumbfounded. Although she knew what the Starnet Brilliance was, she didn’t know what role it could play in the matter.</p> 
 <p>“As I said, Vivid Wing is Vivid Wing at the end of the day. Even if they don’t really care about that bastard, they still need face. Therefore, in order to completely calm this matter, I must give them a reasonable way out. Maintaining the branch’s normal operation is not enough.”</p> 
 <p>He took out a pen and wrote a long letter, and stamped it with the Starnet Brilliance, leaving the item’s unique energy fluctuation on the paper.</p> 
 <p>“All done. If there’s no surprise, the matter here should be handled.” Bai Xiaofei put Tan Xin down and stretched his body.</p> 
 <p>“But what if there are surprises?” Tan Xin’s living environment had given her the habit of considering the worst-case scenario.</p> 
 <p>“In my case, there are no surprises.” Bai Xiaofei smiled as he reverted back to his own appearance before marching out of the room. There was only one last step, and then everything would be done!</p> 
 <p>Leaving the manor, Bai Xiaofei took Tan Xin all the way back to the Yun family’s residence. The entire family was on edge waiting for a result with the fat branch president’s matter.</p> 
 <p>“Yun Ye, you bastard, get out here!!” shouted Bai Xiaofei, who had assumed the branch president’s appearance outside the gates of the Yun house. Tan Xin had also transformed into a burly bodyguard.</p> 
 <p>Before long, the gates opened and a big group of people rushed out with Yun Ye right behind them.</p> 
 <p>“You old bastard. You actually dared to find someone to deal with me! I see you are all tired of living!!!” Bai Xiaofei said coldly, accurately acting furious.</p> 
 <p>“Instead of giving my daughter to someone like you and regret it for life, this old man now thinks this is a better choice. Moreover, there is no fear of death in my Yun family!”</p> 
 <p>Yun Ye showed no fear at all. None of the family servants protecting him retreated either.</p> 
 <p>“It’s just a pity for that little brother, he just wanted to help us.” Yun Ye sighed, then stared intently at Bai Xiaofei and declared, “Come, let this old man see how much weight your so-called major merchant group has!”</p> 
 <p>Yun Ye took out a pill from his chest pocket and stuffed it into his mouth without hesitation. No one noticed that at that time both Bai Xiaofei’s and Tan Xin’s hands twitched a little.</p> 
 <p>After taking the pill, Yun Ye suddenly became a lot younger. His body that could be regarded as healthy directly improved to that of a Martial Master! He rushed straight toward Bai Xiaofei, and behind him was the entire Yun family.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, their opponent was Tan Xin…</p> 
 <p>The ground turned into a soft swamp. After everyone was caught dead in it, Tan Xin solidified the ground and had them all under control.</p> 
 <p>“Old man, die!” Bai Xiaofei declared and walked slowly towards Yun Ye.</p> 
 <p>Right at that time, two figures rushed out of the gate and stood in front of Yun Ye.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t! Please, please don’t! Leave my father alone! I’ll go with you!!”</p> 
 <p>Yun Ni knelt in front of Bai Xiaofei, bawling like a baby. Next to her was He Chang, whose body was covered in gunpowder, and he was holding a fire source in his hand.</p> 
 <p>“Why did you two return?! I told you to go as far as you can!! Now his death is all in vain!!” shouted Yun Ye.</p> 
 <p>The next second, a calm voice made everyone freeze in shock.</p> 
 <p>“Old man, you think too much. How could I die?” Laughing playfully, Bai Xiaofei changed back to his original appearance. “Just a little surprise, I hope it didn’t scare you.”</p>
