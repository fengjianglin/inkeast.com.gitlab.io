 <p>Chapter 845: Beating the Dogs?!</p> 
 <p>Without absolutely any scruples and mercy, Tan Xin stepped on the fat man’s ‘eggs.’ After a tragic scream, he passed out.</p> 
 <p>“According to your idea that puppet masters can bully ordinary people at will, it should be reasonable for higher-ranked puppet masters to crush you,” said Bai Xiaofei indifferently as he stepped down from the carriage.</p> 
 <p>Sure enough, fish begin to stink at the head. It was no wonder those puppet masters acted that way when they worked for such an outrageous president.</p> 
 <p>“Carry him in and call everyone here to the lobby,” Bai Xiaofei ordered the three puppet masters, obviously making himself the master of the place.</p> 
 <p>After exchanging glances, the three puppet masters chose to obey. If nothing else, Tan Xin’s words just now were already enough to scare them witless. Not a single person in their entire branch was a match for an Exquisite Rank puppet master!</p> 
 <p><em>We picked on the wrong people…</em></p> 
 <p>Their hearts sank as they carried out Bai Xiaofei’s order. One led Bai Xiaofei to the lobby and the other two called the people in the residence over. Around thirty minutes later, everyone gathered.</p> 
 <p>“What terribly low efficiency. Thirty minutes is enough for me to kill you all.” Bai Xiaofei settled into the head of the family’s seat as he looked down at the people in the hall, the word ‘impatience’ written all over his face.</p> 
 <p>“Who are you?! Where is my husband?!” A middle-aged woman viciously glared at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p><em>Bang!</em> A slap landed on her face.</p> 
 <p>“Pay attention when you talk to our young miss, or else, I don’t mind tearing off your mouth,” said Tan Xin emotionlessly as she looked down at the woman who had been slapped sprawling on the floor.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, no need to reason with a group of rubbish. Today is the last day they can jump around anyway,” Bai Xiaofei stopped Tan Xin, then said to the crowd in the hall. “Since you are all here, I will announce a few things.”</p> 
 <p>He waved his hand, and one of the puppet masters lifted up the branch president.</p> 
 <p>“First, he is now crippled, so this family and the branch need a new steward.”</p> 
 <p>“Second, for the next three days, I will be staying here. During this time, I don’t want to hear any voices of disobedience.”</p> 
 <p>“Third, you all go to your rooms and bring all of your valuable items over here. I want an inventory.”</p> 
 <p>“Fourth, if you disagree with the three articles above, step out now.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei scanned everyone. For a moment, no one dared to breathe loudly.</p> 
 <p>“Since no one has a problem, move. You only have ten minutes this time. If anyone fails to return in ten minutes, they can scram out of this house.”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Bai Xiaofei’s voice fell, the residents quickly glanced at each other before leaving in a hurry one after another, except for the unconscious branch president.</p> 
 <p>“Wake him up.” Bai Xiaofei pointed to the president as he looked at the puppet masters, who were at a loss of what to do.</p> 
 <p>With the help of the puppet masters, the president quickly woke up. The moment he did, the pain from his injured ‘eggs’ drew cold sweat from all over his body.</p> 
 <p>“If you don’t want anything else crushed, keep your mouth shut. Your voice annoys me.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing Bai Xiaofei’s icy voice, the president’s heart jerked. Having learned his lesson, he looked at Bai Xiaofei with fury in his eyes but did not dare to utter a sound.</p> 
 <p>One had to bow when they were under another’s roof, and never could the branch president imagine that Bai Xiaofei’s arrival would turn his house into that roof.</p> 
 <p>Getting up from his chair, Bai Xiaofei walked slowly to the president, squatted down, and asked with great interest, “Does it feel good to be bullied?”</p> 
 <p>Only now did the branch president finally realize one thing. <em>This is not Yun Ni!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Who the hell are you??!” Enduring the pain, the man squeezed out the question he wanted to know most.</p> 
 <p>“Me? I am Yun Ni. I’m afraid you never thought about how much change you could bring to us ordinary people. Oh, maybe you never expected that such a change could make you this uncomfortable.” Bai Xiaofei stood up with a cold smile. “You must have done a lot of similar things over the years. In other words, you have brought despair to many people. Today, I will let you feel what it’s like!”</p> 
 <p>Then, he went back to the head seat.</p> 
 <p>After ten minutes, the residents returned with their valuables with pain on their faces. For them, there was nothing worse than being asked for money.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Bai Xiaofei shook his head. Their expressions were not right, it should be despair instead. However, he liked this. It would be boring if they really acted as one would expect!</p> 
 <p>“Ten minutes are up. From this moment on, throw anyone who steps in here out of the house. If they refuse to leave, you can use any means,” Bai Xiaofei ordered the three puppet masters.</p> 
 <p>The order troubled the three men. Those who had not returned were the immediate family members of the branch president: his wives, sons, and daughters…</p> 
 <p>At that moment, someone approached the room.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s faint voice sounded, “Don’t you understand what I just said?”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Tan Xin’s aura was fully released. The three puppet masters’ necks shrank in fear, and they understood one thing. What would happen later was not something they should consider now. If they wanted to live, the only choice was to obey!</p> 
 <p>The next second, the three men moved and stopped the new arrival at the door.</p> 
 <p>“First Young Master, there is no longer room for you in this house,” one of the three used the arrogant tone he used to use, but this time on his former master.</p> 
 <p>“You are but three stupid dogs! You really think we can’t handle that little b*tch?!” said the First young master.</p> 
 <p>Right then, two figures suddenly appeared in front of the three puppet masters, both their speed and energy fluctuations far exceeded the three.</p> 
 <p><em>We’re dead…</em></p> 
 <p>These were the three puppet masters’ thoughts when they felt the fluctuation from the two attackers. However, the pain they imagined did not come.</p> 
 <p>“Never heard of ‘checking the owner before you beat the dogs,’ have you?”</p>
