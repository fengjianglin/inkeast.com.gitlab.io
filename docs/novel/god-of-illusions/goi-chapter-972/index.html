 <p>Chapter 972: You Stay!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei then turned to the emperor, his eyes burning with fighting spirit. “I, Fickle Bai, am willing to go to the border!”</p> 
 <p>Zhu Chunyang immediately followed suit. “I, Zhu Chunyang, am willing to go to the border!”</p> 
 <p>Then, the whole courtyard fell into several seconds of silence…</p> 
 <p>Until Zhuang Shuo gritted his teeth and stepped forward. “Boss, I’ll leave my life in your hands! I, Zhuang Shuo, am willing to go to the border!”</p> 
 <p>With Zhuang Shuo taking the lead, many wavering hearts were hit by an urge to follow. One by one, they started to say what the emperor wanted to hear most. In just a few minutes, all the muscular men made a seemingly crazy decision.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei felt his nose tingle. While this was his wish and his plan, the feeling of having so many people entrusting their lives to him was just indescribable. At this moment, what they believed in was not Moonlight, not their high-above emperor, but him, Bai Xiaofei!</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the rest of the contestants weren’t so impulsive. They only made their choice after careful consideration.</p> 
 <p>And not everyone was scared, they all had their own thoughts. If Bai Xiaofei weren’t here, they might have chosen to go to the border, but now that he had taken the lead, they would at best be a green leaf to the rose if they made the same choice, which wasn’t what they wanted.</p> 
 <p>Those who chose to leave were soon escorted out by the soldiers, while Bai Xiaofei’s group was looking at the emperor with resolute eyes.</p> 
 <p>“Your Majesty, we have already made our choice. What do we need to do next?” Bai Xiaofei asked, having become the leader of the remaining contestants.</p> 
 <p>“I just need you to keep your spirits up. Tomorrow, I will give you a pleasant surprise,” said the emperor as she stared intently as if wanting to dig something out of him. “Tong Tong, arrange a place to rest for them.”</p> 
 <p>The emperor turned around before leaving another sentence.</p> 
 <p>“Fickle Bai, you stay. I wish to talk to you in private.”</p> 
 <p>With that, she disappeared from the yard with her attendants, leaving the contestants gaping in shock.</p> 
 <p>“Oh heavens! Boss! You are formidable! You’re gonna be the imperial husband!” Zhuang Shuo couldn’t resist yelling out.</p> 
 <p>The rest of the group also surrounded Bai Xiaofei and began to talk nonsense out of excitement. In their view, Bai Xiaofei getting a great reward meant theirs wouldn’t be bad either, which had been proved by his actions before. He had no habit of leaving his own people behind.</p> 
 <p>“Be quiet. There are still other people here!” Bai Xiaofei scolded and glanced at Ye Tong, only to see her staring at him as if wanting to eat him alive.</p> 
 <p>“I tell you, my sister absolutely won’t like you! You are not allowed to have any far-fetched ideas about her!” Ye Tong said coldly. However, she was inwardly panicking.</p> 
 <p>“I can’t say for sure. You’d better be ready to call me brother-in-law. I’m just too attractive to women!” Bai Xiaofei taunted and burst out laughing. Ignoring Ye Tong, who was stomping her foot in fury, he walked in the direction that the emperor had left.</p> 
 <p>“What are you looking at?! Look again and I’ll gouge your eyes out!” Ye Tong vented her anger on Zhuang Shuo’s group, who she deemed to be birds of a feather with Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>“Her Majesty is waiting for you inside,” said the guard who led Bai Xiaofei to a luxurious building, her attitude amiable.</p> 
 <p>Bai Fei didn’t think much about it. He opened the door and as soon as he entered the room, a burst of aroma poured into his nostrils. He instinctively gulped and his heart started to beat violently.</p> 
 <p><em>Hell, don’t tell me this is her sleeping chamber…</em></p> 
 <p>“I heard that you’re very brave, how come you’re so timid now? Am I that scary?” the emperor’s voice rang out, before the very person walked out wearing only a long dress. Most importantly, she was without her veil.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had seen countless beauties, but her face still put him into a trance. The rumors turned out to be true!</p> 
 <p>In terms of appearance, the only one he knew could rival her was Lin Li. However, the Moonlight emperor’s mature and noble temperament gave her a charm that Lin Li, who was young and unfledged, could not compare.</p> 
 <p>“Sure enough, you are still a man.” The emperor chuckled at Bai Xiaofei’s reaction, but with a hint of sarcasm and disappointment.</p> 
 <p>“Of course, but it may be a little different from the ‘man’ you understand. Some instincts can’t be controlled, but things other than instincts can be.” Bai Xiaofei quickly calmed down. He had important business to do.</p> 
 <p>“You are not from Moonlight, but you seem to be very concerned about our affairs.” The emperor smiled.</p> 
 <p>“No, but you can rest assured that I bear no ill will, because I need two favors from you.” Bai Xiaofei had no intention to hide anything.</p> 
 <p>“Oh? Tell me about it.” The emperor sat down and tilted her head to look at Bai Xiaofei with great interest.</p> 
 <p>“What is Qing’er’s situation?” Bai Xiaofei asked his most concerning question, his face solemn.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this name, the emperor’s expression froze a little and she frowned. “You are the heartbreaker?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s heart dropped. <em>Damn it, how the hell am I a heartbreaker now? I didn’t know what was going on before!</em></p> 
 <p>“Well… That may be a misunderstanding. If I had known about her situation, you might have seen me much earlier,” Bai Xiaofei bit the bullet and explained. After all, the conversation needed to continue…</p> 
 <p>“I can only guarantee that she will not die, but if you want to cure her completely, you need the Revival Grass,” replied the emperor.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was stunned. “You don’t have the grass?!” he exclaimed.</p> 
 <p>“I never said that I have it. I just know where it is.” The emperor couldn’t help but laugh. “I was worried that you wouldn’t do your best when you get to the border, but now it seems my worry is redundant.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was stunned again by these words. After pondering a little, his brows creased.</p> 
 <p>“The Sacks have it?!”</p>
