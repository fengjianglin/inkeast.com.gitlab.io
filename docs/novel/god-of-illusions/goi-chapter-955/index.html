 <p>Chapter 955: The Royal Family Name!</p> 
 <p>“Did you expect this situation?” Looking at the few men who had chosen the second option, Zhu Chunyang couldn’t help but gulp.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, but I didn’t think it would be this bad. Looks like Moonlight women are not entirely to blame that the men are like this. Even they look down on themselves,” said Bai Xiaofei with a sigh.</p> 
 <p>He had thought that Moonlight men ended up in the present situation because they had been suppressed by women, but it seemed that it had something to do with themselves. When a man didn’t want to shoulder any pressure, perhaps this state was more suitable for him.</p> 
 <p>Coming to terms with this fact, Bai Xiaofei gathered his thoughts and looked at the over two dozen men who had chosen to stay. <em>At least some are still willing to make changes!</em></p> 
 <p>“Let me introduce myself: I am Fickle Bai. Believe me, you will see miracles,” Bai Xiaofei said with a smile, which was also to reassure himself, before he pulled out a flare.</p> 
 <p>Soon, there were sounds of galloping and three men appeared on fast horses.</p> 
 <p>“Greetings, Adviser!”</p> 
 <p>It was none other than the bandits from Black Dragon Swarm…</p> 
 <p>After losing the bet with Bai Xiaofei, Ye Qingtong had set out toward the capital with her people according to their agreement. Along the way, she had been keeping an eye on Bai Xiaofei and naturally knew that he had been captured, but never had any intention to save him.</p> 
 <p>In the words of the several bandit leaders, if Bai Xiaofei couldn’t solve this small problem, they could just go back and continue to be mountain bandits.</p> 
 <p>‘Advisor’ was the role that Ye Qingtong assigned to Bai Xiaofei, an identity that no one in the Black Dragon Swarm was a stranger to since they had all been to the battlefield.</p> 
 <p>“Take these people with you. They will be fighting alongside us in the near future. Ask Sister Qingtong to teach them whatever they should know and must know,” Bai Xiaofei told the three bandits, inwardly pleased by the title ‘Advisor’ as this was the first time he had been called this.</p> 
 <p>The three assented in unison and left with the men, taking them to their temporary camp.</p> 
 <p>“Just now was…” Zhu Chunyang directed a puzzled look at Bai Xiaofei. He could see that the three bandits were definitely people from Moonlight, but he couldn’t recall any men-centric troops in the empire.</p> 
 <p>“Have you ever heard of the Black Dragon Swarm?” Bai Xiaofei asked with a proud expression. In Moonlight, the Black Dragon Swarm was definitely a famous band of bandits.</p> 
 <p>“Ye Qingtong?!” exclaimed Zhu Chunyang.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei’s eyes lit up. “You know Sister Qingtong?!”</p> 
 <p>Unexpectedly, this question drew a frown from Zhu Chunyang. “If it’s any other band, I wouldn’t know, but it’s hard not to know the one that is led by Ye Qingtong.” He then looked seriously at Bai Xiaofei. “You don’t know what the surname ‘Ye’ means in Moonlight, do you?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was stunned. He really never paid attention before. It was not just Ye Qingtong, there was also Ye Xi, Ye Tong. Somehow, after he came to Moonlight, all the girls he had a beef with were all surnamed Ye.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t tell me it’s some noble surname,” he said as he recalled their stories. One was a down-and-out general, one a bandit leader, and one an extremist. No matter how he looked at it, they did not seem to be related at all.</p> 
 <p>“Brother, it’s not that simple!” Zhu Chunyang shook his head with a wry smile. “Let me just tell you one thing, the emperor’s name is Ye Qingcheng!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei’s eyebrows instantly touched. <em>If Ye is Moonlight’s royal family name, then what’s the situation with those three?!!</em></p> 
 <p>“It seems that you really don’t know anything. Guess I have to acquaint you with the basic knowledge of Moonlight.”</p> 
 <p>Clearing this throat, Zhu Chunyang started.</p> 
 <p>“The previous emperor has four daughters. The eldest Ye Qingcheng is an absolute beauty who excels in both civil and military affairs, and therefore inherited the position of emperor.”</p> 
 <p>“The second Ye Xi and the third Ye Qingtong are unparalleled in martial arts. Both went to the border and became generals.”</p> 
 <p>“While there, Ye Qingtong’s troops were ambushed and annihilated in a battle. It’s unknown who saved her, but everyone knows that after the incident, she led a group of border servants to become despised mountain bandits and they have even repelled officials and armies many times.”</p> 
 <p>“Ye Xi also lost at the border not long ago and the main force suffered a great setback. She took all the blame upon herself and was removed from her general position, and became the Minister of Internal Affairs.”</p> 
 <p>“Ye Tong, the fourth daughter, is funny, eccentric, and for some strange reason, hates men. After Ye Qingtong left the capital, she also left with a group of people who share the same mindset and set up an extremist servant management office, which is the place where we were detained.”</p> 
 <p>Upon mentioning Ye Tong, Zhu Chunyang had a blissful smile on his face. The hardest love was not between life and death, but knowing that he would die miserably yet still worked tirelessly to approach her.</p> 
 <p>However, it had to be said that this kind of pursuit was a great pleasure for many men. To put it simply, Zhu Chunyang was a masochist…</p> 
 <p>“You… especially investigated this matter?” Bai Xiaofei turned his focus to Zhu Chunyang.</p> 
 <p>“Much more than just an investigation! I can’t say that I know about the Ye sisters like the back of my hand, but anything that an outsider could know, I would absolutely know!” Zhu Chunyang shook his fist and raised an eyebrow at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“So you know that you’re still just an outsider,” Bai Xiaofei mocked.</p> 
 <p>This was a knife to Zhu Chunyang’s heart, nearly choking him to death. After half a day, he declared, “I will marry Tong’er sooner or later!”</p> 
 <p>“So, that’s why you ran all the way here to be taken to the extremist servant management office when you could just be a good king?” Bai Xiaofei took out a translucent jade token, on which was engraved two impressively written words. “Heavenly Star, the 17th-ranked kingdom whose royal surname is Zhu and whose current king recently succeeded to the throne less than two years ago.”</p> 
 <p>The confident Zhu Chunyang instantly deflated like a balloon.</p> 
 <p>“Shh! Keep it down!!”</p>
