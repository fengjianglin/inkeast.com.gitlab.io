 <p>Chapter 841: Busybody!</p> 
 <p>“Hey, let me ask you something,” Tan Xin suddenly said.</p> 
 <p>“Hmm? Say it.” The relaxed Bai Xiaofei was slightly startled.</p> 
 <p>“If my body returns to normal, will you give me a chance to really enter your life?” Tan Xin said slowly with a hint of sadness in her voice.</p> 
 <p>“Aren’t you already in my life? The kind that can’t be rid of at that,” Bai Xiaofei tried to play the fool.</p> 
 <p>However, Tan Xin did not give him any chance to dodge the matter. She reached out, turned his head toward her, and looked at him solemnly.</p> 
 <p>“You know what I’m talking about, don’t you play dumb!”</p> 
 <p>Being mercilessly exposed, Bai Xiaofei donned an awkward and polite smile, and also grew serious as he replied, “Then you have to recover first. If you are a big fat girl who can crush me, how will I dare to agree?”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Bai Xiaofei finished speaking, Tan Xin got up and kicked him flying. In his flight, he heard her voice echo,</p> 
 <p>“You wait three minutes!”</p> 
 <p>His Purple Luan wings appearing, Bai Xiaofei landed safely. Although he did not know what Tan Xin was going to do, he was happy to have three minutes of leisure.</p> 
 <p>Looking around, Bai Xiaofei witnessed for himself what was called a holy place for lovers. There were couples chasing, playing, hugging, sweet-talking to each other, and even praying together on their knees…</p> 
 <p>Everyone who came to this place only minded their own business, only having eyes on their other half. However, Bai Xiaofei soon noticed an exception.</p> 
 <p>It was a guy and girl duo not far away. The girl obviously looked amiss, while the boy was very excited.</p> 
 <p>After they made promises to each other, the girl took out the food she had prepared. As she did, Bai Xiaofei clearly saw her trembling hands and the reluctance on her face.</p> 
 <p>“Heh, interesting.” He watched with great curiosity.</p> 
 <p>A while later, the boy fainted after eating the food. The girl broke into tears and kissed his face. Before long, several servants came and took the girl back.</p> 
 <p>“Tsk, so there is a story!” Bai Xiaofei’s eyes shone as his nosy soul was ignited. Without any hesitation, he ran over to check on the boy. “Mhm, only a common knockout drug. It seems she just wanted to get away, but from her expression, she must have a difficult reason.” He mused.</p> 
 <p>At that moment, a thunderous roar echoed from behind, “Bai Xiaofei!! Where the hell have you been?!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing Tan Xin’s voice, Bai Xiaofei’s scalp tingled. <em>Damn, I totally forgot! She said three minutes, but it’s been more than ten minutes…</em></p> 
 <p>He hurriedly grabbed the boy and ran back toward her. Seeing Bai Xiaofei return, Tan Xin glared at him angrily.</p> 
 <p>“Sorry, something happened. What did you want to show me?” asked Bai Xiaofei as he looked around.</p> 
 <p>What he got was a kick to his calf. “Nothing! There is nothing left!!” Tan Xin was on the verge of erupting. She wanted to annihilate Bai Xiaofei right then and there, but her eyes fell on the boy on his shoulder.</p> 
 <p>“He is…?” she asked doubtfully.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know who he is. I was going to ask, but I have to wake him up first,” Bai Xiaofei replied and put the boy on the ground. He injected energy into the boy’s body, waking him up.</p> 
 <p>“Yun Ni!”</p> 
 <p>The boy woke up with a start, shouting the name of the girl who had just left. However, what he was greeted with was Bai Xiaofei’s big smile.</p> 
 <p>“Who are you?!” The boy repeatedly retreated in shock and fear. From his appearance, he was about seventeen or eighteen years old, much younger than Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t be nervous, I am not a bad person. If Yun Ni is the girl who was with you just now, she has left. But don’t worry! If you are willing to tell me about the two of you, I may be able to help out,” Bai Xiaofei calmly explained.</p> 
 <p>The boy froze after hearing it. Then, he started mumbling to himself in disbelief, “No… no… Yun Ni said she’d run away with me, how could she leave?! She is not that kind of person!!”</p> 
 <p>Seeing the boy’s emotions spinning out of control, Bai Xiaofei quickly put his hand on his shoulder and injected energy into his body again. The boy started to calm down.</p> 
 <p>Emotions were just a series of reactions of the body. As long as these reactions were cut off, the emotions would naturally diminish. The boy was only an ordinary person, so it was easy for Bai Xiaofei to do this.</p> 
 <p>“Who are you?” The boy looked at Bai Xiaofei in confusion. After all, Bai Xiaofei was a stranger who could not be stranger.</p> 
 <p>“How rude. Shouldn’t you state your name before asking someone else’s?” Tan Xin, who was nursing a bellyful of anger without a place to vent, immediately criticized.</p> 
 <p>“Sorry, my name is He Chang.”</p> 
 <p>After He Chang briefly introduced himself, Bai Xiaofei also stated his own name. And then, a few words from He Chang nearly caused a disaster.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai, is this your daughter? She’s very cute!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei froze in shock, then quickly turned and grabbed Tan Xin who was only a millisecond away from grabbing He Chang.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t stop me! I am going to kill him!! Chop him into ten thousand pieces!!!”</p> 
 <p>“Don’t, don’t! Calm down. Isn’t it a compliment? Why are you getting riled over a compliment?” Bai Xiaofei tried his best to stop Tan Xin. At the same time, he explained Tan Xin’s identity to He Chang.</p> 
 <p>Realizing his mistake, He Chang immediately apologized.</p> 
 <p>“Well, now that we’ve known each other, can you tell me about you and Yun Ni?” Bai Xiaofei once again looked at He Chang, his curiosity having reached its peak.</p> 
 <p>“Aii, it’s a long story.” Letting out a long sigh, He Chang looked desolate.</p> 
 <p>Affected by the atmosphere, Tan Xin gradually quieted down. Like Bai Xiaofei, she perked up her ears.</p> 
 <p>Since ancient times, the word love had always been the most painful. Moreover, Tan Xin could be considered to be ‘trapped by love’ at the moment.</p> 
 <p>They did not expect that He Chang’s story was actually quite interesting…</p>
