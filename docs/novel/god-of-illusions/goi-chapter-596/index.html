 <p>Chapter 596: The Limitation of Spiritualization!</p> 
 <p>“Can you explain? What do you mean by ‘refrain from using it’? Is this problem going to occur whenever I use Spiritualization from now on?” Bai Xiaofei urgently inquired. </p> 
 <p>Gu Xing hurriedly soothed him, “Don’t get emotional. I didn’t mean that. I mean you should try to refrain from it temporarily. Temporarily, only temporarily!”</p> 
 <p>After stressing over and over again, Gu Xing began to explain in detail.</p> 
 <p>“A normal puppet only inherits a part of its original ability, especially for the case of animate puppets. After a magical beast becomes a puppet, most of its abilities are sealed, thus unavailable. However, you should have noticed that you can use all of the puppet’s abilities when fused during Spiritualization. As long as the puppet is complete, you can even turn into that magical beast!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei nodded. Indeed, he was so powerful in the Spiritualization state because the abilities of Huskie and Blackie were unreasonably perverse. But what did that have to do with the feeling that caused him to stagger?</p> 
 <p>Casting a puzzled look, Bai Xiaofei was about to voice this question, but Gu Xing started to explain before he could ask.</p> 
 <p>“This is precisely the reason for your case! Puppets, whether animate or inanimate, will have their ranks decreased from their original, which is why their abilities are limited. However, Spiritualization lifts this restriction, so your puppets that are yellow or violet grade in normal situations will be reverted to their original ranks in the Spiritualization state and put a strain on your body.”</p> 
 <p>“My master once told me that in order to use the Spiritualization Art, a puppet master must not choose puppets whose original ranks are much higher than their own. Otherwise, if overloaded, their meridians might burst at best and they’ll die on the spot at worst!”</p> 
 <p>“So, if there’s no mistake, the original ranks of your two puppets are so high that your body can’t withstand their consumption even in the Endless state, which caused terrible damage to your body.”</p> 
 <p>After Gu Xing let it all out in one breath, Bai Xiaofei went silent. He was right, but Bai Xiaofei was unwilling to let go of this power.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know what kind of luck you came into to survive this time, but I advise you to avoid choosing your kitty and puppy for the Spiritualization Art as much as you can. Their abilities are not something you should touch for now…” Gu Xing said carefully for fear that he might poke at a sore spot.</p> 
 <p>And his concern was not unreasonable. Bai Xiaofei was feeling like sh*t right now. If it wasn’t Gu Xing who was in front of him, he’d have already exploded in fury because he felt like he had been toyed with…</p> 
 <p>“At what rank can I completely control this ability?” enduring the storm in his heart, Bai Xiaofei slowly asked.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know, maybe the Exquisite Rank, maybe the Legend Rank. I don’t know what ranks your puppets were as magical beasts, but it’s definitely not low. Moreover, reaching the right rank is still not enough to withstand their power. Your physical quality must also keep up…”</p> 
 <p><em>Physical quality must keep up? My physical level is already at the Grand Martial Master Rank and it still needs to improve? Wouldn’t that be at least the Grandmaster Rank?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Do you know how few Grandmaster martial artists are in this world?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>My body has only reached this rank after various opportunities aligned. Going further? Do I have to forsake my cultivation as a puppet master and become a martial artist?!</em></p> 
 <p>A myriad of ‘what the f*ck’ ran through Bai Xiaofei’s head as he felt like he had gone back to that time in the past when he was fooled by Revelation.</p> 
 <p><em>Why is my life so bitter? Why do I always run into such unreliable teachers?!</em></p> 
 <p>In his indescribable pain, Bai Xiaofei’s expression was that of helplessness and borderline despair. This feeling of falling just after climbing to a mountain top was truly unbearable…</p> 
 <p>“Is there no other way?” Refusing to accept his fate just like that, he asked again. </p> 
 <p>Seeing Bai Xiaofei frowning so deeply, Gu Xing flushed red in shame. After a long silence, Gu Xing actually managed to squeeze something out of his head.</p> 
 <p>“There is!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei’s eyes instantly lit up.</p> 
 <p>“What is it?!”</p> 
 <p>“You should have heard of the three legends. Your master Revelation is one, Angelic Maiden Nishang is another, and the last one is your hope!”</p> 
 <p>While Gu Xing sounded excited, his face looked troubled. If it was anyone else, even if he couldn’t help, it wouldn’t be a problem with a word from Lei Shan. But the last person of the three legends acknowledged no one…</p> 
 <p>“Please just tell me, a little hope is better than no hope. As long as there is even the slightest possibility, I’ll fight for it!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s words dispelled Gu Xing’s worries. With a long sigh, he started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“The last person in the three legends is Wine God Cang Lan, and his puppet is a violetgold called God Control. In order to perfectly cooperate with his puppet, he created a pseudo-god technique called God Control. This technique enhances the puppet master’s control over their own puppets. If you can earn his guidance, your control will advance to another level, and then you may be able to use Spiritualization sooner.”</p> 
 <p>But there came the problem.</p> 
 <p>“However, this person’s whereabouts are unpredictable. Finding him is already not an easy task. On top of that, his character is even more unpredictable than his whereabouts. He may like something one second then hate it in the next. Getting him to willingly teach the God Control technique is not any easier than training your physical quality.”</p> 
 <p>Saying this, Gu Xing carefully looked at Bai Xiaofei. His heart was filled with guilt but he didn’t know how to comfort him.</p> 
 <p>“Okay, I see. Thank you, Grandpa.” Bai Xiaofei suddenly smiled, and this smile put Gu Xing at a loss.</p> 
 <p>“Smelly boy, although the reality is not ideal, you can’t give up on yourself. It’s only a matter of time before you improve to meet the requirements. As long as you hang on there, you will be a new legend. Don’t you do anything stupid!” Gu Xing earnestly persuaded Bai Xiaofei. From what he was seeing, Bai Xiaofei was taking this too hard.</p> 
 <p>“You think too much, I’m not the kind of person who does stupid things.” His smile widening, Bai Xiaofei gave Gu Xing a reassuring look.</p> 
 <p><em>Wine God, is it? This lord is gonna learn your God Control Technique, no doubt!</em></p>
