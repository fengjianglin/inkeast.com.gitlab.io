 <p>Chapter 649: Perking Ears for The Ruins!</p> 
 <p>“Alright, alright, I won’t laugh at you. Don’t worry, there are no other major forces besides us at the moment. As long as we move fast, it’s not a difficult task to get the first slice of the cake.” Qiu Feng packed up his joking tone and grew formal as well.</p> 
 <p>“But sooner or later, we’ll have to consider this, no? I’m afraid that this first slice won’t be so easy to digest and we might even become stepping stones for the later arrivals. In addition, we don’t know much about the situation in the Kingdom of Snow. The Holy Snow Mountain is in their territory. If you can’t get it, people just let us clear the obstacles.” Bai Xiaofei spoke completely from the perspective of the Jackdaw Mercenary Group, so Qiu Feng didn’t sense anything amiss.</p> 
 <p>“As far as the situation is concerned, the strongest magical beasts on the Holy Snow Mountain are only King Rank. With the strength of our squads and the main force, they can’t pose any threat. However, we can’t rule out the possibility that there might be a stronger existence in that cave. But even then, it is not a problem to retreat safely with our ability. As for the Snow Kingdom, I don’t think we need to worry too much. There are only a few experts in their name. Unless they are willing to go to the trouble to mobilize the army, they can’t affect us.”</p> 
 <p>When Qiu Feng finished, Bai Xiaofei had already drawn up a rough idea of the current situation.</p> 
 <p>It seemed that the situation of the Holy Snow Mountain was not as complicated as he imagined. And when it wasn’t complicated, it would be more difficult to fish in troubled waters…</p> 
 <p>Thinking this, Bai Xiaofei was set on the idea of delaying the Jackdaw Mercenary Group. Now what he lacked was a detailed plan.</p> 
 <p>“Fair enough, but this is only our speculation. There’s no way to predict the variables. We have dealt with the Snow Kingdom quite a lot, especially that old geezer Neptune, he’s been hell-bent on making it difficult for us,” Bai Xiaofei complained with an aggrieved face.</p> 
 <p>Seeing him like that, Qiu Feng burst out laughing.</p> 
 <p>“What are you laughing at?” Bai Xiaofei glared.</p> 
 <p>“Who would have thought that the leader of the Jackdaw Mercenary Group holds grudges like a child? Neptune only does where his duty’s due. If he had been obedient to us, the economy of the Snow Kingdom would have collapsed. Moreover, we brought the Blood-Eye Foxes that their emperor has been offering a heavy reward for. I believe he will give us the green light, to a certain extent, of course.”</p> 
 <p>The information in Qiu Feng’s speech made Bai Xiaofei’s heart bloom with joy. He couldn’t even hide his smile. <em>Sure enough, rewards come to good people! Wanna butter up to the emperor? You’ll have to go catch some more Blood-Eye Foxes!</em></p> 
 <p>Originally a move of convenience, but now it would help Bai Xiaofei achieve his purpose.</p> 
 <p>“True. I’ve been too pessimistic,” Bai Xiaofei said and pushed the jar to Qiu Feng. “Drink! We shall not leave sober tonight!”</p> 
 <p>Qiu Feng took the jar with an evil expression. “One jar is not enough! Are you sure your capacity for liquor is still all right?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei felt a pain eating up his pocket upon these words, but he had already talked big. Moreover, he needed to get Qiu Feng unconscious, so he could only accept his fate.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I may not be good at many things, but drinking? I can outdrink you until you doubt reality!” declared Bai Xiaofei while secretly activating Devouring the Heaven and Earth. Otherwise, he didn’t know if he could really outdrink this ‘battle-hardened’ mercenary.</p> 
 <p>Just like that, the two spent the rest of the night drinking who-knew-how-many jars, during which Bai Xiaofei also pried out a great deal of information regarding the current operation of the Jackdaw Mercenary Group. He had basically figured the situation on The Ruins.</p> 
 <p>Early the next morning, Qiu Feng got up from the ground. The moment he opened his eyes and looked around, he was scared sober.</p> 
 <p><em>What the hell is going on here?! Aren’t I supposed to be in Jackdaw’s room?!</em></p> 
 <p>Looking at the group members who were still unconscious, Qiu Feng broke out into a cold sweat.</p> 
 <p>“Wake the hell up!!”</p> 
 <p>Qiu Feng’s roar fused with origin energy woke everyone from their sleep. Crawling up from bed to be greeted by Qiu Feng’s face, they were full of fear.</p> 
 <p>“Boss Qiu, what’s wrong?” asked the small captain of the room gingerly.</p> 
 <p>The frost on Qiu Feng’s face thickened. <em>What’s wrong?? You tell me what’s wrong!</em></p> 
 <p>“Did the head come here last night?” Looking at the jars on the ground, Qiu Feng asked a question that made his own back cold.</p> 
 <p>“No… probably…” the small captain swallowed with difficulty. Under the circumstance that his head was still a mess, he couldn’t give a better answer.</p> 
 <p>“What do you mean probably?! Yes or no?!” roared Qiu Feng.</p> 
 <p>The already flustered small captain panicked. “Boss Qiu, we all fell asleep last night, I really don’t know!” He was on the verge of tears. If Qiu Feng’s fury kept going like this, he would lose his job.</p> 
 <p>“Motherf*cker! I was drinking wine here all night last night, how were you lot still able to sleep?!!” Qiu Feng cursed loudly. Looking at the members with their heads down, he hated that he couldn’t just fire all of these people.</p> 
 <p>“Emergency! Emergency!!!”</p> 
 <p>Qiu Feng was huffing when a panicked voice resounded outside. He hurriedly rushed out and saw Jackdaw also appearing at the door at the same time.</p> 
 <p>The two exchanges, their eyes glinting with different lights.</p> 
 <p>Jackdaw was wondering why Qiu Feng came out from the room of the normal members, while Qiu Feng knew they were in big trouble from the first look at Jackdaw, who didn’t look any like he had been drinking all night, which meant he was drinking with some unknown person last night!</p> 
 <p>“What’s all the shouting? Is the sky falling or what?!” Jackdaw coldly shouted. The underling’s mourning face indeed looked like the sky was falling.</p> 
 <p>“Gone! Gone!!!” the underling kept shouting without providing any actual information. Driven to anger by the confusion, Qiu Feng grabbed him by the collar and lifted him up.</p> 
 <p>“Your grandma! Be damn clear for me, what is missing?!!” Being roared at in the face, the underling was jolted awake.</p> 
 <p>“Blood-Eye Foxes! The foxes are gone!”</p> 
 <p>The instant the underling finished, Qiu Feng ran to the room where the Blood-Eye Foxes were kept and kicked the door open.</p> 
 <p>The cage was broken and empty, and the foxes were nowhere to be seen.</p> 
 <p>Jackdaw also ran into the room. After seeing the cage, he froze on the spot.</p> 
 <p>“Lock down the whole inn! Immediately do a thorough search!!” roared Qiu Feng on the edge of exploding.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the culprit was sitting on the Downwind Boat with beautiful women in his arms enjoying the scenery along the way…</p>
