 <p>Chapter 960: Contestant Camp!</p> 
 <p>“Are you sure this isn’t a prison or something of that kind? Did we come to the wrong place?” Bai Xiaofei gawked in utter disbelief at the sky-tall, dark walls and heavy iron gates that were wholly integrated with a defensive formation.</p> 
 <p>“Of course not. Do you think I’d remember such a unique place wrong? But there’s one thing you are right about. This place used to be a prison, but it was abandoned later. When we decided to hold the competition, I had people clean it up to accommodate the contestants,” explained Ye Xi with a slight smile so irritating that Bai Xiaofei just wanted to strangle her.</p> 
 <p>However, he didn’t have the guts to. She was royalty and this was the imperial capital. Let alone strangle, he had nearly been arrested for just poking her a little.</p> 
 <p>If it had been any other place, he could just walk away, but here in Moonlight where just a soldier could seal his energy, running had never been more difficult…</p> 
 <p>“Alright, go in and enjoy your time there!” Ye Xi burst out laughing.</p> 
 <p>On the side, Tan Xin looked at the building and shook her head. <em>This woman was actually right. I wouldn’t want to come into a place like this even if you beg me to!</em></p> 
 <p>“Master, please come see me often. I have a feeling that I won’t even have a full meal in this place!” Bai Xiaofei yelped.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin, who was secretly planning to ‘abandon’ Bai Xiaofei, was jolted awake by his voice. Hurriedly hiding the guilt on her face, she solemnly cleared her throat.</p> 
 <p>“Ahem, you can rest assured that I will come to see you often. Behave and put on your best performance so you can get out early.”</p> 
 <p>However, she couldn’t sound more half-hearted…</p> 
 <p>“I’ve booked a hotpot. Are you coming or not?” Ye Xi called out from the carriage.</p> 
 <p>“Coming!” Tan Xin instantly left Bai Xiaofei behind and trotted toward the carriage.</p> 
 <p>“Say, Xiaofei, why do I feel like we’ve entered a serpent den…” Zhu Chunyang looked at the iron gate in front of him and swallowed heavily.</p> 
 <p>“Brother, for the sake of your love, you must persist!” Bai Xiaofei patted Zhu Chunyang on the shoulder. However, he was inwardly comforting himself as well.</p> 
 <p><em>This lord has been through many storms! This lord will be fine!</em></p> 
 <p><em>I’m not panicking! Not one bit!</em></p> 
 <p>Working up his courage, Bai Xiaofei took the lead and stepped into the ‘prison.’ As soon as he knocked on the gate, it opened with a creak and a familiar face poked out. Seeing the person, Bai Xiaofei’s mind only had two words –</p> 
 <p><em>I’m finished…</em></p> 
 <p>“Oooohh! Who have we here?!”</p> 
 <p>Ye Tong’s crystal-clear voice rang out as Bai Xiaofei’s complexion became deathly pale.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Zhu Chunyang behind him was ecstatic. <em>Oh, to look for her everywhere and keep failing, only to find her effortlessly like this!</em></p> 
 <p>“Your Highness, I, Fickle Bai, was wrong for offending you before. If you could be so kind…”</p> 
 <p>“No can do!” Ye Tong cut Bai Xiaofei off with a smug expression.</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness, it’s beneath you to hold it against a little servant like me!” Bai Xiaofei bitterly said. If he had known Ye Tong was royalty, he would have stopped himself from letting Huskie say those provocative words at any cost…</p> 
 <p>“Heh, there are very few good things about me, but a good memory is actually one of them, especially regarding grudges,” Ye Tong sneered and opened the gate wide. “Welcome to the competition training camp, Fickle Bai!”</p> 
 <p>Seeing her evil expression, Bai Xiaofei inhaled deeply. <em>Dammit! What do I do now?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Me too, Tong Tong! I’m also here to participate!” Contrary to Bai Xiaofei, Zhu Chunyang was on cloud nine. He had been racking his brain for a way to get closer to Ye Tong, now it seemed all he needed to do was stay in the camp!</p> 
 <p>“Who the heck are you? I warn you, if you dare to harass me again, I will castrate you!” Shooting Zhu Chunyang a grumpy eye-roll, Ye Tong turned around and went in.</p> 
 <p>“See, so lovely even when angry! I’m too happy!” Zhu Chunyang’s eyes were full of stars as he shook Bai Xiaofei, who was contemplating a way out.</p> 
 <p>“Lovely? More like deadly,” Bai Xiaofei muttered as he followed Zhu Chunyang in. <em>Live or die, I must win this stupid contest!</em></p> 
 <p>“Stop, registration!”</p> 
 <p>As soon as the two entered the building, a group of officials immediately went up to them aggressively like they were enemies. Then, the officials watched intently as they registered their information before giving them a key.</p> 
 <p>“Your room is in the Northern District. This is the competition manual. Meals are distributed in the collective canteen in the Central District. Gather there at six o’clock to be informed of the precautions during your stay,” said an official.</p> 
 <p>Then, they all left, obviously having no intention to show the way at all.</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, there was a map of the whole ‘concentration camp’ in the manual. After comparing the map with the environment, Bai Xiaofei quickly found his way.</p> 
 <p>“Impossible! How can there be so many contestants?!” Zhu Chunyang’s mouth had become O-shaped as he read the introduction of the manual.</p> 
 <p>“This competition is held nationwide. Moonlight has hundreds, if not thousands, of cities, and each has 30 to 100 qualification slots, so it’s not surprising that there are more than 50,000 people,” explained Bai Xiaofei. He had already thought about this matter on the way.</p> 
 <p>However, this was not his main concern. What he wanted to know was, what kind of plan did they have to decide the result in just a few days with such a huge number of contestants?</p> 
 <p>In other words, Bai Xiaofei was extremely curious about the content of the competition.</p> 
 <p>“Look at this key, it’s so big. The door of our room should not be small. Sure enough, Tong’er assigned me a big room because she’s concerned about me!” Zhu Chunyang’s mind was once again filled with Ye Tong.</p> 
 <p>As a king of a kingdom, he was certainly an odd duck to be so keen on this matter.</p> 
 <p>“You’d better not be too optimistic,” Bai Xiaofei sneered.</p> 
 <p>Before long, they arrived at the Northern District, where Bai Xiaofei was struck dumb by what he saw.</p> 
 <p><em>No wonder the key is so big! Isn’t this a warehouse?!</em></p> 
 <p>“See, I told you not to be too optimistic. Now I only hope for one thing.” Bai Xiaofei sighed.</p> 
 <p>“What is it?” Zhu Chunyang gulped. Instinctively, he had a feeling that what Bai Xiaofei was about to say would not sound very good.</p> 
 <p>“I only hope that our roommates are normal.”</p> 
 <p>With that, Bai Xiaofei slowly pushed open the door…</p>
