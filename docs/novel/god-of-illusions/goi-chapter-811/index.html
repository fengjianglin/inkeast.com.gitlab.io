 <p>Chapter 811: The Tricker’s Online!</p> 
 <p>Faced with Bai Xiaofei, the archenemy of his organization, the man did not dare to neglect even a little bit. He quickly pulled back a distance, released his puppet, and launched an attack. A series of actions smooth like flowing water as one would expect from a member of a famous mercenary group.</p> 
 <p>However, the imagined counterattack from Bai Xiaofei did not appear. Instead, it was a flexible evasion.</p> 
 <p><em>The hell?! What’s happening?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>He’s scared of me?!!</em></p> 
 <p>A series of questions and exclamation marks flying through his mind, the Devil Forest guy was dumbstruck, and that moment was exactly what the real Bai Xiaofei was waiting for!</p> 
 <p>Golden Feather immediately attacked. A flame rose and formed a spear that shot straight at the opponent. Caught completely off guard, the man’s heart was pierced without suspense. Under the baptism of the sacred flame, he turned into a pile of ash in three seconds.</p> 
 <p>The danger came quickly and ended even faster. Bai Xiaofei came out from hiding upon seeing the opponent was dead. However, he did not exit the barrier. Or to be exact, he was not in such a hurry to die…</p> 
 <p>No one could guarantee that next time would be so easy. Bai Xiaofei had spent so much effort to lure a big group of people in for a grand show. If they kept killing each other off, everything would be too late by the time they reached the last layer.</p> 
 <p>According to the information from Tan Xin, the underground structure of the All-Around base had a total of seven floors. He carefully looked around and noted that Mister Mirror’s teleportation skill had sent him directly to the fourth floor.</p> 
 <p>Although having no idea who created this space, Bai Xiaofei was sure that the person was not here to help him. Which meant the space would collapse once that person’s purpose was achieved. However, everything would be too late then.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, the problem to be solved was obvious. He had to handle this nuisance of a space and regroup with the rest. Otherwise, his plan would be meaningless!</p> 
 <p>“First divide the battlefield and then act. This routine is a bit familiar,” Bai Xiaofei muttered in deep thought.</p> 
 <p>Gradually, his eyes shone with an intense fighting spirit. If it was really that group, then his mission would be much more interesting!</p> 
 <p>“Aunt Gold, can you send a message out?” He once again pinned his hopes on Golden Feather, and to his excitement, she did not disappoint.</p> 
 <p>“Although my real body can’t leave, I should be able to send out my flame when we pass this barrier.” As someone who had wandered through space cracks, Golden Feather could exploit loopholes to some extent despite having no space ability.</p> 
 <p>“Then please help me deliver this message…” Bai Xiaofei then lowered his voice as he said something to Golden Feather.</p> 
 <p>Golden Feather gently nodded and walked toward the barrier, where she voiced her final worry, “However, if we cross the barrier, we will have to face another opponent. Are you good?”</p> 
 <p>This time, Bai Xiaofei actually had confidence on his face and his eyes were firm. “If it weren’t for the battle just now, the chance of me protecting myself maybe around twenty percent, but now, it’s at least eighty percent as long as I don't meet people from the All-Around Merchant Group or Devil Forest!”</p> 
 <p>“This is a gamble. After all, this is the base of the All-Around Merchant Group. They have many people,” Golden Feather said.</p> 
 <p>“Take this gamble and we may break through this dead end. If we don’t, all our actions so far would be in vain. So, Aunt Gold, do you think I have a choice?” Bai Xiaofei chuckled</p> 
 <p>Golden Feather didn’t say anything because the answer was already obvious. It was absolutely impossible for Bai Xiaofei to wait!</p> 
 <p>She placed her hand on the barrier, and a suction force immediately pulled the group. The whole duration of passing the barrier was less than one second, but Golden Feather perfectly timed it to send a flame burst out.</p> 
 <p>In a flash of light, Bai Xiaofei entered a new space. However, there was no time to prepare as a new opponent was right in front of him!</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei won the gamble. Standing in front of him was a loner from Windlove!</p> 
 <p>“Bai… Bai Xiaofei?!” The person had almost the same reaction as the Devil Forest guy just now, exclaiming with an ugly expression as soon as he saw that his opponent was Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Relax, brother,” Bai Xiaofei comforted the frightened guy with a sunny smile.</p> 
 <p>“You…” Looking at Bai Xiaofei, who obviously had no intention to kill him, the brother felt like his brain was not enough. <em>Isn't this the time to kill your opponent quickly and keep going deeper?!</em></p> 
 <p>Keeping a close eye on Bai Xiaofei, the man’s tongue was stuck on ‘You…’ for a while as he did not know what to say.</p> 
 <p>“You can see the situation. It doesn’t make sense to kill each other, so I decided not to,” Bai Xiaofei explained lightly.</p> 
 <p>Not knowing Bai Xiaofei’s condition, the man inwardly felt lucky.</p> 
 <p>“But do we just let the enemy do as they wish? This must be the ability of someone’s puppet. They definitely did not come unprepared.” The loner was not a fool, he could still do a simple analysis of the situation.</p> 
 <p>This was exactly what Bai Xiaofei wanted.</p> 
 <p>“Indeed. Therefore, as long as the puppet master is dead, this barrier will naturally disappear. I don’t believe that it can hold up without the support of the caster,” Bai Xiaofei said nonchalantly and matter-of-factly. This was indeed his real thought.</p> 
 <p>As for whether it would work out, he could only wait and see. The message had been sent. If there was a result, it would happen in an hour at most. If there weren’t any changes by that time, he could only find another way.</p> 
 <p>At least for now, Bai Xiaofei could not think of any other countermeasure.</p> 
 <p>“Does that mean you expected this?” The loner gulped and started having admiration for Bai Xiaofei, although the latter was much younger.</p> 
 <p>“Not that far. I just made some preparations,” Bai Xiaofei replied with a sigh. <em>Looks like a fight is not needed!</em></p>
