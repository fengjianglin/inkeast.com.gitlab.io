 <p>Chapter 805: Six Days, False News!</p> 
 <p>After the meeting between Bai Xiaofei and Tan Xin, the whole city lord’s mansion was mobilized. The rarely seen Windlove Army was garrisoned and patrolled around the city almost every day.</p> 
 <p>On the contrary, the Savage Class was idle. Except for Fang Ye, who still kept an eye out for Tong Fei’s whereabouts, the rest were leisurely enjoying life in the inn.</p> 
 <p>However, this leisurely life gradually made them frustrated and angry, especially Hu Xian’er and the girls…</p> 
 <p>According to the agreement, Bai Xiaofei officially settled in the city lord’s mansion. Let alone seeing him, there was barely any news of him at all. The Savage Class members could only communicate with him through a small captain of the Windlove Army.</p> 
 <p>“Who is the outsider here?! Why do we feel like we’re redundant?!” Xu Chen slapped the table, which was full of delicacies, and stood up from her seat.</p> 
 <p>The rest shared the same mood as her and none were in the mood to eat.</p> 
 <p>“Although I feel the same way, I don’t think Brother Fei has forgotten us.” Wu Chi sighed, a trace of melancholy clouding his face.</p> 
 <p>“Yes! I believe in Master!” Wang Chuan immediately chimed in after hearing a good opinion about Bai Xiaofei. After staying together with the group for a while, he had become accustomed to the identity of a family member.</p> 
 <p>However, there were only two things that could make Wang Chuan speak: one was cultivation, and the other was Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Seeing the guys siding with Bai Xiaofei, Xu Chen looked at Hu Xian’er. “Sister Xian’er, do we really just wait like this?” She was sure that Hu Xian’er was even more irritated than her. After all, that little girl had dragged Bai Xiaofei to her own territory. Even Rui Mengqi, who had always assumed the role of his personal maid, was not taken along.</p> 
 <p>“If there is no news today, we will go to the city lord’s mansion!” a sullen Hu Xian’er coldly said. She set the deadline to be this day as it was the last day of their appointment in the slave market. This day, they were going to steal the opponent’s slave business.</p> 
 <p>“Masters, her lordship invites you.” A figure clad in glossy-black armor suddenly appeared at the door. It was none other than the small captain responsible for contact with Bai Xiaofei, a one-aperture Exquisite Rank puppet master!</p> 
 <p>“Good,” said Hu Xian’er lightly.</p> 
 <p>The small captain turned into a wisp of smoke and dissipated. After he left, the group immediately grew excited.</p> 
 <p>“Go and call Fang Ye and the others. We’re all going!” declared Hu Xian’er after scanning the room.</p> 
 <p>Everyone jumped up from their seats. <em>We must be making big moves this time!</em></p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, at the entrance of the city lord’s mansion, Bai Xiaofei was wearing a black formal outfit, and the dark red cloak on his back was embroidered with a glaring blood-red dragon.</p> 
 <p>This outfit was naturally provided by Tan Xin, who urged him to wear it. Besides making him look handsome and mighty, it also represented an identity – the supreme leader of the Windlove Army. In other words, in just a few days, Tan Xin had handed the entire army that she had painstakingly developed for over ten years to Bai Xiaofei! In the past several days, all the movements of the Windlove Army were executed under his commands.</p> 
 <p>“Your people are so slow. I told you to bring the army, they are so obedient.” Standing next to Bai Xiaofei, an impatient Tan Xin yawned, her short hands tightly grasping the hem of his outfit. It wasn’t that she didn’t want to hold his arm, her height just didn’t allow her to reach…</p> 
 <p>“What you see is not their full strength, and it’s inconvenient to bring the Windlove Army,” Bai Xiaofei explained with a smile, his eyes full of expectation.</p> 
 <p>Although they had been apart for only a few days, Bai Xiaofei already missed everyone in the Savage Class. After graduation, even they would be scattered out in the world…</p> 
 <p>“Here they are,” Min Xizi said, pointing at the approaching Savage Class members. Upon seeing their posture, he gulped.</p> 
 <p><em>Uhmm… Why does it feel like they’re here for a fight??</em></p> 
 <p>Min Xizi was not the only one who noticed this. Knowing Hu Xian’er very well, Bai Xiaofei more or less guessed her thoughts. From a distance, he secretly sent signals to Mo Ka.</p> 
 <p>Mo Ka immediately received it and poked Wu Chi and Shi Kui. The two quickly understood as well. The next second, the trio rushed over.</p> 
 <p>“Big Bro! We missed you to death!” Mo Ka plunged into Bai Xiaofei’s arms with snot and tears. Wu Chi and Shi Kui – the two big guys, surrounded Bai Xiaofei and nearly covered him.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin was helplessly pushed out. Being saved, Bai Xiaofei breathed a sigh of relief.</p> 
 <p>“Beautifully done!” he whispered to Mo Ka and snickered.</p> 
 <p>“Of course, boss, how can I fail to handle something so trivial?” Mo Ka whispered back before continuing to wail at the top of his lungs. The tense atmosphere was completely destroyed.</p> 
 <p>“Good, alright. We’re doing something big today. I can’t bring you if you keep being like this,” exclaimed Bai Xiaofei righteously as the rest of the group approached.</p> 
 <p>Having completed his task, Mo Ka let go of Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei then looked at Hu Xian’er with a big smile. “Let’s go, today is a big day.”</p> 
 <p>Seeing his sleazy face, Hu Xian’er’s bellyful of words was suppressed. In the end, her only resistance was a cold snort and an icy glare. <em>Don’t think I don’t know! I’ve mentally noted this down!</em></p> 
 <p>Reading the implications in her eyes, Bai Xiaofei giggled foolishly. Nothing was more useful than playing dumb at a time like this.</p> 
 <p>Just like that, Bai Xiaofei survived the ordeal and went to the slave market with an imposing group.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Tong Fei had reappeared in Windlove City. This time, he did not bring just one or two people with him…</p> 
 <p>In addition to Bai Xiaofei’s group and the All-Around Merchant Group, the Devil Forest Mercenary Group also moved. It was unknown what information they had gotten, but their purpose did not seem to be the slave market itself.</p> 
 <p>Not only those several major forces, but the loners in Windlove also got wind of something and decided to observe from the shadows. The whole city was stirred up in just a few days. It was as if everyone knew what was going to happen this day.</p> 
 <p>Of course, all that happened was because of the false news that Bai Xiaofei had spread. However, when certain conditions were met, even the fake would become real!</p>
