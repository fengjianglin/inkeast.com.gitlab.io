 <p>Chapter 337: Uncle Feng’s Shock!</p> 
 <p>Under Hu Xian’er’s gaze, Uncle Feng chose to compromise in the end. He just had no way to refuse her. However, when Uncle Feng looked at Bai Xiaofei, the hostility did not decrease at all. Prejudice against humans always existed in the consciousness of a magical beast.</p> 
 <p>It was the same when Xing and Hong were hungry the first time they met.</p> 
 <p>“What about them?” Uncle Feng referred to Xing, Hong, Xiaoluo, and Xiaobu this time. Although he wasn’t as hostile towards them as he was to Bai Xiaofei, there was still alertness in his voice.</p> 
 <p>“They signed a royal contract with me and are now our people,” replied Hu Xian’er solemnly, coloring Uncle Feng’s face with surprise again.</p> 
 <p>“The royal contract?! You were restored to the King Rank so soon?!”</p> 
 <p>“King Rank’s peak.” A rare pride appeared on Hu Xian’er’s face, just like a child showing off her achievement to her parents.</p> 
 <p>“How can it be so fast?! Something like that is impossible!“</p> 
 <p>Uncle Feng felt like his world view had been toppled. How long had it been? How could Hu Xian’er have changed so much? Moreover, he wasn’t blind. Whether it was the Ruindemon Flood Dragons, the Lunaphython, or the two Earth Infants, they were all existences with top potential in the Infinite Mountain Range!</p> 
 <p>“I absorbed the magic core of a Holy Rank beast.”</p> 
 <p>As soon as the answer was voiced, Uncle Feng was once again petrified.</p> 
 <p><em>The magic core of a… Holy Rank beast?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Did I hear you correctly?! I must have misheard!</em></p> 
 <p>“What did you absorb again?”</p> 
 <p>Swallowing hard, Uncle Feng’s eyes were obviously a bit glazed.</p> 
 <p>“Uncle Feng, you heard it right. It was the magic core of a Holy Rank beast. Xiaofei gave it to me. The two consecutive tremors in the Infinite Mountain Range back then happened when I absorbed the magic core.”</p> 
 <p>As Hu Xian’er seriously explained, Uncle Feng fell into a long silence. He was sorting out his confused thoughts caused by her words…</p> 
 <p>After a long time, his eyes scrutinized the group. Everyone’s expression told him that what he had just heard was the truth.</p> 
 <p>Having completely accepted this fact, Uncle Feng suddenly felt a twinge of sourness in his nose.</p> 
 <p><em>Is this the rise of the fox clan? Can I really see the day when the fox clan returns to the throne?</em></p> 
 <p>Exclaiming with emotions in his heart, Uncle Feng looked at Bai Xiaofei, slowly walked before him, and stared straight at him with widened eyes.</p> 
 <p>“Uncle… Uncle Feng, just now, I was a little…”</p> 
 <p>The uneasy Bai Xiaofei hadn’t finished when Uncle Feng suddenly lowered his huge head and bent a front leg.</p> 
 <p>“I, Liefeng, apologize to you for my rudeness just now. You are a benefactor of the fox clan!”</p> 
 <p>The sudden change stunned everyone. Even Hu Xian’er had not expected such a scene.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was even more shocked. He had been practically paralyzed when Wu Chi had knelt to him. Now, the one doing it was the only one recognized by Hu Xian’er as her family elder!</p> 
 <p>In desperation, Bai Xiaofei knelt back to Uncle Feng with a plop.</p> 
 <p>“Uncle Feng, since you are Xian’er’s elder, you’re also my elder. You’re killing me by doing this! So, can we just have a talk? Kneeling like this is really uncomfortable…”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei said it from the bottom of his heart with a pained face. He just couldn’t think of any good way to react to this situation.</p> 
 <p>However, this kind of honesty was what magical beasts liked the most.</p> 
 <p>“Haha, I have been silly.” Uncle Feng rose to his feet with a hearty laugh and pulled Bai Xiaofei up from the ground as well.</p> 
 <p>But when he turned to look at Hu Xian’er, his eyes were covered with frost.</p> 
 <p>“Why didn’t you ask me to guard you during your Holy beast magic core absorption?! Do you think your Uncle Feng is old and useless? “ Uncle Feng’s voice was brimming with fury as if he wanted to eat someone.</p> 
 <p>“No, Uncle Feng, I didn’t mean that! Just that Xiaofei was there, I thought there was no need to bother you. You were still busy looking for our clan members…”</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er’s explanation did not satisfy Uncle Feng, but in the end, he didn’t delve into it. After all, Hu Xian’er was safe and sound.</p> 
 <p>“Then, why did you guys call me here this time?” Using ‘you guys’ instead of ‘you’ this time, Uncle Feng had accepted that Bai Xiaofei was one of their own.</p> 
 <p>“Let me explain this, Uncle Feng.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei suddenly cut in and pulled Uncle Feng’s attention from Hu Xian’er to himself; he had realized that Hu Xian’er seemed a bit afraid of Uncle Feng…</p> 
 <p>“Xiaoluo and Xiaobu were just hunted by Yelu’s underlings. The two of us saved them, but I don’t think things should be left just like this, or else their days would only get more difficult.”</p> 
 <p>Upon Bai Xiaofei’s words, Uncle Feng froze.</p> 
 <p>“What do you mean?” It wasn’t that Uncle Feng didn’t understand Bai Xiaofei’s words, but that he felt he was hearing things and had to confirm aloud.</p> 
 <p>And Bai Xiaofei didn’t disappoint him.</p> 
 <p>“We are going to counterattack! Make Yelu pay the price!“</p> 
 <p>The moment he uttered those words, Uncle Feng reacted intensely.</p> 
 <p>“No! Too dangerous! Xian’er can’t enter the territory of other Emperor Rank beasts yet, everything has to wait until she’s completely grown!”</p> 
 <p>The refusal was direct and decisive, but it was entirely within Bai Xiaofei’s expectations.</p> 
 <p>“Uncle Feng, calm down, don’t be in such a hurry to reject it.”</p> 
 <p>Soothing Uncle Feng, Bai Xiaofei prepared to instill his ideas, which was the kind of work he had become very accustomed to.</p> 
 <p><em>Isn’t it just brainwashing? Easy peasy.</em></p> 
 <p>“Even if we don’t fight back, Yelu has already noticed Xian’er’s existence, or else Xiaoluo and Xiaobu wouldn’t have been hunted. Therefore, it makes no sense to keep hiding. That will only make them more rampant. Now that we have killed one of their King Rank beasts, as long as we push on, our opponent will fall into the dilemma of being unable to guess our strength and hence will have to think twice if they ever plan to attack us again. This will lessen the pressure on the members of the fox clan scattered in the mountains. So, why not kill two birds with one stone? And I can assure you, none of us present will be in danger!”</p> 
 <p>At Bai Xiaofei’s firm vow, there was still hesitation in Uncle Feng’s eyes.</p> 
 <p>No one could deny that what Bai Xiaofei said was very tempting! What’s more, the sentence ‘no one present will be in danger’ clinched it.</p> 
 <p>“How can you ensure that our lives will not be in danger?” Half compromising, Uncle Feng threw out the last question that couldn’t be any simpler for Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“With me here, everything will be alright!” Before Bai Xiaofei could speak, Xing, who could no longer hold back, blurted out. To say who was the most supportive of Bai Xiaofei’s idea among those present, he was definitely at the top of the list.</p> 
 <p>There was no other reason, it was because his hands were itching! After being promoted to the Monarch Rank, he and Xing had been running and hiding without engaging in a single fight, which was simply a torment to him. So, how could he let go of this kind of opportunity?</p> 
 <p>“Why are you such a busybody? Just shut up!” Hong’s tail heavily smacked Xing on the head, snuffing out his blazing passion.</p> 
 <p>“In fact, Xing is right. Light of Obliteration at the Monarch Rank can help us with a lot of things. Moreover, Uncle Feng, don’t forget that our Xian’er is now a royal at the peak of the King Rank!”</p> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei finished his words, Uncle Feng had already been completely persuaded.</p>
