 <p>Chapter 691: Classic!</p> 
 <p>The snowy wind in the Holy Snow Mountain had not been this gentle for so long, so gentle that Bai Xiaofei felt like he had returned to the peach blossom paradise.</p> 
 <p>Throughout the day, the line of people going to sign up for the Jackdaw’s killing crusade never ceased. Everyone knew that the higher the risk, the higher the rewards. At the same time, they were aware that chasing those rewards could take their lives, but courage and desire sometimes could allow one to overcome that invisible fear.</p> 
 <p>When something had not been witnessed, people never knew how terrifying it was and if it could really bring them down…</p> 
 <p>Today, Bai Xiaofei only did one thing – accompany the Leng triplets to go shopping! Of course, the girls were the ones paying…</p> 
 <p>The triplets had never expected such a day when the Holy Snow Mountain could be so prosperous. The more they witnessed, the more they realized the allure of benefits to human beings.</p> 
 <p>“When are you going to tell us what you figured out last night?” Leng Liuying pouted as she stared fixedly at Bai Xiaofei, ready to get angry if she didn’t get an answer out of him. She had already forgotten how many times she had asked the same question today.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, Liuying, just give up. Don’t you know him? If he doesn’t want to talk, even pliers can’t pry open his lips.” Leng Liushuang placed a piece of Leng Liuying’s favorite fish into the latter’s bowl. Like the Ice Pear, this fish was a specialty found only in the Snow Kingdom.</p> 
 <p>Leng Liuying showed the perfect example of ‘food could block a person’s mouth’ as she no longer bothered with Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Enjoy every second of this. After we re-enter the mountain tomorrow, who knows how long we will be before we are able to come out,” Bai Xiaofei tried to act all mysterious as the speed of him putting food in his mouth soared.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, three servings of every dish we just ordered!” His mouth still stuffed, Bai Xiaofei raised his hand and shouted, once again shocking all and sundry with his cosmic appetite…</p> 
 <p>Sure enough, food was more delicious when one was not paying!</p> 
 <p>Night fell. The triplets had gone to bed early while Bai Xiaofei was drinking alone in the hall.</p> 
 <p>The place gradually emptied out as the guests left in batches, returning to their rooms either to recharge or to start deeper indulgences, but Bai Xiaofei still had no intention to leave.</p> 
 <p>Suddenly, the door was pushed open and five familiar figures poured into the inn along with the wind and snow.</p> 
 <p>“Ahh! Honored guests, you really came at a…”</p> 
 <p>“We are here to find someone.”</p> 
 <p>The waiter hadn’t finished his words when the deep voice of the group leader interrupted him. His eyes scanned the hall before locking on the corner where Bai Xiaofei sat. His resolute face immediately looked troubled.</p> 
 <p>With Bai Xiaofei present, he really couldn’t act tough.</p> 
 <p>“Come sit down. What are you standing there for? I am not a stranger,” said Bai Xiaofei. His faint voice was the deadliest irony to the group of five.</p> 
 <p><em>Well, you are not a stranger. You are an enemy…</em></p> 
 <p>Despite complaining in their hearts, A’First’s group still sat down around Bai Xiaofei’s table. After all, they had to be obedient when their entire possessions were in someone else’s hands!</p> 
 <p>“We have arranged everything you asked us to. Shouldn’t we get what belongs to us now?” asked A’First said with a solemn face, looking like he didn’t want to say even one unnecessary word to Bai Xiaofei…</p> 
 <p>“Why are you in such a hurry? This Snow Milk Wine is still hot. Are you sure you don’t want a sip?”</p> 
 <p>Letting down people’s wishes seemed to be Bai Xiaofei’s greatest pleasure. The more you wanted something, the more he wouldn’t give it to you. You don’t want to talk to him? He’d drag the conversation all around the world while avoiding the main topic.</p> 
 <p>So angry that his teeth ached, A’First reluctantly picked up the Snow Milk Wine. The smell that invaded his nostrils made him frown.</p> 
 <p>However, just like Bai Xiaofei’s first mouthful of the wine, after the steaming wine flowed down his throat, A’First’s frown instinctively relaxed.</p> 
 <p>This was the charm of a foreign land. One could be conquered despite their wish.</p> 
 <p>“Actually, the reason why you are willing to work for me is for money, isn’t it?” Bai Xiaofei said and took out the five’s storage props.</p> 
 <p>Their eyes immediately lit up at the same time. If it weren’t for their weak point in Bai Xiaofei’s hand, how could they endure something so infuriating!?</p> 
 <p>“There, back to their original owners.” Bai Xiaofei smiled.</p> 
 <p>His straightforwardness stunned the group of five. If it weren’t for the fact that the storage props were linked to their spirit, they would be more willing to believe that he was lying to them.</p> 
 <p>“Are you sure you’re going to give it to us just like this?”</p> 
 <p>Humans were strange. It was obviously something they had been thinking about something for a long time, but when it was really returned to them, they dared not reach for it.</p> 
 <p>Which was the current A’First. Looking at his own storage prop, he hesitated.</p> 
 <p>“Or else? Do I have to hold a ceremony or something? I don’t need them to restrain you, and moreover, you need these to better help me.” Bai Xiaofei revealed a smile that A’First couldn’t figure out.</p> 
 <p><em>Help you?! You think too much! If it wasn’t that I can’t beat you, I would have killed you already, okay? And you say ‘help you’?! Are we too idle or out of our minds?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Don’t be in a hurry to reject. Since you guys don’t have any new goals, why don’t you listen to me?” Bai Xiaofei said faintly as he placed his wine on the table.</p> 
 <p>The group gulped in unison and looked at each other for half a day. <em>What is this guy up to?</em></p> 
 <p>“Sorry, our brothers are tired. We just want to rest.” A’First reached for his props and stood up. His brothers followed suit.</p> 
 <p>“You’re not interested in the origin mine?”</p> 
 <p>Upon these few words, the group immediately froze before they looked at Bai Xiaofei in disbelief.</p> 
 <p>“It seems that our conversation can go further.” Bai Xiaofei raised his wine bowl to A’First. “If the wine finishes, we can order more, but the mine in the Holy Snow Mountain will not wait forever. Heck, it might even become the national property of the Snow Kingdom tomorrow.” Bai Xiaofei stared straight at A’First as his smile never faded. The invitation was obvious.</p> 
 <p>A’First gritted his teeth. A conflicting battle fully unfolded in his head in just a few short seconds. Then, he viciously picked up a wine bowl and touched it with Bai Xiaofei’s. After draining it in one go, he sat down.</p> 
 <p>“I can hear you out!”</p> 
 <p>Upon this, the remaining four looked at their boss, then at the smiling Bai Xiaofei, before finally sitting down in confusion. <em>What’s going on now?!</em></p>
