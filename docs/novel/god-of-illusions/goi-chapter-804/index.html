 <p>Chapter 804: Conditions, Tan Xin’s Determination!</p> 
 <p>“Hey, why aren’t you saying anything?”</p> 
 <p>Looking at Bai Xiaofei, who was shocked with eyes bulging and mouth agape, Tan Xin shot him an annoyed glare.</p> 
 <p>Swallowing with difficulty, Bai Xiaofei struggled to squeeze out an answer, “Change a condition…”</p> 
 <p>“Impossible, I can change anything else, but not this!” Tan Xin immediately disagreed. Seeing her attitude, it seemed that this condition was the real purpose of her visit. “But I know that feelings should be established naturally, so it’s fine as long as you don’t oppose. Now, tell me your plan.”</p> 
 <p>As she suddenly gave him some room to survive, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help a long sigh of relief.</p> 
 <p><em>As long as there’s time. Once I handle the Blood Diamond issue, where will you find me? The distance between the Windless Zone and Starnet Academy is not just a matter of a simple trip!</em></p> 
 <p>“First, I hope that you can help me investigate the All-Around Merchant Group. We have too few people, and our recent actions have exposed us too early, so we can’t continue to investigate in depth.”</p> 
 <p>Getting back to business, Bai Xiaofei immediately became serious.</p> 
 <p>“No big deal. My investigation of them has not stopped, I’ll just send more people,” Tan Xin agreed without hesitation. In her opinion, exchanging this for a Bai Xiaofei was a big win for her.</p> 
 <p>“Second, I want you to keep an eye on Unify Business. There is definitely a force behind them, one that they cannot reveal to the world. Their way of doing business is too strange, and from my understanding of them, they are not like businessmen at all,” Bai Xiaofei said with a frown. For some reason, he found Unify Business familiar. He just didn’t know where this familiarity came from.</p> 
 <p>“I also noticed this, I just didn’t think it was necessary for us to be enemies and so didn’t look into it. But since you feel it necessary, I’ll do my best.” Tan Xin blinked provocatively.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei shuddered. He was not afraid of Tan Xin, but was scared that his harem would catch fire again if he got involved with her…</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er might have been able to endure before, but if he got his hands on a little girl, he would definitely be skinned alive!</p> 
 <p>“Third, if there’s a fight…”</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, once you get into a fight, my people will arrive to help you at once!” Tan Xin immediately took over. Bai Xiaofei stating his three conditions meant that she could make demands to her heart’s content. It was impossible not to get excited. She rubbed her hands expectantly. “Now, it’s my turn.”</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin’s eager manner threw Bai Xiaofei into a panic.</p> 
 <p><em>What does this little girl want?!</em></p> 
 <p>“First, from today, you will sleep in my mansion!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing Tan Xin’s shocking first requirement, Bai Xiaofei sweated.</p> 
 <p>“I want to bring my group with me.” Quickly brainstorming, Bai Xiaofei put forward a compromise. He firmly believed that he would not die too miserably if Hu Xian’er was with him.</p> 
 <p>“You think I would agree to that? I didn’t ask for any ‘discount’ from your three conditions!” Tan Xin retorted, obviously refusing to let him slip.</p> 
 <p>“Fine! I agree!” Bai Xiaofei gritted his teeth and decided to stake his little life.</p> 
 <p>He could not muster any origin energy and Tan Xin was an indispensable part of the operation. Without her help, everyone in the Savage Class might be at risk. Although he was not clear of Tan Xin’s strength, he could tell from Min Xizi’s attitude that it was definitely nothing to scoff at.</p> 
 <p>“Mhmm, consider yourself smart.” Tan Xin nodded in satisfaction and continued, “Second, I want to closely follow you in all your activities in the near future!”</p> 
 <p>This condition did not trouble Bai Xiaofei, but looking at her big eyes, he didn’t know why he kept getting a bad feeling.</p> 
 <p><em>Is she digging a trap for me? But… where does this trap lie?</em></p> 
 <p>“Only follow?” he asked nervously.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, just follow, closely follow!” Tan Xin chuckled, not making it difficult for him.</p> 
 <p>What he didn’t notice was that she deliberately added weight to the word ‘closely’…</p> 
 <p>“Alright, I agree. What’s the third condition?” With a ‘f*ck it all’ attitude, Bai Xiaofei could not wait for this torment to end.</p> 
 <p>“I haven’t thought about it yet, but you can rest assured that I will come up with one before you leave the Windless Zone.”</p> 
 <p>Leaving him in suspense, Tan Xin contentedly removed the barrier around the room and swaggered out the door.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei stood there in shock. Watching Tan Xin’s petite figure, a sense of powerlessness washed over him.</p> 
 <p><em>This little girl is even harder to deal with than Rui Mengqi and Gu Lingyue!!</em></p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>During the ‘seesaw battle’ between Bai Xiaofei and Tan Xin, the atmosphere in the hall kept growing more and more bizarre.</p> 
 <p>Although familiar with Bai Xiaofei, this was the first time the rest of the Savage Class saw such an obvious change in his girls’ aura after he was called away by Tan Xin.</p> 
 <p>Whenever Min Xizi looked at Hu Xian’er, the response he got from the latter was a murderous glare!</p> 
 <p><em>Goodness, this boy is surrounded by a group of monsters!</em> Min Xizi screamed inside. He could not wait for Tan Xin to finish the meeting and come out to save him, but she did not seem to be in a hurry at all.</p> 
 <p>When Min Xizi felt like he was on the verge of collapsing, a crisp voice echoed in the hall, “Diarrhea, we’re leaving.”</p> 
 <p>For the first time in his life, Min Xizi found Tan Xin’s voice to be music to his ears! Feeling alive again, he strode to her side. “Great!”</p> 
 <p>“Wait!”</p> 
 <p>Before Tan Xin and Min Xizi could leave, Hu Xian’er stopped them with an icy expression. Her woman’s intuition allowed her to sense Tan Xin’s ‘ulterior motives.’</p> 
 <p>“Ohhhh, sorry, I forgot to greet the empress.” Tan Xin turned around with a snicker and looked straight at Hu Xian’er with provocation in her big eyes.</p> 
 <p>“You’d better not do what you shouldn’t!” Hu Xian’er did not regard Tan Xin as the city lord of Windlove at all. In her eyes, this was an enemy full of unknowns!</p> 
 <p>“Depends on what you mean, and even if I really want to do it, do you think you can stop me?” Tan Xin retorted with a sneer.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t mind trying!” Hu Xian’er stepped forward, her aura spiking.</p> 
 <p>The rest of the people in the hall were either at a loss, or followed Hu Xian’er and regarded Tan Xin and Min Xizi as enemies.</p> 
 <p>“It’s been a long, long time since someone dared to talk to me like this!” Tan Xin instantly looked eager and her eyes flashed with a strong intent to fight.</p> 
 <p>Seeing her become serious, Min Xizi gulped. <em>F*ck! Why get so serious all of a sudden?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Xian’er!” Before a fight could ensue, Bai Xiaofei hurriedly ran out to defuse the situation.</p> 
 <p>Hearing his voice, Hu Xian’er coldly snorted and gradually retracted her energy fluctuation.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin made the same response and her attitude took a U-turn. “If Lil’ Feifei doesn’t want me to fight, I won’t. I’m very well-behaved!”</p> 
 <p>She threw a seductive glance at Bai Xiaofei and went straight for the door. However, it was not over yet. At the entrance, Tan Xin turned around and yelled, “I’ll obediently wait for your good news, Lil’ Feifei!”</p> 
 <p>With that, she blew him a kiss before finally disappearing from everyone’s sight.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei was driven crazy by the urge to die. If there was an icy hell, then he was definitely in it. Without even having to look, he could imagine the several pairs of murderous eyes behind.</p> 
 <p><em>I’m so done… This can’t be explained clearly!!!</em></p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>“You’re sure?”</p> 
 <p>While Bai Xiaofei pondered how he could salvage his life, Min Xizi was having a discussion with Tan Xin.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, I’m sure.” Tan Xin proudly smiled as the image of Bai Xiaofei emerged in her mind.</p> 
 <p>“This concerns everything we have in this world. You can’t make a mistake, my captain.” Min Xizi was still a little worried. His manner earned him a big eye-roll from Tan Xin.</p> 
 <p>“When has Li’s ability ever failed? He is definitely the one. As long as we grasp him, we will be connected to the vein of this world.” Tan Xin’s tone was completely inconsistent with her appearance. The faint melancholy in her voice and her firm attitude was not what a little girl should have.</p> 
 <p>And after hearing Li’s name, Min Xizi fell silent. Then, he asked, “However, do you really have to gamble yourself?” Perhaps this was the real reason why he had asked if she was sure.</p> 
 <p>“We are not from this world. If we want to fully integrate into it, we must establish an inseparable relationship with it. For this, I worked hard for over ten years, yet was never able to get in at all. However, I never felt closer to this world from the moment I saw him. I will not allow this opportunity to slip away. He shall be a bridge for us to enter this world! Even if I have to stake everything I have!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing Tan Xin’s declaration, Min Xizi did not open his mouth again.</p> 
 <p><em>Let’s just hope we’ll win this bet. After all, we have already lost once in this world. Lose again and we’ll really have nothing left…</em></p>
