 <p>Chapter 616: Doubts Arise Once Again!</p> 
 <p>“This student… this student doesn’t know who to believe,” choked for half a day, An Yue gave an honest answer. Normally, he should have leaned towards An Bang Ting since Bai Xiaofei had just become his teacher. However, he himself was skeptical about the ‘rebels’ statement, so Bai Xiaofei’s question actually put him at a loss.</p> 
 <p>“Remember, there are some things you can’t just judge from hearsay. Only what you see and hear with your own eyes and ears is trustworthy and able to provide a basis to make the most correct judgment.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was not as dissatisfied with An Yue’s answer as the latter had imagined. There was even a smile on his face.</p> 
 <p>“To be a good leader, your personal strength is never the most important on the list. It is whether your people are willing to become your most reliable support. In the next month, I will guide your puppet cultivation, but that won’t be the focus,” Bai Xiaofei paused, his eyes flashing with a firm light as he looked at An Yue. “What I want to teach you is how to be a good emperor that is admired by his people!”</p> 
 <p>Upon Bai Xiaofei’s declaration, An Yue was first stunned. Moments later, he bowed and cupped his hands towards Bai Xiaofei with new rising excitement. “I will follow your teachings!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei placed the teacup on the table as the smile on his face deepened. Giving A’Tao a reassuring look, he turned back to An Yue.</p> 
 <p>“I’ve heard about two outsiders answering the imperial announcement recently. Do you know what happened to them? And what’s with the dissident party thing they said? You can’t be in the dark about this, right?“ Finally getting to the main business, Bai Xiaofei was secretly hopeful. As long as An Yue could answer his doubts, the first layer of fog covering this imperial city would be cleared!</p> 
 <p>However, he really thought too much this time.</p> 
 <p>“Only Imperial Father knows the specifics, but those two Teachers of the Nation have been put in prison.” While An Yue didn’t know why Bai Xiaofei would want to know about this, he still answered with what he knew.</p> 
 <p><em>Put in prison?! With all that talk about them being favored?!</em> Bai Xiaofei was shocked for a long time to hear this. After getting an answer that was 180 degrees from his expectations, he felt like his brains weren’t enough. <em>Just what the hell is that An Bang Ting plotting?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Prison? You mean those two Teachers of the Nation offended your father?” Still in disbelief, Bai Xiaofei had to reconfirm.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, Imperial Father said that they were deceiving people and then directly sent them to prison. I think they’ll be executed soon,” said An Yue seriously. He didn’t seem to be lying at all, and there was no need to lie about this anyway.</p> 
 <p>“Wasn’t there a group of people arrested by the royal guards before? Was that the idea of those two Teachers of the Nation or your father? And where are those people?“ Throwing out three questions in a row, Bai Xiaofei had started to lose his composure.</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, An Yue didn’t think much about it and still answered him honestly, “This student doesn’t know, but after Imperial Father locked those two men up, he seemed to have changed into an entirely new person. He had never intended to decide an heir at all, but after that happened, we four were called back from various places.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei frowned. It seemed that there was nothing more to be dug out from An Yue, and the information he got was exactly the opposite of what he had expected. Now, instead of being uncovered, the fog had become even thicker.</p> 
 <p>The string of information in Bai Xiaofei’s mind was broken into pieces by some words from An Yue, not to mention that this string was already very thin in the first place. Now, he had no clue to connect the events at all.</p> 
 <p>“It seems that this matter really has nothing to do with you. I have wronged you.” As if having realized something, Bai Xiaofei’s attitude made a U-turn. He motioned A’Tao to step forward. “Training is not one person’s business. This is A’Tao, the sparring partner I’ve found for you. In the next month, you two will be both rivals and friends. I hope that after one month, I can see you both make progress.”</p> 
 <p>Seeing that Bai Xiaofei finally got down to business, An Yue was thrilled. But when he looked at A’Tao, his brows creased.</p> 
 <p>It was not that he was dissatisfied with Bai Xiaofei finding him a sparring partner without knowing, but A’Tao was a child who had no origin energy. How could he be a sparring partner with his little body?</p> 
 <p>“Teacher, this student means no offense, but this little brother…” An Yue awkwardly paused. He really didn’t know how to word it.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, he won’t let you down.” Without explaining anything, Bai Xiaofei just smiled lightly and then looked at the Leng sisters. “Today, we only train one thing.”</p> 
 <p>At his words, the triplets sat down cross-legged at the same time and closed their eyes.</p> 
 <p>“Meditating.” Looking at a confused An Yue, Bai Xiaofei smiled again. “Don’t ask anything, just follow my instructions.”</p> 
 <p>Sit down, close eyes, adjust breathing, concentrate, and do one’s best to mobilize the energy to run according to the route of the technique, but control the energy to not overflow out of the body…</p> 
 <p>Following Bai Xiaofei’s instructions, An Yue first started to sweat, but after gradually adapting, he entered a wonderful, strange state.</p> 
 <p>The feeling was like his whole being had become an airtight container, and his energy and spirit were the water in it. Under the cleansing of the water flow, his container was becoming clearer and increasing in capacity…</p> 
 <p>This was something basically everyone could learn in Starnet. Starnet called it the circular method, which was specially prepared for puppet masters below the Master Rank. It could purify one’s origin energy and cleanse and broaden their meridians, serving to get them ready before starting actual cultivation.</p> 
 <p>While this circular method was worthless in Starnet, it was extremely precious to the outside world! At least An Yue had never known about the existence of something close to this before, so he was grateful for his luck at the moment.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei was pressing one hand on A’Tao’s shoulder, helping dredge his main meridians little by little.</p> 
 <p>“I’ve checked your body. You don’t meet the conditions to become a puppet master, but there is no threshold to become a martial artist. I will teach you a secret art. Practice diligently, and it won’t be a delusion for you to become an expert in the future!” Bai Xiaofei’s voice resounded directly in A’Tao’s ears, and then he taught him the first two-thirds of Devouring the Heaven and Earth.</p> 
 <p>It was also at this moment that Bai Xiaofei understood why his Fourth Father never taught him the Endless State…</p>
