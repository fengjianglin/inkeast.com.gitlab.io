 <p>Chapter 786: Rebirth!</p> 
 <p>Zhu Nuo immediately rushed to Fang Ye and gently injected his energy into the latter’s body. Fang Ye’s trembling immediately reduced greatly.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the situation?” Bai Xiaofei nervously asked. This clearly happened because of the Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill. If anything happens to Fang Ye, he would not forgive himself and Unify Business!</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know, it seems dangerous; the tendons in his whole body are rupturing, but recovering at the same time. And his energy fluctuation is changing. It’s just like…” Zhu Nuo was stuck. She couldn’t find a suitable way to describe it.</p> 
 <p>“Being reborn?” Bai Xiaofei gulped and his expression grew excited. <em>Looks like the pill is working fine!</em></p> 
 <p>“Yeah, that’s right! That’s it!” Zhu Nuo confirmed.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s wait. Our Savage Class is gaining a new pervert!” Bai Xiaofei chuckled in utter relief. Outside of those who had seen the auction, no one understood him.</p> 
 <p>However, Hu Xian’er focused on another point. “What do you mean ‘another pervert’? Who are the other perverts? Introduce them to me.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing the frost in her voice, all of Bai Xiaofei’s hair stood up. <em>Damn it, talking about putting my foot in my own mouth… This is a topic that should only stay between the boys!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Mo Ka! Shi Kui! They are all perverts! An alchemist and a forger who love fighting? They are so unreasonable!” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly shifted the blame to save himself from this grave situation.</p> 
 <p>Mo Ka was fine since he was not present, but Shi Kui felt wronged.</p> 
 <p><em>What did I do?! Brother Fei, you don’t have to betray your brother to save your life!</em></p> 
 <p>Receiving Shi Kui’s pitiful eyes, Bai Xiaofei shot him a glare.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, Brother Fei is right, we’re called that a lot!” Shi Kui immediately yielded.</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er snorted, obviously knowing what was going on, but she did not make it hard on the two. After all, Bai Xiaofei helped her find a clan member today.</p> 
 <p>During the little storm, Fang Ye’s painful expression had disappeared. A vigorous vitality spread from his body and his aura began to climb: breaking through the peak of the Master Rank to the Grandmaster Rank first realm, second realm, third realm…</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye had long mastered the theoretical knowledge of the ranks. The only reason why he had not advanced was not having time to cultivate, which the Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill helped eliminate.</p> 
 <p>Finally, Fang Ye stopped right before the threshold to the Exquisite Rank. This rank was not something that could be gotten through by theoretical knowledge alone. However, being a peak-grade Grandmaster Rank already put him at the top of the Savage Class in terms of rank at present, which only Hu Xian’er, Lin Li, and Bai Xiaofei had reached.</p> 
 <p>The effect of the Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill shocked Fang Ye for a long while. The connections to all of his puppets were forcefully severed, but he did not suffer any backlash. This was simply unimaginable.</p> 
 <p>Despite his shock, Fang Ye remembered what Bai Xiaofei had told him. He grabbed the three Blood Diamonds and injected his energy into them. The three stones then turned into gentle energy silk threads that drilled into his body.</p> 
 <p>The Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill had given Fang Ye a special physique. What the three Blood Diamonds could give him would depend on luck!</p> 
 <p>As time passed, everyone’s attention fell upon Fang Ye. Unlike the pill, the Blood Diamonds did not cause a scene. Only Fang Ye knew what was happening, but from the looming smile on his face, the rest knew it was rewarding.</p> 
 <p>About half an hour later, Fang Ye slowly opened his eyes. Without a word, he grabbed Into Oblivion and linked it without delay thanks to the effect of the Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill. After the gun puppet was the Tri-Form Stone – which was a quasi-violetgold puppet, and the linkage process was similarly smooth.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Bai Xiaofei was pleased. Fang Ye had definitely gained Strong Soul, the same physique that Wu Chi had obtained that allowed one to forcibly link any puppets!</p> 
 <p>Finally, Fang Ye picked up the Immovable Bracelet and asked Bai Xiaofei about its effect. After getting the answer, he laughed, and then linked it without any hesitation. If it was before, Fang Ye might have considered the pros and cons, but now, the bracelet could only do him good and no harm!</p> 
 <p>When everything was done, Fang Ye stood up. The moment he did, everyone could clearly feel his change – a great change in his aura.</p> 
 <p>“How does it feel?” Bai Xiaofei asked. He had always felt apologetic toward Fang Ye.</p> 
 <p>Although Fang Ye was suitable for business, he had paid too much for the Illusion Demon Merchant Group. Without him, Bai Xiaofei would not have it so easy…</p> 
 <p>“Never better.” Fang Ye chuckled. He could somewhat see through Bai Xiaofei’s thoughts.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t keep us guessing, we are all waiting!” Bai Xiaofei urged in expectation. He badly wanted to hear that Fang Ye had gotten four special physiques.</p> 
 <p>“In addition to the changes you saw, I also got three special physiques,” Fang Ye said nonchalantly, but the whole room collectively gasped.</p> 
 <p><em>Three special physiques! Is he still human?!</em></p> 
 <p>“The first one is Strong Soul, which you should have guessed. The second one is Heavenly Origin, so I won’t have to worry about lacking energy.”</p> 
 <p>This was exactly the same as Wu Chi. After this, Wu Chi would have nothing to brag about… Moreover, Fang Ye had yet to disclose the third one!</p> 
 <p>“What is the last one?!” Bai Xiaofei swallowed with difficulty. For some reason, he felt that the last one would be a BUG!</p> 
 <p>“Spiritual Attachment!” Fang Ye uttered.</p> 
 <p>The whole room fell into a dead silence.</p> 
 <p><em>Spiritual Attachment! This special physique finally reappeared!!</em></p> 
 <p>If there was a ranking system for special physiques, then Strong Soul would be mid-tier and Heavenly Origin would be top-tier, but even so, the gap between the latter and Spiritual Attachment was like that between earth and heaven. Spiritual Attachment was definitely the top among the top special physiques!</p> 
 <p>It gave all attacks by the puppet master spiritual attribute, and could give any seemingly insignificant item a soul!</p> 
 <p>For example, in a battle, even a stone on the ground might suddenly jump up and accurately strike an enemy’s eyes, and there was no need to control the stone at all as the puppet master only needed to attach some spiritual strength to the stone!</p> 
 <p>“Now this is interesting.” Bai Xiaofei’s lips slightly curled at the thought.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this smile, the members of the Savage Class shuddered. <em>Someone is going to suffer!</em></p>
