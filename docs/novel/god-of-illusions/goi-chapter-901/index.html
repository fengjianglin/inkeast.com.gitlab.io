 <p>Chapter 901: Always Brothers!</p> 
 <p>Nightfall,</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin finally came out after spending more than two hours dressing up. Dressing up was definitely a different concept for women and men.</p> 
 <p>At the very least, Bai Xiaofei was shocked silly. All the beauties that he had seen before were pure natural beauties, but what Tan Xin had done with makeup could only be described as striking.</p> 
 <p>“What? Is there something wrong with my makeup? You’d better be honest!” Tan Xin emphasized ‘honest,’ which obviously meant Bai Xiaofei was only allowed to sing praises.</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, there was absolutely nothing to find fault with.</p> 
 <p>“I’m trying to find the right adjectives to express the astonishment in my heart right now. This is no longer about good or not, it’s beyond perfect…” Bai Xiaofei swallowed.</p> 
 <p>Although it sounded like flattery, he really meant it from the bottom of his heart. Tan Xin always gave people a fresh feeling of youth and sunshine, but now she exuded a mature and dignified aura. In short, she suddenly changed from a young girl to a high and mighty royal sister…</p> 
 <p><em>This is not makeup, it’s like she changed faces!</em></p> 
 <p>On top of that, her sky-blue dress emphasized her slender figure, and her not-so-outstanding chest only added to her graceful bearing. It was the same feeling as ‘any more would be excessive and any less would be regrettable.’</p> 
 <p>“If so, let us go. It’s not good to keep people waiting.” Tan Xin immediately brightened. She held onto his elbow and they set out.</p> 
 <p>The two became the focus of attention as the sight of a woman was rare in the Imperial Guard camp, not to mention a stunning beauty like Tan Xin.</p> 
 <p>“Overseer, His Highness the First Prince ordered me to pick you up.” The people arranged by the First Prince had already been waiting outside.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei and Tan Xin got on the sedan while the Imperial Guard followed after. Thus, the mighty team departed from the palace and headed toward the Moon Beck Pavilion.</p> 
 <p>Along the way, the garrison cleared away all pedestrians, who were curious about who dared to extravagantly stand out at a time like this.</p> 
 <p>It couldn’t be helped, even the garrison commander didn’t know why he was ordered to clear the roads, let alone the citizens.</p> 
 <p>“We are here, Overseer.”</p> 
 <p>When the sedan stopped in front of the Moon Beck Pavilion, the Imperial Guard surrounded the entire area under Tian Hai’s command.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei supported Tan Xin down from the sedan. At the door, the five princes had been waiting.</p> 
 <p>“Your Highnesses take me too seriously, I…” Bai Xiaofei awkwardly greeted as he looked at the expectant prince group.</p> 
 <p>Before he could finish, Third Prince Ling Fan hugged his shoulder.</p> 
 <p>“No status here today, only family and friends. You don’t have to be so uptight, Brother Bai.”</p> 
 <p>Given the age gap between him and Bai Xiaofei, calling the latter brother was really making him out to be a little too old. However, it wasn’t like he could call him nephew…</p> 
 <p>“Then I will be presumptuous this once, my brothers!” Laughing merrily, Bai Xiaofei quickly blended into the atmosphere. At the same time, his eyes briefly stopped on the Sixth and Eighth prince.</p> 
 <p>“Come, let me introduce you guys. This is our Sixth Brother, Ling Zong, the only bachelor among the five of us,” said Ling Fan.</p> 
 <p>The introduction drew a speechless face from Ling Zong.</p> 
 <p>“Sixth Brother.” Exchanging smiles with Ling Zong, Bai Xiaofei rescued him from the embarrassment.</p> 
 <p>“This is your Eighth Brother Parrot… I mean Ling Ming.” Ling Fan once again made another face cloud.</p> 
 <p>It was not until this moment that Bai Xiaofei realized that Ling Fan had been already quite restrained in the palace!</p> 
 <p>“Third Brother, don’t think I’m afraid of you just because you’re older. I have your embaras…”</p> 
 <p>“My dear Eighth Brother, I suddenly remember I still have a pot of precious wine. How about opening it together when we have time?” Ling Fan hurriedly bribed Ling Ming before the latter could finish his words while subconsciously glancing at his wife.</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, the madams were busy introducing themselves to Tan Xin and didn’t notice what happened on the men’s side.</p> 
 <p>“Well, you don’t want to stand here all night, do you? Talk about whatever you want inside,” reminded Ling Yue.</p> 
 <p>The rest smiled awkwardly before inviting each other in, trading courtesies as they came to the private room at the top of the Moon Beck Pavilion.</p> 
 <p>Usually, this room was used by the pavilion performers when winning the top card position of the month.</p> 
 <p>After the banquet started, the attendees chatted about everything to get to know each other. During his talk with the Sixth and Eighth Princes, Bai Xiaofei excluded them from the possibility of being the human puppet mastermind.</p> 
 <p><em>Does this mean that puppetsmith lied to me? But it didn’t look like it!</em></p> 
 <p>His heart full of doubt, Bai Xiaofei fell into a dead end.</p> 
 <p>At that moment, Ling Yue started getting down to business.</p> 
 <p>“Wanqiu, take the ladies on a tour around the pavilion. We have something to discuss in private.”</p> 
 <p>Ling Yue’s wife immediately stood up. The rest of the ladies tactfully followed her, including Tan Xin despite her unwillingness.</p> 
 <p>“Now, Brother Bai, please tell us exactly what you plan to do. We will abide by the agreement if we can.” Ling Yue looked at Bai Xiaofei, directing everyone’s attention at him.</p> 
 <p>“It’s actually very simple.” Having thought out the specific measures, Bai Xiaofei also entered his business mode.</p> 
 <p>The five princes perked up their ears with rapt attention.</p> 
 <p>“Since it’s a competition for the throne, let’s make it literal. Before the end of the half-month period, choose a day. You will be scattered throughout the city, and whoever arrives at the palace hall and sits on the throne first will be the winner.”</p> 
 <p>“However, we all need to agree in advance that: First, do not use the others’ family and friends to threaten them. Second, do not deal irreparable damage. Third, no matter who the final winner is, the rest must accept it. You are brothers, and always will be!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei spoke slowly, making sure everyone could hear clearly.</p> 
 <p>“Ehhh… It’s that simple?” Ling Hai gulped with difficulty, his face covered in disbelief. He thought it would be a much more complicated process.</p> 
 <p>“It’s as simple as that. Just a friendly match after all, right?” Bai Xiaofei smiled when he saw that none of the princes’ reactions were suspicious.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, I agree, especially the last sentence.” Ling Yue stood up and looked around at his brothers. “We are always brothers!”</p>
