 <p>Chapter 973: Seeing Nie Qing!</p> 
 <p>“Of course, as it is the sacred treasure of the Sacks. As far as I know, it has been passed down their generations for hundreds of years,” said the emperor nonchalantly as if this was something everyone knew.</p> 
 <p>“Then why didn’t you tell Brother Fang?” Bai Xiaofei questioned with a hint of displeasure. If the emperor told the Thunderstorm group about this, they wouldn’t be wasting their time in Moonlight.</p> 
 <p>“Tell them? So they can run to the Sacks to die? The strength of that group lies in the cooperation of their puppets. They are as good as dead going against the Sacks. Not to mention that their little sister is still at my place. I’m afraid her body would have been cold by the time they see what the Revival Grass looks like,” the emperor refuted calmly as she observed Bai Xiaofei’s expression with great interest.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei fell silent for a moment, before asking hesitantly, “Can I see Qing’er?”</p> 
 <p>“Don’t you think it is inappropriate to say you want to see another woman in front of one?”</p> 
 <p>The emperor’s reply surprised Bai Xiaofei. He didn’t know what to say.</p> 
 <p>“I’m sorry, I…”</p> 
 <p>“You can see her,” the emperor interrupted.</p> 
 <p>“What is the condition?” Bai Xiaofei was not a fool. There was no such thing as a free lunch, and even if there was, it wouldn’t come from someone like the emperor.</p> 
 <p>“None, because you will do it anyway.” The emperor smiled.</p> 
 <p>“Where is she?” Bai Xiaofei didn’t struggle with this. He only had one thing on his mind – to see Nie Qing!</p> 
 <p>“Follow me.” The emperor stood up and walked toward a door.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was stunned. <em>Nie Qing is right inside her sleeping quarters?</em></p> 
 <p>“Why are you still standing there? Afraid that I will eat you?” The emperor turned around after hearing no movement from Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei revealed an embarrassed expression. <em>As if! Even if that’s the case, I will be the one eating! You really think I’m just some servant?!</em></p> 
 <p>“I was just thinking about what to say when I see her!” He hurriedly found an excuse.</p> 
 <p>“You think too much.” The emperor sighed and led him to the study, where she turned a switch in the secret compartment of her desk which slowly opened a passage behind the bookshelf.</p> 
 <p>The emperor went in, followed by Bai Xiaofei, who grew increasingly anxious along the way. He really didn’t know how to face Nie Qing who was willing to sacrifice her life for him. Without knowing, the guilt had already been deeply rooted in his heart…</p> 
 <p>“I won’t disturb you two, although she can’t respond to you now,” said the emperor after taking Bai Xiaofei to their destination.</p> 
 <p>On an ice bed, Nie Qing lay quietly with a happy expression, as if she was only sleeping.</p> 
 <p>“She…” Bai Xiaofei’s vision blurred as he walked to the bed. His mumbling stopped the emperor who was about to leave.</p> 
 <p>“All I can do is preserve her life. If it wasn’t for this ice bed, I can’t even maintain her youthful appearance. Moreover, even this can’t maintain it for long. Six months at most. If you haven’t brought the Revival Grass by then, it will all be futile,” said the emperor solemnly.</p> 
 <p>After the emperor left, Bai Xiaofei slowly knelt in front of the bed and reached for Nie Qing’s cold cheeks.</p> 
 <p>“Silly girl, why? Just how little belief did you have in me? If you had told me earlier, how could I have left you alone for so long?” Bai Xiaofei murmured, tears slipping silently down his face. “Look at me. Now that we finally meet again, I should talk about something happy.”</p> 
 <p>Then, Bai Xiaofei searched his memory and started narrating all the things he had experienced after separating from Nie Qing, sometimes with laughter and sometimes with a sigh. He didn’t know whether she could hear him, he just wanted to say it.</p> 
 <p>He wanted to make up for lost time, even if it made him look like a madman talking to himself.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, I’m finished. Say, your man is formidable, isn’t he? Don’t worry. When I come back from the Sacks, you will be able to stand up again. At that time, I will tie you to me. Even if you want to run, you can’t run!” Bai Xiaofei ‘threatened,’ then he smiled and got up, planting a kiss on her forehead. “Have a good sleep while you wait for my return.”</p> 
 <p>With that, he took a deep breath and exited the secret chamber.</p> 
 <p>After he left, a teardrop slowly slipped from the corner of Nie Qing’s eye…</p> 
 <p>“It seems I misjudged you,” said the emperor with a smile right after Bai Xiaofei came out.</p> 
 <p>“You eavesdropped on me?” Bai Xiaofei frowned and there was displeasure in his tone.</p> 
 <p>“Have you forgotten where you are? Or have you forgotten who I am? Your tone is enough for you to die a hundred times!” The emperor’s voice instantly grew icy.</p> 
 <p>However, this did not scare Bai Xiaofei. “If you want to kill me, you would have done it long ago. But I’m still useful, aren’t I?” He seemed to have changed after seeing Nie Qing.</p> 
 <p>Facing his piercing gaze, the emperor slightly froze.</p> 
 <p>“The people of Thunderstorm said that you aren’t called Fickle Bai.” Her cold aura suddenly changed into that of a gentle big sister.</p> 
 <p>“My name will bring a lot of inconvenience, you should know that, ma’am,” Bai Xiaofei didn’t deny it.</p> 
 <p>Among other things, if Shadow Death knew of his presence in this matter, they would definitely interfere and make his trip to the Sacks extremely difficult.</p> 
 <p>“I also have a name, and it sounds quite good. How about calling me Qingcheng?” The emperor once again made a U-turn.</p> 
 <p>The sudden change of topic struck Bai Xiaofei dumb. <em>Just how the hell is her brain wired?!</em></p> 
 <p>“I don’t want another reason to die hundreds of times.” He gently rejected the idea with a wry smile.</p> 
 <p>Ever since knowing what happened to Nie Qing, he had seriously reflected on himself. He had owed too much and there were too many people waiting for him. He didn’t want to continue creating any more debts.</p> 
 <p>“No hurry. You will change your mind. Now, let’s talk about your second purpose here.”</p>
