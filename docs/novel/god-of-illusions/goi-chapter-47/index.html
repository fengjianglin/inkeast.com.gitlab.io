 <p><span style>After Xue Ying finished venting her bellyful of grievances, He Meng was utterly incapable of standing, and based on the clear and resounding sounds from before, there were at least six or seven of He Meng’s bones that had been broken!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei walked over slowly to He Meng’s side before placing his hand onto He Meng’s wrist, and then the feeling of Origin Energy converging arose once more before a strand of it was extracted by Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s done, Senior He Meng. You can be at ease. But, I hope I don’t have to use this little fellow again in the future.” Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but chuckle as he looked at the unconscious He Meng, and this chuckle was filled with disdain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Xue Ying who was by Bai Xiaofei’s side moved far away instinctively because Devourer Worms were like incurable diseases, and no matter if it’s capable of posing a threat to one’s self, no one was willing to come close to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, how long more do the three of you intend to lay on the ground? There’re five third year student jade tokens here, don’t all three of you want to consider getting up and looking for them?” As soon as Bai Xiaofei finished speaking, Mo Ka and the others that were acting dead had instantly leaped up from the ground, and they charged with tremendous momentum towards the group of five third year students that were in an even more miserable state. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Experience comes with practice. The three of them were slightly worried the last time yet the level of their audacity wasn’t inferior to Bai Xiaofei in the slightest this time, even if the people before them were third year seniors!</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, all the other four seniors on the ground except He Meng actually had the ability to resist, but with Xue Ying present at the scene, they didn’t even dare move a muscle until Mo Ka and the others had transferred all the Starnet Stones within their jade tokens.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they returned to Bai Xiaofei’s side with excitement, the smiles on their faces was already sufficient to display the wealth of these five seniors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seniors, the infirmary at the Furnace of Agarwood has probably not closed yet. Do all of you intend to continue staying here? Or make the best use of your time and have yourself looked at?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as Bai Xiaofei finished speaking, the four of them that had a slight ability to move stood up right away, and they didn’t even dare take a glance at Bai Xiaofei and Xue Ying before carrying He Meng up immediately and running out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The students that were spectating outside noticed all this and all of them split open into a path when He Meng’s group of five left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, room 807 had been set as a restricted area in their hearts!</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Zhang Qinghai and Zhang Qingshan who were hiding in the corner had completely given up hope. Even third year students were helpless against Bai Xiaofei and the others, so they could only choose to stomach this humiliation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surrounding spectators dispersed gradually, whereas, the remaining six male students in the male dormitory and from the Savage Class ran over hastily instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, they were watching the show as well. But, they didn’t know that the ‘actors’ in the show would be Bai Xiaofei and the others, and the problem was already more or less resolved when they realized this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Sister Xue….” At the instant they charged into the dormitory and saw Xue Ying, the flustered expressions on their faces instantly turned to astonishment before they revealed an obedient and reserved appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s fine now, everything that needs to be resolved has been resolved.” Xue Ying cleared her throat as her attitude turned solemn once more. She could be slightly at ease when there were fewer people. But, when everyone was together, she had to maintain her dignity as the headteacher.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Astonishment turned into pleasant surprise as all of them looked at Bai Xiaofei right after. Even though they were pushed out to the outer circle of the crowd earlier, they’d roughly heard what had occurred, so the gazes they shot at Bai Xiaofei at this moment couldn’t help but be filled with admiration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Fei, you deserve to be our Savage Class’s Class Monitor. Your bearing absolutely crushes most people in our academy!” The person that spoke was Xing Nan, and the nearby Xue Ying couldn’t help but be stunned when the words ‘class monitor’ was mentioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Class Monitor? Him?!” Xue Ying pointed at Bai Xiaofei as she spoke while a trace of bewilderment appeared on her face because she intended to organize a small test in the class to determine the candidate to be Class Monitor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right, weren’t you the one who chose him, Big Sister Xue?” Xing Nan continued, and the acutely smelt a slightly wrong feeling in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t listen to his nonsense. I never said that. On the day of registration, he and Zhu Si’si didn’t even give me the chance to explain before directly determining me as the Class Monitor.” Bai Xiaofei revealed a flattering and sly smile as he explained hurriedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Sister Xue, you must believe a pure and good young man like me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Ying couldn’t help but grunt coldly to display her attitude as she looked at Bai Xiaofei’s odd expression.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pure? Good young man? You? Then would there be anyone that isn’t pure and good in this academy? </span></i><span style>Xue Ying thought like this in her heart yet didn’t voice it out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whatever. In any case, there needs to be someone to do some errands. But, I’ll absolutely make you bear the consequences if you dare throw the face of our class!” After she confirmed him as the class monitor, Xue Ying didn’t forget to give him a fierce warning before revealing a puzzled expression right after that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you really foster a Devourer Worm?” Finally, Xue Ying was unable to restrain the curiosity in her heart because a matter such as fostering a Devourer Worm was truly astonishing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fostering a Devourer Worm?!” Before Bai Xiaofei could speak, Xing Nan had already exclaimed with shock before him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could that be possible? Even our southern territory doesn’t have a way to foster Devourer Worms because the actions of Devourer Worms are based entirely on instinct. There’s utterly no possibility to form a relationship with them!” As soon as a specialist spoke, Bai Xiaofei instantly swallowed back the excuse he’d prepared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xing Nan is right, how could I have possibly have fostered a Devourer Worm? This thing that’s hated by all in the Infinite Mountain Range is even rarer than Magical Beasts that can take human form, so not to mention fostering one, it’s impossible to even encounter one.” Bai Xiaofei laughed slyly as he shrugged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then how did you deceive He Meng earlier?” Under their sudden understanding, a new question surged into their minds. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you have heard of the World Devourer technique, right? I only slightly sped up the speed his Origin Energy at one of the places it converged. Who asked him to be ignorant and really believe me?” After he unveiled the secret, all of them got to know Bai Xiaofei once more. Sure enough, the Illusion Stream really did suit him the best because they’d never seen anyone better than Bai Xiaofei at making what was fake seem real!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard that secret techniques like the World Devourer require guidance to learn, so you know someone that is skilled in this technique?” Xue Ying was older after all, and she could be considered to possess extensive knowledge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My Fourth Father does.” Bai Xiaofei chuckled and didn’t hide it because all of them didn’t know who his Fourth Father was at any rate, nor was it possible for them to go to the Gorge of Heroes to look for him….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Exactly how many secrets do you possess? Or perhaps how many tricks have you not used?” As a trace of a smile appeared on her face, Xue Ying felt slightly pleased with this ‘class monitor’ of hers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ll find out in the future because I’m unable to tell you everything even if I did now.” Bai Xiaofei kept them guessing and directly stopped the topic of conversation because those tricks were the foundation of his life, and it would be impossible for him to move about in the world if he revealed all of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whatever. But, don’t let me find out you played tricks on me. Otherwise, you know the consequences!” Xue Ying clenched her fists as she revealed her trump card once again — Threats….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, I usually don’t play tricks on beauties.” Bai Xiaofei seized the opportunity to flatter her, causing Xue Ying to reveal a satisfied smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, she didn’t know that Bai Xiaofei had said similar words to countless people….</span></p>
