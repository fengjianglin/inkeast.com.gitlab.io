 <p>Chapter 324: Angering You to Death!</p> 
 <p>“Good day, Senior. If I’m not wrong, you must be Su Yu, the well-known number one of the Combat Ranking. I initially wanted to find some time to learn from you, but who’d have thought you’d beat me to it? I’m really ashamed.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei said it so impeccably that Su Yu, who was repeatedly addressed using the respectful ‘you,’﻿<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span> nearly floated into the air.</p> 
 <p>“Junior Brother Bai, you already give me face by calling me ‘senior.’ I’m not worthy of this respect. As for fame, I’m really no match for you.”</p> 
 <p>Su Yu was also a veteran. His mutual flattery with Bai Xiaofei had the rest of the four people dumbfounded.</p> 
 <p><em>Aren’t we here to look for trouble? What kind of plot is this? At this rate, you two will kowtow and become sworn brothers soon!</em></p> 
 <p>“Senior is too nice. Then I can only take the liberty and hope that you won’t go saying I, Bai Xiaofei, is an impolite person!” Bai Xiaofei laughed heartily, completely without intention to get to the main topic.</p> 
 <p><em>Keep going, I can talk nonsense with you for a day!</em></p> 
 <p>“How is that possible? I, Su Yu, am not the kind to spread baseless rumors. I can’t do such a thing as smearing my junior brother’s reputation!” Su Yu inadvertently praised himself, but his heart felt like a cat was scratching it.</p> 
 <p><em>Why hasn’t this boy asked me why I’m here yet?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Seniors, please take a seat. Although our place is small, there is still some room to sit. Seniors, do you guys want some fruit? I’ll wash it for you,” spouting small talk, Bai Xiaofei still didn’t ask the thing Su Yu wanted him to ask.</p> 
 <p>“No, no, no, please don’t go to the trouble, we have all eaten.” Afraid that Bai Xiaofei would not come back if he left, Su Yu hurriedly kept him.</p> 
 <p>“By the way, Senior, I see you are wearing the logos of two departments at the same time, why is this?” he asked, but it was just another meaningless question…</p> 
 <p>“I majored in the courses of both and my results were recognized. They both wanted me and somehow after discussion, I became a student of both departments.” Trying to suppress his agitation, Su Yu answered Bai Xiaofei’s question in detail.</p> 
 <p>“Then what would you do in a competition among departments, Senior? Would you be with the God Amongst Men or the Sword of Assault?” One question after another followed. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that Bai Xiaofei could pull off nonsensical chitchat for an entire day.</p> 
 <p>“Rotation, this time the Sword of Assault, then next time the God Amongst Men.”</p> 
 <p>When Su Yu replied, a senior next to him couldn’t take it anymore and discreetly poked him. However, Su Yu didn’t respond; it was as if he hadn’t felt it.</p> 
 <p>“Senior, you’re truly outstanding. We definitely can’t find a second one like you in Starnet!” Bai Xiaofei boldly clapped his hands, looking like he was praising Su Yu to the skies.</p> 
 <p>“Speaking of outstanding, Junior Brother, you’re the outstanding one to be able to organize an event that shocked the entire Starnet and even the continent. The Blossom Ranking has existed for so long, but you are definitely the first student that can make it shine like this!” Su Yu really couldn’t wait any longer, but getting straight to the point seemed too low for him, so he chose the roundabout way.</p> 
 <p>But how could Bai Xiaofei not know what he meant? Regarding digging traps, Bai Xiaofei could be his ancestor!</p> 
 <p>“I am but a figurehead that they pushed to the front. In fact, all that doesn’t have much to do with me. Let’s not talk about this since it’s rare for you to visit, Senior. I wonder if you can give me some advice on cultivation? I haven’t advanced at all after entering the Master Rank. How can I ascend to the second stage?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei said these words as if he had really been training after reaching the Master Rank. If he could really rank up like this, people would be angered to death!</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Su Yu loathed that he couldn’t just curse out loud. He had just finally gotten down to business, yet Bai Xiaofei had disrupted his plan with just a few sentences.</p> 
 <p><em>Go ask your damn teacher about training! Why ask me?! I’m not here to give advice!</em></p> 
 <p>Su Yu roared in his mind but he showed no sign of it.</p> 
 <p>“Origin energy control﻿<span id="fnre2"><a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a></span> isn’t actually difficult. With internal sight as the basis, as long as you regularly guide the flow of origin energy in your body, it will naturally advance after time.”</p> 
 <p>Su Yu said it like puppet masters ranking up was just a walk in the park, but he was really not to blame. Who told him to be a genius?</p> 
 <p>“I see! I thought origin energy control was just to consume origin energy continuously. I’ve learned something! When I rank up, I’ll definitely thank you properly!” Bai Xiaofei looked like a revelation had dawned upon him. Acting wasn’t difficult for him at all.</p> 
 <p><em>What the heck! Did this brat really not know it or is he deliberately teasing me? How the hell did he even get to the Master Rank?!</em></p> 
 <p>Su Yu had begun to lose his cool, and moreover, he gradually realized Bai Xiaofei’s intentions. His pent-up annoyance was nearing the edge of his limits. When did he, Su Yu, have to experience this kind of injustice?</p> 
 <p>“No need to thank me. It’s my duty to help a junior brother. By the way, Junior Brother, I heard that you also established the New Student Mutual Aid Community?” Su Yu once again brought the topic back on track. He no longer expected Bai Xiaofei to willingly ask him the right question.</p> 
 <p>“They are but a group of people who spontaneously gathered together to protect themselves. I merely give a little guidance. Even without me, the New Student Mutual Aid Community would have been established sooner or later, it can’t compare your Student Union. Speaking of which, Senior, I want to ask, how can I join the Student Union? I’ve been interested in this for a long time!” Not giving Su Yu the opportunity to delve deeper into the topic, Bai Xiaofei grabbed a topic and asked back, despite that he had just shown disdain for the Student Union in front of Yun Sheng.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Su Yu’s eyes lit up upon hearing that Bai Xiaofei wanted to join the Student Union.</p> 
 <p><em>Regardless of whether you are sincere or not, as long as there’s an open window!</em></p> 
 <p>“If you join the Student Union, I promise you will at least be a vice president, but you know, you have to do something for the Student Union in order to convince everyone!” Su Yu really kept his wits about himself to be able to lead the conversation to where he wanted even in this situation.</p> 
 <p>The four people behind him were already smiling. After Bai Xiaofei dragged it out for so long, he still jumped in it in the end!</p> 
 <p>However, they were happy too early. If Bai Xiaofei could jump in, he naturally could jump out.</p> 
 <p>“Then forget it. I’m kind of lazy, I don’t want to be in charge of things.”</p> 
 <p>A plain remark nearly made Su Yu cough blood in anger.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter, Senior? Your complexion looks a bit off, are you feeling unwell?”</p> 
 <p><em>Yes, extremely! Your senior wants to kill people! Especially you!</em></p> 
 <p>However, there was one thing everyone here had to admit – On the sleazy and crafty road, Bai Xiaofei was already far ahead of everyone else…</p>
