 <p>Chapter 365: Falling from the Pedestal, the Doom of the Student Union?</p> 
 <p>Stunned! Everyone was stunned, even Su Yu without exception!</p> 
 <p>No one knew what had happened, no one knew what Hu Xian’er had done, but Hu Xian’er was now grasping Su Yu’s neck with one hand. His origin energy armor had been crushed by her fox claws. So long as Hu Xian’er used a little force, his neck would break.</p> 
 <p>“You’ve lost.”</p> 
 <p>Two faint words echoed. Everyone recovered from the shock, only to be filled with disbelief.</p> 
 <p><em>How can this be?! Over in an instant?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Is that really Su Yu?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Am I dreaming or Su Yu is deliberately acting?</em></p> 
 <p><em>What the hell just happened?!</em></p> 
 <p>All kinds of questions arose in the mind of the audience, and now there were no words to describe the disturbance in their hearts.</p> 
 <p>As for Su Yu, he was completely befuddled. He had expected Hu Xian’er to be very difficult, but he never thought he wouldn’t even have a chance to fight back. A dull gray flashed in Su Yu’s eyes. At this moment, he felt what hopelessness was.</p> 
 <p>“I… I’ve lost…” mumbled Su Yu.</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er then let go of him, her body flashed and she appeared next to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“How about some applause? To celebrate our new Combat Ranking number one?” said Bai Xiaofei lightly with a smile.</p> 
 <p>The crowd was quick to respond. The next second, a huge round of applause rang out. Hu Xian’er’s name was shouted over and over, while Su Yu had been completely forgotten.</p> 
 <p>Sometimes reality was just that cruel. Once you fell from the pedestal, you were deemed worthless because there was no such thing as hailing the second best in martial arts.</p> 
 <p>Losing the top place on the Combat Ranking, Su Yu could beat the second place to prove himself, but it would still be meaningless. Others might be afraid of second place, but they would never fear and respect the second place as they would for the first.</p> 
 <p>And the word ‘respect’ was what everyone really strived for. It represented the difference between strength and charisma. No matter how powerful you were, without charisma, you would be far less pleased than you imagined.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you very much. I also have something to announce, and this news will soon be spread throughout Starnet by the New Student Mutual Aid Community, but everyone present can have the first taste.”</p> 
 <p>Signaling for everyone to be quiet, Bai Xiaofei drew attention to himself.</p> 
 <p>“The New Student Mutual Aid Community currently has two long-term managers, but the roles haven't been made permanent yet. I’m announcing that starting today, the community will set up three minister positions. To qualify, in addition to certain prestige and support, the most important thing is to be in the top ten of either the Combat Ranking, the Wealth Ranking, or the Command Ranking! And I, Bai Xiaofei, the current number one of the Command Ranking; Fang Ye, the number one of the Wealth Ranking; Hu Xian’er, the number one of the Combat Ranking; the three of us will be the first ministers of the New Student Mutual Aid Community!”</p> 
 <p>Upon this, everyone froze, staring blankly in shock.</p> 
 <p>They wouldn’t have noticed if Bai Xiaofei didn’t mention it. The New Student Mutual Aid Community had actually developed to this stage! The three grand positions in the rankings that they always looked up to had been won by three freshmen!</p> 
 <p>And that was only the beginning. What stirred them thoroughly was Bai Xiaofei’s next words.</p> 
 <p>“And, starting today, the New Student Mutual Aid Community will be renamed to the Student Community. Any Starnet student can become a member as long as they are willing to abide by its rules!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei paused a little and inadvertently swept his eyes at Su Yu’s group of three who still remained.</p> 
 <p>“Of course, as a collective organization, the Student Community will not allow dual memberships. For example, if you are a member of the Student Union, then I am sorry, we can’t accept you. But if you are willing to quit the Student Union and join the Student Community, I, Bai Xiaofei, will welcome you with both arms wide open.”</p> 
 <p>Finally, Bai Xiaofei said something that Su Yu heard every day in his nightmares. The Student Union was going to face a catastrophe!</p> 
 <p>After finishing his speech, Bai Xiaofei and Hu Xian’er left arm in arm under the gaze of all. In the afternoon, the news, accompanied by several jaw-dropping facts, was spread all over Starnet––</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei won first place in the Command Ranking, and Sima Ye announced his withdrawal from the Student Union!</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er crushed Su Yu to win first place in the Combat Ranking, and joined the Student Community as one of its ministers!</p> 
 <p>The New Student Mutual Aid Community changed its name to Student Community, officially inviting students from all years!</p> 
 <p>A series of explosive news swept through the academy like a storm, and for that period, even the limelight of Blossom Ranking had to make way. As all kinds of discussions broke out, Bai Xiaofei’s name was pushed to the forefront. He who was already well-known became a legend that every guest coming to Starnet first learned about.</p> 
 <p>Yet, this was not the end. Bai Xiaofei did not intend to give the Student Union any time to breathe as he kept pursuing victory after victory. Under the joint advertisement of the Student Community and the Blossom Pavilion, the statement that the Student Union would soon be replaced circulated in Starnet like a tornado.</p> 
 <p>“Old gramps, long time no see.”</p> 
 <p>In Lei Shan’s office, a smiling Bai Xiaofei was quietly looking at Lei Shan, while Lei Shan felt like he had a headache every time he saw Bai Xiaofei’s face.</p> 
 <p>“If possible, I’d rather not see you, little brat.” Despite his words, the smile on Lei Shan’s face could not be concealed, he looked as if he had eaten honey.</p> 
 <p>“If so, I should have a good discussion with Big Sister Lei. After all, her change has been thanks to my hard work. If I work a little harder, I should be able to change her back.” Bai Xiaofei stroked his chin with a thoughtful look.</p> 
 <p>Lei Shan instantly panicked like a child who had lost money.</p> 
 <p>“You brat, since when is your tolerance for jokes so low? Have I ever mistreated you? As long as I can do it, just ask!” the emotional Lei Shan made a promise that he immediately regretted.</p> 
 <p><em>I was tricked!</em></p> 
 <p>Seeing the sleazy smile on Bai Xiaofei’s face, Lei Shan suddenly felt that he had lived the 100 years of his life in vain.</p> 
 <p>“Old gramps, that is what you said, I recorded it.”</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei waved the Recording Eyeball in his hand, Lei Shan’s face was filled with bitterness.</p> 
 <p><em>Damn brat, you really dare to scheme against anyone!</em></p> 
 <p>“You know, I won’t violate my own principles!” said Lei Shan as his last struggle after giving up treatment.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I am a man of principles!”</p>
