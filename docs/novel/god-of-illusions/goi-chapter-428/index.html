 <p>Chapter 428: Meeting the Empress; Mighty General!</p> 
 <p>The empress’ plan proceeded at an increasing speed. Anyone who opposed her in court was remembered, and before long, they would die due to unknown reasons if they did not actively resign first.</p> 
 <p>In a nutshell, the court was tipping towards the empress at a fast speed. No matter how everyone saw it, it was only a matter of time before the second prince ascended the throne.</p> 
 <p>However, there were still a few people that the empress could not sway: Imperial Scholar Hou Jin, Fourth Great Prince Gu Long, and Prime Minister Shen Qiandong. Protected by many Master Rank experts and while having an influence that was deeply rooted in the imperial court, they were not scared of either open or secret schemes!</p> 
 <p>On the surface, however, they showed no intention to oppose the empress, only emphasizing that they must see the imperial edict. Gu Long even especially declared that before the death of his brother – the late emperor – was figured out, no one was allowed to mention the heir; otherwise, whoever it was that wanted to claim the throne, he would do everything to hinder them!</p> 
 <p>Driven to desperation, the helpless empress in a moment of folly decided to seek help from Bai Xiaofei or the youth of the Globe Merchant Group.</p> 
 <p>Handing matters that couldn’t be solved internally to outsiders would save her from having to overuse her brain or capabilities. Moreover, judging from the two’s abilities, it was entirely possible that they could help the second prince win the throne without having to start a fight.</p> 
 <p>Finally, the determined empress set out. The first person she saw was Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>If she had to make a choice between Starnet and the Globe Merchant Group, the former was obviously better. After all, students were still relatively pure compared to experts raised in the outside world, especially those coming from a place like the Globe Merchant Group. One could never put too much trust in them. Businesses were all evil, and the youth belonged to the Globe Merchant Group that was a business giant. No matter how young he was, he was definitely a hungry wolf with a bottomless stomach!</p> 
 <p>“I hope nothing unpleasant has happened during your stay here so far,” said the empress to Bai Xiaofei’s group after she dismissed her maids and guards, showing her utmost sincerity by remaining alone.</p> 
 <p>“Of course not. Thanks to Your Majesty’s kindness, we have been well-fed and living every day in comfort, so much so that we even feel bad for it,” a smiling Bai Xiaofei replied in a purely bureaucratic manner, having no intention of befriending the empress.</p> 
 <p>“What if it can even be better? Would you like to think about it?” The empress didn’t show any displeasure to Bai Xiaofei’s reaction. Instead, she showed her goodwill with an offer.</p> 
 <p>“What can be better than eating and drinking well without having to do anything? I’m a lazy person, anything too troublesome is above me.” A wise-looking Bai Xiaofei smiled sleazily. If it weren’t for her fine self-control, the empress might have already started a fight.</p> 
 <p>“I heard you were working for the crown prince, but he was harmed and has gone completely insane. I sent people to check on him, and he is beyond cure. Since you can work for the crown prince, you should be able to help another finish this last step. Help me, and I’ll give you everything you want!”</p> 
 <p>The empress was direct this time. It was no different than saying ‘make my son emperor and you can have whatever you want.’</p> 
 <p>“Everything I want? Heh, how very generous. Then tell me, what can you give me?” His hands clasped, Bai Xiaofei made a pondering expression.</p> 
 <p>“I know you cannot care less about any official position in Ancient Yue and that you won’t stay here for a long time, but as long as you help me, you can get a hereditary title. If any of your descendants are interested in coming to Ancient Yue in the future, then they will hold a status of under only one but above ten thousand. At the same time, I can assure you of a fortune and any high-grade puppet you want!”</p> 
 <p>The empress could be said to be offering the best terms within her capabilities. As long as Bai Xiaofei agreed to this condition, he and his descendants at least wouldn’t have to worry about food and clothing in the future.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei only smiled wryly.</p> 
 <p>“I’m sorry, Your Majesty, what you just offered meant nothing to me.” Bai Xiaofei paused a little then added, “Since the crown prince is now unfated for the throne and our mission for the Bright Road Merchant House has failed, I ask Your Majesty to let us leave. We have been away from Starnet for quite some time, it’s time to return. I promise we won’t give you any trouble.”</p> 
 <p>At Bai Xiaofei’s words, the empress’ frown deepened.</p> 
 <p>“Is it really not negotiable?” the empress asked icily with finality.</p> 
 <p>“It’s not about whether it’s negotiable or not, I just don’t want to get involved in this muddied water anymore. I’m tired,” Bai Xiaofei said lightly, giving up the last chance offered.</p> 
 <p>“I’m afraid you will have to stay here for a while. When the matter in the palace is concluded, you can naturally return wherever you want to return, and I guarantee that there won’t be any problems with your safety.”</p> 
 <p>With her final words, the empress slowly turned and left. She thought Bai Xiaofei would stop her, but he didn’t.</p> 
 <p>“You really don’t want to get involved anymore? This isn’t what you told us before,” Qin Lingyan asked dubiously after the empress left.</p> 
 <p>“Of course not, it’s just a tactic to stall. She definitely won’t let us go. If I don’t refuse her clearly, she would think she’d still have hope,” explained Bai Xiaofei. The rest immediately had a look of enlightenment.</p> 
 <p>“But, who will we support now? She just said the crown prince is insane, and it is the third prince who opposes us. If you don’t plan to help the second prince, there is really no one else.” Bai Ye was puzzled while Chu Yue and Zhao Tiantian also didn’t look any less confused.</p> 
 <p>“This can’t be said, can’t be said…” Smiling mysteriously, Bai Xiaofei left them in suspense.</p> 
 <p>“What about the Thunderstorm Bandits? They must still be in the city. Do you think they will do something?” Qin Lingyan still cared about the mission. Although there was no hope of completing it, she was unwilling to let the Thunderstorm Bandits off.</p> 
 <p>“Definitely. They have no reason not to. As long as the Globe Merchant Group people don’t leave, they may intervene at any time,” stated Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Qin Lingyan’s eyes lit up.</p> 
 <p>“Then, can we…”</p> 
 <p>“What can we do? We only need to wait and see. Whether it’s the royal family or Thunderstorm Bandits, they can’t find trouble with us now. We have such an opportunity to watch a good show and you still want to get involved?” Bai Xiaofei interrupted Qin Lingyan.</p> 
 <p>The rest lapsed into silence, then one by one sighed. Just how long did they have to wait?!</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei’s group analyzed the situation in their room, the empress headed straight for the youth of the Globe Merchant Group. Since Bai Xiaofei had turned her down, she had to settle for second best.</p> 
 <p>This time, she was not disappointed. The youth agreed and only made one condition – Title him a general, Mighty General<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>!</p>
