 <p>Chapter 1044: Do Think Twice!</p> 
 <p>“I know you’re not worried, but this still needs to be solved. Otherwise, the situation will get complicated if they intervene.”</p> 
 <p>Except for the Globe Merchant Group, who had met its downfall, and the Ethereal Merchant Group, who had a close relationship with Bai Xiaofei, the remaining seven major merchant groups had come to Cloudveil. Facing the pressure from them, Fang Ye couldn’t remain calm.</p> 
 <p>Unlike the Cloudveil Empire with a flawed system, all these merchant groups were a handful to deal with even without abundant resources backing them up. One careless mistake and Bai Xiaofei’s group would create themselves an extremely formidable enemy!</p> 
 <p>Moreover, as far as the present situation was concerned, the seven merchant groups must have already prepared an excuse for their emergence that would put Illusion Demon in the wrong. According to the Business Agreement, it was explicitly prohibited for merchant groups to intervene in the internal disputes of a nation!</p> 
 <p>Those seven merchant groups had long been waiting for Illusion Demon to make mistakes. While the remaining eight major merchant groups had hugely benefited from the collapse of the Globe Merchant Group, the rapid development of the Illusion Demon Merchant Group had threatened them. Absolutely no one wanted to spit out the benefits that they had eaten.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, they came to Cloudveil… with the idea of completely destroying Illusion Demon!</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I’ll make them speechless,” Bai Xiaofei said and headed out.</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye hurriedly followed him, not wanting to miss an excellent show.</p> 
 <p>The two walked all the way to the main hall. As soon as Bai Xiaofei appeared, the room full of people immediately had their gazes on him.</p> 
 <p>To the outside world, Fang Ye had always claimed to be the acting president of Illusion Demon, so everyone had been curious about the real president. When they saw that it was Bai Xiaofei, they were visibly surprised – because of his age and identity!</p> 
 <p>“A hero from young! Who could have thought that the one behind the rising Illusion Demon is the famous new graduate of Starnet? As expected of the miracle generation, you’ve really opened this old man’s eyes!” exclaimed an old man white hair and white beard as soon as Bai Xiaofei sat down. From the old man’s amiable appearance, one wouldn’t think that he was here to make it hard on Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Devpath Merchant Group, Elder Han, senior alchemist,” Fang Ye informed softly behind Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“You are too kind, Elder Han. We are but a group of children, and Illusion Demon is just getting started. How can it deserve your attention?” Regarding superficial courtesies, Bai Xiaofei was professional.</p> 
 <p>“Intervening in a nation’s major affair when you’re just getting started? I’m afraid that when you are all developed, you would even dare to start a war!” a sarcastic voice rang out before Elder Han could speak. Looking over, it was a chubby man.</p> 
 <p>“Multihouse Business, Zhang Yekun, president of the Northern Branch,” informed Fang Ye with a hint of hostility in his voice. When Illusion Demon had started to open up its northern market, Zhang Yekun hadn’t missed a single opportunity to hinder them.</p> 
 <p>“Are you here to condemn us, President Zhang? But I’m afraid we can’t afford to shoulder your blame. We accepted someone’s payment and so we are here to eliminate their problem. For us, this is just a business deal,” said Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The fact that Bai Xiaofei didn’t bite back like Fang Ye had thought surprised him as much as everyone else. The room was full of puzzled expressions.</p> 
 <p><em>What deal?!</em></p> 
 <p>“President Bai, are you serious? Your recent actions could not be more obvious to everyone, and you still said this was a deal? Then tell me, who is the buyer? What are you selling? How is the price determined?” a lean middle-aged man mocked as if he had just heard the biggest joke in his life.</p> 
 <p>“A veteran figure of Barbel Merchant House, Gambling Monkey.” Fang Ye continued his duty.</p> 
 <p>“The buyer is the royal family of Cloudveil. What I’m selling is manpower and material resources, and the price is the aid of Cloudveil in the future. For such a grand transaction, it’s not much to mobilize the whole Illusion Demon, don’t you think?” said Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“So to speak, you’re admitting that your merchant group is intervening in a nation’s affair?” A vigorous voice rang out immediately. It was an ordinary-looking middle-aged man who wore a serious expression.</p> 
 <p>“Unify Business.” This time, Fang Ye didn’t say a name. Bai Xiaofei had already known too well what kind of organization Unify Business was, and their fate had been determined.</p> 
 <p>“Anyone here can discuss this matter, except you!” Bai Xiaofei’s voice instantly turned icy. “Shadow Death’s dog!”</p> 
 <p>Before the middle-aged man could refute, Bai Xiaofei had already appeared in front of him with Mind Sunder in his hand covered in a dazzling light. The weapon’s characteristics rendered all of the man’s protective measures useless. His energy armor cut through like paper, and he died on the spot with a horrified expression.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei then expressionlessly returned to his seat while the rest of the room stood up, their faces full of vigilance.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t be nervous, everyone. I, Bai Xiaofei, take responsibility for everything I say. I am certain that Unify Business is controlled by Shadow Death. It doesn’t matter if you don’t believe me, in any case, our Illusion Demon refuses to coexist with them,” explained Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>This successfully steered everyone’s attention in another direction. Now, no one cared about the purpose of Bai Xiaofei’s presence in Cloudveil as they were busy recalling his words and actions.</p> 
 <p>“In fact, I am very clear about your purpose – it’s nothing more than wanting to lose a competitor, so now I give you my response. After the matter of Cloudveil is over, there will be a life-and-death battle between our Illusion Demon and Unify Business. No matter who wins, you can all fish some benefits out of it,” Bai Xiaofei openly exposed their motive.</p> 
 <p>His overbearing manner coupled with his ruthless and decisive action made everyone fall silent.</p> 
 <p>“Of course, if you believe and are willing to investigate Unify Business, I will be more than willing to welcome you to join hands with us and I promise that you won’t be mistreated. But you don’t believe me, please bring a message back to your organizations.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei retracted his smile, a surging murderous intent sweeping out from him.</p> 
 <p>“I shall not withdraw from this matter of Cloudveil. Who dares to hinder me will have to fight me to the death, even if we are doomed for it! Therefore, do think twice!”</p>
